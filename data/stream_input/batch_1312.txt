0525478817|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I had a fantastic time reading this book. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|OK I'm Biased.  I was actually alive and remember glimpses of the assassination... and I LOVE ANYTHING by SK.  But, really, this book was riveting and kept me on the edge of my seat.  I was anticipating the next moves and came to love the hero and heroine.  The characters were well formed and had substance.  I couldn't wait to turn the page but felt a growing trepidation knowing I was nearing the end.  I LOVED the ending.  SK you are the genius I have come to love also.
031603441X|4.0|What Keith Richards has managed to do with this book is to confirm every positive and negative thought I've ever had about rock stars in general and the Rolling Stones in particular.  The fact that I have known the Stones' music for my entire adult life certainly helped me to relate to the book.  Good fun!
B006GG1KOC|5.0|My friends and I just played this in the cafeteria and we loved it! We we're shouting and yelling and we thought it was awesome.
1401923127|1.0|If you want to read this book, get it from your local library (mine had 3 copies, all available). I have never written a review, but I am so outraged at the hoodwinking and in this climate of \\"speaking out\\", I will am willing to share the following:<br /><br />I give it one star, because the writing is in fact engaging. He presents an interesting case for studying the human system, based on single celled behaviors combined with a quantum physics outlook. He even eludes to important issues affecting our health regarding genetic engineering and over medication (but never really takes a stand on these).<br /><br />The scamming comes in when Dr. Lipton uses the age old \\"I'll tell you more about this in chapter 6 and 7\\" trick and NEVER really tells you more. You find out at the end of the book that you have paid for an infomercial for PSYCH-K, an applied kinesiology technique that supposedly frees you from the subconscious programming which is your obstacle to change (in other words your subconscious limits your beliefs). Note Dr. Bruce Lipton teaches these workshops and \\"you\\", sucker, have just paid for the marketing. :(<br /><br />Buy at your own risk!
0062101897|5.0|Wonderful product to add to a Harry Potter collection.  Beautiful pictures and great information. This has been a great tie between the books and the movies.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app. I love that it is NIV.This Bible is organized and intuitive. The layout is easy to access.I love signing up for the daily Scripture passage. Overall an excellent app.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|LOVE THIS!!! I had asked for this item from my mother-in-law for Christmas for my Kindle Fire! I love this!!!! I got mine and white and love how light weight it is. The kindle fire itself has a bit of weight so I was looking for something light weight not to add on any extra weight making it difficult to use my Fire. I love everything about this shell!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I play it on the kindle fire. It is fast paced and challenging. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys solitaire games.
B003YCOIFY|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He is a fan of war movies and this being the exception because it is based on actual events. Even the interviews were great. Actually seeing the guys who were in the fight you had just seen is remarkable. Even for a chick like me, I have to say it was a great movie! Blu-ray makes it awesome!
0307266303|4.0|Born to Run came highly recomended by different people in my life so I had to brake down and read it. It lived up to its hype. I found it easy to read and enjoyed the suspense, interspersed with research science, interesting characters and the history and evolution of running. It challenges foundations of modern industry and asks how is it that people managed to run before the advent of the expensive modern running shoe. I tore through this book at times not being able to put it down and of course it made me get out and try running again.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|At about the 20 minute mark, I switched this film off - I couldn't stand it any more. This film is camp, idiotic, B grade and no better than a Xena TV episode. Nothing about this film rang true or had any sense of danger or authenticity. I saw the original Conan the Barbarian movie on the big screen as a kid when it first aired and THAT was a great film ... this is not even worth the plastic for recycling.  If you liked the original Conan films ... don't watch this. Can I choose minus 5 stars?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|just starting to use. games. seem simple but repetitive. but fun please don't let this become a disappointment!!! !!! watch and see what I say later
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is just what ive been looking for, mindless fun... great for messing around while listening to the Tv or something.
B00004YRQA|5.0|this prodect i got it in just only a few days and i love that it works i haf this before and now that i have it again i can save all my game and i love it
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I just downloaded this game about 5 min ago but I'm 11 soo idc yes this game is for younger kids but since when is that a bad thing I have no regrets the game really made me think about wat was different COOL give this app a try
B001OBT3FM|5.0|The collaboration between Maestro Ozawa and Violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, with the members of the Vienna Philharmonic gave a very refreshing and energetic lively and beautiful performance of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.  There were often seems of joyful and mischievous merry making that gave a fitting tribute to the late Maestro Von Karajan.  The Stearneness of the more seriousness demands of the piece, came into their own, as if Beethoven would have demanded himself.  The performance of Tchaikovsky's Sixth was a fitting tribute to both the composer and to the memory of the late Maestro Von Karajan. The exciting and somber scenes were very meticulously blended without seemingly great effort.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a pretty fun game and I enjoy playing it. its good qualities are that even when you don't know how to play certain games it shows how and its easy to learn and catch on. :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thing this is a awesome game!!!!!  you get a lot of games to play like this game!! you should rate this!
B0055SWM08|5.0|GREAT APP!! Fun puzzles, relaxing music. Works well with my Kindle Fire. Worth the money. Glad i bought it. a fun app that wont get boring .
B004GYY714|5.0|I use this app for hours a day on my Fire and occasionally on my phone. Having little details like a sleep timer and alarm makes it better than other radio apps I've tried. Wish it could get around some of the station restrictions but it's not a deal breaker.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I bought this game for my kindle fire and it is absolutely amazing! It's challenging but very rewarding! i tried it on other devices like my girlfriend's ipohone but it wasn't the same because of the screen size. I definitely recommend it if you have a kindle fire!
B0012HCASA|5.0|I found myself watching episode after episode continuously. A reel shame they canceled the series. But such is the way in the science fiction world. (Stargate universe)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Finally able to get my teenagers to read their Bible daily when I put this app on their electronic devices. Free and they keep improving it. Can't ask for much more.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The app is one of my favorites! I love the many different translations and is very useful while my Pastor is teaching as he uses the different translations for a better understanding for us all. It even speaks! The only downside is I need ALL of the translations to download when WiFi isn't available.
B005FITIGO|4.0|The movie \\"Margin Call\\" was goood and interesting. It let you know what happens in coporate America and how the elite try to cover up their mistakes and try to keep it from the working class.  This is what happens when greed takes first place and people are last place. It do inform the public of corporate America with the dirty tactics and the underhand schemes that they do. Check it out.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game for beginner to expert. Easy to learn, different levels of play. Never shuts down, always loads up properly
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the title says all the words, it is just ok. Some of the games are hard and some are easy......
B00007KWHO|3.0|A transitional phase between their excellent and quirky Beatles/Jazz/Psychedelic-influenced debut, and the supergroup they would become with Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman's addition over the next two albums, this is basically the awkward adolescence of the band: plenty of good ideas, but a general lack of focus and direction, and overbearing orchestration doesn't help matters. Not bad at all, but definitely not a good introduction to Yes: pick up (at least) The Yes Album, Fragile, Close to the Edge, Going for the One, and their debut before this one.
B003G4W49C|2.0|I chose this book strictly based on all the rave reviews. The first chapter or two kept my interest pretty strong. After chapter after chapter of Enders time in battle school I began to get a headache just from the serious lack of story. It was really like reading a self pitied diary about some kid in military school. I figured if I could just make it through the first half of the book the story would start to pick up. Unfortunately I wasn't so lucky. It just got slower! It was literally like you were reading different versions of the same chapter throughout the whole book! If this book ever makes it onto the movie screen I'm pretty sure there is going to be a lot of creative fluff added just to keep it visually entertaining. It was just so slow. Very little of the storyline actually held this book together. I did manage to suffer through the whole thing but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I got this case a few weeks ago when I picked up an iPhone 4S and am extremely pleased with it.  If you're like me, you find the iPhone to be a tad bit on the small size- so small that you're worried about the thing falling out of your hand or off of your shoulder while you're using it.  This case is just big enough to provide a comfortable and grippable surface so you don't feel like you're going to drop this precious gadget every 5 minutes, but still slim enough to easily fit into your jeans pocket.  This case is a fabulous complement to a white iPhone (although I think it would look great on a black iPhone as well).  The concentric circle design is cool and eye catching, but not so bling that you are embarrassed to carry it around as a guy.  I get compliments on this all of the time.  Also, the included screen protector is a nice bonus.  For previous phones, I've ended up paying close to $30 for the case and screen protector.  Thank you Amazon Basics!
0307474259|4.0|Gary Taubes' book Good Calories, Bad Calories (or 'The Diet Delusion' in Australia) is one of the most important health books I have ever read.<br /><br />The author is incredibly intelligent and that this book took the author more than five years to write, shows. I've read few health books so intelligently written as this one. I thought I was quite well educated about diet and the need to restrict refined carbohydrates (for good health and to stop weight gain) but I learned so much from reading this book.<br /><br />This book gives you a detailed analysis of why low calorie diets don't work and why restricted carbohydrate/high fat diets do and is backed up by compelling evidence and research at every point. We have evolved to eat a diet that contains enough fat and protein to cause satiety, lots of green vegetables and minimal amounts of fruits and starchy vegetables. Our bodies really can't cope with huge levels of refined carbohydrate as have recently been added to the modern diet.<br /><br />Because this book was so good but so very long and complex, I really hoped that Taubes would put out a summarised edition of the book that I could lend to my friends and family. I was so happy to see 'Why We Get Fat' had been released and bought a copy right away.<br /><br />While this 'distilled' book explains the same concepts and comes to the same conclusions as Taubes' previous book, and also explains some concepts in brilliant and remarkable new ways, I am not sure I would have been quite as blown away as I was by Taubes' work if I had read this book first. I couldn't help but think it was somewhat less compelling and made the various points just a little bit less convincingly. Perhaps that is inevitable with a much shorter book and comparing them is unfair? That might well be true.<br /><br />What I would have liked is for each of the main points to be listed one after the other in one chapter and explained using about a half page for each. To make it really simple for everyone to get the main points.<br /><br />Main points would include facts such as:<br /><br />1. The 'calories in, calories out' mantra is a myth<br /><br />2. 'A calorie is a calorie is a calorie' is a myth<br /><br />3. The 'just eat less and do more exercise to lose weight' message seems to be logical but is actually wrong and unhelpful<br /><br />4. Overweight and obese people often eat no more calories, or even less, than their thinner counterparts<br /><br />5. Low calorie diets also reduce the amount of nutrients in the diet<br /><br />6. It is a myth that the brain and CNS needs 120 - 130 grams of carbohydrate as fuel in order to function properly, as the body can use fat and protein equally as well, and these fuels are likely the mixture our brains have evolved to prefer.<br /><br />7. Restricting calories with a low fat/high carb diet just makes you hungrier and more lethargic and slows your metabolic rate. Weight loss is only maintained if the patients stays on a semi-starvation diet forever, which is impossible for most people and also undesirable. Being far more active just makes you far more hungry.<br /><br />8. It is a myth that reducing calories slightly or increasing activity slightly will lead to weight loss.<br /><br />9. It is a myth that we evolved through periods of feast and famine to be very good at holding onto fat. Fat gain is due to excessive insulin levels caused by high dietary refined carbohydrate intake. It is a sign of something in the body going wrong, not a healthy adaptation.<br /><br />10. Fructose is not much better than glucose and the two together may cause more harm than either individually.<br /><br />11. The idea of a weight 'set point' is a myth<br /><br />12. Insulin is the overall fuel control for mammals. High insulin levels cause the body to store fat and stop the body from using fat as fuel. This means that high carbohydrate foods make you put on more fat, and also leave you still feeling very hungry and unsatisfied.<br /><br />13. Our bodies have evolved to do best on a diet of plentiful fat and protein (including saturated fat), lots of greens and minimal fruits and starchy vegetables. This diet is the best for health and also for losing weight and stopping weight gain.<br /><br />14. Dietary fat, including saturated fat, is not a cause of obesity. Refined and easily digestible carbs causing high insulin levels cause obesity.<br /><br />15. To say that people are overweight due to gluttony and slothfulness is just not correct and it is very unfair. Overeating and a sedentary lifestyle are often CAUSED by eating a high carbohydrate diet! This association has wrongly been interpreted as a cause of weight gain, rather than an effect.<br /><br />16. Hunger caused by eating a high carbohydrate diet (or excessive exercising while on a low calorie diet) is a very strong physiological drive and should not be thought of something mild and psychological that can be overcome with willpower. This is something serious occurring in the body, not the brain!<br /><br />Thus psychological 'treatments' for obesity are inappropriate and cruel. Most people are overweight due to bad medical advice, NOT a lack of willpower, greed, laziness or because they lack 'moral fibre'<br /><br />17. People have different insulin secretory responses. Even if insulin secretion is slightly off, weight gain can occur.<br /><br />18. Eating large amounts of a high sugar and high fat food like popcorn is easy because the body will not use most of the carbohydrate and fat for immediate fuel but will store much of it as fat - leaving you able to eat a lot of it and still be hungry a short time later as well.<br /><br />19. Eating foods with a large bulk or high in fibre wont fill you up, you need the correct proportion of macronutrients and will stay hungry until you get them.<br /><br />20. Those advocating the low calorie and high carb diets for health and weight loss are not involved in legitimate science. These approaches are not supported by the evidence.<br /><br />I took 6 pages of notes while reading this book. Even though it is short, it does still give you a ton of information and research. It isn't one of those books stuffed with 'filler.'<br /><br />Reading the first book I wished the author had included some sort of basic eating plan that followed his principles. After reading this book, I wish the author had not included the basic eating plan he gives at the end of the  book. I realise that it is probably only there for illustrative purposes, but it really is of quite poor quality. Yes, it describes a low-carb diet which will be helpful for weight loss...but it is very far from being a healthy diet with regard to additives, nutrients and so on. This is an important failure when one of the main reasons many of us wish to lose weight is to improve our health.<br /><br />Eggs are not even mentioned in the eating plan which is quite bizarre. Even worse, microwaving is recommended and processed meats are allowed to be eaten. (Pork rinds, pepperoni, etc.) The diet allows up to 4 tablespoons of mayo daily, despite the fact this often contains unhealthy types of fat including trans fats. Aspartame, splenda and saccharin are recommended too, I was surprised to see. No mention is made of the importance of choosing grass-fed meats over conventionally farmed meats, if possible, and coconut oil is also not even mentioned.<br /><br />The diet recommends 3 cups of vegetables daily which is okay, but for my preferences, I don't see why one can't eat quite a bit more than that if one chooses green leafy vegetables which are of course very low carb. Choosing what to eat is about weight control, but getting as many nutrients in is also important and this is especially true if you are ill and trying to become more well. I also just like eating lots of nice veggies with my meals, and for me 3 cups is just not enough long term. (Been there done that!)<br /><br />Far better books forgiving you practical diet information for weight control and health are [[ASIN:0452285666 Eat Fat, Lose Fat: The Healthy Alternative to Trans Fats]] and [[ASIN:1594774137 Primal Body, Primal Mind: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer Life]], among others.<br /><br />Even with the above small quibbles, this is still an impressive body of work. I wish we had more investigative journalists writing about 'controversial' topics to such a high standard. I'm grateful to Taubes for writing his two books.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book or (if you are up to reading a very, very big and dense book) [[ASIN:1400033462 Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health (Vintage)]] would be even better. Check your library for a copy of one of them, at least! This information is so important.<br /><br />I give the first book 5 stars and this summary book 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E. (HFME) and Health, Healing & Hummingbirds (HHH)e approaches are not supported by the evidence.<br /><br />I took 6 pages of notes while reading this book.

0143113100|4.0|The book gives the message that all sorts of amazing things can be done through lots of brain retraining work, but doesn't claim that it is a quick and easy cure for everything either, which I appreciated.<br /><br />Some people are taking the idea of neuroplasticity and running with it and maybe going a bit too far and claiming that we can retrain our brains to be any way we want (such as choosing our sexuality), and to use it to cure completely every neurological disease. It is disturbing. But this book doesn't at all support these sorts of unreasonable notions, fortunately.<br /><br />This book explains that amazing changes can be made to improve people with congenital issues, diseases or brain injuries or that wish to reverse negative learned behaviours - but that these changes take lots of hard work and also that they are limited in some cases. Recovery from brain injuries will often be partial and not total. Not all neurological function that is lost through a brain injury can be fully restored. All we can do is try our hardest and do our best.<br /><br />(The idea that everyone so injured could be totally well again if they just put the time into rehabilitation worries me a little. Again, this idea is not supported in the book, I'm referring to worrying and ignorant comments made elsewhere.)<br /><br />Partial recoveries are still very very exciting though and nothing to sneeze at, especially when people are very ill and disabled to begin with. It is very exciting stuff, this book.<br /><br />This book would be very encouraging to read for those who have had strokes and would like to learn to walk again. The bits at the start of the book about how neuroplasticity may allow people that are blind or deaf from birth to see and to hear, were astounding to read about.<br /><br />I was fascinated to read about how one can compensate for a failed vestibular system with vision, as this is something I and many other M.E. patients have done.<br /><br />I couldn't help but think about this compensation in M.E. patients as I read the book. It is a natural phenomena, which is kind of fascinating to me. But it is only a partial solution - which sort of supports the notions in this book of targeted and purposeful brain retraining being so powerful I guess.<br /><br />This natural brain retraining of the vestibular system works well, but leaves you in a hideous situation if you are even plunged into a totally dark environment - such as when the power goes out. You suddenly have no sense of up or down and the world spins horribly, so much so that you are too ill to crawl towards the torch or lighter that can save you.<br /><br />I keep torches within reach in every room I spend time in, I have to. This problem also means many of us need to sleep with a nightlight, as your body seems to need to know up from down when you are sleeping too. I also need to make sure when I walk that nothing in the room moves, or else I feel about to fall over and lose my equilibrium for a few minutes and have to clutch at things to not fall over.<br /><br />But far better all these problems than going back to when I didn't really have any sort of vastibular system and would be constantly spinning and feeling I was rolling off my flat bed, or feel I was falling backwards the whole time I was walking upright! As the women in the book said too, it is also awful always walking with your feet so wide apart for balance as well. I'm so used to it now, but it would be wonderful to one day no longer have to do so! Maybe in time, and with the ideas in this book put into use, this could happen? I'd like to think so.<br /><br />Reading about how well-known these visual compensations for vestibular problems are was a bit hard going for me at times, as it made me quite annoyed and sad that so few doctors and neurologists seem to know about them and that we as patients are each treated as if this problem were unique to us, when it is so obviously not. The woman with vestibular symptoms mentioned in this book described my symptoms so well. It is a bit maddening how behind with real cutting-edge research and information so many medical professionals are.<br /><br />If I can improve my health to the point of being out and about in the world again, and my vestibular function hasn't improved along with the rest of me, I'll definitely try the under-tongue vestibular re-trainer device (I forget the proper name for it used in the book!) if I can.<br /><br />This book was exciting to read and gave me hope for my future and one day being able to try out some of these ideas for myself. But for right now, with a brain injury that also has had systemic effects and caused cardiac insufficiency and an inability to do anything but the most basic tasks (I'm housebound and 95% bedbound and very limited with talking and movement etc. as well), it is impossible and would result in relapse and loss of function rather than improvements. Having an ongoing disease process which means your activity level is severely restricted as well as neurological problems is a different kettle of fish to fixing neurological issues which are not ongoing, such as a stroke, say. You need to be able to put the work in, and not have a disease which is worsening for physical reasons too I guess. But hope for the future is still hope.<br /><br />The parts supporting animal studies in the book made me feel quite uncomfortable. I would personally rather they had been omitted from the book as they detract from the important main message.<br /><br />I also have to admit that I was a bit disappointed after reading the book and hearing so many good things said about it that it wasn't edited to a somewhat higher standard, and organised a bit better. Parts of the book were quite boring to read and it'd have been great if the book had summarised the main points in the final chapter instead of just kind of petering out. The book was well written, but could maybe have been made even better with a good edit.<br /><br />All through the book I kept wondering how much more positive the results from these treatments would be if they were combined with patients being given all the nutrients their brains need to function well and to heal. Nutritional medicine is vital for anyone recovering form a brain injury or similar, the body needs to have all the basic building blocks necessary to make repairs and to function properly, no matter what other treatments are tried. Although this topic is mostly ignored in this book, there was one comment towards the end where the author said that although nutrition was not his area that a properly designed supplement regime is 'a common practice that we should all be pursuing' which is hard to argue with.<br /><br />For anyone interested in this topic books such as [[ASIN:1887202048 Detoxify or Die]], [[ASIN:0452285666 Eat Fat, Lose Fat: The Healthy Alternative to Trans Fats]], [[ASIN:0615228380 Deep Nutrition: Why Your Genes Need Traditional Food]] and [[ASIN:1594774137 Primal Body, Primal Mind: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer Life]] and others are a great start. (These books and others like them have let me very slowly start to improve my own health, FWIW.)<br /><br />Overall this book is a fascinating and engaging read, especially if you are facing a neurological disease or other neurological problem. I'd highly recommend checking to see if your library has a copy. The books on neurological case studies by Oliver Sacks are also a very interesting read if you have any type of brain injury.<br /><br />Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

Although this topic is mostly ignored in this book, there was one comment towards the end where the author said that although nutrition was not his area that a properly designed supplement regime is 'a common practice that we should all be pursuing' which is hard to argue with.<br /><br />For anyone interested in this topic books such as [[ASIN:1887202048 Detoxify or Die]], [[ASIN:0452285666 Eat Fat, Lose Fat: The Healthy Alternative to Trans Fats]], [[ASIN:0615228380 Deep Nutrition: Why Your Genes Need Traditional Food]] and [[ASIN:1594774137 Primal Body, Primal Mind: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer Life]] and others are a great start. (These books and others like them have let me very slowly start to improve my own health, FWIW.)<br /><br />Overall this book is a fascinating and engaging read, especially if you are facing a neurological disease or other neurological problem. I'd highly recommend checking to see if your library has a copy. The books on neurological case studies by Oliver Sacks are also a very interesting read if you have any type of brain injury.<br /><br />Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|fine but be a little better when this thing asks you what shape is this on the quiz it is the worst game in the whole world.thanks to my brother keegan I just have to beat the soccer one. :p,keegan.Ps I beat the sushi game haha
B004FOA84A|2.0|alright game. should be free though. took me half hour to beat... want a refund actually...not the hidden object game I was looking for
B001E45XT4|5.0|Bought these headphones because I was going overseas and needed them for skype. I bought them on March 11, 2011 and they are STILL WORKING GREAT! I've bought many headphones and HIGHLY recommend these. They're worth way more than the 30 bucks i paid for. a crappy product costs a lot in the long term. Only if they had noise cancelling... maybe some day.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|This book had a lot of helpful information, specifically focusing on your target audience. Although I found this concept a little vague in the beginning, Locke provided good examples with his blog posts.<br /><br />I know some readers had an issue of Locke writing about his own successes, but I didn't have a problem with it and I think it made a compelling argument about his model for success.<br /><br />I would have liked more specifics of how he promoted his blog, etc. If you are a self-published author, this book is a worthy read.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This is definately the best game app you can play! Is is HIGHLY addicting; You can play this game for hours and still want more (so then play more!). In the game you are free to do what you want. You can be a peaceful Merchant and trade goods to make money. Or you can be a Pirate and take goods from others (because you are to lazy to get them honestly). There are plenty of other choices too, like finding ancient Artifacts on planets. This game is very deep and there is much to do. You will never want to stop playing! The developers are also very dedicated to this game, constantly improving it further with updates. They will also read and respond to any questions and ideas you post on their website. This game is worth way more than the two dollars you will pay for it!
020530902X|5.0|The book is very informative and contains a wealth of knowledge.  It is quite explanatory and is particularly designed to assist writers and persons who want to improve on the English language.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app has replaced my hard copy Bible. I love it. I use it everywhere. I also love the various Bible versions.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Movie was damned good...Excellent ..The technology advances from the the first Planet of the apes makes this one off the hook...  Buy it...
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I don't understand how a competent adult can view a kid's app and then rate it as if it was made for adults...oh wait, these people are just dumb.  This is an app for KIDS, young ones at that.  My 2 year olds play this a lot and if they didn't enjoy it, I doubt they would.  My 4 year old doesn't like it because he's passed all the games.  The majority of the 1 star \\"reviews\\" don't address this app but instead how they feel they are for some reason entitled to more than this app.  If you don't like what's FREE today, come back tomorrow, you are obligated to buy and you aren't entitled to ANYTHING.  But please stop rating something things bad just because it's not for you.  No one cares what you want, they care about the product in question.  If you have a young child, this app will provide some entertainment for a while.  Some of the differences are harder to spot, but I take these opportunities to teach my kids more about the differences and how to spot them next time.  Images and sound are good, at first my kids would get answers wrong on purpose just to make the ladybug shake.  For a FREE app, or even 99 cents, this app is great.  But again, younger kids will enjoy this more than older ones.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I bought this for my husband who was a big fan of the series...I was so thrilled with the presentation...it all looked so official. My husband has not stopped watching it. He says to be able to watch one after the other makes the show flow and has seen a couple of discs he had missed. I had not realized there were 7 series...awesome gift to get for a West Wing Fan or for  yourself..this is a keeper as Video's go. Shelf Worthy.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This id a fun game to play, just like the PC version. It could do without the constant ads for spider solitaire though.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|As a whole, the album is superb.  But I have to say 'Dov'e L'Amore', which is sung to Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings is possibly the most brilliant piece ever recorded by these gentlemen. What gets me is the instantly recognizable haunting melody which suddenly erupts into this powerfully dramatic almost violent crescendo, and then back again.  I keep replaying it, marvelling at the genius of it - takes my breath away.  And does the hair thing too.....  The Amazon CD page for this album has a short video promo for it.  Watch it and you'll catch a snippet of the guys doing this song. Nothing like actually seeing them perform a piece like this.  Bravo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0634022296|5.0|This book covers every Beatles song you will ever want to play. It is very easy to read with chord diagrams for every chord in the correct position at the beginning of every song. There are only lyrics and accurately placed chord names for each song, so no musical notes or piano scores. For guitar players this is great since you often get the whole song on one or two pages so you don't have to keep flipping pages after every couple verses. So yeah, you have to already know the melody for every song you want to play since it's not in there. Of course this is a non-issue for any Beatles fan or pretty much anyone who would consider purchasing this book. All the songs are in the original keys so you can play along to most Beatles recordings. I've always wanted to have every Beatles song at my finger tips and now I do. Weather you've been playing for 1 week or your whole life, if you play the guitar you need this book period.  The only negatives I think this book has is that the layout of the book is just plain ugly and that it is not spiral bound. The cover is nice, but once you get inside, don't expect a graphic design master piece and it would be helpful if the book would lie flat. Still, it's very easy to use, all the necessary info is there and just know that once you use it for a bit, you will have a lot of creases in the spine.
B004WE01YA|5.0|I am a huge beauty and the beast fan.  I received this as a present last christmas.  That being said I am so thrilled that I was able to have this item.  It includes five discs, so this means that there is a disc for a regular DVD player for those people that don't own a blu ray player yet.  It also comes with three blu ray discs one of which is a 3D disc.  The only down side to the 3D disc is that if you don't own a 3D TV, 3D glasses, blu ray player, and a 3D enabled HDMI cable you wouldn't be able to watch that version.  If you love this movie as much as I do I would definitely buy this version even if I didn't have all of the technology to watch it.  But that would be the only complaint I believe anyone would ever have with this item.  The colors are amazing compared to when it was first released on DVD.  If you have no interest in the 3D disc though you would be better off saving some extra money and down grading to the three disc version.  This was an amazing purchase and I look forward to more Disney 3D releases.
B00406UK7S|2.0|Some good action scenes beautiful cinematography, good sound track. Kind of a 300 wannabe movie though with the digitally painted blood and over the top gruesome battle scenes.  And don't forget to be in line with current politcal correctness diversity even though it is not historically correct by throwing in a black dude, assyrian and all the different British accents for the Romans?? This film is very predictable and the flaws abound and are downright too absurd to get invested in what happens to the characters.  Instead of finishing off a soldier the Pict says \\"let him bleed\\", warriors on horses galloping after Romans have long chases where they can't catch up, the list goes on but most unconvincing were the hottie Skinny Pict warrior babes.  While I am not knocking female warriors and don't doubt they did indeed exist and were just as fierce as the men, these skinny little babes beating up muscled up dudes in hand to hand combat twice their size...I don't think so.
B000W03RHQ|5.0|This was a gift for ME, recommended by a friend, now I have a new FAVORITE, not very known in the states however if they ever do a TOUR HERE...., as for the way it was purchased, AMAZON.com, this VENDOR making available through... where we try to buy everything that we do E-Commerce,  which is always through AMAZON, even to the extent of taking a search from a manufactures website and pasting it in the AMAZON search to see if it can be bought through AMAZON, the pricing, shipping, time tables, ( I believe in some cases that the items are BEAMED down from some AMAZON Starship to our Doorstep they're so fast) , (order receive) service, return, exchange, replace, (replace, exchange, seems you will receive these before the one you are sending back gets picked up) etc. in the event are SECOND to none, and everyone I know I do my BEST to advocate they try the same....www.AMAZON.com<br />Amazon Verified Purchase
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I had seen this movie when it first came out and many time thereafter.  But the extra features, of this edition,provide an in-depth discussion of the making of this film.  They interviewed the actors and got their perspective.  It shows how and where the film was shot  I learned a lot about how films were made.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|This is a cute game for preschoolers. There were only a few that I didn't get but I think it will be good to use with my daughter when she is older to help teach &amp; explain what the 3 objects have in common. Overall: well done.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|I had seen this film many times before.  This edition explains how this movie was made before the advent of CG.  We usually do not see what was edited out of a film.  This provides all the deleted scenes which explain why something happened the way it did.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|a good way to waste your time when you have nothing else you do but it is fun to try and beat all the games

B000ZECQ08|5.0|The DVD arrived on time and in great shape. I will definitely be buying other items from here. Fast delivery.
0375826742|1.0|Paolini really blew this apart. After filling the first 3 books with tantalizing loose ends Inheritance only answers about half of them and almost all are done hastily and with no effort and thinking put behind them.   Had potential to be a great book but really just slogged along for hundreds of pages until a ridiculously ludicrous ending followed by a  painful pathetic attempt at wrapping up the series in the last 100 pages.   I really loved the first 2 books by Brisingr (book 3) sent warning signs of what was happening to this series. Inheritance really ruined a spectacular first 2 books.
B0038W0OIK|2.0|If you are getting these strictly for headphones to listen to music, etc, they sound OK when hooked up to a good sound card. I have the Asus Xonar D2 7.1 card, the bass on these cans are well produced, there is no folding whatsoever even at high volumes.  Unfortunately the bass is the high point, the mids and the highs are sub par.  When hooked up to USB the bass is non existent and the mid and high get even worse.  The MIC itself is very bad, when hooked up to the sound card directly it sounds like someone is crackling a piece of paper right at the MIC, the static is just horrible.  When hooked up to USB it is even worse. On this particular set that I received, the audio also cut out on the mic at random times on both the soundcard and the usb hookup.  I have small ears and the ear cups BARELY cover them. Once these are placed on your head they can be compared to a giant vice grip, they are super tight, tons of pressure.   This is a very poorly created product that Steelseries has released, stay FAR away from this headset.  My logitech 3 dollar USB desktop mic sounds flawless compared to these.  So cross these off your list as potential candidates in your research, $150 for such low quality is just laughable.

B0062P332Y|5.0|Killer Elite is a highly entertaining action thriller that should appeal to anyone who enjoyed The Expendables and, maybe, also appeal to those who aren't interested in straight-forward action films, but enjoy more high-brow international espionage thrillers. Make no mistake about it, though, the action in this film is non-stop and, best of all, it's old-school. By that I mean, you can see the hits landing in the hand-to-hand fight scenes and when there's a car-chase, you can follow the action with some sense of direction. The acting in the Killer Elite is also praise worthy. Statham plays just about the same role he always plays, but, you probably alreay knew that. However, Statham plays that role better than just about anyone else currently. His acting, in that role, has always been solid for an action star, but in this film he seems to have improved. Deniro adds a touch of class in the mentor role. Deniro's as charismatic as ever, no complaints. Owen's very-good as well, but there are many excellent performances from actors whose names didn't make it onto the front-cover, among them are Aden Young and Dominic Purcell as members of Statham's team. In conclusion, I'd like to add that Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper were two of the very few mainstream film critics that gave a positive reveiw to Killer Elite during its theatrical release. In time, I think many, many more people will come to agree with them.
1593974760|4.0|Not really in the same style as Ender's game, but tells a good story.  The voice acting is good and entertaining.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Bought this movie for my wife as a Christmas present and couldn't have been happier with the service and my wife loves the movie! Great movie and another excellent transaction with Amazon!
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This movie embellishes the epic story of the Spartans during the Battle of Thermopylae.  It is done in a comic book style similar to Sin City.  For the guys there are epic battles and beautiful women.  For girls there is Gerard Butler and the rest of the Spartans.  The story is told really well like a grandfather or father telling his sons.  The imagery is beautiful and gory.  One of my favorites.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|I ordered this for my 8-year-old son, who loves Legos.  He loves it.  It gives him a great arena for setting up battles between his mini-figures.  And then he can zip it all up, out of the way.  A great purchase.
0393338398|3.0|I enjoyed the beginning of the book.  It is a good story and background on baseball.  However, it gets caught up on statistics and the history of statistics.  I didn't finish the book, but it was an interesting read until I finished.
0062082353|1.0|I have read the first 20 or so pages. Riveting! No complaint about the content.   My complaint is about the production quality. I don't know what they did but the leading edge of every page is a different length. They all line up kinda saw toothed.  I was trying to contact amazon direct but found no method for this. So here it is.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|This isn't just a movie it is a story.  It does have some political and moral statements.  It is disturbing and gory, but don't let that distract you from the amazing story.  This is an action drama movie, not purely action, and a little of a love story.  Mainly, though, it is a movie about self discovery and strength.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|awesome - no sympathy for the stars which i respect.  any movie where a major player from hollywood is killed within the first 10 minutes is a win
0937381888|5.0|This book is so much more than I expected.  It goes into so much depth I don't even know what to do with it.  If there was only one book I could get on brewing it would be this one.

B002ZG997C|5.0|Denzel Washington does an amazing job in this movie. This movie throws you into a whole new world.  It is disorienting at first, but as the story progresses it becomes more clear.  It is like a post apocalyptic western.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|I found this game to be very cute and so did my child. She enjoyed it and it's for children so good job. Also Amazon doesn't need to do free apps, so don't whine when its not something you won't use.
B000W91RUG|5.0|At first glance, this show is boring, uninspired, and cliche.  Don't let it fool you.  If you pay attention and give this show a chance there are tons of little things that are going on.  It is hilarious.  The relationships between the characters keeps getting funnier and the more you know the characters the more you appreciate them.
B004LROMSO|3.0|Starz attempts to turn the sturdy legend of King Arthur into a sexy nighttime soap opera with mixed results. Production values are high and most of the cast is game in creator Michael Hirst (of the excellent Showtime series THE TUDORS) and Chris Chibnall's rewrite which is decidedly more John Boorman than it is Lerner & Lowe. Joseph Fiennes gives an interesting portrayal of the magical sage Merlin but the central casting of Jamie Campbell Bower as Arthur is perhaps the weakest screen portrayal of the famous king so far. However, the real fun is in watching Eva Green's delicious portrayal of Arthur's evil half sister Morgan le Fey. Whenever she is on the screen, she raises the proceedings up a couple of notches. Recommended for fans of 80s excess like Dynasty and Dallas, but certainly not for fans of T.H. White.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Batman Begins changed the way people thought about Batman movies.  The Dark Knight takes it even further.  The way the Joker is portrayed is just amazing.  Heath Ledger does an amazing job as the Joker.  He actually becomes the Joker.  You forget who is playing him and that he is acting.  He takes you on a twisted journey.  He definitely steals the leading role on this movie.  The movie is dark, gritty, and well paced.  A movie that needs to be watched.
0689835604|5.0|Mine is.  She lifts up other people's shirts sometimes to find their belly buttons.  She is also learning about eyes, hands, feet and other body parts.  This book helps to learn about those things and is entertaining.  She likes to lift the flaps.  She isnt too rough, but other kids might rip the flaps.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a great game and it passes time only thing is it kind off hard to get enough points to open knew games after to get past the first couple
B004R13U6Y|3.0|TTS feature very useful, but language selection is very cumbersome. I have to scroll through 10 different accents of English, 5 different accents of German just to get to Spanish.<br /><br />Need Copy/Paste in Text-Reflow mode, which extracts text from PDF to read it like an eBook. I use this mode exclusively on my Galaxy phone, and copy/paste seems not to work in this mode, Repligo Reader allows copy/paste in text-reflow mode.<br /><br />But I would say, overall, given its features, this is the best PDF reader for android.

1609611543|5.0|In recent years many people have become more aware of carbohydrates, be they simple or complex.  However, one of Dr. William Davis' many significant points in \\"Wheat Belly\\" is that these are *processed* carbohydrates and have been modified by Agribusiness.  These are not the same carbohydrates that are grandparents ate.  The focus of the book is, on wheat.  Dr. Davis writes clearly and uses case studies, references, and science to support his claim: wheat causes many negative side effects and deleterious health issues such as changes in the brain and blood sugar.  The wheat we eat today has been genetically altered by the corporate Agribusiness industry. Davis also did a scientific comparison of the wheat of today versus wheat eaten by humans in the past.  Davis claims obesity, diabetes, and other serious ailments are the result of our massive consumption of today wheat, which permeates our food intake in the United States.    Davis advocates eliminating all wheat from one's diet, and notes the many, many, foods that wheat and wheat products are in: pasta, bread, crackers, porridge, pancakes, muesli, pastries, pies, pizzas, muffins, rolls, dough-nuts, gravy, pretzels and many other things.    Also adroitly noted was the 'acidity and alkaline' issue of the processed foods of today.  Processed foods are ubiquitous and make our bodies more acidic. I have almost completely eliminated processed foods from my diet (because I live outside the US and it's easy to do so).    Among the many things I learned from this book is that wheat is not just a carbohydrate, but a mutated and altered \\"food\\" that has adverse health effects. If you have had carbohydrate sensitivity or feel you are over-weight of bloated, I would recommend that you buy this book (which is a well-written quick read) and significantly reduce or eliminate wheat from your diet for a month or 6 weeks.  See if there are differences in your body and how you feel. \\"Wheat Belly\\" contains non-wheat recipes and meansof how to have a non-wheat diet and lifestyle.  This is not a \\"diet\\" or \\"lose weight\\" book but a book about wheat and its ill effect that are related to health. You will thin-out, following this.  (Also see: Track Your Plaque diet.)  Dr. Davis is a preventative cardiologist and he does suffer from wheat intolerance.  The eating changes prescribed in the book may help many, and not be needed for some people. It's up to the individual to try and experiment with the change, monitor his/herself, then make an  assessment.  With this book, once  again we see the misinformation from the USDA and also the negative things Agribusiness does.   This is a very helpful book for overall health also, and in particular (to state again) the ill-effects from processed foods, which should be learned about and understood by everyone.

B0043EV774|5.0|I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan, but I do like a few of his movies. I wasn't particularly interested in seeing this version of Alice in Wonderland which puts a twist on the Alice in Wonderland story that I grew up with. But, when we purchased a 3D TV, I thought it might be a great addition to our 3D DVD library.<br /><br />The peaceful world of Wonderland became the nightmarish world known as Underland under the villainous Red Queen's reign. Alice doesn't recall visiting Wonderland as a child, but was having recurring nightmares about her experiences in Wonderland. When nineteen year old Alice falls down a rabbit hole, she is transported to Underland where the residents remember her & have been waiting for her return to rescue them from the evil Red Queen. Johnny Depp plays an excellent Mad Hatter; Helena Bonham Carter, the Red Queen with the big head...no HUGE head, is an excellent villain. I could go on to praise everyone in this movie, the casting was perfect. The Bandersnatch, a ferocious creature under the Red Queen's rule & the Jabberwocky, a terrifying dragon type creature used by the Red Queen as a weapon, might terrify younger children.<br /><br />My whole family enjoyed it from its beginning to the end. The colors, atmosphere, characters, costumes & 3D effects make this movie visually exciting. (There were a couple scenes which had minor parallax problems; I'm the only one in the family that noticed them) This is one movie where 3D definitely adds to its visual entertainment.<br /><br />This Combo set contains  4 discs: DVD, Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D & Digital (you can download a digital copy to your Mac or PC in ITunes or Windows Media format, use the code to transfer & watch the movie on your computer or compatible portable device.)<br /><br />5 Stars
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|This reboot of \\"Conan The Barbarian\\" is a fairly entertaining sword and sorcery fantasy movie, but it easily could have been really great. I am a fan of the Arnold Schwarzenegger [[ASIN:B0026IYLS6 Conan the Barbarian (1982)]] but really looked forward to seeing Jason Momoa (like him in Stargate: Atlantis) take on the Conan roll. Add in the talented Stephen Lang as Conan's nemisis, Khalar Zym, and Rachel Nichols as Tamara, Conan's love interest, this should have been much better.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The movie follows Conan from his birth, to his youth learning about what is to be a Sumerian and becoming a man, to the destruction of his village, and his long search for revenge. This sounds a lot like the original 1982 movie, but the implementation was far from as entertaining.<br /><br />The action, settings, and special effects were all top rate and are what made this a watchable movie, but the lack of character development and generally weak script were the real let down.<br /><br />The real test of any movie is how often you can rewatch it and I watch the 1982 version once or twice a year, but will likely not go out of my way to see this one again.<br /><br />CFH
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is absoulutly one of the best games out there, it is so addicting and had so many level and even when you beat all the levels you can go back and try to get 3 stars on them! I would.tottaly recommend this game to any kindle fire users looking for a fun entertaining game!

B0063IH60K|5.0|Always have enjoyed playing solitaire no matter what media. I think it helps keep the brain stimulated besides being fun and enjoyable. And right now it keeps my brain and hands busy while I am trying to cut down and in the near future quit. Very important game to me at this time especially.

B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Let me begin with what bothers me the most right now: I have NEVER had a book with such a TERRIBLE cliffhanger as this. This cliffhanger beats out The Son of Neptune by a MILE. You're reading it, all full of anticipation and excitement, thinking *SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT* What will happpen when she finds Xander?? OMG what will she say when she finds out his secret. You flip or press on to the next page, and BA BAM!! It's over!!! When that happened to me, I was just sitting there in shock, going,&#34;What? It's over??? WHAT??!!!??&#34; I kept trying to click on to the next page when there wasn't one. And I was left with more suspense than ever. FRUSTRATING!!!!<br />Other than that abrupt ending, all in all, the book was pretty good. A VERY VERY VERY miniscule step down from Matched, but I almost liked it better than the first book. It's filled with more action than ever.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app. my kids and I cant put this game away.  I recommend this game during down time.

0060899220|5.0|Anthony Bourdain is honest and forthright about his personal and professional life in the restaurant business.  He covered a lot of areas, and this is also a book for those considering going into the business. KC begins with Bourdain realizing the tastiness and special qualities of superb food on a trip to France with his parents as a child.  Later, after working in a Summer for a mid-range restaurant in the Cape of Mass, Bourdain entered a 2-year culinary school.  After graduation he got a job at a well known restaurant atop the Rockefeller Center in New York. A lot of wealthy New York influential \\"eating garbage at the top of the world\\" as Bourdain put it, \\"with a view of Manhattan.\\"  He classifies cooks into 3 groups: artists, exiles, and mercenaries.  The artists are annoying and high maintenance, the exiles cannot make it in any other business because of idiosyncrasies and foibles.  The mercenaries do it for the money and do it well.  I think these categories can certainly be applied to employees in several other businesses and industries.  Author Bourdain noted the long hours, stress, heat, and conditions of working in close proximity to other people in a busy, hot kitchen.  The stress causes many to use drugs on the job to take the edge off.  He also notes the humor, camaraderie, vernacular, and slang of the crew in kitchens.  There is no political correctness, here.  Working with an array of sharp knives that are close at hand, leads to control of potential bullies and malcontents when personalities clash.  He notes the open and wild times of the 1970s in the business and outside of it.  Bourdain appreciates good, delicious cuisine.  As for the some of the many things that he notes in restaurants is that brunch is basically left-over food from things not used in the previous couple of days, and fish on Mondays is usually from Thursday.  If the fish not gotten rid of by Monday it's a waste and therefore a financial loss.  Hence Bourdain's advice: \\"don't order fish on Mondays.\\"  My only recommendation for KC is that it should have had a glossary in the back for restaurant terms and French words that were often used throughout the book.  Without a definition, the reader has to guess the meaning, and it was not always easy.  As for the bartenders that often accompany a restaurant, the most common way a bartender increases his income is the \\"buy-back.\\"  Every 2nd or 3rd drink/beer is on the bartender and the tip can be increased in appreciation.  Almost all of us have experience this.  I think it's more common in the big cities.   One saying: \\"An ounce of sauce can cover a multitude of sins,\\" if the meat is a little off.  Bourdain's mentor in the business when he became a manager and later an owner was a man with the nickname Bigfoot because of his physical scale.  Bourdain adopted Many of Bigfoot's principles.  One example, is having a restaurant supplier (called a 'purveyor') delivery driver unload an entire truck at the restaurant, only to re-load it and leave without Bourdain buying it because the driver was 5-minutes late.  A little picky here?    'Failing Restaurant Syndrome' is also detailed:  When a restaurant if failing, people often start to brainstorm and tinker with the menu, and make unnecessary and futile changes.  Different gimmicks are introduced such as \\"New Orleans Brunch complete with a Dixieland band,\\" and/or \\"Sunday night Brunch and prix fixe menus.\\"  A publicist is hired.  Each brainstorm is more and more counterproductive than the one before.  Last minute attempts to thwart the coming insolvency. Then the consultants are hired.  Bourdain notes that the consultants are the last ones to come in before paychecks bounce, vendors put the restaurant on COD and the repo men arrive.  A tough business, it is.    \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is reader friendly and contains lots of personal info and details about the restaurant business.  Lots of pleasure about the restaurant industry for the customers (which we allare), those who enjoy good food, and for those in the industry and for those who are considering going into it.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Bought the Kindle Fire for my wife and decided it needed a cover.  This cover is just the thing for it as it doesn't increase the size or weight to any degree, looks smart and protects the KF.  The elastic strap is nice to insure it is going to stay covered when in a bag.  I bought a Kindle Fire for myself, as I liked the one for my wife so well.  This time I bought a different colored cover so we can easily tell them apart.  Recommend them without reservation.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Took a bit to get the hang of but is fun to play. Wish there was more variety though. Some games are a bit difficult to control action.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Wow, what a great game!  Totally simple in concept, it will make you believe in the impossible.  Some of the challenges are amazingly elegant.  It is conceived as a Zen like game and it succeeds. Well worth the $1.
0062082353|2.0|THE GOOD:  This book is a fairly fast read. For better or for worse though, it is pretty much written on a third-grade level. Now I'm not expecting a soldier, a SEAL no less to be a master thespian, but given the assistance Mr. Kyle had in writing this book, you would expect a little more depth.  A really nice touch to this book was the interwoven perspectives of his spouse, Taya. As one knows, every story has more than one side to it, and Mrs. Kyle adds an interesting layer to her spouse's story. It would have been refreshing, however, to get her take on what all those kills meant to her personally, i.e. how did she come to terms with that. But then again, she knew what she was getting into when she married him and married into the life.  THE BAD:  No real surprises here. Before I even turned a single page [a book I picked up to pass the time on a flight], this story has been told before. What is there really to be said that hasn't been said before?  THE UGLY:  Here is where the tough love comes in: Let's stop being silly, cut the bullcrap and be honest here. I'm confident in saying a majority of the reviewers here who gave it 5 stars have either one of three things pertaining to them. 1. They know Chris Kyle personally. 2. They are gung-ho ex-military types. or 3. They have a extreme right-wing view on life.  That said, let's see it for what it is: Chris Kyle is NOT a 'hero'. Period. The 'sacrifices' he supposedly made were actually selfish choices. This man LOVES to kill for the sake of killing, plain and simple. The 'honor' rationale he sprinkles as an afterthought throughout the book is cringing at times. Perhaps he has rationalized it in his psyche, and no doubt he created life-long bonds with his comrades in the heat of battle. But at the end of the day, he couldn't wait to go in the front lines and keep killing. You very quickly reach the conclusion that he enjoys it.  Another reoccurring theme where I found myself asking the same question over and over: Howis it that he can call the insurgents \\"savages\\", feeling so indifferent to killing them, picking them off like they were a video game, yet we are supposed to go along for his \\"payback\\", and feel empathy for him personally?  No love for them either, Mr. Kyle, but really now, would you be ANY different if you were a dog backed into a corner by a foreign army? I am sure some reviewers here will view this as being liberal or sympathetic in nature, but quite the contrary. Part of defeating your adversary is getting into the mind of your adversary. I can see Mr. Kyle and ourselves, for that matter, resorting to such tactics if we viewed foreigners as invading our soil.  Even if Mr. Kyle never enlisted to do something he relished doing anyhow, I assure you the world would have still kept on spinning. We all have our delusions at one time or another of not being expendable, so let's squash this, okay? And one other thing, there are more ways than what you did to serve your country and fulfill your domestic obligations. Happens every day.  Bottom line: Is Chris Kyle an elite warrior? No question about it. Is he a brave soldier? Undoubtedly. Is he a hero [a term used so loosely in today's society, that really now, people should pull out a dictionary]? A resounding 'NO'.  The unique thing about this author [aside from his kill number, which, pardon me Sir, were it not for that statistic you wouldn't even have a book published!]is that he was able to place his unique/special talent to use, a talent he LOVED possessing, into an arena whereby any other place he would be thrown into prison.  Amazing the depths we will go to in order to rationalize the things that we do.
B004P2CQM4|1.0|I am so disappointed. I bought this for my husband. It was difficult to assemble and the pieces are flimsy and easily broken. The remote control was the same quality as the $5 RC car I bought my 2 year old. Within 5 minutes of use the right side motor stopped working. Buying this toy is like paying $50 for a mylar balloon. Next time I will go to the florist and buy a jumbo balloon. The fins are held on with clear tape and there are poor quality rubber bands holding pieces on that fall off.  Shame on Animal Planet for putting their name on this product. A price point of $10 would be an accurate reflection of the quality.

0783233477|5.0|It's too bad that this movie did not get the reviews it deserved!! The music is fantastic and Sir Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt do not disappoint! Perhaps the title should have been changed to reflect its true message.. It may stem from Greek mythology, where Hades (Death) abducts Persephone to his kingdom, before her mother fights for her return. In this movie,however, \\"Joe\\" (angel of Death)falls in love for the first time, discovers the meaning of life here on earth, and exercises the freedom to choose .. The title should have well been, \\"Death Meets Life!!\\"

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the first time I felt a real need to write a review for a book. To such an Amazing book. It's been 3 hours since reading \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" , and I am still utterly speechless and awed.  This is not so much as a review, but as a reaction to how I felt reading the book. John Green's Characters are so memorable, I knew them, I felt for them, Their joys, and pains, their struggles and triumphs. I cannot emphasize enough how I feel for the main characters of this book, but as a person suffering from much of the same thing they were, I felt a sense of connection I have never felt with any other book of Fiction. Somehow, Now, I am hopeful.   This book is for the sick and healthy, for the young and old, for the weak and hopeful, To just about everyone who doesn't mind being touched by teenagers, two in particular, Hazel and Gus, who cherished the infinities between Life and Oblivion.   \\"But there is no shortage of fault to be found amid our stars.\\"
0062082353|5.0|I read this book in a day, thanks to a couple of flights and I found it a riveting book.  No, it's not a manual on how to be a sniper and I believe the author intentionally focused on what the special ops teams do, not going into a lot of detail about the \\"how's\\".   If you are looking for a \\"how to be a sniper\\" this is not the book.  Yes, he inserts a small amount of \\"Texas humor\\" from time to time.  If you want detail on the level of commitment that it takes to perform at this level, the stress that it can provide to a young family and a marriage, the constant daily danger, and the \\"hardening\\" of emotions that take place over the years in a hostile environment, then I would recommend this book.  It's also sobering to read how Mr. Kyle coped with assimilating back into society, and working on his family and marriage, as well as life after the SEAL's.  While many are offering negative reviews and opinions, I have gratitude and appreciation for these men and the sacrifices they make in serving their country.   If Mr. Kyle happens to read this, I'd like to say \\"Thank you, Sir\\"
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is soooo fun! its challenging and the fact that its free makes the adds worth it. it'll keep you entertained for hours and even gives points at random which is cool too!
B0020GUXW2|5.0|Pablo Casals stood as one of the musical giants of the twentieth century. This set offers recorded proof of his greatness. Casals' performance of the Bach Cello suites first introduced me to that glorious music and have brought me countless hours of listening pleasure since. I've long been a fan of M. Horszowski, so I expected the Beethoven cello sonata performances to be of similarly high caliber. They did not disappoint. I had also heard the Archduke trio previously and knew that it was a great performance as well.<br /><br />The concertos were pleasant surprises though, mainly because the recording quality was better than I expected, allowing the orchestra accompaniment to further enrich the glorious cello playing. Szell and the Czech Philharmonic (one of my favorite orchestras, especially in Dvorak) collaborate on an especially fine rendition of the B minor concerto.<br /><br />9 CDs packed with some of the greatest musical interpretations I've ever heard.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|(Written by my wife) My husband and I unknowingly purchased each other Kindle Fires for Christmas. I ordered him this case in black and he loves it. The case he ordered me was too large. It made the Kindle huge, which made it difficult to carry in my bag. We returned that case and purchased this one in pink. I love it. It's slim, but it still protects the device and is easy to toss in my bag. I haven't had any trouble with the easel part, like some people have. The weight of the Kindle holds it down so the easel doesn't fold up. I definitely recommend this case!
B00479SVBU|5.0|Got this for my audiophile brother-in-law for Christmas, he was still toting cds in and out of the house to fill his changer. He loves it, now he just loads up his flash drive and plugs it in no fumbling with changing cds no annoying skipping...just jams the whole commute.
B005CS3WO6|5.0|I lived in the US my entire life. Unfortunately, Westlife never made it big in the US (which made it really difficult to collect all their albums/songs), but in other Countries they are recognized for their singing talent! I feel I've seen quite a bit of comments on Westlife that they are just a cover band, which I don't think is entirely true. Unless I'm mistaken, Westlife sang many original songs that I think are great: Amazing, Bop Bop Baby, Colour My World, Every Little Thing You Do, Flying Without Wings (later covered by Ruben Studdard), Heart Without A Home, How To Break A Heart, I'll See You Again, I Do, I Lay My Love On You, It's You, Lost In You, Maybe Tomorrow, My Love, Obvious, Shadows, Something Right, Talk Me Down (Awesome song!), Until The End Of Time, Us Against The World, When You're Looking Like That, When You Come Around, Where We Are, World Of Our Own, and You Make Me Feel; only to name a few. :)  I was actually hoping during the US version of X-Factor, Westlife would make a guest appearance or something (since Simon was involved with their earlier career). Too bad this is their final album. I don't think this or the 2 disc version of this album does their music journey justice. I'm confident that their will be a Platinum Collection set; and I hope Amazon offers it. I just hope their isn't different releases because I'll want to get them all!!  If you don't know these guys, you should get their music. They offer many great cover and original songs!!

0525478817|5.0|Do you see what I did there? :D    Anyway, this isn't going to be a terribly long review because I don't want to get spoilery.  My thoughts?  The book is a TREMENDOUS work, and I very well may have said that about all of the books that I've read by John, but this just takes the cake.  I laughed, I cried, I wanted to travel internationally, but most of all, I wanted to know these characters in real life.  That's the thing about John Green's characters:  They're just so relatable, and I think Hazel and Augustus are even more so than some of his other.    (I won't lie, though.  I want a friend like Tiny.  [[ASIN:0142418471 Will Grayson, Will Grayson]])  I bought the nook book on release day (Don't hurt me, Amazon) and I had the novel read in a day's time, but that's not gonna stop me from reading my newly delivered, J-Scribbled, hard cover copy, and you should, too.  DFTBA.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is a movie that is not afraid to tell the truth. Meat and dairy farmers want to paint a picture of \\" happy cows and chickens.\\"  Nothing could be further from the truth. It reinforces  the reasons to be a vegetarian or at least to know about the food industry..

1423136802|5.0|Was very happy with the boxed set. Was a better price than the 2 major bookstores! My 12 year son loves reading them. It arrived when it was suppose to & I didn't have to drive to the bookstore to purchase it. It was a Christmas purchase so it was so easy. (sometimes the store doesn't even have what you are looking for and then they tell you to order it online through them).
B00139XTG4|5.0|Have you ever wondered what people with exceptional thinking skills reflect on?  The Black Swan is a metaphor that can be used by anyone in every field. The author presents thinking that I cannot contemplate. But, he presents his information with stories that allow every reader to understand why this concept is important.  Very worthwhile reading!!

1451627289|5.0|What would engage anyone to read an 800+ page book? A premise so extraordinary you just can't resist picking it up. I am not a fan of Stephen King, never read any of his books before just seen a few of his novels turned into movies. I don't like horror books, and I assumed that is all he wrote. But this novel's description was so enticing, I bought it.<br /><br />I was hooked from the first chapter. It was engrossing and so interesting. The novel draws you in and the fictional people became alive and as real as Kennedy himself. You see the Oswalds as real flesh and blood people as the main character travels back in time with one mission: stop Oswald. I am an author myself and marvel at the amount of time it must have taken Stephen King to research and create this masterpiece. This is a remarkable story -- you simply have to read. Everything has consequences -- you'll be surprised by all the ones that happen in this fascinating  page turner.<br /><br />I lavish this praise because I mean it when I say --it's the best novel of the decade. Don't miss this one--you'll lose out on a story you'll never forget.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I read this as a grandfather knowing it was a children's novel. It moved me like few books have in the last few years. Though a child's book I think children will miss much of the author's message. Some of the scenes may be a little too intense for young children, especially if they are the 'sensitive type.' I would recommend it as a great 'read to' book so that parents/grandparents can talk to the children about the issues that arise.   I would give this more that 5 stars if I could!
0811879542|5.0|This is simply the review of a 2 1/2 year old boy. He loves books and this one is by far his favorite. Hold any variety of books with this one and ask him which one he wants to read first - this is it! Regarding the person with a 7 year old who \\"doesn't get it\\" - perhaps he is at the wrong age for this book. At 60, I can promise you I \\"get it\\". But this book is for little kids, and my grandson gives this book two thumbs way up!
B001N26GFM|3.0|This was a very well-made movie, with excellent acting, casting, camera-work, etc., but I can't get away from the fact that it was the most depressing movie I have ever watched.  I know that movies like this have to be made, and not every movie should have a happy ending, but I guess I just want to warn people about this.  This film is going to hit you hard, and stay with you for a long time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Absolutely terrific! This whole app is like one big game! You have to keep unlocking games by playing other games! A great overall experience!
1583334386|5.0|There are a million self-help books out there. I can only think of two that are based on solid scientific evidence: 59 Seconds by Richard Wiseman (highly recommended) and this one. Whatever your issue is, the author helps you understand why your brain wants to overeat, overshop, cheat on your spouse and gives helpful exercises for you to stop the behavior.   I read this book in a couple of sittings, but I'm going back through the way she recommends: a chapter a week to fully work through the exercise(s) I chose. I can't say this book has been life-changing for me; I've only had it a week, but I'm optimistic. The author teaches a class on willpower at Stanford, and she mentions that some people take it multiple times, and people bring their kids and spouses and co-workers in to it. I can believe it. This book is well-written and fun to read.   It's an empowering book-and since it's based on facts and science instead of pithy sayings and unusual if inspiring anecdotes-is more likely to get you to improve your life-with actual lasting results- than most self-help books out there. Seriously, stop reading the books that just tell you to wish upon a star and only reference motivation speakers to back up their claims. Start reading the books written by people who use concrete evidence for their claims. Sorry, Tony Robbins and Brian Tracy, but I'll go to Richard Wiseman and Kelly Mcgonigal and the scientists whose studies they reference.

B005G4TJI4|4.0|Great popcorn flick. Big difference between the dvd & bluray. The digital copy has been great since we own an iPad
B006SV2LWA|3.0|Maybe I let myself buy into the hype too much for watching this and had my hopes too high. I was really hoping for an intense nail biting experience (built by suspense, I was not expecting an action thriller) but found myself bored at times and wishing that they would move the movie along a little more. It felt to me like there was a lot of filler time. Maybe it is the director trying to build suspense by staying on a scene for so long but it was a fail in my mind. I guess my medical background had something to do with me and my girlfriend finding this movie less than remarkable, intense, or chilling. My biggest hope from this movie, as it shows how easy something can get passed between people was that, after seeing it, people would be more hygienic. However, people are as gross as always. I work security and watch people all day long sneeze or cough in their hands (or even pick their nose) then proceed to touch everything they can. People are so gross and inconsiderate!<br /><br />Anyway, sorry about my little rant. In summation, the movie is well acted but slow and a little boring and unremarkable.

I Wanna Go  the first 9 tracks are the exact same remixes from the US Version.   10. Criminal (varsity team remix)      NOT THE RADIO EDIT... this version is pretty kick ass, no lie  11. Break the Ice (tonal remix)     I prefer the jason nevins remix, but his one is still top notch  12. Hold it Against Me (funk generation club remix)    SWEEEEEEEET MIX!!!!  13. My Prerogative (x-press 2 radio edit)    This is ok, I've heard it elsewhere before, maybe on her limited edition of my prerogative. nonetheless, it's an excellent beat.   14. Criminal (Tom Piper and Riddler Club mix)    Ehh, I prefer the first edition of Criminal on this collection.    All in all, even though the price is ridiculously more than the US version, this is a GREAT! collaboration.  If your strapped for cash, you may want to wait for it to drop or search elsewhere of course... either way you'll want to add this to your collection!

B004GUSG4M|2.0|This book was rather a waste of time to read. Thankfully it's a quick read. But mind numbingly boring. I basically began skimming just to get through with it.  The end is not a shock. You figure it out and then it's tied up so quickly that it's embarrassing.   The worst part about the ending is that the characters explain everything nice and tidy. It feels like Scooby Doo.   I can see how it could easily be turned into a movie script. I think it would be better as a film.

B000001F7R|4.0|I first heard Def Leppard (and it was probably the first of maybe 3 times total) on my local rock station shortly after this album came out - they played 'Rock Brigade' and it was like a breath of fresh air twisting its way through the stale vapors of what was being played on radio at that time...a few months later the band (along with Scorpions) opened up for Ted Nugent on his 'Scream Dream' tour (the day before my birthday...what a cool present!) - after that, I HAD to find the album.  Finally found it and became a huge fan.  Up until this period, I was more of a (oh, how I hate this term) 'classic' rock fan (Rush, Zep, Kiss, Foghat, Nazereth, UFO, etc etc etc), but the HEAVY stuff (Aerosmith, Triumph...you get the idea...) - this album, and this BAND basically kicked down the door for the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal (although there were some bands recording this type of stuff before the Lep's released this...Riot, Saxon, et al) and I was happily swept away on a wave of exciting new bands from both the UK as well as other countries.  Listening back on it now you can hear the naivety on a lot of these tracks, but I think that's what makes it so fun to listen to today.  I guess you needed to hear it when it was first released to fully appreciate what this album (as well as 'Hi 'N Dry') meant to metal fans back in the early '80s.  And it's strange...before they recorded this, the band were revered as metal heroes in their native Britain...for some odd reason, the album (and the band, after recording it) received extremely hostile reactions by both critics as well as fans in jolly olde England, essentially directing the band to focus their attention on the American market, hence the ultimate demise of the band...once Pete Willis left the group, Phil Collen (previously in a band called 'Girl' - a dead givaway of what was to come...) stepped in and WHAM!!! Inane, teeny-bopper fluff metal at it's 'finest.'  Gone were the thundering power chords that kicked down yourdoor to be replaced with chimey, polite chords that snuck around your door, begging to be let in...and those swelling harmony vocals in the chorus that just swept your heart away...BAH! And yes, I know Willis had an alcohol problem, but he was the 'bringer of the grit' and the band was never the same again after his departure...all the other 'positive' reviewers have already described what this album sounds like; I just felt like adding my 2 cents to it as well...I can still hear the majesty and power of 'It Could Be You,' still my favorite Def Lep song ever...

1417709049|5.0|My wife and I both enjoyed reading this book. It is a wonderful opportunity to see into what most would consider a psychological and physical anomaly. My wife felt as if it not only provided her with entertainment through reading, but actually changed her perspective of the world as she sees it. I would tend to agree and add that it will affect one's views on further literature, as well. A solid, if somewhat confusing, read for everyone. The library binding is especially nice for the added durability and the ability to add personal notes throughout.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I truely enjoyed this book, and I am very much hooked into the story now and cannot wait to read the next book. I can understand the frustration some readers feel about this book, as it does go back in time from the end of the 4th book.  In the version I have been reading, the first chapter is a repeat of a chapter in the 4th book. I did groan internally when I started the book and realized we went back in time, but decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did because the chapters in the book helped move the story forward, and were intersesting to read. After reading them, I think they were important to the story's development.  The only thing I'm sad about is that I do not have the 6th book yet to read.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I like the level-changing tool, and the graphics are bright and friendly. When I was young, it was considered impossible to play chess against a computer. Too complicated, they said. We've come a long way, baby.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I really enjoyed these 4 books. There are a few times where the books drag a little, but there are a lot of different aspects of the stories to cover. I found the more I read the books, the more I cared about the characters.  Martin does a good job of describing the world the characters live in. I cannot wait to finish the series.

0812992792|5.0|If you're thinking about buying this book, you should know this: this novel will take you places you have never seen.  And those images will stay with you.  Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this book is Adam Johnson's ability to combine research (that is, he is one of the few Americans to visit North Korea) with an intuitive understanding of the human soul.  This is not merely a political or a geographic novel--though of course it is those things as well--it is a masterfully plotted story that lures its characters into a place where they must know themselves--their loves and ambitions--in a way that is devastating.  In other words, this is not only the best literary I've read in the past year; it is also the first novel to realistically explore the oppressive regime of North Korea.  If you've read Johnson's previous books, you've no doubt noticed his attraction to dark humor and political absurdities, a stance that is always coupled with a deep understanding of the human condition.  Johnson's short stories--somewhat like those of George Saunders--often create an absurdist alternate American reality, one pitched just right to offer cultural commentary on our current social climate.  In terms of this book's design, its genius is that Johnson has found the perfect location for his absurdist political outlook, a place where propaganda disguises itself as news, a place where oppression is presented as love, a country populated by millions yet with only one identifiable individual citizen, its ruler, Kim Jong Il.  This is an amazing read.  You'll be glad you picked it up.
B00002MVRP|1.0|I purchased this product on December 2nd and it is now Jan.13th and I have not received it yet!  When is it coming!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This case by Marware does the job admirably for the price-point.  It fits the Kindle Fire snugly, with  well designed carve-outs for the power button and jack, earphone jack and speakers, leaving an overall sleek profile and adding very little to the size or weight of the tablet.  The screen cover is ultra thin, but it provides more than enough protection from ordinary incidental contact.  The fabric lining is soft and has so far prevented any scratches whatsoever.  It closes easily and stays closed, even without a clasp (which surprised me, honestly).  I've been using the case for several weeks now with no signs of wear and tear to the Fire or the case.<br /><br />The additional feature of the screen cover folding behind the main case to form an easel or stand for the Fire also works well, as long as you have a flat, relatively hard surface to work with, and as long as you want to use the Fire in landscape mode.  I often use the Fire in bed, and the stand feature can be less effective at odd angles and on soft bedding as it's the weight of the Fire itself that keeps the stand together.  This isn't a major issue for me, though, since I'm usually reading or web surfing and holding the device like a book.<br /><br />Incidentally, the elastic strap on the back of the case makes holding the Fire like a book a perfect fit for my hands and dramatically reduces the minor hand and wrist fatigue I was experiencing previously during long term reading.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that the felt-like lining is an absolute lint and pet hair magnet.  This was a slight disappointment at first, but then I discovered that it cleans amazingly well with a simple lint roller.  As an animal lover, I've come to expect that everything I own will sooner or later (usually sooner) need a pass with the lint roller.<br /><br />Please note that this case will probably do very little to protect the Fire from higher impact events like major drops, and it likely offers only minor protection against precipitation since it does not completely enclose the device.not completely enclose the device.

0345522478|5.0|I have been reading urban fantasy for about as long as it has been around, and I have never been as struck by a first novel as I have by Kevin Hearne's \\"Hounded.\\"  His wry humor infuses the novel and makes it easy to read, and his characterization of the Irish wolfhound just makes me cackle.  Atticus is a fascinating character who really comes alive and drives the story, and the secondary characters are well-crafted and add to the entertainment.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|the free version is so much better! ha I loved this game then I paid for the upraded version and I could careless for it...
B000KIPD5E|4.0|I like this pedal.And now own almost the entire behringer line of pedals.I have not had one problem yet with any of them.And have not experienced the comon problem I read about saying they suck battery power because I also have the behringer pedal board.In this day and age you can buy another Beheringer pedal for less than a pack of batteries so a pedalboard is the way to go.That said my only beef with the a/b 100 is it has a/b but not a and b together.
0525478817|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read, by far John Green's best work. I highly reccomned giving this book to your mom, dad, sister, brother, grandma, grandpa, and aunt LouLou, because it a fantastic piece of literature that anyone with the capability to read and comprehend it will love.  The story stays with you long after you've turned the final pages, and the characters are some of the most awe inspiring and interesting almost 3D characters you'll ever find in a book. A 5 star book.

0375842209|5.0|This book was written so well and held my attention. I luckily stumbled upon it when I was in my small, local library. Wow am I happy I did. Genius idea for a narrator and so historically realistic. Wonderful book.. makes me want to steal books. But for the record I only borrow them. :)

B006JTS5OO|5.0|Lets face it, we all wanted this movie to revive the Muppets..... annnd... Jason Segel does an astounding job, not only does he revive the Muppets, but he re-enters them into our society.  Segel accepts that the Muppets have been left as a redundant children's toy in recent years, and decides to revive them and re-introduce them to the youth of today.  Thankfully, the adults of today remember and cherish the Muppets, and love everything they were.  Such an honest, pure form of communicating with children is refreshing in todays world, and Segel hits it on the head with every song and dance.  If you want a family movie, Pick this
B006GG1KOC|2.0|My 5 year old son beat the game in 10 minutes.  Way too easy and not much to the game.  Disappointed.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have been using LogMeIn and have used many other remotes and the control, speed and image quality of Splashtop products is one of if not the best!! (And I use native Windows RDP every day) It's even one of the best from native Windows connection much less running from Android!  Very polished and well thought-out. Can't believe it's only $5 (I got free via Amazon daily deal).  You have a new fan!!  :D
B003YL4LYI|3.0|If you are on the fence about purchasing this book, and the price isn't a bank breaker, I say do it. But understand that it will feel like a chore at times. Daenerys' chapters are frustrating and lead nowhere, Tyrion's are ridiculous at times, but have their moments. If you are a fan of Jon Snow, you might not be after you read this addition to the series.  But regardless of the frustratingly boring chapters and the story that goes nowhere, I'm optimistic. I see this addition to the series as bridge to less tedious volumes, and if you read DWD you will have a more vivid picture of both the land and the characters. Don't feel bad about skipping a chapter or two though. You won't miss anything.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|this thing is just awesome! i haven't used the diamond rod yet, so i cant say too much about that, but i was able to get all my knives razor sharp with just a few passes through the carbide slot. The only thing i didn't really like, was the plastic it was made with, it just feels kind of delicate. but other then that, its amazing (for 8 bucks, what are you waiting for? go buy it!)
B002G1YPH0|2.0|The CPU cooler arrived with no threads on one of the standoffs, making it unable to hold the fan to my motherboard. I contacted CoolerMaster from the support section on their website for a replacement. I started with the Live Chat, which put me on hold... for an hour and a half. I then called their support line, which I was also put on hold for a very long time. I gave up and sent them an email. The next day, I got a response saying I had to fill out a form on their website, which I did. It took them 7 days to approve my part request, and another 2 days to ship my part, then another week to get my part in the mail. I understand that my experience could have been much worse, but I get the impression that Cooler Master will only do the bare minimum to satisfy their customers. It's just a little frustrating that I have to wait for a few weeks to install my CPU fan because of a lack of quality control at CoolerMaster. I understand these things happen and defective products ship from time to time, but all I ask is for a little hustle and to pick up your support phone line/live chat. Being without a CPU fan, therefore computer for more than two weeks is excruciating (Especially when I paid for expedited shipping), and not being able to get a hold of somebody to help just makes it that much more frustrating.    I'm disappointed with CoolerMaster and would probably use another brand in the future.
0718157834|5.0|It's hard to type a review with tears in your eyes, and on your cheeks, and falling into the keyboard, but I'll try. Because I just finished Me Before You and I have to write about it now.<br /><br />There are millions of love stories out there but few that get to the core of what the couple means to one another, a meaning beyond physical attraction and personal fulfillment. But the story JoJo Moyes has written of Will Traynor and Lou Clark goes exactly there.<br /><br />We meet Will when he is a successful businessman, leaving his gorgeous girlfriend to go to his high powered job. It is a brief introduction, for on the second page he is struck by a motorcycle. From then on, we see him as the quadriplegic he has become.<br /><br />Enter Louisa Clark, who's lost her job at the Buttered Bun cafe. She is employed by Will's mother to be his caretaker, although she has had no experience with the medical needs of a quad. What she does know, however, is how to be witty, how to be colorful, how to bring more than a spark of joy into Will's life.<br /><br />What she doesn't know is that Will has promised his parents only six months until he goes to Dignitas in Switzerland, a place where he can die because he cannot bear the life he is forced to live. It is a life with no control, no capabilities, no choices left but one.<br /><br />This is a complex novel, examining much more than the love between two people. It also examines how our lives can enrich one another, and how we can reach beyond our fallibilites and limitations to show how much we truly care. It is very powerful and deeply moving.

B006KAWI2C|4.0|NOTE: This review was revised upon my discovery that my box was missing disc 11, had two copies of disc 13, and was lacking disc 94 (and jacket).<br /><br />The recordings of Arthur Rubinstein have been well treated on Compact Disc.  Some of RCA's first CD issues of analogue recordings were devoted to Rubinstein, although the early remastering left much to be desired.  (I worked at a classical record store on Cleveland's Shaker Square when a Tchaikovsky/Grieg disc was issued.  The manager said it would never sell because it originated as an analogue recording - in fact all our copies sold within two days.) Most of Rubinstein's stereo recordings have received multiple CD issues, a testament to the pianist's continuing popularity with the public.  The mono recordings have not had such broad distribution which has contributed to a distorted picture of the pianist's legacy.  RCA's Complete Rubinstein Collection, issued as an expensive box in 1999, gathered together all of Rubinstein's recordings for RCA, HMV/EMI, and a single recording he made for Decca/London - it also contained a two CD set of interviews and previously unissued recordings.  Now we have this Original Album Collection.  Contained herein is everything from the 1999 box, except for the 1964 Moscow recital, which is available elsewhere on CD and DVD.  This set also includes three CDs of previously unpublished live recordings (more on those later)  -  making for a total of over 100 hours containing a huge swath of solo, concerto, and chamber repertoire -  at a fraction of the price of the 1999 box.<br /><br />With the exception of a 78RPM disc made for the Polish Favorit label in 1910 (never transferred to a modern format), Rubinstein refused to record during the pre-electric era - he complained the old acoustic recording process made the piano sound \\"like a banjo\\".  So the earliest recording here was made when Rubinstein was already 41 years old.  It's fascinating to trace Rubinstein's evolution as an interpreter over a 48 year period.<br /><br />In general, Rubinstein's earlier performances of shorter works, such as Chopin Mazurkas and Nocturnes, are freer and more imaginative than the later remakes.  The younger Rubinstein also has greater control of pianissimo, which can clearly be heard even in the earliest recordings.  Conversely, Rubinstein's sense of structure, particularly in larger scale works, improved with advancing years.  The pianist's stereo remakes of Beethoven's Opp. 13, 31, No. 3, and 81a sonatas, Chopin's Op. 35 sonata, and the Brahms Op. 5 sonata, are head and shoulders above the earlier versions.  The flip side is that, by the 1960s, Rubinstein had become conscious of his role as an \\"elder-statesman\\" of the piano and that he was recording \\"for posterity\\" - resulting in a loss of spontaneity.  Also, his recordings from the mid-1960s onward are increasingly marred by the lack of a true pianissimo in his playing - possibly a result of deteriorating hearing.  Many of the pianist's mid-period recordings, such as the Chopin Polonaises from 1951, marry the best of both worlds.<br /><br />We are doubly blessed that many of Rubinstein's best performed recordings (especially in concertos) were also made during RCA's \\"Living Stereo\\" era - when that company's recording engineers were putting out their best work.  By the mid-1960s, RCA's engineers were experimenting with multiple-miking which marred his later concerto recordings, despite digital remastering<br /><br />Now to the newly issued material: These stem from the 1961 series of ten Carnegie Hall recitals given by Rubinstein (truly \\"given\\", as he donated the entire proceeds to charity).  Four works are new to Rubinstein's recorded repertoire: Falla's Dance of the Miller's Wife; Debussy's L'Isle Joyeuse; Scriabin's Nocturne for the Left Hand, and Stravinsky's Petrouchka.  The Scriabin is proof that Rubinstein's left-hand technique was secure, despite an inconsequential wrong note at the beginning. The Falla and Debussy have an orgiastic brio that allows one to forgive the many missing details.  Performances like these must have led Harold Schonberg to write that \\"Rubinstein played with the great pelvic thrust\\". The Stravinsky is most interesting, as it was written expressly for Rubinstein (with the pianist's assistance) and the composer gave Rubinstein carte-blanche to make any changes he felt appropriate.  The most significant change is that Rubinstein reinstates the \\"drum-roll\\" interludes between the three scenes.  The Russian Dance starts out roughly, with several wrong notes and some unsteadiness, before settling down for the scene in Petrouchka's Room. In the Shrovetide Fair scene, Rubinstein throws caution to the wind and gives a full throttle, adrenaline fused performance - overwhelming in its savagery.  This is the Rubinstein that music lovers over a certain age reminisce about - one never heard in the more cautious studio recordings.  The remaining works have been recorded elsewhere by Rubinstein, but when performing live, the pianist was notably more flexible, poetic, and exciting than in the studio.<br /><br />The set also includes two DVDs: Rubinstein Remembered, a 1987 documentary hosted by the pianist's son, John Rubinstein; and Recital for Israel - a 1975 performance at Ambassador College in Pasadena, California.  There is also a CD only version of this recital, although the playing is far from Rubinstein's best and I have no doubt the pianist would be displeased by its release.<br /><br />This set uses the best existing transfers of each recording, which in most cases means the superb 1999 remasters by Jon Samuels.  A few exceptions include SACD hybrid remasters of selected Living Stereo items.  Of course, the three discs of new material are newly remastered, but the source material (monaural cassette tapes owned by John Rubinstein, and RCA tapes recorded using an AMPEX noise reduction curve that flattened Rubinstein's tone), is less than optimal.  Still, these remain eminently listenable.  The sound in the Ambassador College DVD has been sweetened and is more palatable than previous issues - though still far from ideal.<br /><br />The quality control issues prevent me from giving this a five star review.one to forgive the many missing details.

B004EPYZXU|2.0|A movie like this is not compelling because of the all-too-often repeated storyline of an all-knowing government who knows all about the dangers and dead Russians but sent the men to the moon anyway.  This is a real \\"9-11 Thruther\\" type scenario which falls apart as soon as you sweat a few first order logistical or historical details.  My main objection to this type of movie is that it gives birth to the most meaningless and false tripe when the actual history is incredibly compelling.

What this movie lacks in scope, script, and style it makes up for with decent pace. The best part is watching the actors (Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Zachary Quinto) all of whom are very talented. Even Demi Moore is captivating. Overall, the no frills approach makes this feels less like a movie and more like a long episode from the best cast TV show in the world.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is exactly what I expected, and I am very happy with it. It's light, simple, and protects my Kindle Fire. It's nothing fancy, but it'll keep you from being paranoid about putting it on your desk with other things touching it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun fun fun is all I can say about it. try it and see for yourself.  I mean it. fun
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is really fun and also challenging. I love it I like all the levels sometimes you have to really think about it. its a great game and its worth the $0.99.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Who else but John Grisham can yet again tap into his oft-used \\"big firm lawyer\\" vs. \\"the little guy\\" plot and crank out yet another best seller?  Well, he's done it again & I gotta admit, I really enjoyed this book.  One of the most entertaining I've read in a while.<br /><br />Yes, you will see some familiar themes you know you've read before in Grisham's previous books.  But hey, the formula obviously works and he IS the master.  His development of lawyer-turned-hero David Zinc and his new ambulance-chasing partners, Oscar Finley & Wally Figg, was well done.  Lawyer stereotypes of all types are well represented, often in hilarious fashion.  Lovable Losers.  Bad News Bears.  You get the idea.<br /><br />Pursuing any good tort lawyer's dream (a sure-fire win & huge fees), Zinc gets dragged into helping his tiny firm's inexperienced \\"dream team\\" take on a major drug maker & its high-powered legal defense team.  The David & Goliath roles are familiar to earlier works, but Grisham has a few twists to keep it fresh (and funny).<br /><br />I'm not a lawyer (thank God!) and I probably have the same general feelings about the legal profession as most of us do.  But when John Grisham's story-telling gets you actually rooting FOR the ambulance-chasers, then it's gotta be very well done.  Very enjoyable.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|great app for passing the time or relearning chess. Excellent free app. The easy level is great for kids and my wife and I enjoy the competition of playing each other head to head.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|This app would be wonderful. for helping at-risk kindergarten kids with language development.  The drawings are simple and easily identified, but the relationships are great for enhancing concepts. I am recommending this to my colleagues!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game!  who wouldn't lov it????? its fun and interesting to play on car rides to the beach.  I play it on my kindle all the time! !! my brother even loves it &iexcl;!!!!!!&iexcl;
B004N66XYE|5.0|I guess I should say right off that I didn't enjoy what I saw of the original  series. But this sequel caught me from the first moments. It seems to have a  much wider range of personalities than the first series did, including a Royal  Highness and a Nazi bigwig. There's a very strange, comic, but also scary  episode where the new tenant at the famous house needs to get the Nazi out of  a fancy party and the only thing they can think of is to have one of the  footmen drop a tray of drinks on him. Did they ever get that crazy in the  older Upstairs, Downstairs? And they really struck gold in letting Eileen Atkins  play one of those meddling, decadent society dames who, oddly enough, always  makes more sense than everyone else, in her dryly sarcastic way. The only problem  with this series is that it's too short. I could really have used an endless  mini-series approach. In short: witty, adventurous, and a trifle odd.
B006MW3VC4|5.0|One of the best things on TV today.  The beautifully filmed scenery, period clothing and most especially the great story lines and incredible actors.  Masterpiece is a real gem.
B005V20JKI|5.0|I can't play this app enough. I've spent more time on this game than anything else on my phone. Smooth gameplay on the LG G2x. Only time it force closes is when I am running too many other things in the background. I definitely recommended picking this up if your phone can run it.
0307593312|4.0|I understand the criticisms of 1Q84 - it is long - but not just long to tell a long story, but sometimes long because it is too repetitive.  And versus other Murakami novels, the action is slight.  But to me, the story was still mesmerizing - the magical realism the world/moon crossed lovers and the characters kept me coming back.  Ultimately it was very rewarding - though perhaps in need of a tyrannical editor.
B0037A4ILC|4.0|If you are a climber, you have to watch this movie.  Its that simple.  If you want the most realistic climbing movie out there, this is it.  The story is faily compelling throughout, I grade it -1 star for a few sequences that got over done with hollywood drama.  You'll know it when you see it.  Definitely a good film to drink a bit with your climbing buddies, watch this, and retell some of your own stories.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game - my granddaughter loves playing on it. we have about 1&amp;1/2 pages unlocked thanks to her. I like it to, I cant get off it now! like I said before, great game!
0439023521|4.0|I know my title is a little brutal for a book - I'm ALMOST accusing Mrs. Collins of a rip off. But reviews are supposed to be honest; and one feeling that I was unable to shake off while reading this book was that I was reading Lord of the Flies all over again. Or The Running Man. Or The Long Walk. Or, most closely, the Battle Royale.   Totalitarian government - check. Dystopian world - check. Teens fighting to their deaths - check. Only one survivor must remain - check. 42 kids at the start - nope, 24. Same digits, big difference. A simplification, if you will.   And this is where I believe this book wins; a simplification of the complex, foreign, deeply disturbing and graphic Battle Royale for the mass Western audience. For us.   The strengths of the book are fantastic: a past paced thriller, a likable character, lives of innocent children at stake.   The weaknesses are no less formidable. The plot and the writing are unbelievably formulaic. Here are just a few I care to mention:   - Make your character lovable by: (a) being an orphan; (b) having a defenseless relative, preferably a child; (c) taking care of a hurt pet;  - Make your character fight against all odds, ideally for the survival of humanity;  - Make sure she of he are visibly running out of either (a) time or (b) options;  - Have someone (\\"a guardian\\") warn them against the coming dangers...  The check list goes on.  I know this review is a collection of checklists; but this is exactly how I felt reading the book. A set of checklists to create an irresistible thriller.   Having said all that, the result is a fast-paced page turner that's impossible to put down. Well done. I truly enjoyed this book (although not the two that followed) and will watch the movie.   If only Katniss were less repeatedly whiny about the same issues over and over and over again... oh father... or mother... oh Prim... oh father... oh mother... oh Prim... as if no other thoughts exist to choose from. Sadly, this part gets worseas the series goes on: ad nauseum.  It's also amazing how Katniss gets through the Games without ... spoiler beep ... almost anyone. Lucky, I guess.  One major flaw that may call for a re-write, in my opinion, is the missed opportunity to create a hero. Good female leads are few and far between. Katniss (despite the name) could have been one. What do we get instead? A self-centered teen who can't decide what she wants, does what she is told, doesn't stand for much apart from her family, and manipulates the poor, sincere Peeta. Later on, it gets so bad I don't want to talk about it. Oh well.
B00005OWIU|5.0|It didn't take me long after seeing the movie to realize that I needed to get the soundtrack. There is just something about it that I won't lie. It gives me goosebumps. Especially \\"Harry's Wondrous World\\". That track right there is what put me into Harry Potter's world. I have every movie, every soundtrack, and every book.<br /><br />The music on here, as well as the other seven soundtracks, is beautifully done and for me is what defines Harry Potter. If you are a fan of Harry Potter, or of instrumental soundtracks, you should definitely get these. You won't be sorry.
B001OSIV62|2.0|I choose to watch this documentary with my kids so they could see the Twin Towers as I saw it as a kid. Philipe's  commitment, and determination to reach his vision seemed admirable. Just when he accomplished his great feat the film digressed to vulgarity showing a nude/sexual scene. this was PG-13 rating. I had 12 and 13 year old watching with me and they were disturbed and walked away. \\"What did that have to do with anything?\\" they were asking.  We never finished it. Disturbing and disappointing.
1451627289|5.0|I have to say this is one of the best books that I've ever read, and I have a lot of books. I first found out about this book at my local store, when the cover caught my eye, and I was like, oh well that looks interesting. So I read the inside flap and was like, I have to read this book. So I put myself on my library's waiting list - as I usually like to do first in case the book isn't what I think it will be and I end up not liking it. Well, I could have saved the time and bought the book outright because I loved it.<br /><br />I read it in three days. I had trouble putting it down at night, and when I finished last night, I stayed up until I finished because I refused to put it down.<br /><br />I love the idea of time  travel. Mainly because there are just so many different ways that you could go with it and I love thinking about the different effects that it could have. That was what initially drew me to the book. Especially the fact that the time portal in the book can only take you to a specific day and time, and that's it. That was a new direction I have never explored within time travel before, and thought it was brilliant.<br /><br />I think book is excellent for anyone who is a fan of time travel and loves to explore the idea of \\"what could have been\\" if such an event was changed. It makes you think about everyday little things that would be altered due to one thing changing and it can totally boggle your mind when you think about it.<br /><br />The only bad thing I can say about this books is that it ended... I wish it could have gone on and on. I am also happy to find out that they are planning a movie adaptation, only I hope that it does the story justice, because after all, it is a 849 page novel, and as a fan of Harry Potter and their adaptations, I know that it is hard to fit that many pages into a 2 hour longish movie. A mini-series would be ideal :) But that is just my opinion.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i really like this game because it is free and has 117 games. berry good i would recommend this to everyone who likes fun and or challenging games
B0066W1AZK|2.0|No help, so I haven't been able to castle or capture en passent. It also sometimes refuses to make legal moves.
B0012216WG|5.0|If you love satisfying American-style folk and blues rock, two of the masters still making this kind of music in the age of media-manufactured junk have come together again for the benefit of the human race. Don't miss it.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is my favorite app.  So little time in my day to read but my kindle and this app make reading my Bible everyday so effortless. When ever you have extra time check out all the different translations.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I like this app a lot. You can customize your alarm clock and it works even if your kindle is in sleep mode.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app. Now I can access any version I want with just a touch. I highly recommend it.
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is an excellent source as a dictionary and thesaurus.  The spoken pronounctuation is very helpful. I love the daily word games and short informational articles. They are very educational. I highly recommend the Farlex Dictionary for all age groups.
0375507256|1.0|It's 6 stories extremely vaguely linked told with a jump of about 30 years per story as each chapter progress. Each  book is supposedly written in the style of the era it's set in and based on the age of the person telling the story.  The books are split with the first half told forward - the as you get to the 'end' of the last time period, it reverses telling the rest of the story for each story.   As I don't read reviews ahead of reading the book I didn't know any of that.   Instead of finding it clever I found myself incredibly frustrated as each chapter ended with a cliffhanger so to speak. By the time the story reversed - I didn't care anymore as the story lost its momentum. I didn't think the changing writing styles added to the story - on the contrary I felt it took away from it.   Based on this I won't be reading anything else by this author.
0545265355|5.0|Bought for my cousin who is obsessed with this Trilogy.<br />This was the perfect gift and came in a neat box.<br />Would recommend for any Christmas or Birthday gift.
B0060ZJ74O|1.0|Beware that any DVD package that offers a digital copy that says \\"UltraViolet\\" is NOT a real digital copy.  UltraViolet is a streaming service.  You do not get a digital copy for your computer or devices.  UltraViolet does not work with iTunes or AppleTV.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the user experience/controls with UltraViolet streams is very poor.
B006GG1KOC|2.0|Not bad, but not good either. It was too easy, and could have lasted a lot longer. Maybe an update? That's if I don't delete it by then.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Put this on my Kindle Fire and it works great. Ads do pop up at the beginning, but it only happens a couple of times. Haven't had any problems with the game.
1573301183|5.0|I've owned the DVD and CD for several years now.  I view the DVD at least once a month.  It's a fantastic show.  The best ever, really.  If your a true AIC fan, and your interested in other videos of Layne and AIC performing at their best, check out on youtube this entry: Alice In Chains 1990 Seattle [full live show].  In it are songs from their Facelift album.  Layne looks young and belts out some vocals.  Very nice compliment to this DVD......
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've played this game on my PC's for years. This version on my Android phone is easily as fun and easy to play as any I have ever used. The graphics are sharp, clear, easy to read. The tap feature is sensitive and responsive. Thanks!

B0055SWM08|5.0|This is probably the best dollar I've spent on an app; it's gorgeous on the HTC Incredible and Kindle Fire and runs perfect on both
B002RKRV4Y|1.0|I read this book about 35 years ago. Then I liked it. But this translation is terrible--it's like listening to Yoda--and together with the bad punctuation it makes the text difficult to appreciate. The one star rating is for the atrocious translation.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I &lt;3 this case. It was protected well, had no scratches on it, and was brand new!!! The color is really pretty. It protects my Kindle Fire perfectly, and is not heavy at all! I recommend everyone with a Fire to get this! Good price for something wonderful!!! :D

B003ITZBVI|4.0|I honestly bought this for 2 reasons:  1. It actually (for real) follows the messed up sidekicks to Batman really are.  It shows how it's not Batman's darkness that makes a Robin go bad, but instead we get to learn that it is because of Batman's darkness that he is able to save a fallen bird. And 2. Jensen Ackles as Jason/Hood.<br /><br />The action was tight. The script was excellent. Not too much monologing, just enough backstory for even the most casual of viewer.<br /><br />Great for the tweens and the big tweens also.<br /><br />This film has great action and great voices, a little Joker, all the trappings of a great Batman movie.  Now if they could just write a live-action script like this.  It was dark and disturbing, but it was supposed to be.  Not enough to give you nightmares, just a \\"mmh\\" momemnt for older fans seeing into the psyche of the \\"Dark Knight\\".  It's worth watching again and one more time. . .
B0063IH60K|5.0|A great version of a classic game. I really like that the random setting can stump you at times. It's not always a guaranteed win. I highly recommend it!
B004DK5CYM|5.0|this was send very quickly I was pleased with the dvd.  I read the review before I bought it and they were good. If you saw the movie you will like this dvd.
6305428042|5.0|A classic Halloween flick from my childhood! Bought this DVD as a gift ... But I wanted to keep it I'll be honest
B004EPYZPS|3.0|The review from Amazon.com was spot on. The movie tries to hard to seem like it was filmed in 1979, put a filter over the camera lens for goodness sake enough with the glare. The kids in the film do a good job of acting however the generic \\"fat kid\\" gets annoying after a while. The story is pretty basic, alien escapes train wreck and tries to leave earth. Don't expect to see much of the alien creature, i would say 5 minutes of screen time tops, but the overall special effects are great and are done by Spielberg buddy ILM. If you want to watch a movie that makes you think of late 70's early 80's sci-fi then this is the movie for you.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app has good variety, and while you can buy points, it's not required. points are easy enough to score, the app practically throws them at you for doing nothing more than trying.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|Was fun to play, and more fun to play in front of my friend who didn't know what the game was. Sped through the levels so he didn't have a chance to figure it out.
B004WR125O|1.0|I have no problem with the supplier of the UWF-1.  My beef is with the product.  I'm using the adaptor with a TX-NR809 receiver.  Initially, the adaptor connected to my network and I was able to log into my Pandora account and see my playlists.  But, every time I tried to stream music, it would report a connection error.  I spent several hours troubleshooting the problem and finally called Onkyo technical support.  They ran me through a number of steps to include resetting the receiver a couple of times.  Although the adaptor IS connecting with good signal strength to my network, it just can't seem to provide ANY of the content through the NET feature.  Onkyo gave up and said they would elevate the issue and call me back.  Well, its been a week and I've not heard back from Onkyo.  Not too pleased
B0038P59A0|4.0|Great fun! And there was a decent attempt to justify Holmes' fighting abilities. The action plot is really just there to give the characters something to do while exploring the real plot which is about relationships; the disruption to the Holmes/Watson relationship most obviously, but also between the two men and their respective paramours, and between Holmes and members of the police force. That's where the real joy of the film arises and why I am eager for the next installment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I had no problems on my Kindle  Fire. Fun games. great for kids too. It helps pass the time when waiting at the Cr's office
B000021Y77|4.0|Not as complex as my ten years ago memory of it recalled, but that's not a bad thing. This is a little gem of a movie which tells its tale with economy and verve.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful app. Now I can take Gods word with me in my purse. This is a first rate tool for those who want the convenience of the 21st century along the tried and true word of God.
B0031SU2Y2|4.0|Wonderful little film about young love, and divorce, and immigration, and crushed hopes. The \\"mature\\" relationship playing in the background of the main story offers layers of perspective to consider when looking at the main story of the young immigrant.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|this app is meant for younger viewers I'm older then 5 so I beat it in like 5 min but great if ur in the car and u want to pass time
B002VECLVO|4.0|Impressive - especially for a first time director. Deep, nuanced performances; assured pacing; confidently composed shots. I'm ambivalent about the ending - not a bad choice at all, but perhaps not the most challenging choice.  This would be a great 60s flashback double featured paired with [[ASIN:B002ONC9NC An Education]].
1419702238|5.0|I had no plans whatsoever to read a kids book but my daughter brought it home from the library one day and it was sitting around for a week. So I decided, hey, why not? I have to say that the premise of a novel in a cartoon format is nothing short of brilliant. I will say that I got a huge kick out of the antics of Greg, a boy somewhere between the ages of 11 and 13. His perspective on his world and those in it is completely endearing. The author's insights into things such as popularity, growth spurts, and best friends really did take me back. In a world where kids engage is so much over-the-top inappropriateness, this back- to-basics story on kids thinking and behaving as normal kids should really hits its mark. I loved it.
B002VECM6S|4.0|Well made, well performed movie about how great it is to unexpectedly join the privileged classes. Apparent sarcasm aside, even looking at it with eyes wide open, it is a good movie.
0316056863|5.0|I have been waiting awhile to read this book. I fell in love with Tina Fey during the last presidential election in which she so brilliantly portrayed Sarah Palin. Before this, I did not at all care for Fey. I just didn't get how she was funny. Now I get it and consider myself a fan. Sometimes it's that simple. If you like Fey (as I now do) then you will probably like her book too. Fey outlines for us her humble and awkward upbringing. A child of German and Greek heritage, Fey grew up determined and headstrong. Her life was not always pretty or easy but she seems to take it all with a grain of salt. She highlights her start in local theater, then improvisational theater for which she found her calling, to writing for Saturday Night Live, ending with her stint in front of SNL's cameras as the new Weekend Update correspondent. From there, she made her way into sitcom writing, development, and acting with her much lauded show 30 Rock. She can now add book author/biographer to her resume. At first I didn't quite get that this was supposed to be a biography because it's unusual in its format. Purists may have a problem with this, I decided to go with it because today, everyone, their mother, and their long lost cousin has a story to tell and it all seems to get published. I believe that in Fey's case, the idea of writing her own story was probably presented to her again and again because people actually want to know. She remains one of the most well-rounded people in show business. She tells her story in a laugh out loud funny way with plenty of irony and just the right amount of tempered sarcasm thrown in. She honestly makes me feel better about that endless annoying list of things we all hate most in life. Her book reminds us all to not take ourselves too seriously, not because no one else is either, but because to experience real freedom we just can't afford to.

B006JPS1OM|5.0|I've only just finished the first chapter of this game and already I am loving it. I'm hoping that the other chapters are just as intriguing. I don't doubt it. Good work, where can I get more games like these?
0060833459|5.0|Note: Amazon continues to feature reviews of earlier editions. What immediately follows is my review of the 50th anniversary edition published today, January 24, 2017.  What then follows is my review of an earlier edition.<br />*  *  *<br /><br />This is the 50th anniversary edition of a book first published in 1967. Jim Collins provides the Foreword and Zachary First the Afterword. In my opinion, Peter Drucker (1909-2005) is the most influential business thinker as indicated by the endless list of other thought leaders who continue to acknowledge his value and significance to their own work. He always insisted on referring to himself as a “student” or “bystander.” With all due respect to his wishes, I have always viewed him as a pioneer who surveyed and defined dimensions of the business world that no one else had previously explored.<br /><br />Consider this passage in the Foreword: “Here are ten lessons I learned from Peter Drucker and this book, and that I offer as a small portal of entry into the mind of the greatest management thinker off all time.” These are the lessons that Collins cites and discusses:<br /><br />1. First, manage thyself.<br />2. Do what you’re made for.<br />3. Work how you work best (and let others do the same).<br />4. Count your time, and make it count.<br />5. Prepare better meetings.<br />6. Don’t make a hundred decisions when one will do.<br />7. Find your one big distinctive impact.<br />8. Stop what you would not start.<br />9. Run lean.<br />10. Be useful.<br /><br />“He was in the end, Collins adds, &#34;the highest level of what a teacher can be: a role model of the very ideas he taught, a walking testament to his teachings in the tremendous lasting effect of his own life.”<br /><br />As was true of Collins and will be true 0f everyone else who reads one of the several editions, they will have their own take-aways. Drucker provides a framework in the Introduction, stressing while discussing the importance of eight specific practices that all great business and non-profit CEOs are committed to, such as asking “What needs to be done?” and “What is right for the enterprise?” The first two enable them to obtain the information they need.<br /><br />The next four help them to convert this knowledge into effective action:<br /><br />3. Develop action plans.<br />4. Take responsibility for decisions [and their consequences].<br />5. Take responsibility for communicating.<br />6. Are focused on opportunities rather on problems.<br /><br />The last two ensure that the entire organization feels responsible and accountable<br /><br />7. Run productive meetings.<br />8. Think and feel “we” rather than “I.”<br /><br />Yes, these are basic and obvious practices but they were not five decades ago. Until Drucker, thinking about management lacked order, structure, clarity, and focus. Borrowing a phrase from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Drucker developed thinking about management to “the other side of complexity.” To paraphrase, Albert Einstein, Drucker made management “as simple as possible but no simpler.”<br /><br />In the Introduction Peter Drucker concludes, “We’ve just covered eight practices of effective executives. I’m going to throw in one final, bonus practice. This one’s so important that I’ll elevate it to the level of a rule: [begin italics] Listen first, speak last [end italics]”...And, like every discipline, effectiveness [begin italics] can [end italics] and [begin italics] must [end italics] be earned.”<br /><br />The title of this review is a portion of one of Peter Drucker's most important insights: &#34;The most serious mistakes are not being made as a result of wrong answers. The true dangerous thing is asking the wrong question.&#34;<br /><br />*  *  *<br /><br />I first read this book when it was originally published in 1967 and have since re-read it several times because, in my opinion, it provides some of Peter Drucker's most important insights on how to &#34;get the right work done and done the right way.&#34; By nature an &#34;executive&#34; is one who &#34;executes,&#34; producing a desired result (an &#34;effect&#34;) that has both impact and value. As Drucker once observed in an article that appeared in Harvard Business Review at least 40 years ago, &#34;There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.&#34; Therefore, the effective executive must develop sound judgment. Difficult - sometimes immensely difficult - decisions must be made. Here are eight practices that Drucker recommended 45 years ago:<br /><br />o  Ask, &#34;what needs to be done?&#34;<br />o  Ask, &#34;What is right for the enterprise?&#34;<br />o  Develop an action plan<br />o  Take responsibility for decisions.<br />o  Take responsibility for communications.<br />o  Focus on opportunities rather than on problems.<br />o  Conduct productive meetings.<br />o Think in terms of first-person PLURAL pronouns (&#34;We&#34; rather than &#34;I&#34;).<br /><br />The first two practices give executives the knowledge they need; the next four help them convert this knowledge into effective action; the last two ensure that the entire organization feels responsible and accountable, and will thus be more willing to become engaged. &#34;I'm going to throw in one final, bonus practice. This one's so important that I'll elevate it to the level of a rule: [begin italics] Listen first, speak last.&#34; [end italics]<br /><br />This volume consists of eight separate but interdependent essays that begin with &#34;Effectiveness Can Be Learned&#34; and conclude with &#34;Effective Decisions.&#34; Actually, there is a &#34;Conclusion&#34; in which Drucker asserts that &#34;Effectiveness Must Be Learned.&#34; I agree. The essays are arranged in a sequence that parallels a learning process that prepares an executive to &#34;assume responsibility, rather than to act the subordinate, satisfied only if he `pleases the boss.' In focusing himself and his vision on contribution the executive, in other words, has to think through purposes and ends rather than means alone.&#34;<br /><br />I highly recommend this to all executives who need an easy-to-read collection of reminders of several basic but essential insights from one of the most important business thinkers, Peter Drucker. I also presume to suggest that they, in turn, urge each of their direct reports to obtain a copy and read it. The last time I checked, Amazon sells a paperbound edition for only $11.55.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|Besides the series being outstanding, the DVD includes special features that really give you an idea of the amazing work this production has been doing to achive the success they have today. MILLION LIKES!
B002NS2HBM|5.0|Just wanted to say thanks!  I got the set for my daughter for Christmas used.  A couple of the seasons had not even been opened and the set came very very fast.  Originally it was noted the item might not get to me by Christmas, but it came in just a few days!  Thanks so much!
B004QK5N5W|5.0|It works on my ipad2 with several apps including Netflix and YouTube. It mirrors the screen and HDMI is amazing. I've been using for more than 2 months without a problem and it is of good quality. Works like a charm.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game was alright because it had alot of miny games and you can unlock any of them. Alot of them were fun
B005TPCQ5I|5.0|I have nothing to say, other then the acting was surprisingly good and I found the characters very likable. I cared about them. I enjoyed following them on their journey. I was quite surprised, pleasantly surprised. It's well worth renting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it aether I'm racing  my friend to beet my to beet the score to just passing time. I almost unlocked all them!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app! its lots of fun and doesn't even need Internet! I only wish each game came with instructions. so short and sweet I give this 4 stars.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Every time there is an update to the Android stock keyboard, I check it out, but I always end up going back to Swiftkey. This has happened with both Gingerbread and now Ice Cream Sandwich. Once you get used to how accurately Swiftkey predicts your next word, you cannot live without this functionality!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app and now I'm studying a lot more thanks to the YouVersion bible. everybody should download this app and the best thing about it is it's free!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|the games are bad! ! they are ok but the controlls are bad most games are ok. they do give u points for random thing
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I have read this book twice and also seen the Video.  Enjoyed them all even though they brought back some memories.  We never had a maid when I was growing up, so I never saw the attitudes protrayed by the white mistresses in the story.  But the schools were segregated and the town separated by the railroad tracks.  There was proverty and hard times on both sides.  This book does not address this.  Perhaps the authoress would like to write another one from that view point.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a fairly decent game so far, although some of the games are stupid, and all of the ads are really annoying to let people get points
0307891372|4.0|The game comes on a regular DVD.  The guide is the size of a phone book (remember them?) from a medium sized town.  It has so much information it's possible to get as lost in it as in the game itself.  There are plenty of wikis and Youtube videos out there that might save you the price of the guide, if you want two devices going at once.  But I'm Old School.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy this game. Some are harder than others.  It is lots of fun.  You should try it too!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is time consuming and very fun. the games vary way to much in difficulty. but over all it is a good game
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love to play. I downloaded this app to my kindle fire and it was very easy to play! I will definitely download any Mobility apps!

B005I6EU7U|5.0|Beautiful cover that works great for my Kindle Fire. The detailing is very nice and the case holds my Fire perfectly. Seems to be very well made. I hope to enjoy it for a long time.
0307593312|5.0|Not as good as HARD-BOILED WONDERLAND AND THE END OF THE WORLD (but how many novels are?), 1Q84 has a mesmerizing flow and the author delves very deeply into the psychology of his characters.  Could it have been edited down into a shorter work?  Certainly, but for what purpose?  Vastly superior to Murakami's previous effort, AFTER DARK.  4.5 stars would be a more accurate rating.  (There are a few ambiguously translated passages).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|As a Pastor and Bible teacher, this app makes going between translations a breeze.  I can also teach in English but let others hear scripture in their own language!
B006GG1KOC|4.0|One of the most important cognitive functions humans perform is that of finding patterns in seemingly random datum sets. This is so critical, it is one of the first tasks a child starts learning.<br /><br />This app is great in theory, as it helps a young child (2-5) with developing these skills. Any practice a child gets in this critical period should be welcomed with applause. Additionally, a child that young isn't typically using technology alone, which is the second major advantage. Anytime a parent gets involved in her/his child's learning, there are numerous benefits to both involved.<br /><br />There were only two major problems I found with the game. First was the developer's significant lack of knowledge regarding child development. Generally children this age can discriminate in such categories as color, food groups, letters/numbers, etc. They DON'T know (usually) the animal classifications, nor would they typically know the difference between a planet and a satellite.<br /><br />Second, there should be an ascending order of difficulty to the items. There doesn't seem to be any rationale for the different levels, except that a level may only have four questions. (Great understanding of a preschooler's attention span!) If the level of complexity increased VERY gradually with the levels, more of the complaints might be addressed.<br /><br />Finally, I learned one can never under estimate the intelligence of the average person. After reading these reviews regularly, I'm learning the same is true for the emotional level and ability to view the world from another's perspective. What a sad statement.
B005V1WVPA|5.0|This album is a little different their rest & I love every song on it. I have been playing it in VERY heavy rotation on my computer & in my car. I'm either in /on one or the other pretty much all day everyday.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|i wanted to buy a cheap microphone with at least normal quality to record music on my PC. i was afraid that for 20 bucks it was impossible to purchase a good mic, but i gave it a shot and i'm more than excited. i connected this mic to pc via integrated sound card, nothing special, used XLR To mini 3.5 jack. i can both record my voice and also hear it's live sound during singing. i definitely recommend this product.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Games are a great time killer.  Most are simple enough to beat on the first or second run through.  Runs great on Kindle Fire.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is the perfect companion to the Kindle fire! It doesn't make the fire seem any larger like other cases might. It's the perfect fit which doesn't change the overall profile of the device yet protects it.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|If it was about three times longer and kept track of your stats, it'd be worth a buck. It needs to show what you got wrong, why it was wrong, how many tries it took, how long it took to complete each level, and overall time. Seems this is some that NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND crap; why else would scoring be absent? Still, the game is well presented, a great learning tool, and would likely take a three-year-old a couple of hours to solve.
B006VRZ5YM|4.0|As long as you do not start watching this movie expecting Notting Hill, it is a nice romantic comedy, perfectly predictable but entertaining and enjoyable. Chris Evans is a great co-lead, and although I am usually not a fan of Anna Farris, she was actually watchable in this movie.  This is a movie that does not take itself too seriously - approach it in the same way and enjoy.
B0055SWM08|4.0|fun game with relaxing music and some challenging puzzles that make you think the way out through. I really like the graphics of this game.
0786915749|5.0|The book that started it all for me. I absolutely love the dragonlance series and have read very few subpar books from the world (I've ready roughly 45+ full books). I still look back on the days when I first read this trilogy fondly, the characters, action, and story really come together to make this an enjoyable read that I just couldn't put down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game has a bunch of sweet minigames in it and challenges you to buy more games with the points you earn from completing other games
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun to play.  Easy too.  Play every day. Create your own settings for more or less competetive play even change the Color and designs.  Fast moving.
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|To be frank, this movie was a little boring and anti-climactic.<br />Hereafter follows the lives of three people who have experienced death in different ways: an American man who has the psychic ability to see departed loved ones, a French woman who momentarily died from drowning, and an English boy who lost his identical twin brother in an accident.<br />While the movie started out very engaging with a tragic tsunami scene, it slowed down afterward and never picked back up. And waiting for the three stories to intertwine was long and tedious. The stories are interesting, but not enough. Matt Damon, C&eacute;cile De France, and the McLaren brothers do a good job of carrying this movie on their shoulders, but not enough to save it from its dull resolution. There was a definite lack of payoff when it was all over.<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert**<br />I have to admit that the dead little boy was kind of a jerk. He seemed nice while alive, but then became mean-spirited once he passed on. His brother searches for a way to connect with him for most of the film, and when he finally does, the only thing his brother can say is don't touch my hat, you can't rely on me anymore, and goodbye. Jerk.<br />And I was really upset at the idea that it was mere coincidence that the boy's losing his hat in the subway saved his life. I was happy with the thought that the ghost brother knocked it off his head as the act of a guardian angel to keep him from getting on the train. But then we find out that the ghost brother knocked it off the boy's head because he was mad that he was wearing it and that the boy missing the train was just a happy coincidence. Lame. Again, jerk of a brother.<br />And what was with the random flash of a kiss between Damon and France? If they were trying to establish the idea that Damon can touch France without seeing visions, we already get that with the handshake and lack of visions when they first meet up in the street after the flash. The scene was completely random and unnecessary. And weird, too.<br />**End Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />Overall, the film was a bit bland. The end.<br /><br />As far as questionable content:<br />There is a tsunami scene in which several people are engulfed in water that can be a bit traumatic, and there is a scene where a little boy is hit by a car and smashes into a car windshield with some blood splatter. He is afterward lying on the ground with blood running from his head.<br /><br />[...]too.  **End Spoiler Alert**    Overall, the film was a bit bland. The end.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|Brilliantly produced DVD.  I highly recommend buying this DVD.  This is a classic to own and watch many times over and still feel all emotions that are portrayed by this timeless classic.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|To begin, this was a hard review to write. I've only seen the movie once and I went in with so many preconceptions that I will likely have to sit down and watch the movie again to get a real feel for the film and how much I like it. I saw it a while ago, but needed time to think it over a bit before spreading my thoughts before you.<br />Second part to The Deathly Hallows and conclusion to one of the biggest film franchises in history, Part 2 follows Harry, Hermione, and Ron as they search out the last Voldemort horcruxes and try to stop an impending attack on Hogwarts.<br />I certainly found this film refreshing and a lot more enjoyable than the slow and awkward [[ASIN:B001UV4XI8 Part 1]]. While the first film had some enjoyable moments - our heroes breaking into the Ministry of Magic - it didn't add much to the film series. This film on the other hand delivered a great deal of satisfaction to any Harry Potter fan. The story moved along at a very pleasing pace and I was engaged throughout the entire film. There was enough spell-casting and wand fights taking place in this movie to appease any magic-lover. The resolution of each character's story was satisfying and everything led to a gratifying end. The performance of the actors was very good, the special effects were incredible, and I feel the series finished with a powerful bang.<br />Still, while there was much that was good in the film, there were a few things that needed some more attention. First, I was sad that Nicholas Hooper - composer for [[ASIN:B000W7GFG4 Order of the Phoenix]] and [[ASIN:B000ZELISO Half-Blood Prince]] - was not in charge of the musical score for these last two films. His music for parts 5 and 6 was spot-on and added a great deal of depth and emotion to each film. I felt that his work on this film could have been an excellent contribution to the overall impact of the series end.<br />Second, while it was a great jolt to see the deaths of some of our favorite characters, I felt the film did not do their deaths enough justice in this movie. The revelation of their deaths was a shock, but the film moved on too quickly for us to get a full blow of knowing these characters are gone. I little more hang time and emotion with each death would have made for a more intense and growing despair and an overall greater triumph in the end.<br />Overall, the film was very enjoyable and rewarding. Definitely worth the time and money. Thus ends a great franchise.<br /><br />As far as questionable content:<br />The film had some pretty violent moments and it certainly earns its PG-13 rating. I would not recommend the film for youngsters as it would be a little too scary.<br /><br />[...]deaths enough justice in this movie.

0307891372|5.0|Buying the game guide was heavily encouraged by the store where the game was purchased.  It's very detailed.  The game can be played without the guide, but it makes it much easier with it.  The price on Amazon was way cheaper than in the store, if you could even find it.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|For most people, you either loved this film, or you completely despised it. As for me, there were things that I loved about this film, and things that I didn't care for. Cloverfield follows several twenty-somethings as they try to escape a city being attacked by a giant Godzilla-like creature.<br />I think that this film was a landmark in motion picture history in two ways. The first landmark is how they campaigned for the film. It was brilliant. Successfully keeping this movie in the dark, they released a trailer that showed us very little and only had a date instead of a title. People who looked up this date online found a website that only had a couple pictures. From here, the advertisers used a number of techniques to publicize the film and pique audiences' interest. The main website would be updated occasionally with pictures that gave clues about the stories. Several of the characters had MySpace pages and online video blogs. There were several fake news and business websites created to help give further background to the story. All in all, it was an amazing form of advertising that got audiences excited for the film and accounted for a great deal of profit that the studio could not have made any other way.<br />The second landmark is the way they filmed the movie. This is where most audience members grew to hate the film. The movie was filmed as if we saw everything from a handheld camera being used by one of the characters. This added a great deal of realism and believability to the story where we felt like we were watching a YouTube-like video of an actual event. But this also meant that there was a lot of camera-shake in the process and anyone who had motion-sickness did not make it far into the movie. While it's true that [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]] started the hand-held technique, I believe it was this film that showed the true potential and effectiveness of filming in this form. It was this film that started the hand-held craze and later inspired other films like [[ASIN:B001MVYUR0 Quarantine]] and [[ASIN:B002VKE1K2 Paranormal Activity]].<br />Aside from that, the movie itself wasn't all that good. The movie echoed Godzilla a lot, so we felt like we had seen this film a dozen times before. There was really nothing to new to see. Another thing that bothered me was the lack of background story in the film. A lot of the background information was covered in the campaign sites for the film, but if you never looked at any of those, you were left with a lot of questions.<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert**<br />Apparently, - and they don't tell you this in the film anywhere - the object landing in the ocean at the end of the film was a failed satellite that crashed to the earth and awoke a monster that had been hibernating underwater for thousands of years. The monster was supposed to be a baby looking for its mother.<br />**End Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />Overall, the movie was a good thrill ride with lots of good special effects and scares, but not good enough to be seen over and over again.<br /><br />As far as questionable content:<br />There is some violent monster mayhem, a couple of gore moments (one person is attacked by a monster and some blood sprays on the camera; a person explodes behind a curtain; one character is chewed up in the monster's mouth) and some profanity throughout the film.<br /><br />[...]ed other films like [[ASIN:B001MVYUR0 Quarantine]] and [[ASIN:B002VKE1K2 Paranormal Activity]].

0439023521|4.0|I first heard of this book a couple years ago and the things I've heard haven't changed since. Once I read it, I knew why. The book has the perfect amount of depth for adults, teenagers, and children to understand. It's enjoyable for readers at every level. Katniss is a stong, independent protagonist struggling to figure out her true feelings about the boys in her life while still battling. Though the circumstances seem far fetched, Katniss is relatable, as are most of the characters. The life they live in Panem seems eerily plausible. I couldn't put the book down. Every chapter seemed to end with another hook. The action didn't dominate the book as one would expect from reading the back cover, but instead included a stable balance. Afterwards, you'll be begging for the second book in this magnificent trilogy.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|I have always thought that movies based on Philip K. Dick stories ([[ASIN:B000JMK6LW A Scanner Darkly]], [[ASIN:B000TGJ8CQ Next]], [[ASIN:B0001NBNDY Paycheck]]) have always been translated into film really well - some better than others ([[ASIN:B000UBMWG4 Blade Runner]], [[ASIN:B00005JL78 Minority Report]]). While not my favorite adaptation, this film was a great thriller and enjoyable watch.<br />The story is about David Norris (Matt Damon) , a young and popular congressman, who one day meets a beautiful and mysterious woman (Emily Blunt) and falls head-over-heels for her, only to discover that there are strange circumstances that arise to keep them apart.<br />Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's on-screen chemistry is awesome. Both played their characters really well and both seemed to play off of each other even better. If nothing else draws you into this movie, the relationship between these two will. Matt Damon is just an awesome actor. Period.<br />As with most other Philip Dick stories, the plotline is very mind-bending and supernatural. The story progresses extremely well and leads up to a satisfying climax. Many people were disengaged by the conclusion of the film, and while I thought that it could have been solved better, I was still contented with how it ended and enjoyed the ride getting there. The content could have been delved into a little further and I would have liked to know more about what happened to some of the other characters in the film, but there was nothing that put me off in this film. It was a fun flick and I recommend it if you're in the mood for a good thriller.<br /><br />As far as questionable content:<br />There is some swearing throughout, including two strong uses of the F-word, and a brief sex scene in which you don't see anything below the shoulders.<br /><br />[...]
B000002L3P|5.0|This was a Christmas present and turned out to be exactly what the person wanted.  I was very impressed with how quickly the product was shipped to my home.  Of course it was in perfect condition.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app, no matter what anybody else says its extremely fun. Thanks for the heads up to not update loosing all progress would blow lmfao. I highly recommend this game if your down to play a variety of different games, to kill down time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|dealt pretty cool, but I think the prices for the games could be a little lower but again, awesome, pretty awesome
B002ZG980U|5.0|Love a great bargain! Good movie at a good price. Doesn't always happen on Amazon but this time it did.
B004FOA84A|2.0|I really enjoy these types of games, but I'm sadly disappointed!! :-( It's incredibly short! I was expecting, since it costs a dollar, that it would be more challenging and Much longer than the free games like this. I finished it in around 45 minutes, which is fast. It was Not worth my money... Disappointed...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is ok. it sucks that you have to play so many games of the same type to unlock more games that are medioker.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app! the little minigames are actually really fun and addicting. I wasn't expecting that. good quality for a free app is rare.
B005TZFYNE|4.0|There are some good tracks up front (the raunchy, upbeat ones), but the second half doesnt have much to offer other than some mediocre slow jams. Obviously you have the two singles \\"We Found Love\\" and \\"You Da One,\\" and there are a couple other bangers on there.    \\"Talk That Talk\\" ft Jay Z (the title track) is about to blow up.  Believe me, we are gonna be hearing this one on the radio a while.. so much energy, so much swagger!  Jay an Ri know how to do it.  Saying \\"Cockiness\\" is suggestive is a bit of a stretch; saying \\"Birthday Cake\\" is suggestive is a downright lie - but that is what makes them both awesome!  Anyway, they both have some pretty solid beats.  The only problem is that for some reason they cut off Birthday Cake before it is even half over - it just fades off like it is a sample.  This happens on both my hard copy CD, and also on Amazon's digital download.. I have heard full tracks from other sources online, so I am pretty sure this is some sort of a mistake.  Too bad because it really leaves you wanting more! Then again, maybe that's the point...  The last standout is \\"Drunk on Love\\" which samples \\"Intro\\" by the xx.  I LOVE that song too begin with, so I was automatically drawn to this track.  It's not quite as epic as the original with its cannon-like bass blasts, but RiRi's more synthesized version still hits a good spot - especially after it builds up all the way!  I have listened to the album a few times, and cant really remember anything about the last three tracks which probably says enough on its own.  I am fine paying $4.99 for the hard CD, but I would have been disappointed if I had paid anymore than that.  I would say its a 3.5, but based off of \\"Talk That Talk\\" alone, I will round it up.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|This was such a good investment for my Kindle Fire!  I love the color and the durability.  It was very easy to put on my Kindle Fire.  I highly recommend this product for Kindle Fire users!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! Bought free version only to find out only about 10 games are unlocked. Have to play games I don't like before I can buy the other 91 games!!! Games are bought with points earned in games already unlocked. Glad I didn't pay for this!!!!
B0043XX7VE|5.0|Great Movie for everyone to watch. We can't wait for the next one (hopefully). The minions make the movie.  The shorts are Ok, but not worth extra $

B004I8WD6E|4.0|This case is great, this is a plastic case and its flexible so you have to put your phone in it. It is not that hard to twist and turn, but even though its flexible it keeps its shape and when I placed my Iphone in there it fitted just right. The phone is totally covered the protector goes around the front so you can place it screen down and the screen would not touch the surface. The cut outs for the camera/flash, speakers/cable port, volume, and headphone jack are perfect. The screen protector is good too fits great on the phone as well. The only thing that I am worried about its that the pattern of the circles are through the inside of the case so I am hoping they don't leave the marks on the phone. I guess I will come back in a month or two and let everyone know if it marked the back of my phone or not. I guess a cheap plastic back protector can save the phone from getting marked. By the way I bought this for my IPhone 4S 16GB Black for AT&T.

0316067598|1.0|After 4 weeks still no book. I would give zero stars if possible.Will not be ordering from them again. Also why does amazon require you to wait so long to be able to file a claim?
B004FOOQV6|5.0|This app works well on my Kindle Fire.  There is a lot of flexibility concerning display options and measurement units.  Conversions are dynamically made as you enter values, without delay.  Three different measurements can be displayed at the same time.  To enter a measurement, you click on the display area for the unit type.  Reversing the direction of conversion is simple and quick; you merely click on the display area for the other unit type and start typing the value.  This app is well designed to be easy to use, with much flexibility.

B005XO9B6M|5.0|I absolutely love this vinyl. It was a Christmas gift for my fiance and truly a gift for me as well. I have had the pleasure of seeing Trombone Shorty perform twice, my fiance three times, and we seriously need to give it up to him. I know some may just be coming to hear his sounds for the first time, but he has been making great sounds for some time. As greatness gets more magnified, so does exposure. You can now hear his trombone over the Nikon commercial with Ashton Kutcher and he just performed the national anthem this past nfl football game. These are minor things, yet I can see how he will be a more household name soon.   Vinyl releases a little bit more of the grittiness of his sounds...I highly recommend this purchase.

1401232590|2.0|The real tragedy of this title is not the weak, contrived ending nor the bizarre and pointless parade of Batman's Rogue Gallery . . . it's that Sale and Loeb could have really put together a fantastic Batman mystery if they'd been pressed to.  Let me start off that Sale's artwork tends to be a little polarizing. People love it or they hate it, and it is very stylized. I enjoyed the moody, noir feeling Sale's deep shadows and muted colors evoke, I enjoyed the architecture of Gotham, and there were many splash pages that were artistically satisfying. Some weak anatomy and draftsmanship mistakes conveniently blacked out by a dramatic shadow are hardly unique to Tim Sale, and credit must be given where it's due. The Long Halloween has some very well-drawn pages and panels.  Loeb, on the other hand, really wastes the opportunity to write a beefy, 300+ page Batman mystery - something many writers would eat their own word processors to have the opportunity to do - by slathering his narrative with tired Godfather references, cliche Mafia tropes, and a hackneyed, clumsy mystery resolution that comes out of nowhere and makes no sense in the context of the story. I get the sense that Loeb was really into writing his mystery, but kept running into plot holes and lulls in the story that he had no idea how to work through . . . and that he wrote the ending before he wrote the story. His attempt to dove-tail his 'surprise' killer's motivations and drives with the slow and meandering narrative of his mystery is almost embarrassing to wade through. It's like having to watch a stand-up comedian bomb on stage . . . for almost 400 pages.  Sadly, the build-up to the reveal is actually interesting, the interest in the killer's identity grows as the story unfolds. The Harvey Dent sub-plot, while predictable and very cookie-cutter Batman story-telling, is nevertheless solid and holds up as the tale progresses. But the ending, the mystery resolution and the steps that lead to it are so badthat they overshadow and eclipse the aspects of the book that succeed at what they try to do.  The Long Halloween is a decent enough read if you don't want to think too critically about the story and/or attempt to solve the mystery before the characters do. Sale's artwork is well worth seeing, although it's quality is a topic of subjectivity. But if you're in the mood for a meatier, more cerebral treatment of Gotham's Dark Knight . . . you won't find it here.

B003Y5H53S|5.0|I am so upset that I missed this one at the theater! The quality of the animation of 'Rango' is top notch and looks brilliant on a HD screen. The story line is a bit quirky to start with, but if you stick with it, you'll soon see the reasoning and appreciate where and how this story unfolds. With an engaging story line, 'Rango' invokes everything from 'Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas' to 'China Town' with many nods to countless westerns and other action pictures ('Apocalypse Now' included!) The movie also manages pays tribute to the icon of westerns, Clint Eastwood. I though the language was a bit harsh for the under 12 set (hell and damn are still considered cursing, right?) There are also a few inuendoes that hopefully sail right over the heads of the youngsters (no wonder this has a PG rating). If you enjoy animation, 'Rango'  is a must-have![[ASIN:B003Y5H53S Rango]]

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book!  It kept my interest fully and I didn't want to put it down, always wanting to find out what was coming next.  Even my husband, who I have ever only seen read 1 other book for pleasure, couldn't put it down.  We are now on to \\"Catching Fire\\" and can't wait for the movie to come out, hopefully not too much is lost when they put it on the big screen.

0385333846|3.0|Slaughterhouse Five is, in effect, an autobiography of Kurt Vonnegut's time during the World War Two. However, Vonnegut tries to put his own satirical spin on his life by creating the awkward, little soldier, Billy Pilgrim. Here's the real twist: Billy is unstuck in time. That is, he is able to perceive every moment of his life from any point in time. As if that's not confusing enough, Billy has no control over his visions. This creates a story that goes back and forth through flashbacks and flashforewards, creating a story so knotted up within itself that even the reader will lose all sense of what time it's supposed to be in the book.   The book seems to be intended to bring to light the Fire-Bombing of Dresden, an event many Americans would rather leave forgotten. However, the Fire-bombing, while hinted at throughout the book, only occurs near the very end, and even then, it seems that Billy's own emotions and stresses resulting from excessive time travel take the main focus of the book.   If you're into dark humor, confusing and intricate storylines, and rather depressing events, then this is the book for you! If, however, you'd rather turn your frown upside down, I suggest reading something else. For the tragic, yet grimly humorous and ironic tale of Billy Pilgrim and the Fire-bombing of Dresden doesn't exactly make for a giddy and gleeful read.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|exactly what it says it is.  good clean fun for kids. nice to have games that are educational for the little oneso and keep them busy too.
B000002USN|4.0|I was among the lucky ones who experienced Sinatra live - The Ultimate Event in 1989 and the Diamond Jubilee Tour of 1991.<br /><br />And what I witnessed was an artist.... an actor...  \\"It Was A Very Good Year\\" might have been appropriate title to say how he was ....<br /><br />Sinatra told us in 1991: \\"I hope you all live to be 150 years old and the last voice you`ll here.... is MINE - SKÅL\\".... He had a wink in his eyes.... as a matter of fact... he made all of us like the guy next to him in a bar and he told us saloon stories through his songs...<br /><br />By 1991 Ava, Sammy, Peter, JFK were all gone and Dino was to follow in 1995.<br /><br />He ended up by traveling alone...<br /><br />This shows in these recordings....<br /><br />He used his voice as an actor.... as an old man....  still charismatic.... still with great dignity.... selling his songs, but by now with a different reading.... with more depth....<br /><br />He glowed on stage that man...<br /><br />And when it was announced he was to release a Duets album in 1993 I was spellbound... Still am...<br /><br />Diva Streisand I have to say - is a real show-off here and comes out as elboing the man out of the limelight.<br /><br />Highlights are the ones with Tony Bennett, Liza Minnelli, Aretha Franklin, Bono, Kenny G and Anita Baker...<br /><br />These recordings are of the highest value - making a statement of how the Great man was in the early 1990s...<br /><br />Listening at the Duets cd`s today I am still spellbound by his magic, his interpretations, some duetpartners(not all mind you) and the great orchestrations....
0525478817|5.0|No book I have ever read has caused me to feel as deeply as this one did. The only others that managed to come even close were Mr. Green's other works. The emotions are visceral, they're real, they're heartbreaking and they are so. Very. Beautiful. I cannot praise it highly enough, there aren't strong enough words in the English language.
B005HSL626|5.0|it is slot of fun i could not stop playing it i even got my brother playing and we never like the same things i would recommend this to any one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I honestly didn't even think about reading this book until I saw a movie was going to be released soon.  I had read reviews and saw that it had a near five star average, but I still didn't think to read it.  Finally I decided to spend the $4 or so and download it to my Kindle.  Well, that was a good idea.  I could barely put the Kindle down, and I took every available minute to read.  This is the type of book that, for me, made everything else fade away.  Normally if I had a free hour in the evening when my kids were at basketball or dance practice I would catch up on my DVR'd shows.  Not when I was reading The Hunger Games.  If I had 10 minutes to myself, I was powering up the device and finding a quiet corner of the house.  This book is so easy to read, and maybe it's due in part to the fact that it's a young adult book.  But, more than anything, the characters, especially those of Katniss and Peeta are so well done.  The first half of the book is the lead up to the Games themselves, but during that time I came to know Katniss and understand her feelings towards Peeta, Haymitch, and her left-at-home friend Gale.  Her love towards her little sister, Prim, whose place she took in the Games, is palpable.  Being a young adult book, the violence described during the Games was a bit surprising.  However, I wouldn't keep my older kids of 10 and 9 from reading it.  As a matter of fact, I will most likely pick up a paperback copy and have them read it so we can all see the movie together.  I look forward to reading the other two books of the trilogy.  I'm anxious to read more about the lives of Katniss, Peeta, and all the folks of Panem.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty amazing. the games which are provided are not the best but they pass the time I feel its a worthy download
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Its been 2 years old now but Im here just to say this one really passed the test of time, what a amazing collection of songs!  Dark, beautiful, great lyrics and amazing harmonies from Jerry and Willian.  Its a must buy if you are looking for a good Rock/Alternative release. Its not a nostalgia thing, this is real, here and now: 2012.  New album is being created in this moment, and I cant wait!
B00000J0O2|1.0|Cartridge supplied was *very* old - well past it's shelf life but I only found out after it dumped a load of toner into my previously pristine and perfectly working printer.  Not entirely sure of the actual cause of this but most likely due to the toner appearing caked to the ends of the roller and perhaps messing up the way that the toner is normally released.    After reading one reviewer's comment that the cartridge they had received was over 9 years old I researched how to find the date of manufacture for HP cartridges online.  What I found was there is a 6 character code beginning with a number followed by a letter.  The important bit is the first digit which is the last digit of the year.  In my case the code was 3B... meaning the cartridge was made in February 2003!   That's almost 9 years old!    A search online (including HP) suggests a shelf life of 2.5 years!  I don't think vendors should be selling cartridges that are past their shelf life.  So, in trying to save some money, and purchasing a cartridge that was not advertised as \\"9 year old cartridge that we probably bought for fractions of a penny on the dollar and selling to you for what appears to be just a reasonable price\\" I've ended up probably ruining a perfectly good printer.   In conclusion, there *may* be sellers who are genuinely offering a good deal on genuine HP cartridges, but my advise is to check the date code before installing and consider carefully if you want to proceed or request a refund if you think you have been sold \\"New but past the recommended shelf life\\" instead!
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Agree, this movie is one of the best movies, if not the best. Makes u realize people who are in jail are humans too. Some innocent, some who cant cope with the real life out in the world. I'm a female, and I know women will love this movie as much as men do.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|your under the age 3. Its like the games on the back of cereal boxes were you compare two pictures. I can see how this might be fun for kids. If you have a 2 or three year old child then this game is for you, I mean your child.   I beat the game in about five minutes and if your board and just want to try and beat five minutes than download this game and try although you'll get board with in minutes
B005KELQEU|5.0|I wanted a sleeve for my Kindle Touch.  I figured a sleeve is a sleeve and why spend a lot of money on a sleeve.  So, I bought this one because it was one of the least expensive sleeves that Amazon was selling.  When I recieved it, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was a well made high quality sleeve and probably just as good as some of the sleeves that are selling on Amazon for twice as much.  I'm very pleased with this product.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great & intriguing story,Sets up characters well, lots of action, suspense, excitement, futuristic story. I kind of saw where it was heading, but after a few surprises it still  kept me entertained till the very end and sets up very well for book #2. You won't be disappointed with The Hunger Games!<br /><br />The Hunger Games are about the future, where there is 12 districts of Panem (the new world in North America) Each district gets a boy & girl picked to fight for his or her life in the The Hunger Games. It happens once a year, \\"The Capital\\" puts on this event to keep the districts in fear and prevent an uprising. Character must fight for her life, while maintaining dignity and hope for a better future!

0307593312|5.0|I loved this book -- every page. I wish it would have been longer! It's only 944 pages.  My only complaint just involves the production: The cover is great, the part openings are striking -- perfect for the book -- but the typesetting SUCKS. It doesn't bottom out evenly on left and right pages; some pages have several more lines of text than others -- it's a mess. Knopf should fire their typesetters!  But the story was WONDERFUL -- it's one of those stories that stays with you and affects you for a while, especially as you see a sunset, or a paper moon hanging in the sky in the afternoon....

1250004217|4.0|Sarah's Key was a good book; a page turner which kept the reader hooked.  Tatiani De Rosnay's narrative was told in two voices.  The most intriguing was that of Sarah, a young Jewish girl who thought she was the cause of her little brother's death after he was left/hidden in a closet during occupied France - all because she had the 'key'.  The other protagonist was Julia Jarmond, a journalist and an American by birth who lives in modern day Paris with her husband and daughter.<br /><br />Through Julia we learn of Sarah's heart-breaking personal story, and of the tragedy of war that gripped Parisians, many of whom became informants to the Germans who awarded them with the 'spoils of war'; valuable possessions of their former Jewish neighbors.<br /><br />De Rosnay's story switched back and forth from that of Sarah and of Julia.  However, the little girl Sarah's story which began in  1942 was more gripping than that of Julia's.  And although we learn the full history from Julia's tireless research, there are parts of the story which seem a bit contrived.  However, despite this opinion, Sarah's Key is a great story which informs the reader about betrayal, guilt, and the search for truth.<br /><br />It's a great story you will enjoy.<br /><br />Maizie Lucille James<br />January 13, 2012
0312641893|4.0|I'll admit, I was hooked in by the words \\"cyborg\\" and \\"deadly plague.\\" Because of that, I didn't really know what to expect.<br />Cinder is an amazing mix of science fiction, dystopian, and it even has a classic fairy tale thrown in. I'm crazy about anything sci-fi and I really think Cinder hits the mark with putting the right amount in it without being overly weird for those who don't particularly like sci-fi.<br /><br />Cinder, our cyborg Cinderella, didn't really make a lasting impression on me. I think she's a great character and I enjoyed reading about her, but something was missing that could have made the connection better. Cinder didn't annoy me at all, she didn't whine, didn't do incredibly stupid things, honestly, Cinder is the epitome of what I wish every female character could be. Cinder is the kind of character you feel for. She makes you ache, makes you hurt. Her struggle with being a cyborg is heartbreaking, not only because she is a cyborg, but because of how cyborgs are treated- less than human, just because of mechanical parts.<br />Our Prince Kai is drool worthy as well. I'm glad, for once, there is a love interest who is not mean. Doesn't say nasty things and snatch and grab on the heroine. Thank you Marissa Meyer for making him a gentleman!<br /><br />As for characters I can't stand, it would be, hands down, Adri. Adri is Cinder's wicked stepmother. I have absolutely no nice feelings for the woman. Just reading about her made me want to pull out my hair! Her meanness to Cinder was astounding and I can see why Cinder was so desperate to escape.<br /><br />I'm deeply in love with the world that has been created. A world of plague, a world where medical technology can create cyborgs, a world that has people that live up on the moon; it's not the dream world someone would want to live in, but for story-telling purposes it really makes you think. I do think the main part of the story was a little obvious, I figured out what was going on early in the story and it was very easy to jump to the right conclusions. That said, it didn't take any of the joy I felt reading away.<br /><br />We are left with a major cliffhanger (!) and it's a long wait until 2013, when Scarlet is set to publish. Definitely add this one to your list for the new year and be prepared to swept up in romance and deception.to the right conclusions. That said, it didn't take any of the joy I felt reading away.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|The only real problem is that the game is really just trying too hard to make money.  The games are fun, but the ads and such are ridiculous.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun! I love having all the games on one app.I love it a lot. I would buy a second version if they made one. it is so so so so so so so awesome

1615243496|3.0|Well...it's the complete story with a background story on the author but I honest think it's not worth the money. Get a cheaper version. This book kinda looks and feels cheap when you hold it in your hands. the ribbon is way thinner than it looks in the pic. all in all good story, ok looking book but honestly don't buy this one, not worth it.

B006GG1KOC|3.0|This app is a great concept for children. It requires critical thinking skills to determine which object/picture is different. The problem is that for many of the selections, there could be many ways to group the objects. A man, a bear, a fox, and a fish. The obvious difference to me would be the man, or maybe the fish if grouped by mammals, but it's really the bear because of the color of the pictures. There is a \\"hint\\" button, but I still found the game frustrating. I haven't let me 2 yr old try it yet. He would probably enjoy it just because the ladybug would shake whenever he got it wrong. I can see the appeal for older children to play this game to practice critical thinking skills and to encourage communication and reasoning about the differences. It could be fun if you are not easily frustrated by it.

B005GVF95O|4.0|Used on Kindle Fire<br />I got this when it was free for my 4 1/2 yr old grand-daughter. She whipped through the puzzles in a couple of minutes and then proceeded to amuse herself by intentionally putting all the pieces in the wrong places. She got a real kick out of that. She finished the first puzzle faster than I did when I tried it out LOL.<br /><br />The puzzles are cute and its great for introducing little ones to apps, puzzles, android devices etc. But consider the childs apptitude on these things more than their age. If they have some experience with apps this will bore them rather quickly, lasted my DGD about 3 minutes, but if they are just learning this is a great tool.<br /><br />I would recommend this for about a 2-3 year old, depending on their experience. I do think 1.99 is too high for this though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game ever. 117 games total, there was only. 2 games I didn't like. best part... its completely add free( not to mention free from your pocket)
B00631VJIC|5.0|I bought this for my husband. We are both fans of the show. It is a great compilation of music from the t.v. series. I highly recommend adding this CD to your personal collection.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|my friends & i are introducing ourselves to this series again...we LOVE IT!! :)  we watch at least 2 to 3 episodes each week.  next week we'll wrap up season 1...quote from our straight friend, \\" this is just like sex in the city...just with lesbians!\\"  :)  yay!  so much fun!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the plans, and the different versions. very nice &amp; helpful app. very User friendly. couldn't ask for a better app. it's almost like having a library of Bibles at your fingertips.
1451629184|5.0|People like Garrido should get an automatic 5 years when caught the first time abusing someone, whether they are prosecuted or not by the victim, just like those who use a gun.  No parole, no early release, our country has enough money to do at least this much to start a record on such people (or hopefully put an end to any further records), and putting their name and picture in the local paper would make for a good embarrassment, anything, to give stiffer penalties that should follow them throughout their lives.  I'm glad that Jaycee remains decent and willing to help others, and that's the happy ending about it all.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app does everything i wanted it to and more. a great app to have for anyone who reads the Bible for business or pleasure.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote helps me organize all those web pages I want to save to read for later across all my devices and computers no matter whet operating system.
B005HSL626|5.0|I would highly recommend this application. It's great and you can spend forever playing this. Has very clear goals and can be played by someone 3 years old, or 30.
0670022411|5.0|So excited for the rest of the series! Book two is out in July! and they are making the movies!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|first let me say that I am addicted to sports radio. I recently moved from Dallas to San Francisco where sports radio is less than stellar. This allows me to listen to the sports shows that I loved in Dallas, and record the ones that I missed because of the time zone shift.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that I can take it anywhere. Having so many plans to choose from makes me even more excited about reading God's word and makes me feel nearer to Him no matter where I am.

0525478817|5.0|This book is John Green at his finest, you'll laugh, and cry, and feel everything in between. A delicate story which doesn't shy away from the truly awful disease it portrays. Hazel, our dear narrator meets Augustus Waters in a support group for teens with cancer. Hazel has temporarily static cancer of the lungs, and Augustus had bone cancer, which abated once he lost his leg. Together they confront fears of oblivion, the concept of martyrdom, and what constitutes true heroism. If you are not looking for a book that is pressed full of emotional charge, search elsewhere.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Fabulous CD as usual.  Truly amazing!  I always enjoy them.  Wonderful renditions.  I don't need to hear them before I purchase.  I know it will be great.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I paid around 7$ for this after using low quality fake iphone earphones. This one has decent audio quality, I enjoy listening music again and it seems reliable.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a great app with hours of fun. The best part is that its free! One downside, there are a lot of ads, but since it was free I can live with that.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|this game is the worst game in the history of th world it is too childish and it is way too long I hate it.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|My daughter loves this case!  It is light weight and she really appreciates the pink color and the ability to reverse it to use as a stand
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have tried them all and YouVersion is flat out the most efficient and I really like all the reading plan choices.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I really like this app, but almost every tine I look at the radar,  or zoom out on the radar it crashes my kindle fire. I hope there is some update that will fix it..
0307887960|5.0|This book is very well laid out, goes beyond just being a diet book. It has excellent suggestions for exercises, menus, helpful lists, and answers all your questions. My only complaint is about the person I bought it from, it took a month to receive it and it came from 3 states away; what's up with that? Fortunately for me, it was worth the wait.
B003E48AYC|5.0|Loved this movie! There is a great balance of laughs and action in this family-friendly story. Graphics look amazing, along with great performances by the actors for such quirky characters.
B005N95JA4|4.0|I happened to play this \\"newly remastered\\" CD in my car right after listening to the remastered \\"Beggars Banquet.\\"  Wow, talk about night and day!  Or even chalk and cheese, or bangers and mash or whatever you want to call it.  BB sounded great but Some Girls hurt my ears.  It has a thin, tinny sound that's not all all what I expect or want the slightly grungy RStones to sound like.  I'm pretty sure Charlie and Bill showed up for the recording sessions but there's scant evidence that they had real mikes on them.  I see this has been mentioned in other posts so I wish to second that emotion - the second disc makes this collection worth having, but it's not pleasant to listen to my old faves on disc one.  I guess a new-er new remaster will appear in a few years when they change record labels again.
B000JSI7BM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie; the story is entertaining and has a nice mix of drama, comedy and fashion! Great music and acting.
B0055SWM08|5.0|i think this game is just right--it is challenging but not too frustrating.  music gets old after a while. could you vary? its relaxing.
1878424505|5.0|The Four Agreements was truly a surprising read for me; I generally don't consider \\"self-help\\" books or guidance style books to be a part of my general reading, but the book truly changed my life.  With an open mind, I was able to accept Don Miguel Ruiz's advice and encouraging words, and truly make a change for the better in the way I make decisions and live my life!  I highly reccomend this book!
B006GG1KOC|2.0|instead of getting pointless kindle games get a xbox 360 kinect it has kid's games you can get into thegame
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a good time killer :) You can pick what you want to play but it costs a certain amount of coins to play each one.
B005ZUR724|5.0|the game is awesome but it cant compare the greatest game ever world of warcraft no matter what wow is top.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|This movie is pure science fiction fantasy.  Right off the bat it tells us this by entering us into the story with some linear exposition.  Once it establishes this new \\"reality\\" it introduces us to the antagonists and protagonists quickly (the extended version here doing so a bit better than the theatrical version but not much is lost in the theatrical version).  The story is a trifle of one man being chosen to be a savior of sorts who essentially doesn't believe in himself but comes to believe in himself because he comes to believe in something more than himself (saving the world).  Standard stuff really.  What elevates this movie then?  For one, it is absolutely gorgeous to look at.  The colors are deep and vibrant.  For another, it gives us unambiguous characters and an easy to follow story that makes it perfect popcorn fare (I realize that this is enough to significantly downgrade its ratings in a lot of people's eyes but shouldn't they know that they are getting a certain type of movie when they see the...oh, preview for this one?).  And for another, the \\"reality\\" in this film is sufficiently fascinating with plenty of supporting characters that can be explored.  Like many others I can't figure out why this movie got thrown under the bus when all of Marvel's fare enjoyed moderate success and decent critic review.  After seeing \\"X-men: First Class\\", \\"Thor\\", and \\"Captain America\\" I'd have to say that \\"Green Lantern\\" beats all of them out in my book (barely \\"Thor\\").  Sure X-men gave you some subtext and philosophical arguments to chew on and interlaced its story with our history (something the Cap film should have done a lot better) but the effects in X-men were less than stellar and the characters, while better drawn out than in Lantern, required that they be drawn out more.<br /><br />I will admit that I don't do the digital download/ ultraviolet copy things yet so, please, if that's your thing take a look at the one star reviews here.  They will be important to you.<br /><br />Lastly, I wanted to share one thing about this film that did bother me.  The \\"hero\\" of the story has looks, has a pretty adoring girl, has raw talent; in short, he's the supposed \\"dream\\" many want to be.  He's able to overcome his one flaw.  So, by the end of the story the \\"pretty person\\" gets everything and remains in their exalted status as said \\"pretty person\\" who is really pretty and now so much more.  By contrast you have one of the \\"villains\\" (played sympathetically and extremely well by Peter Sarsgaard--good job there) who is presented as a competent sad-sack.  He doesn't have the looks (poor balding guy), he doesn't have the pretty adoring girl (though said girl is kind to him), and his talent is capable but not superior.  He is not one of the \\"pretty people\\" (some might say \\"below average\\") but his heart, while sad at the recognition of loss of being able to get one of the \\"pretties\\", is also an honest and apparently decent heart at the beginning of the film.  He becomes infected by the uber-villain and undergoes transformations to his character and physical features that turn him into an extremely disgusting individual (inside and out).  Of course he dies.  So, by the end of the story the physically unattractive person loses everything and becomes so much less.  Doesn't this validate our Madison Avenue's view that the pretty are good and the ugly are bad (to put it simplistically)?  It sure did in this film and that's one thing I didn't like about the film.  And, there!  Who says this film can't cause a deep sociological discussion?<br /><br />Good film.stly, I wanted to share one thing about this film that did bother me.

B003INBNXO|4.0|A thoroughly enjoyable and dramatic martial arts picture that avoids wild wire-work fighting (a la \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\") and tries to maintain a feel of history and realism while still imbuing its subject with a bit of myth.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought it was pretty fun. id recommend it. I liked the part when you had to shoot Romeo at that fat lady.
B005WZZRD8|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He is still watching and re-watching the DVDs. He LOVES it! He loves the behind the scenes in it. Of course, her performances are awesome. A definite win for anyone liking her music!
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|Soul Surfer, 2011 film  \\"This is based on a true story.\\" A girl is born to parents who surfed; what is her destiny? She had two older brothers and learned to compete. She grew up in Hawaii next to the ocean. [No mention of a daily job.] Skateboards are another hobby. There is competition to be better. [Note the product placement in these scenes.] Can people make sense of things when they only see part of a picture? Bethany avoids a trip to stay in training. [Job over pleasure?] Her mother says \\"it's your call\\". [No parental advice?] The girls go surfing at night. [Did they ever read a book on shark attacks?] Fireworks at night. They are home-schooled. \\"Why didn't you ask?\\" There is more surfing in beautiful weather. The sudden attack is unexpected. \\"Get to the reef!\\" Her left arm is gone!  They meet the ambulance on the highway, transfer the patient, and rush to the hospital. Bethany survives but will have to relearn a lot of things. \\"When can I surf again?\\" There is anger and conflict in the family. Television news has this story (\\"if it bleeds, it leads\\"). Bethany yearns to return to surfing. At home she finds journalists with cameras to exploit this news. \\"We'll take it day by day.\\" A TV show will pay for a prosthetic arm in return for an interview. She learns of the disadvantages. Its healing nice. \\"I don't understand.\\" Later a shark was caught. \\"It's a perfect fit.\\" [About eleven feet long?]  Life goes on for Alanna and Bethany. At home Bethany prepares orange juice for the family. She returns to the ocean to relearn surfing. Later she puts on the prosthetic arm and finds problems. \\"People like normal.\\" Bethany continues to practice surfing. She enters a surfing tournament. There is a big wave that causes a problem. A broken board ends her competition. \\"I can't do this anymore.\\" She meets her fans and gives them a present.\\" \\"It's over.\\" Will she ever be the same? There is more to life than surfing.  Volunteers go to Thailand where a tidal wave destroyed peopleand homes. They pass out bags of rice. They hear of the disaster. Bad memories. They serve food to the hungry. Bethany uses a surf board to help children play in the ocean. She learns there is more to life than surfing. Back home Bethany gets fan mail. A board with a handle allows Bethany to compete again. Exercise strengthens her muscles.  The \\"Rip Curl\\" National Tournament is held in Hawaii. Bethany enters against strong competition. They paddle out into the ocean. The contest is very close, and may be over. Then a wave appears! Can they count it? No, it was after the horn. But it counts for Bethany. \\"Nobody is as tough as you.\\" Bethany lives to surf, in spite of the drawbacks. The ending credits show the real Bethany Hamilton, and others. This shark attack occurred in 2003 when Bethany was thirteen. She later wrote a book about her life. This movie seems to have downplayed her religious life. Just what did her parents do for a living in expensive Hawaii?
B00006JIA4|5.0|It's been a long time since I've heard Queen and so bought this and love it.  I never knew a lot about this band other than the sad loss of Freddy so I read the info  insert from front to back and learned a lot. All four members wrote songs for the band  all had hits and amazingly all played multiple instruments and also recorded solo albums.  That much talent in one band is incredible and makes listening a different experience  for me.Amazon is pretty much the only place I shop these days.Rock on!
B004I744AS|5.0|From my experience this is among the very best dictionaries I have used. I sometimes get lost looking through the related items it suggest, its depth and interest being quite extensive.
0525478817|5.0|This book is definitely worth your time, money and emotions. I include emotions because it will connect you and force you to feel all of them. This is the first book that made me both cry(to the point where someone made a Niagara Falls reference or seven) and laugh out loud.   This book is an experience worth having.

B004GHYCKW|5.0|In a year with worldwide political turmoil, PJ Harvey gave us a battle-cry to rally the protesters.  It is just as relevant for England, as it is for the U.S. and the rest of the world.  Although released previous to the London riots, it seems as though Ms. Harvey is a bit clairvoyant- or perhaps she realized it was all inevitable.  This album makes it apparent that the personal is in fact political, and that is what must push us out of submission.  Harvey has delivered something much different than she has in the past, and it is up to us to follow her through every battlefield in protest and questioning.
0525478817|5.0|I always describe my favorite books as feeling like \\"home,\\" and TFiOS is just that. It's sweet, sad, comforting, disheartening, and incredible.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|Lost was, for six years, one of the most addictive (and perhaps best ever) television shows to ever capture the American audience.  Billed as part mystery, part science fiction, part supernatural, part action-adventure, it was a serialized drama which like soap-operas required dedicated viewing in order to follow and understand the plots and characters.  However, unlike its daytime namesakes in serial-drama, Lost was the most expensive television series made, and the creative team led by JJ Abrams wrote and directed the most complex, twisted, and believably human character situations ever to grace the \\"boob-tube\\".  Lost was not an exercise in weekly entertainment, it was captivating, thought-provoking, yes it was \\"intelligent\\" (a way overused word), and again...addictive beyond belief.  Echoed everywhere in reviews, the end of Lost was both the culmination of high imagination and the sudden cold turkey of millions of fans.  Thankfully, this Lost Complete Series set, boxed in an ultra-imaginative set for the devoted fan, complete with mysteries in packaging and toys for the &Uuml;ber-fan is available.<br />The Bluray Hi-Def picture and sound are fantastic, deep, rich, and a feast for the eyes and ears.  Watching Lost again, in this way, is like participating in the world's longest movie.  The \\"Season Play\\" mode allows you to leave the viewing at any point and automatically resume your viewing at the exact location, even if you turned off your system and removed the disc to watch something else in-between.  Watching Lost this way is so gratifying without having to wait a week for the next installment and forgetting things, you appreciate Lost so much more than ever before, and you might not believe how much you had forgotten since the first season aired.  Opening the packaging, shaped as \\"The Temple\\", and exploring all the surprises which come with the discs is pure fun, re-living the complete series episodes is engaging in the world's longest sci-fi thriller movie, and watching this series in Bluray perfect high-definition with complete theater surround is an eyes and ears extravaganza.  Can't give enough praise to this boxed set!  It was the perfect gift!ching this series in Bluray perfect high-definition with complete theater surround is an eyes and ears extravaganza.

B004EWEX9Y|2.0|Received a Product from this seller, the timing was good and the product was in good shape (Apple Composite AV cable ZML). The video portion wasn't compatible with my 2nd Gen Ipod touch. Two things are at fault, 1 when selling an item like this the seller should state the OS systems compatibility and 2 I should of did a more through research as to the compatiblity of this cable with my Ipod. When a product states its compatible with your device, we take it for granted that it will work. So we are both to blame so I have to be an more informed shopper and go to an Apple store in person. Even if it costs more.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I received this as a Christmas present and could not be happier.  As others have noted, it makes the Kindle look like an antique book, and strangers will just come up and tell me how beautiful it is.  The straps are tight and they should be to protect it.  I don't have any trouble taking it out, but I rarely do it.  The cover does lie flat.  There is a review of the red cover in which the reviewer states that it doesn't but mine does.  Maybe the difference is between the two.  Anyway, I highly recommend this cover.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|great to have a hundred plus games at ones fingertips. so glad I stumbled across this app while looking for something fun.
0060873027|1.0|I am enraptured with Michael Crichton's books and had reasonable expectations for this last book. It did not live up to the usual standards of this body of work. The reader could gloss over the first ten and the last ten pages and still obtain a pretty close understanding of the entire text. I read the whole effort, but when I realized that most of the pages was going to be miniature grad students fighting ants, I was disappointed. It will make a nice \\"B\\" movie.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Irving Berlin's classic musical \\"Holiday Inn\\" which stars Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire is such a wholesome and entertaining movie. Produced in 1942, it is one of Crosby's earliest movies that reinforced his appeal not only as a singer but also an actor. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards including Original Motion Picture Story, Best Song for \\"White Christmas\\" and Scoring of A Musical Picture.<br /><br />The plot revolves around four main characters: Jim Hardy (Bing Crosby), the owner of Holiday Inn in Connecticut who is also the inn's main singer/performer; Ted Hanover (Fred Astaire), a dancer and Hardy's performing partner; Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds), a singer/performer at Holiday Inn who is being wooed by both Hardy and Hanover; Lila Dixon (Virginia Dale), also a singer/performer who was once courted by Hardy and Hanover while they were a trio of performers at a club in New York City. Although Hardy and Hanover excel in their respective crafts--Hardy as a singer and Hanover as a dancer--the only thing they have in common is their interests and attraction to the same lady at the same time. It happened with Lila Dixon and again with Linda Mason, which made Hardy sighing and saying: \\"Here we go again.\\"<br /><br />Under the direction of Mark Sandrich, the viewers are guaranteed an enjoyable musical/comedy from start to finish. Crosby sings splendidly  and Astaire dances so gracefully. They both made this movie memorable and an enduring classic. Irving Berlin's most remarkable songs are featured here from \\"White Christmas\\" and \\"Easter Parade\\" to \\"I'll Capture Your Heart Singing\\" and \\"Be Careful, It's My Heart.\\" The song and dance numbers are truly spectacular.<br /><br />This DVD Special Edition is a collector's item. The digital remastering was excellently done. You wouldn't think that the movie was filmed 70 years ago. It also has interesting bonus features like an interview with Fred Astaire's daughter, Ava Astaire-MacKenzie by film historian/author/producer Ken Barnes; the making of the unforgettable song and dance numbers; film clips of Bing Crosby's memorable performances from his other movies such as \\"Moonlight Becomes You\\" from Road To Morocco, 1942 and \\"White Christmas\\" from Blue Skies, 1946, the film that made his signature Christmas song became a primary theme song for the military men and women who wish to be home and spend Christmas holiday with their families.<br /><br />Movie producers nowadays don't make movies like this anymore, so this DVD is absolutely a collector's item and a keeper. Wholesomely recommended for your viewing pleasure.king of the unforgettable song and dance numbers; film clips of Bing Crosby's memorable performances from his other movies such as \\"Moonlight Becomes You\\" from Road To Morocco, 1942 and \\"White Christmas\\" from Blue Skies, 1946, the film that made his signature Christmas song became a primary theme song for the military men and women who wish to be home and spend Christmas holiday with their families.

B000MD9UJC|5.0|I have heard about this conversion before but never got arount to it. I am super happy I did. The mag AA mini(with the led kit), throws a massive floodlite beam. Seeing is believing. It is my best back-up light that I keep in the center console of my truck. I have another in my traveling bags for hotel use in case of blackout etc. I do a lot of electronic work that sometimes necessitate the use of both hands. Having the little mag in mouth when working in tight places is a gift to techincians like me. I'm impressed.
1451629184|5.0|While reading this book I wondered how any child could go through such trauma and come out as wonderful as Jaycee Dugard.  It will bring tears, anger, amazement, and most of all, a real look into the mind of two sick, perverted people. Jaycee is the most amazing lady .. and the most amazing mom. This book will make you stop and think about the evil that exists in the world, and how a young girl overcame the evil, through faith, love of her children, and the memory of her own mother's love in her early years.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|my 2 y/o couldn't figure the object of this out yet. I even had a little trouble trying to figure out a few of the higher level differences. I think it should be geared more towards the 4 to 6 y/o audience. Good graphics and sound. I will keep this app for when he's older. Thanks for FAOTD. Keep em coming! I &lt;3... Btw, I'm using an HTC inspire 4g phone.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I have to admit that this is one wonderful movie. With no school today because of snow, the older daycare kids and I sat and watched this movie and you couldn't pull them away from it, me either for that matter.  This was a great movie about the loyalty of a dog and his love for his owner but beware, if you are like me and some of the kiddos you too will be bawling your eyes out more than once while you can't tear yourself away.  The kids and I both give it 5 stars and I will be purchasing it in the future to watch again and also as a Christmas gift for my parents, truly an amazing story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think it's a great game! You always have a different activity to do, never bored, and always on your feet!

The most significant point in this story and, in my mind, why the war lasted so much longer than it could, should, would have, is made in the realization by Hal Moore and the 1st Cav commander Harry Kinnard that the US had forever surrendered offensive initiative to the PAVN because they were not permitted to follow the battered PAVN units into Cambodia and destroy their ability to fight. Given the safe sanctuary of Cambodia the PAVN could replace, refit and rest their soldiers in complete security and chose the time of their next attacks which it did on the same grounds many times over the next years.<br /><br />If the political leaders- Johnson and McNamara among others- had not been so timid and concerned more about public relations than their troops and had alowed US units to follow and defeat in total the PAVN wherever it was, there can't be any doubt of a much swifter resolution to the war and saved many US toops from death and life long injuries. Instead, the war lasted another seven years with thousands of deaths and injuries.<br /><br />In the end the thing Johnson and his cohorts feared most- the loss of public support for them and the war - did happen and on a much greater scale than they feared. To me that is one the greatest ironies of their failed strategy.

0823095223|5.0|Well written, concise and nicely detailed overview of each step in the process of creating stunning collector statues. I picked up some nice details that had never occurred to me previously. I would say this is an excellent \\"How To\\" book for beginners, and a worthwhile add on to any sculptor's library. My copy sit right next to my sculpting table now. Good sections on painting, posing and molding!
1597801585|4.0|This book follows half a dozen expatriates, American and others, in a future Thailand, after the world has shuddered through a mini-Dark Ages and has just emerged out the other side.  There are serious environmental challenges in this future world, and the geneticists of that world are fighting a 5-alarm battle to stay one step ahead of exotic diseases and conditions that threaten the world food supply.  The characters in the story are part of this struggle in various ways as it plays out across social, political, physical, religious and economic battlefields.  The plot is gripping and fast-paced, sometimes so much so that it broke me out of the story:  it's just not possible that this much crap can happen to so few people in such a short time!  As a story, though, it's extremely engaging and even thought-provoking.  Could a society really be as corrupt as the one portrayed here?  As cutthroat and ugly?  If you know your history you know the answer is yes, and you can only read on as the characters pursue their individual goals and try to keep their heads above the fast-rising tides of change that are gripping this version of Thailand.  \\"The Windup Girl\\" has reaped much critical praise, deservedly, and hopefully we will see many more works from this young author.  I gave it four stars because I have read plenty of works similar to this one in tone and subject matter (post-Dark Ages), and though this one was quite good, it doesn't break as much new ground as I would have hoped.  Very good but not one of the greats, is my final verdict.  Certainly worth buying.
1600595871|4.0|While I have borrowed Alisa Golden's other books from the library many times, I did not own one, so I thought this book would be a good resource. Now that I have purchased it, I would say it is a good resource, but probably for either someone who has some prior experience with making books, or someone who is adept at figuring things out. The first book I tried, the Woven Codex (p. 163) has a mistake in the materials list. I am experienced as well as pretty good at punting, so my sample was successful, but it made me wonder if there are other errors in the book. One nice thing is that Ms. Golden does address questions and errata (including the one I encountered) in her blog,  [...]. Look for the entry dated March 30, 2011. She will also answer your specific questions regarding instructions, which is helpful. So I would recommend this book if you would like a nice collection of structures and forms for memory-jogging or getting ideas, but if you are just beginning, I would heed the suggestions of other reviewers and look for a book by Shereen LaPlantz.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|This is the best metal release since Flotsam and Jetsams' 'The Cold'.  Unlike many of their contemporary's recent releases, this disc sounds fresh, energetic, relevant, and fun.  The songs are all strong with great lyrics.  Very memorable riffage and catchy vocal melodies.  Belladonna sounds as good as he did 20 years ago and the band is tight and metal thrashing mad.  I really feel like these guys still love what they do and are committed to playing the best music they can.  Some of the other musicians from this era seem to be \\"phoning it in\\" or basically going through the motions.  Anthrax is the legitimate article.  Everyone take notice, once again, the disease is ready to be spread!

B005974CNA|4.0|Ok, the first phrase that comes to mind is 'Thank God'!  That last abortion with the ants on the cover made me wonder if this band was defunct.  Much to my satisfaction, they have returned with one of their best efforts of this current millenium. I won't drone on with a long review, but I would like to say that the lyrics on this album are great.  I couldn't listen to the last album due to the fact that the lyrics were so pointless that it made me somewhat embarrassed for the band.  Petrucci did an excellent job on this effort and it really makes it easy to get engrossed in the music.  And, of course, the musicianship is unmatchable as usual.  New drummer, Mangini, does a great job and Portnoy is not missed although I hope he continues with his career.  Although, without Portnoy, at least the listener is not subjected to the ridiculous growling vocal that he always felt compelled to record, even though they seemed forced and awkward at best.  So, essentially, if you had been turned off by the past efforts of DT, give them another try.  This is a great disc!  Hope they keep it going.

0525478817|5.0|Not many books have brought me to tears. I consider the ones that have great successes. In order for a book to make me cry, I need a great attachment to the characters, and full absorption into the story. The Fault In Our Stars made me cry at least 10 times, and I wouldn't even consider it a \\"sad\\" story.  I read The Fault In Our Stars cover to cover in one sitting. This book is John Green's best work yet. I highly recommend it to anyone. Don't be put off by the stigma of the \\"young adult\\" genre. It is truly fantastic.

B000002AQH|4.0|I owned the 1972 Decca recording by Britten and his Aldeburgh forces for years without feeling much of an urge to take it down from my shelves for two reasons: first, I could not get past my antipathy for either Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau or Peter Pears with their ungrateful tone - one gravelly, the other strangulated - and both pecking away at the text like canaries at a cuttlefish; secondly, the melodic discursiveness of Part One, beginning with a dismally pedestrian overture consisting of a listless, repeated, downward-falling semi-quaver figure followed by some of Schumann's least melodious writing always failed to engage me long enough to persevere.<br /><br />I am in agreement with a previous reviewer who recommends starting your listening with Part 2, which is much closer to Mahler's inspiration in its whole-hearted response to Goethe's mystical, metaphysical vision. This music was of course written a good few years before Part One and as such is much fresher, inventive and devoid of the stolidity and the calcification of Schumann's genius which marked the inexorable encroachment of his mental illness. The second part really is like a different work from the sclerotic, episodic and disjointed Part One.<br /><br />Abbado's direction is too polite to bring out the full dramatic potential of the music but he has the advantages of a superb Berlin Philharmonic and a very starry cast. Terfel, here aged only 28, is in finest voice: rich, noble, vibrant - and one is struck afresh by how clear and idiomatic his German is. One could wish that he sang the other bass parts, too, including Mephistopheles, as he is far more firm and alluring than the rather pedestrian Rootering; Harry Peeters as Pater Profundus is superior to him, too. Endrik Wottrich's neat, flexible, slightly \\"Germanic\\" tenor is far preferable to Pears' bleating. Karita Mattila is large and lovely of tone if not especially moving or vulnerable as Gretchen. The finest female voice is that of gorgeous, fluting soprano Barbara Bonney in various roles; future stars like Susan Graham takes three smaller parts, too.<br /><br />If you want this music, there really is no competition - or indeed another recording - unless you are attached to the other very capable singers for Britten and actively enjoy the sound of those I do not. Apart from the obvious quality of both the recorded sound of this live performance and also of its participants, it is worth acquiring almost solely to hear Bryn Terfel at his youthful best, at his most expressive and communicative and always luscious of voice, from the gentlest of falsetto pianissimo to his gleaming, forte top notes .Bonney in various roles; future stars like Susan Graham takes three smaller parts, too.

B000002J27|5.0|All of the naysayers had me believe that the band Genesis went completely downhill once Peter Gabriel stepped out of the fold.  While I am a huge fan of Gabriel era Genesis I was at first hesitant to listen to anything by the band post his departure.  \\"When Peter left they went pop\\" one person exclaimed.  \\"They lost all magic and originality\\" another one would chime in.  I thought to myself, \\"wow, Peter must really have been the heart and soul of Genesis and apparently the only contributing factor that made them so great\\".  Then I heard A Trick Of The Tail and was utterly gobsmacked by it.  This would turn out to be one of the bands top three greatest albums of there entire catalog including the Gabriel era.  What the hell are people talking about!  This album coincides perfectly with albums such as Foxtrot and Selling England.  This record in my opinion is better than The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway.  It is still as progressive as ever and the band is absolutely on fire while blazing through such tracks as Dance On A Volcano and Sqounk.  I find it a bit ironic that people felt that the band had changed so much when Collins stepped up to the mic.  Did you hear Gabriel's First solo album after he left the band.  Talk about a different sound.  A Trick Of The Tail is not only better than Gabriel's first solo album, it is far superior and remains much more true to the original Genesis format.  One critic commented on the fact that Collins sounded more Peter Gabriel than Peter Gabriel and this is a very true comment.  Collins would go on to craft his own style of singing but on these particular albums he sounded very much like Gabriel.  I can understand what people are talking about during the bands 80's material.  genesis did go the pop rock route but even then had moments of brilliance, (can we just pretend Invisible Touch and I Cant Dance never happened).  All in all if your a bit younger and new to to the band I would highly encourage you not to thumb your nose up at any record that had Collins as the lead vocalist.  The next four albums that followed Peter Gabriel are absolutely essential to anyone who wants the bands classic material.any record that had Collins as the lead vocalist.

B0058VW36U|4.0|This is a good game. Works great on kindle fire. The deceptively simple gameplay often has me scratching my head. Great way to just waste some time. But this is no Angry Birds.  Be prepared to think. If you hate games that require some thought than go for something else. I believe there should be a free version however.

0525478817|5.0|If you are a fan of realistic, honest, smart books, this is the book for you. Although John Green writes in a genre known as \\"young adult,\\" his books are far from kid stuff. He honors young adult literature and teenagers by writing them such intelligent books with characters who are well spoken, funny, and raw. The Fault In Our Stars will make you fall in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters. The sarcastic wit with which they face the world around them brings amazing humor to a grim reality. I am doing everything in my power not to add spoilers to this review and to gush about the latest, and perhaps best yet John Green masterpiece. The Fault In Our Stars is heartbreakingly spectacular. I am an avid reader, and love the Nerdfighter web of authors. This is literally the best book I have read this year. Literally.
0439023513|5.0|I took the longest time reading this book out of all the three because I heard a lot of people say they didn't like the ending and I really didn't want to be disappointed and have it end bad because I thought the first two were great. But I thought Mockingjay was a great ending to an amazing trilogy!  I heard a lot of people complaining about how the ending was too depressing, but in a way I think that was supposed to be the point, If you look at the first two books, they aren't exactly happy books, so I don't think people shouldn't have expected a really happy ending.   I believe Collins does a great job showing the effects of war and the fact that it's never a complete happy ending. Something to remember as well is that I don't think she meant for these books to be a love story, but a lot more than that. I think her ending was perfect, yes it was sad I think but in a wasn't a complete extreme sad ending that makes you hate life since in the end there is a ray of light with Katniss who does end up making the best of the life she's left with. Also in a way I liked how both her and Peeta never fully recover because after being in war I don't think you can ever erase the thing you have seen or even have done, they will always be in the back of your mind haunting you but you just try to out them aside and dot he best with what you have.   What Collins does is give us a realistic ending. Yes it's not the happiest but it's realistic unlike many other books that just give the reader what they want by giving them the fairy tale ending, her ending was harsh but it was what the trilogy needed to make it great. Once again excellent book and trilogy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I downloaded this on my kindle. its fun and has a Lot to choose from. better for little kids than adults though.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|For those of us who love baseball, and even for those who don't, this is a wondeful 'feel good' film of statistics and brains versus intuition and brawn.<br /><br />We find Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt, GM of the Oakland Athletics, making it to the World Series but failing to win. In the process the team is losing three of its best players. The Athletics have a thirty million dollar cap on their players versus the Red Sox and New York Yanklees, who have hundreds of millions. Beane needs to replace these players, but the members of his scouting teams just give him the same old tired story of the players that will probably work out with practice. Beane wants another method to pick his players. At a meeting with another team he finds a young, short, chubby man, Peter Brand, played by Jonah Hill, who spouts statistics and crunched numbers to arrive at an algorithm for players who will do well. He hires Brand and changes his methods and that of his team.<br /><br />Brand is a nerdy Yale graduate who looked at the  strict cost-benefit analysis of baseball players. He persuaded Beane that he should hire based on key performance statistics that pointed to undervalued players. They assembled a team that seemed foolhardy at first, but during the course of a season, proved itself the biggest bargain in baseball. Beane antagonized most of his scouts, but he was proved correct. At the end of the season he is invited to Boston to meet the Red Sox owner. When he returns to Oakland he talks with Brand, and tells him, \\"I don't play for money, I play for the love of the game\\". Oh, yes, the love of what you are doing. A lucky man and one who knows and is happy with himself. A loner, a divorced man with a daughter he loves, but all in all a man who is fine living alone.<br /><br />This is not just a film for baseball lovers, but a film for all of us who can see that a new way, a change from the old ways is almost always a good thing.<br /><br />Highly Recommended,  prisrob 01-12-12<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005UKJX4E The Tree Of Life]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000IZJZIU Accepted (Widescreen Edition)]][[ASIN:B000IZJZIU Accepted (Widescreen Edition)]]

0525478817|5.0|I woke up early in the morning with a sinking feeling and tears in my eyes. Had something terrible happened the night before? No, I had only read John Green's \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\".  It's a powerful book. I had read \\"An Abundance of Katherines\\" a couple weeks earlier, and I laughed at one sentence and cried at the next. \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" went one step further - what started out as a laugh ended as a cry; I really laughed and cried at the same time.   It's no wonder that John's favorite band is the Mountain Goats. (It's my favorite band too, and I probably wouldn't have heard of it if not for John.) Darnielle's three-minute songs and Green's unputdownable one-evening books are in the same incredible boat. John's novels and the Mountain Goat's lyrics share a grasp of the poetry of sadness and simplicity, a minimalism which leaves out everything but raw humanity.   The book is (at least in part) about how to remain human and happy without giving up honesty. On one level, it is a question about what a novel should look like. The theme of the contrast between two types of novel runs through the entire book. There's your typical - cheesy, overly optimistic, making holy that which is just human - cancer novel - a novel, in short,  which compromises its honesty in favor of optimism; and then there's the fictional Peter Van Houten's \\"An Imperial Affliction\\", which ends up erring on the side of pessimism. This device of \\"book within book\\" is a daring one, as there is an implicit claim that John's book manages to steer clear of the pitfalls of both approaches. And steer clear he does - as well as fulfilling the unspoken promise to give the reader an ending rivalling the one in Van Houten's novel.   On another level, the distinction between the two types of novel is of course a distinction between different ways of living our lives in the face of suffering. In the end, the book says no more than to live and love before it is too late - and to not be too afraid of being hurt. And I think this is the best we can do when it comes balancing honesty and humanity. In a new and poignant variation on the \\"'Tis better to have loved and lost...\\" theme, one of the ending lines in the novel is \\"You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you.\\"   Having said all this, there is a - perhaps minor, but still disappointing - mistake in the novel. Cantor's discovery that there are different sizes of infinity does /not/ give a solution to Zeno's Paradox. The fact that there can be smaller and larger infinities does not help, because the only infinities involved are the countable infinity of sequences of rational numbers and the uncountable infinity of the continuum - and they are the same for both Achilles and the turtle. And this brings us to the crux of the matter - when Hazel says that \\"of course\\" there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2 than between 0 and 1, she is displaying a complete ignorance of Cantor's work. In fact, one of Cantor's groundbreaking (and clearly extremely unintuitive, judging by Hazel's \\"of course\\") results was that the size of the set of real numbers from 0 to 1 is the same as the size of the set of numbers from 0 to 2 (under a suitable definition of what it means for two sets to have the same size - for the curious, two sets have the same size if and only if one can \\"pair together\\" elements of one set with elements of the other without leaving any out). John could have read all of this in a Wikipedia article - that he didn't, and that neither his editiors nor his more mathematically-minded friends caught the mistake is a severe disappointment. (One could argue that neither Van Houten nor Hazel were mathematicians and so it was okay for them to be wrong. But the uninformed reader will doubtless assume they are correct and take away from the novel a misconception about mathematics and philosophy.)  It is a mark of my high opinion of the book that Igive it five stars despite this glaring mistake. After all, it is not every day that a novel makes you laugh and cry at the exact same moment.

B000JQU1VS|5.0|This ebook compiles 12 of the best and most well-known Sherlock Holmes stories. They're quite entertaining, and they're short, so it's easy to sneak one in when you have a little spare time.<br /><br />I won't speculate on whether they're easy or hard to armchair-solve, since the truth is that I had already read most of these, years ago, and once I started reading a story I usually remembered what the solution turned out to be. I was rereading for the journey, not the destination. ;) And it's funny how much goes over your head if you first read these stories as a pre-pubescent. This time around, at 34 years old, I suddenly noticed all the references to mistresses and the snarky little digs about classist snobs! The writing style is clear and elegant with a streak of dry humor.<br /><br />This is a good sample of Holmes stories and a lot of fun. I recommend it.

0525478817|5.0|I just finished reading The Fault in Our Stars. First of all, I will say that being that I just literally put the book down, I am going away from it with that feeling in your heart and the back of your throat. Its a very familiar feeling because its the one where you're trying to choke back all the tears but you just can not hold them back. From a complete non-spoiler perspective, as I would not want to ruin such a wonderful piece of literary work by spoiling it for others, I will say simply that if there is one book that you ever read, let it be this one.<br />It captures the fears, desires, and wants that we have when faced with adversity. In this age, we see so many fantasy books out there that involves vampires, werewolves, witches, wizards, and mythical-magical beings. The Fault in Our Stars is based on fiction, as Mr. Green states, but it has all the components that could very well happen. I wish so many times, as he says in his acknowledgments, that THAT miracle should exist. I want it so bad because I've lost so very many people that I love dearly to Cancer.<br />As I was reading the book, I recollected the times I spent with those people. He describes it so well because the things that these characters go through are nearly identical to what I have seen my own mother go through at her young age of just 38.<br />TFiOS will definitely make you laugh, cry, lose yourself in the deepest thoughts, make you wonder \\"what if\\" questions, and then you'll have this strange (or in my case anyways) realization that we are in fact mortal. These shells that hold our souls, personality, hopes, dreams, loves, fears, anguish, and all those emotions make us human. My mother died of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma when I was 14. I am now 30 years old but those memories of her are still incredibly instilled in my mind and I see her now through my memories I have of her.<br />Anymore that I may say regarding this novel will unintentionally reveal spoilers and I will end this review now. I will only say, in closing and reiterating, that if there is one novel that you read, let it be this one. You won't be disappointed and I think that it has left me with a lot of answers to questions I've carried for a very long time.y, in closing and reiterating, that if there is one novel that you read, let it be this one.

0374158460|4.0|The relatively poor reviews of \\"Freedom\\" on Amazon suprised me.  I think it may have have to do with the difficulty of writing \\"life in suburbia\\" novels that appeal to a majority of readers. Many of the (quite thoughtful) negative reviews focus on \\"unlikeable\\" or \\"weak\\" characters. But I found that their \\"weakness\\" made them credible, interesting and possible to identify with. Other negative reviews refer to the Franzen's apparent attack on \\"freedom\\". I rather found it beautifully constructed how he lays out that total freedom to make choices can have unfortunate consequences in different ways. Still other negative reviews focus on implausibility of certain events, behaviors or dialogue. That may be the case. But I rather found this secondary because to me the main point of the novel, the supremacy and frailness of relationships with family, loved-ones and friends, was so powerfully, sensitively and emotionally rendered. If I have a complaint about \\"Freedom\\" it would have to do with the sort of unexceptional and yet lengthy descriptions of the professional circumstances with which Walter was involved.   Like \\"Freedom\\", Franzen's other major work, \\"The Corrections\\", seems to have been widely praised by professional critics but unfavorably received by Amazon reviewers. I enjoyed both works, but if asked to recommend one it would definitly be \\"Freedom\\".  In any case, I strongly recommend both novels for serious readers.
1451627289|4.0|Like many, I'm a huge Stephen King fan. I enjoyed the book, although I wouldn't rate it as one of my top five King reads. I noticed I didn't quite read the with usual fast page turning pace that I usually do with one of his works. Nevertheless, I enjoyed picking it up every night, anxiously awaiting the moment when the main character would eventually makes it to 11/22/63.

B005TTEFRG|3.0|You can't really accuse Marcus Nispel's swords and sorcery fantasy of being namby-pamby - there's cracked skulls and slashed limbs a plenty - and enough ketchup to worry Burger King. We're not exactly talking Conan The \\"Librarian\\" here. And yet somehow - and despite Herculean effort (if you'll forgive the terrible pun) - it just doesn't click.<br /><br />It should though. All the right ingredients for an update of this comic-book hero are there - bad guys with bad teeth - a minion with a severed nose and a tasty set of thumb-screws - an evil witch sporting razors for nail extensions - exotic wenches sporting very little else... And all the while a longhaired body-builder does his best to act while wielding a sword of destiny, riding a horse through haunted forests, causing landslides in slave mines, sneaking through secret passages into a turreted castle of ultimate doom (you know the sort) - and even finding time to shag a monastic nubile in a mud hut with very fetching candlelight. Not to mention all manner of burly warriors with more facial battle scars than members of the Scunthorpe Debate Society after a particularly rough game of Cribbage.<br /><br />To be fair to the lead actor on which pretty much everything rests - it's hard to follow in the triceps of Arnold Schwarzenegger. But Jason Momoa as Conan The Barbarian is likeable and a very credible presence on screen (he clearly bought a Bullworker in the last few months as well). Stephan Lang (of \\"Avatar\\" fame) is the main villain - a power-obsessed overlord trying to get an ancient mask back that will make him a God (I felt the same way last week when I was queuing in Tescos). He thoroughly enjoys a psychotic frown as he pokes your eyes out and regularly rabbits on about \\"...rivers of blood...\\" and other such delightful bedside chatter (dialogue above). There are loads of battle sequences to keep the action ante up and the BLU RAY picture quality is immaculate throughout (it comes as a 'Double Play' set and there's a '3D' version too). There's even a believable 'attraction' between Jason Momoa and the gorgeous Rachel Nichols as Tamara the 'pure blood'. There's also the ever-watchable Ron Perlman as Corin (Conan's father) and Nonso Anozie plays Conan's loyal sidekick Artus - a man with Byzantine dreadlocks and personal hygiene issues.<br /><br />And yet this new remake grows tiresome very quickly - rather like \\"The Prince Of Persia\\" did. I think the main culprit is the incredibly derivative storyline - we've seen and heard all of this epic warrior and his journey nonsense before - and way too many times too. A boy witnesses his father and entire village be slaughtered - grows up to be a fierce warrior - systematically avenges all involved - meets fab-looking dolly bird en-route - saves the world from the forces of darkness - returns to a nicer mud hut at the end - has a shower (wash the blood and entrails off) - and settles in with a nice cup of cocoa and the Downton Abbey Christmas special. It sounds like great fun - it sounds rip-roaring - and at times it is. But it also feels a little empty-headed somehow. It's hard to get excited about this - and I'd admit to fast forwarding on more than one occasion. I also doubt I'd want to watch it again - so it's a rental rather than a purchase.<br /><br />Still - if you're up for a bit of a He-Man actioner - you could do worse - you could try Poker night at the Scunthorpe Debate Society...ion too).

B003Y5H4Y8|3.0|The plot of THE DEBT is rather enigmatic and a bit confusing because of<br />the technique of cutting back and forth between past and present. Added<br />to this is an even more problematic factor: the younger and older<br />counterparts don't look a bit alike, so keeping track of them by<br />character names can keep a viewer in a distracted frame of mind.<br /><br />Other than the script problems, it must be said that the acting is all<br />on a high level, and the story is particularly engaging during the<br />earlier 1967 sequences. This is partly due to the fact that Rachel<br />(Jessica Chastain) gives the most impressive performance in the film<br />and is someone who immediately involves you in the story. She emerges<br />later on into the Helen Mirren image, which is not quite credible in my<br />opinion. Mirren does a fine job as the mature Rachel and her final<br />scenes with the man she has been hunting down is staged realistically<br />with gut-wrenching violence.<br /><br />If you can get beyond the casting problems involved, the story is taut<br />with suspense but told at a rather leisurely pace.<br /><br />Tom Wilkinson and Martin Csokas as old and young Stephan; Ciaran Hinds<br />and Sam Worthington as old and young David; and Jesper Christensen as<br />Dr. Vogel give performances that cannot be praised highly enough. The<br />only drawback is that the resemblance between young and old is entirely<br />missing, a fatal flaw when a film is told in cross-cuts between past<br />and present.<br /><br />Hunting down an ex-Nazi surgeon who has committed war crimes always<br />makes for an interesting story idea...but in this case, there are too<br />many flaws to make the film wholly successful.<br /><br />To be fair, fans of espionage tales will no doubt be able to overlook this aspect of the film and take pleasure in watching a taut story unfold in flashbacks.

B004UXUUDA|5.0|This film left me emotionally exhausted but hopeful because it portrays the worst of people and the best of people. At first, I found myself enraged at the French collaboration with the Nazis. In Paris, when Jewish families were separated, mothers from children, it was the French soldiers who pulled them apart. Later it was a French soldier who allowed Sarah and her friend to escape under the wire. The poor girl who had hidden her brother in a closet and locked it against the Nazi soldiers, never gave up the idea that she could go back and save him. Fifty years later an American wife of a Frenchman realizes that the family apartment that they will inherit from her husband's family, was part of the ghetto of Paris. She investigates further and finds the name of Sarah's family, its former inhabitants. Thanks to the meticulous record keeping of the Germans she realizes that Sarah and her brother never went to Auschwitz with their parents.She also finds that Sarah moved to the United States. Never giving up on finding Sarah, she also realizes that she is pregnant, something that she had given up on after miscarriages followed the birth of her only child. Her husband does not want another child when their daughter is now a teenager. So this is another conflict in her life. The movie covers a huge time frame but does it well, showing the hardships of World War Two against the realities of present day and how we face the same choices in our lives.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how simple and clean this app is.  Easy to use.  Variety of translations.  Love option of download or wifi access. Best Bible app on market.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|Some of the logic escapes my daughter and some of the knowledge required is a bit beyond her right now but most of the puzzles are appropriate for her to figure out.  The most recent one she missed was about things that open and close. At 4 I think she is a little too young to get that.  My guess is that at about 6 this game will be way too young for her.  I would recommend this app - but I would also recommend spending some time helping your kids think critically about the puzzles.  There is minor feedback for incorrect answers so your child may guess their wag through a puzzle. Once all the puzzles in a level are finished, success is ranked by 1 to 3 flowers. Getting less then 3 flowers is enough incentive for my daughter to try the level again.

1451627289|2.0|I'm not the biggest Stephen King fan but I LOVED 'The Stand' years ago. This book got me curious with the time travel. It seems to me that King is writing for the screen with his books. While reading this book, I could picture the humor on the screen of the 'back to the Future' type occurances along with the hokey romance story with George/Jake and Sadie. How many times did we have to hear about the pound cake and their extraordinary love? This 'past' seemed to be too perfect and taken from sitcom tv-land to me. I prefer the \\"Time Traveler's wife\\" way over this silly time travel sitcom. And then the \\"Titanic\\" type ending?.. it was as if parts of different movies/books  were taken and manipulated for this book.  All in all it would probably make a more entertaining movie than I found it as a good read. I'll think I'll pass on his next one.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|Let me qualify by saying that not only have I read all of the Fire and Ice books but before Dance with Dragons was about to come out, REREAD all the books over to refresh my memory and to savory a truly amazing author at work. I have never been so effected by an authors writings as I have with GRRM\\"s Fire & Ice books. That being said you can understand my crash of a paradise lost watching a directed and focused writer lose it. The reason I continue reading a book is because I care about the characters, I have a personal investment so to speak. I had a rough time understand and getting past the death Ned (Lord Eddard Stark),George baby that was your shot readers will give you that one. George Martin you don't understand that people have to care for your characters so when you systematically exterminate people in your book readers will eventuality ask them selves why do I what to continue reading? Who will be next? I decided that I didn't want to keep reading if at anytime,whap Half-man your gone, whap Dany your toast.<br />  Book five comes to very little conclusion. More characters are added, plots barely plod along with gregarious description. I don't know if GRRM started drinking and drugging. Maybe he loved this world he created and never wanted to it to ever end, I really don't know. What I do know is that what started out great ended up stalled in its tracks. What a shame because when he stumbled he took every one down with him.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Aweful. just no. stay away. this is just plain aweful  worst game I have ever played. ballsack I hate this game
0451228375|3.0|I have to agree with the reviewers who called this the book without end. I read and enjoyed the first one. This one wasn't much different really. Quite frankly I lost patience with it about halfway through. The plight of the characters just seemed so hopeless. I skimmed the battle scenes, the witch hunt trial, the rape scenes then pretty much just started skimming the whole thing. You know what, it was still too verbose. Then the plague as deus ex machina was just a little too...neat somehow.<br /><br />Maybe I was just in the wrong frame of mind. I have a couple of other books in my quene that I wanted to get to and just wanted to get to the end. If it had not been a library book I probably would have put it down and just finished it later.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|great for reading, sharing &amp; understanding the word of God.  only one drawback during audio reading so far is when reading my year plan audio will re read previous verses.

B000TM1CKQ|5.0|I had a problem with the delivery(UPS)of the item.  It got lost at it's stop over in Laurel.  However, when I contacted Amazon the next day they took excellent care of me.  The item was reordered and I was instructed what to do if the other item finally found it's way to me.  The item was due 12/12?  The replacement showed up in a day due to a rush order.  The original showed up yesterday 1/12 (a month late) and I was able to go on line and print out my return label very simply! As far as the product goes my Goddaughter was enjoying 5 minutes after she opened it on Christmas.  Thank you   Sandra Suydam

B000AYEL6U|2.0|I am a huge fan of British historical dramas and was disappointed.  I read a few reviews that compared it to Pride & Prejudice -and how that our male hero Mr. Thornton was akin to Mr. Darcy.  I found the story went no where and it showed the dark side of the Victorian era - If you do get it, just do not expect to see grand dresses and beautiful scenery.  This is not going to show that.    Boo.
B002ZNJW0O|5.0|The Lucky One by Nicholas Sparks is about a marine stationed in Iraq who finds a picture of a girl that becomes his good luck charm. When he makes it back to America, he sets out to find her and repay her for saving his life.<br /><br />I loved this book! Nicholas Sparks will always be a master of romantic fiction, but what makes this book better than others is the fascinating premise. Logan is an excellent character, as are all the others. The parts about Iraq are interesting and real, and the character dynamics are great. The writing is engaging and I wanted to keep reading once I'd started. So far this is my favorite Nicholas Sparks book.<br /><br />I can't wait for the movie. I was trying to picture Zac Efron as Logan and to be honest I really couldn't, not with the way Sparks wrote the character. But I think he'll be great in an adaptation, I really love him. I'm very excited to see this story on screen, I think it'll be very powerful.<br /><br />Not much more I can say except that everyone should go read this book! It's wonderfully written and extremely interesting. Sparks is fantastic.
1451648537|5.0|The number of reviews of this book, on Amazon.com, has already exceeded 900. This is quite staggering and undoubtedly reflects the public interest in Jobs; the person and his achievements. Interestingly though, very few of the 900 reviews make any mention of the book's handling of Jobs battle with cancer. And yet, Isaacson dedicated 3 chapters to this saga. So rather than just repeat what most others have said, that it is a book worth reading, I will comment a little more on the cancer theme.<br /><br />After reading the book one is left with little doubt that the physical and psychological realities of living with cancer had a significant impact on Jobs as a person. Initially he confronts the disease in a typically rebellious way, then he accepts more conventional treatments - but usually on his terms. Finally, we see a more reflective Steve Jobs, accepting the inevitable, but still believing he could have an influence on future developments in the technological world.<br /><br />There has been comment that Jobs chose some approaches to managing his cancer that were not \\"mainstream\\" and that if he had listened to more people, and accepted conventional treatment earlier on, he may have lived longer. But Isaacson threads this viewpoint into the story in such a way as to suggest that if Jobs had taken a conventional approach he wouldn't have been \\"Steve Jobs\\".<br /><br />Finally, I think that the book shows that Jobs, in his own way demonstrated that regardless of the steady progression of a life threatening cancer, by being \\"true to yourself\\" it is possible to stay in control of the situation - at least in a psychological sense - and to keep living a good life for as long as that is possible.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is about a girl named Hazel who is living with cancer. She attends a support group and meet Augustus Waters, and attractive kid who takes an interest in her. Hazel constantly worries about her parents's lives and the lives of her friends, while also struggling each day to just live.<br /><br />I loved love this book. It was so absolutely fantastic. Hazel and Augustus are great characters, and I loved Isaac too. I literally went from crying to laughing at many parts. The humor was fantastic, and everything was very realistic, although Hazel and Augustus seemed a lot smarter than any teenagers I've ever met.<br /><br />There's really not much to say. The book definitely speaks for itself. If you've read it, you know how awesome it is, and if you haven't read it, then you should read it.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />One of the things I noted early on in the book was Augustus's obsession with self-sacrifice in the video games, which I figured had to mean something.<br /><br />Augustus wants to mean something to world. He wants to be able to die having left his mark. Hazel, on the other hand, wants to leave as small a mark as possible. She sees herself as a grenade that will harm everyone when it explodes (or rather, when she dies). She tries to avoid loving Augustus because she doesn't want to hurt him when she dies. And of course, it ends up being the other way around. Saw that one coming. But anyway, through Hazel, Augustus learns that it's enough to mean something to someone else, that you don't need to die a noble and sacrificial death.<br /><br />I need to read this book again, I think. I can't quite wrap my head around all of it just yet, but I know that it was funny and entertaining, but also sad and hopeful. John Green certainly has a way with words.
B005COO1X6|1.0|The price is very steep for what you get--a very short substandard, non-intriguing, non-scary Stephen King story filled with recycled themes and unrealistic perspectives and a sneak preview (advertising for which YOU are paying) of King's latest novel. It's truly a waste of money and time.
1423113454|5.0|The Red Pyramid is the first book in Rick Riordan's Kane Chronicles. The novel switches between the points of view of Carter and Sadie Kane, a brother and sister who discover they are descendants of ancient Egyptian pharaohs. Their father is taken by Set, an Egyptian god, and they have to stop Set from destroying the world and try to save their father, all while trying to figure out who or what they are.<br /><br />The book is a promising start to the series. Carter and Sadie are fantastic main characters. They're charming and entertaining, and the reader can see them trying to figure out what to do with their lives. The Egyptian mythology is interesting and intriguing, but very complicated. It's not always clear what's going on, and the length of the book causes it to drag in some places. However, Riordan's writing is concise and interesting, and the characters keep the reader engaged.<br /><br />The last 100 pages is when the book really picked up. The end revealed some very interesting plot twists, and I'm very excited to see what happens in the next book. I love Egyptian mythology, so I found it fascinating. It's an easy read and very enjoyable. I have high hope for this series! Riordan is an artist.

1423140591|5.0|In The Son of Neptune, the second book in Rick Riordan's Heroes of Olympus series, Percy Jackson comes to a Roman camp with no memory of who he is. Hazel should have died 70 years ago. Frank doesn't understand his family history or why his life could go out with one quick blaze. The three band together to journey to Alaska and stop Gaea's plans to destroy the world.<br /><br />Riordan never ceases to impress me. This book is just as good as the first installment in the series. It's full of mythology, both Greek and Roman, and the plot is fascinating and complex. He effortlessly refers back to his other novels while still keep this series isolated. His ever-present themes of heroism and self-sacrifice are all there, and the novel doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />What I like is that even though Riordan began his writing career with Percy and his journey to become a hero, his books have evolved past that. It's clear that this book isn't all about Percy, and in fact, the real hero of the novel is Frank, whose chapters I didn't even enjoy when I first started reading. Frank discovers who he is and why he lives, while Percy just gets his memories back.<br /><br />Hazel's backstory was very interesting. I loved hearing about her past, and I loved all her interactions with Frank. Hazel's a great character. Her story is all about taking advantage of what you're giving and not mourning the past.<br /><br />It always strikes me how well informed Riordan is. He wrote about \\"ROFL\\" and \\"ROFLcopter\\", which I totally laughed out loud after reading, and he does a whole Amazon bit. He knows what young adults like and what they want to read, and he's a 47 year old man! His writing is very youth full, and that's what I liked best about his books. Plus the mythology.<br /><br />I'm very excited for the next book. Although I'm very confused about how Leois Sammy? That doesn't make sense, but I'm sure it'll be explained. Also, I'm pissed that we didn't get to see Percy reunited with Annabeth. Boo. But I totally loved this book, and everything Riordan writes is pure gold.h. Boo. But I totally loved this book, and everything Riordan writes is pure gold.

0525423656|4.0|Crossed is Ally Condie's sequel to Matched. Cassia is trying to find Ky in the Outer Provinces while learning more about the mysterious rebellion called the Rising. That's pretty much the whole book.<br /><br />I liked this book. It's not as good as Matched, but I didn't really expect it to be. Cassia and Ky's relationship is kinda boring because it's just a bunch of \\"I love him, where is he?\\" or \\"I love him, where is he mentally?\\" There isn't that much new information about the characters or their stories, though we do get more about Ky and Xander. Indie is a great new character and I'm looking forward to getting more about her. Eli wasn't very well developed, he was kinda just a replacement Bram, who I honestly don't remember at all. It seemed like everything that happened in the book could have happened within 100 pages. It felt like a transition novel to the third book, which should be very good after this one.<br /><br />Condie is a very good writer. She writes themes very well, and her writing is very interesting. Unlike Matched, which was just from Cassia's point of view, Crossed has alternating chapters from the points of view of Cassia and Ky. Which I didn't really enjoy. Most of the time they think the same thing, but Cassia doesn't know something that Ky does, but Condie doesn't want the reader to know it, so Ky never thinks about it either. What's the point of switching POV if it gives us no inside knowledge to one of the characters? Also, I forgot frequently which character's POV the chapter was in; I'd have to look around and see if they were talking to Cassia or Ky.<br /><br />The book was definitely interesting, and the ending left me wanting more. I'm really hoping the third book is just excellent. Crossed didn't stack up compared to Matched, but I think the third book will. Anyone know the title?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Well, some of the games are great for time killing and down time. That said,though, some of them are virtually unplayable, due to controls issues.  But, it was free and pretty much unlimited, it seems, as far as earning more points. You just have to find the games that work for you. Could stand a lil better instructions.
1452101248|5.0|After preparing some of the recipes in Plenty, my husband said, \\"you have made our vegetarian diet so exciting!\\". What a great compliment coming from a highly trained chef.  The recipes are delicious and allow for your own creative adaptations.  The combination of flavors and textures in the recipes are wonderful.  Most ingredients are readily available, and again, can be substituted (example, No tallegio cheese? Use Fontinella or other robust cheese instead).  Plan to enjoy some very hearty dishes (Very Full Tart), as well as, some lighter but just as satisfying dishes (Mee Goreng).  Our friends and family have not even noticed the absence of meat.  Interestingly, Chef Yotam Ottolenghi, is not a vegetarian, however, his recipes always deliver and never disappoint!  Please, enjoy Plenty.
B00526ZKYS|2.0|In this genre, there are MUCH better choices. Parts of the book felt like they were written in a 10th grade English class.  The whole premise of the society is just not believable.  Everyone is okay with getting brain surgery?  What is the advantage to this for the government?  The characters were weak which made it difficult to get close to them or care about what happens to them.  I kept hoping that something was going to happen, some twist of plot that would salvage a rather predictable and dull book...unfortunately it didn't come.  Not terrible but not the best and NOTHING like the Hunger Games, jeez.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I was excited to see a paid &quot;premium&quot; remote program on here and with so many good reviews.  this app is terrible,  it has a 4-10sec lag. I tried it yesterday while I was home and bored, it was just awful.

B0068RHGJM|2.0|I guess the first thing that needs to be cleared up in any Nightwish album review, is that I am not a \\"Tarja Troll\\" and actually rank \\"Dark Passion Play\\" as my 2nd favorite Nightwish album behind only \\"Once\\". Actually, Anette isn't even the problem I have with this album - her performance is the BEST by far. The album quite simply doesn't \\"rock\\" as much as DPP. (Dark Passion Play) I think Tuomas simply pushed this circus them for the album a bit too far, and I found it interwoven into some of the songs unnecessarily, or interrupting in the middle and killing the momentum of a song entirely. Dark Passion Play is far superior, so I again reiterate that this is not an \\"Anette isn't good in Nightwish\\" because that album was fantastic. I'll briefly break down the tracks, since I imagine most people won't like my review because I didn't blindly \\"Oh masterpiece, five stars, bravo!\\" like many people are doing. This album feels like solo material from each band member that was piece together. A few tracks have like 3 or 4 musical themes interwoven together, and I just don't think it flows well at all. If you want circus music, cut a track or two with circus music - don't put it in half the songs.   #1 - Taikatalvi: Meh, not really a song IMO. It's just random talking and instrumentals. It's fine I guess.   #2 - Storytime: The first full song. The first time I heard this I wasn't overly impressed. It's not a bad song (one of the better ones) but I wanted a killer song to open the album like DPP had \\"The Poet and the Pendulum (arguably the first or second most epic song the band has ever done behind maybe Ghost Love Score). Maybe I expect too much from this song opening the album. The song certainly has the Nightwish feel, that's indisputable.   #3 - Ghost River: Quite possibly the worst Nightwish song ever. I don't like the feel of the song, and Marco isn't really singing, he's chanting stuff in an irritating octave. Marco's voice isn't shot, I just really don't like how he'ssinging at all on this song (and I like him in past efforts, so it's not a knock on him). There's too much going on in this song, it has horrible flow.   #4 - Slow, Love, Slow: Picture Anette going back in time, to the 1940's Gangsta lifestyle in America. Now picture her sitting on a piano singing to a room full of people. That's basically what this song is, and if I am not mistaken, Tuomas said he was inspired from something from that era. People will either like this song or not like it IMO. I'll probably skip it more than I listen to it.   #5 - I Want My Tears Back: After back to back not very good songs, the band gets back on track with a better song. I've seen a few reviewers really geeking out over this song, not sure why. It's decent, but pretty much EVERY song on Dark Passion Play is better than this. The last third of the song turns into a cross between the Islander, and some random circus music.   #6 - Scaretale: I like how the song begins. I think this song had \\"opening track\\" written all over it. Has a slight \\"Poet and the Pendulum\\" feel to the beat. Then around the 4 min mark, a full on circus them emerges in the dead middle of the song, and kills any and all momentum this song had. Massive, massive letdown. Not a fan at all. If I wanted to hear circus music, I could go buy \\"Best of Barnum and Bailey vol 1\\" but I didn't. The rest of the song pisses me off.   # 7 - Arabesque: Arabian music. No vocals. Give it a listen, see what you think. It's 2:36, so it's almost over before you can form an opinion. It's ok I guess, no real strong feelings either way.   #8 - Turn Loose The Mermaids: Not bad. It has a slow feel with the bulk of the tracks effectiveness being carried by Anette's voice. I like it.  #9 - Rest Calm: The beginning drags a bit, feels like a complete filler track. I like Anette's singing, but the musical direction on this track feels highly uninspired like they just wanted to finish the song. Not crazy about this song at all, the flow is all over the place, with a random chorus of kids joining the band in the middle of the song.   #10 - The Crow, The Owl And The Dove: Doesn't even feel like a Nightwish song. Actually, that's the problem with this album - a lot of it feels like random solo material from the band mushed together. That's the problem.   #11 - Last Ride Of The Day: The heaviest track since....the opening track? Good song, it's a shame more song with a slightly heavier theme were not included on this album.   #12 - Song of Myself: Starts off well enough, slowly builds into something that feels like it will be an explosion of rock/metal worth headbanging too. Fast guitars, solid flow and drumming - check. The song is also 13 min long and seems to have a few different themes to the music, but at least every theme is good. Then the 7:30 spot or so, we go into some random talking and we once again kill the momentum of the song. I feel like I'm listening to an audio book, not a song. Eventually the music disappears and various band members are just talking. Boring.   #13 - Imaginerium: Not really a song, just pieces of music from other songs.   I'm not very excited for this album, and I can tell I do not need to \\"let it grow on me\\" I know what I like and do not like pretty quickly. Dark Passion Play was great, but this album just doesn't do it  for me at all.   I sincerely hope many others like this album for one huge reason: I do not want to see album sales be poor and Tumoas start to think \\"Oh maybe Anette is the problem, maybe I need a new singer\\" because the problem is NOT her. At all. It's the rest of the band this time around. Tumoas should of focused on writing good songs, not adhering to a circus theme and letting it muddle his normally exceptional song writing ability. I still plan to see them on tour and will likely enjoy them immensely. Just not a fan of this album. Sorry.
B005GUQIDC|4.0|Kimbra is a true talent.  Comparisons to Nina Simone, and Amy Winehouse are justified.  She has real talent, and this album is great, and she is beautiful to boot, however, if you watch her \\"Live at Sing Sing\\" videos on you-tube, you will see that she cannot be contained by a conservatively produced album.  She is a force to be reckoned with, is an incredible presence in her live performances, and her albums need to reflect that better otherwise she is being sold short.    Don't get me wrong, I like this album a lot, but it really only captures about %50 of what she is capable of.  She needs to establish a presence in Europe and the US, get her album available on amazon in the US as a proper, cheap album rather than an import.    I hope she gets the recognition she deserves as one of the best female singers currently producing music!
1588167461|5.0|This is a really good book. People mentioned the lack of color, but if anything it is a very small issue. Sure it would be nice at times, but it is the only negative thing about the book. The BW pictures don't take away from the book. Its a great intro to style and helping you create your own.<br />I was surprised on how much it went into, not just wear this with this, or this is how you wear this, but it went it to the history of clothes and other great side topics. It show different styles of different iconic men in the recent history that were actors musicians and other famous people that had good style. A really good handbook to help you look good.<br />I was debating get this or a couple of the other style books on Amazon. I settled with this one, and was glad I did. It is put together very well and the layout is really clean and pretty. Very well designed!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is definitely a must read! I never thought I would enjoy it as much as I did. THis book, along with the two others are now among my favorites.

B002NWRMVS|1.0|Norah Jones music all sounds too much the same!  At first it was refreshing, and her first album was a breakaway smash selling over 10 million copies.  The second sold half, five million, and the third which became extremely boring only sold 2 million, The Fall speaks for itself.  It's a Fall to the bottom, these songs and arrangements are terrible, the recording is bad, no passion in the delivery.  In less than 10 years Norah has became a has been!  And she can't go back and make another Come Away With me or Feels Like Home because she's already been there.  She needs a serious change to ever become popular again!

B005J9ZDYK|2.0|After being pleasantly surprised by Season #1 of Shaun the Sheep, I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife looking forward to many more intriguing farm life adventures with Shaun. Sadly, something has changed between Season #1 and Season #2. Not just the farmers cat and Bitzer's face - something more fundamental. Whereas the first season's episodes drew the audience in to the entertaining farm life of these silly clay animals, the second season's episodes just seem to rush from one dumb joke to the next. Is it because of a new director, new writers? I don;t know, but it is distinctly different. The light hearted charm of season #1 cannot be found in season #2. In addition, whereas season #1 was not offensive, season #2 often shows examples of Shaun or the other animals stealing, or destroying things for fun. And, is it just me, or is the farmer's underwear in EVERY SINGLE season #2 episode?     I must admit that I had high hopes for Season #2, and I have been disappointed. Perhaps Season #3 will go back to the original wit and style of season #1? I can only hope....
B005KELS6Q|5.0|If you are expecting something that you can keep your Kindle in while you read, this will not work. It is simply a storage and transport sleeve. That being said, it's perfect. I had a folding style case for my Kindle that I did not care for, I found that way uncomfortable. This is good. I can store and transport my kindle in a safe manner, keeping it safe from splashes, dirt, etc. It also will protect the screen from scratches and damage, but when you are ready to read, you simply remove it and read.<br /><br />So if you like to have a case for your kindle, but don't want to read it in the case, this is for you. You can protect your kindle for storage and transport, but still read sans case.
B004KZOWEG|4.0|King Leoplold's Ghost is such a well written account of the antecedents and events of a mostly forgotten dark chapter in the history of Colonial Africa that it is rather difficult to put the book down. For non-fiction this is quite remarkable. The narrative pulls you along. You could be reading a good novel - except that the misery visited upon the hapless tribes of the Congo region is all too real - and hard for Westerners living in wealth and freedom to comprehend.  Hochschild consults a great many sources to give us a first-hand flavour of what went on in The Congo Free State (the personal fiefdom of Leopold the Second, King of the Belgians) at the close of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries; and it was horrifying: an unedifying scramble for riches (ivory and then rubber) that took little or no heed of the value of human life.  Many larger than life characters people the story, none more so than Henry Morton Stanley. We are given a rather unflattering picture of Stanley, the African explorer. The author finds little to commend him and shows the dark side to exploration of the Dark Continent. (I can't help but think that Hochschild has gone out of his way to blacken Stanley's name as he presents some irrelevant (to the story) facts to make the explorer look pitiful.)  The Belgians come out of it all looking absolutely horrid (and rightfully so) but to be fair to them it is noted that the French and the Germans in their quest for the riches that rubber promised were equally murderous towards their native vassals in their own African spheres of influence. In particular, the Germans tried to exterminate the Herero people in German East Africa which amounts to the genuine article of genocide (something that, technically, the Belgians did not commit). The German, Lt. General Lothar von Trotha, issued an actual extermination order following a Herero uprising. But then Hochschild, in his haste to rope all Colonial powers into this moral quaqmire, accuses Britain \\"for its killing of aboriginies in Australia, in accordance with extermination orders as ruthless as von Trotha's\\".  Here Hochschild goes way too far. For all the misery visited upon the aboriginies of Australia there was never anything like an extermination order. No such documents have ever existed. On the contrary, the first Governor New South Wales (ie the first colony of what would eventually become Australia) was expressly charged to look out for the welfare of native Australians. Granted things went badly for Australian aboriginies (mostly via the agency of disease), but genocide is one thing of which the colonial governments of Australia cannot be accused.     Elsewhere, Hochschild it at great pains to inform us that the Arab slave traders of the east coast (based in Zanzibar) were not in fact Arab, but \\"Afro-Arab\\". He harps on about this over and over again. I fail to see what relevance this has to the story of the misery of exploitation of native Africans in the Congo. It is remarkable the moral equivalence Hochschild indulges in as he fails to condemn the (Afro-) Arab traders but condemns the Europeans.   Hochschild's descriptions of \\"Afro-Arab\\" Tippu Tip (Hamed bin Muhhamed el Murjebi), an `owner' of 10,000 slaves, a slave trader and ivory dealer is far more sympathetic than his portrayal of Stanley, who for all his faults was no slave owner nor trader. Perhaps it is the inexplicable desire to apologise for muslims at every possible moment lest they be slighted by 'racist' Westerners that motivates authors such as Hochschild. Who can tell?  The real hero of the story is E. D. Morel, a British humanitarian who did more than anyone to alleviate the plight of the oppressed Africans. He is truly an unsung and unknown hero. Hochschild likes Morel especially as he ascribes a virtual Marxist worldview to him - but then scolds him for the defect of believing in free trade (Imagine that!: believing in the merits of free trade!) (But Hochschild later contradictshimself as he mentions a lack of free trade as a reason that Africa has not prospered since the end of the Colonial Period).  A couple of  times in the book Hochschild draws a parallel between the actions of the Belgians in the Congo with that of the US in Vietnam. Considering how abhorrent was the behaviour of the Belgians this is a particularly gratuitous and unfounded slur. For all the faults of the US in Vietnam we must understand the conflict in terms of  the Cold War. The US was not in Vietnam press-ganging the populace into slave labour to enrich itself and murdering people en masse at a whim as where the Belgians in the Congo.   These cases where Hochscild, in his eagerness to smear all Western powers, goes too far do mar the book. But such defects are minor in comparison to his grand overview of the tragedy that befell the people who inhabited the area now know as The Democratic Republic of the Congo. Hochschild concludes the book with a look at what happened after the era of Leopold (post 1908) and in the post-colonial era (after 1960). And he looks at the country's prospects. He is not hopeful.  All up, \\" King Leopold's Ghost\\" is a book I can recommend as essential reading for anyone unacquainted with a story that must be a leading candidate for the darkest chapter of Colonial African history.

B004EPZ07U|1.0|In all honesty, I do feel misled by the promise of a digital copy with this purchase.  I travel a bit and like to have movies on my iPad, so this is one of the main reasons for purchasing the disc.  However, like other reviewers, much to my dismay I found that there really wasn't a digital copy included, as I've come know and expect.  Instead, there is something called Ultraviolet that makes you register at two different sites in order to stream the video (up to 3 times within some timeframe).  Even after registering at the two sites, I never could get the movie to steam, much less download an actual copy that I could synch to my iPad, as I wanted.  This led me on a quest to get my own digital copy, as I thought I was getting orignally.  What I did was look at several DVD copying apps that I found through Google search and through CNET.  Some of these were separate apps to decrypt videos, and then some that would convert DVD (VOD) files into iTunes format (M4V).  I've a 9 year old Dell 8250 computer with a Pentium 4 3.0 GHZ processor and experimenting with video files took a long time and sometimes I had to let the apps work overnight!  I think there are several apps out there that can do the job.  I found some ran quite slowly, and some the menus were confusing or I never did figure out how to load a folder of the DVD files that constitute a movie, rather they seemed insistent on ripping/converting a single file so I never did quite figure that out.  But of the 1/2 dozen or so I tried, the one that I liked best was DVDFab (despite the monkey \\"mascot\\").  I've no financial interest in this software - as I write this, I'm using the free 21 day trial version, but I do like it and will likely get a full copy once my trial is up.  What I like about it was that the menus were quite intuitive, it has some nice options but not overwhelmingly complex, and it rips and converts together so I don't need separate apps to do it.  Having said that, I'm sure there are others that will do the job and you might want to experiment a bit on your own if you have the time and patience.  With my chosen app, it still did take some experimenting, the default options produced an iPad compatible file but was of poor video quality / had noticeable pixilation (and small file size - just 800 MB when I was expecting something more like 1.5 GB - 2 GB (usually 1GB per hour is about right).  So what seemed to work well was to set a custom output resolution of 854 x 480 (the DVD's native resolution), bumped the audio encoder from 96 to 160 because, in music anyway, I'm sensitive to the degredation of the quality when the rate falls too low, and these options produced a quite good quality video at around 1.7 GB that took my computer about 2 hours to run.  On other thing to mention that you might like, when you import this new video file into your iTunes movie folder, it will not have the image of the movie or some other movie informaiton that you'll see for your other files.  So right click on the file name within iTunes movie folder, select \\"get info\\" and then the \\"info\\" tab, you can add the year (2011) and genre (action & adventure) and under the \\"artwork\\" tab, select \\"add\\" and add a jpeg.  I should have mentioned first to grab a Green Lantern DVD cover picture by right-clicking on it and saving it on your hard drive.  Then from within iTunes, when you are in the get info/artwork tab, and selecting \\"add\\" you can point to the jpeg file and iTunes will use this picture from now one and it will look just like your other videos!
B001BANK32|5.0|I enjoyed the movie version of this book, and I'll admit I couldn't help but picture Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance. The movie never really frightened me, though, whereas I can say for a fact that there were more than a few times after reading in bed at night that as I closed my eyes to go to sleep I kept hearing, \\"The Red Death held sway over all! Unmask! Unmask!\\" I really enjoyed how much more of Danny's point of view is expressed in the novel, whereas I felt that the movie centered on Jack with Danny as more of an afterthought.   *Spoiler to anyone who hasn't read the book or watched the movie* It was definitely much more impacting to read about Jack trying to murder Wendy at the end of the novel versus watching it. The entirety of this scene seems to happen very quickly in the movie, and there is just something very different about seeing someone get hit with a mallet and actually reading about how the ribs break and the back is broken and how agonizing it is just to try and get away from this horrible thing trying to kill you.    *End of spoiler* King paints such a vivid picture of pain and terror, that I actually felt my own heart rate climb and my eyes get wider and wider with each sentence. Amazing. Simply put, pure perfection and I highly recommend to anyone looking for a pretty unsettling and fascinating read.

B003U80I5G|4.0|George C Scott's portrayal of Mr.Rochester was excellent!  His portrayal fit Austen's character closer than any other's.  I would have liked the story fleshed out more in this version instead of condensed to a certain time length.  Overall, a fine performance worth seeing.
B003Y5H4YI|4.0|If you were expecting James Bond or Mission Impossible, this was not your movie.  This is a story about three Mossad agents who fail in their assignment, lie to cover up their failure and the toll that takes on them.  The story line is good and progresses logically.  Every actor in this movie did an excellent job with varying amounts of understatement.  The locations used in the movie were very realistic and set the proper \\"feel\\" for the movie.<br /><br />I would have given this movie 5 stars, but for two things.<br /><br />1.  When you have a story that requires the use of the same characters at different ages and can't do it with make-up,you need to use actors that look like the same character at different ages.  While the Jessica Chastain/Helen Mirren match-up worked, Marton Csokas and Tom Wilkinson neither look nor sound like they could be the same person.  The same for Sam Worthington and Ciaran Hinds...and Ciaran Hinds is 4\\" taller than Sam Worthington.<br /><br />2.  This is the second movie where Mossad agents are portrayed as poorly trained and emotionally unprepared for for their assignment.  When things don't go as planned, the command structure comes unglued and they all get very emotional.  It is very reminiscent of the movie Munich, in which Ciaran Hinds' character died, too.  I can only wonder about why they are portrayed that way.<br /><br />Still, I enjoy \\"spy movies\\" where the spies aren't supermen driving souped up cars and blowing everything to bits.

It arrived in a timely manner, however the BRAND NEW DVD was physically damaged!  I am so annoyed with the situation that I don't even feel like contacting the seller in any way!  It wouldn't be so bad, except the product was packaged properly, and should not have broken!
B003Y5H54W|4.0|My husband and I watched this movie some time back, and loved it.  This copy was for my teenaged granddaughter.  It is a twist on the generally accepted \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" storyline.  If you like the true Grimm versions of fairytales, you will love this movie.
B000BZIT5M|5.0|I have been been to many Bohemes since 1950 and saw the Covent Garden production recorded here in London with Aragall instead of Shicoff. My at home listening encompases many recordings from Toscanini's to present day Dvd's.  This is a great Boheme!!! The sound is a drop perhaps echoey, but is not disqualifying. Cortrubas IS Mimi.  Shicoff is a lyrical but rich voiced Rudolfo.  A young Thomas Allen is wonderful as Marcello. The Musetta is very special.  Don't let this one get away!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was great lots of fun games plus its free all the better I defanetly would recommend this game you should get it
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. its a great way to get your game better. I play the computer and can undo a move which helps me earn confidence and see how to see moves easier
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very much addictive! when I cant pass a game I just have to keeping playing until it is mastered!
076790592X|5.0|This is an excellent book mainly because it is a real-life story of Professor Morrie Schwartz. As a dying man, he made good use of his situation and expounded his wisdom in life.
1455869880|5.0|Loved it. Fastest I've ever read a book in my life. It's so worth it. Get it. You won't regret it.

B00000JTB2|5.0|The combination of Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan is incredible.  A must have if you are a fan of either artist.  I enjoyed this CD immensely.
B005NUFU9S|5.0|Two episodes from the end of the season....I don't think I can wait until fall for more.  I've been watching Dr. Who for many years and season 6 is just about as good as they get. Matt Smith is great and gives Eccleston and Tennant a run for their money. I LOVE this franchise. (I guess I'll re-watch Baker until the new stuff arrives.)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app.  Use it everyday.  Great way to keep up with reading daily.  The reading plans are helpful to keep you on track
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Cover is very durable, love that it keeps my kindle safe.  Love the closure and how you can prop your Kindle up to read or watch a video.  Great product!
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I'm on my 3rd swivel sweeper so they must be doing something right because I keep buying them. As as been mentioned by other reviewers, the sweeper has no vacuum capability - just a brush on each side. They are fantastic for picking up the miscellaneous debris tracked in by my dogs and I can run one around the house in a matter of minutes. The weakness is the battery. I had my first sweeper for a couple of years before the battery gave out. My next one was the G2 model and it only lasted a couple of months so I went back to the original. I'm going to baby the battery on this one because it's a very useful little gadget.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app has everything a weather app should have. I love the graphics and ease of use. So far has been accurate and loads quickly, unlike others I have used in the past.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the one click movement of the cards. The graphics are nice and since it's a free version there are ads but they are small and are after you finish each game.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game with so much levels to explore....brought the movie and received a hint to unlock yet more levels, can't beat that......thanks dev team and amazon For saving me money on entertainment on my evo shift!!
B000002J7U|5.0|I was very happy that they arrived in such short time and every thing was very correct,I love doing business with Amazon.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|Will keep the kids occupied for some time. Might be a little hard for the really young kids but great app to have! very much enjoyable. graphics are okay . Thanks dev team and amazon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so disturbing that I felt disgusted at how into it I was.  I can't believe that someone came up with a story like this!  Once you start reading it, you will not put it down.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Will be a great app to use to look at the night or day sky...  Haven't played around with it a whole lot. But still very nice to have ...thanks dev team and amazon!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought that I had this book all figured out after reading the first one.  I thought I knew what was going to happen, who would be a part of the games, and who would fall in love with whom.  I was completely wrong on all counts.  This book was absolutely nothing like what I expected it to be, and for that reason I loved it even more!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Had gotten this for my hp tablet, also will be a great addition to my evo shift .. Thanks dev team and amazon for offering for free!!!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This series is absolutely phenomenal.  I feel like the characters are people that I actually know in real life, and I find that while I am waiting for the 8th book to be written and published, I am actually missing these people!
B005GVF95O|4.0|Nice little challenge for the kids. Will keep them entertain for a wee bit.  Cute graphics. Thanks dev team and amazon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series was not only incredibly entertaining, but it makes you take stock in a lot of things from your own life.  I hope it is not a glimpse into our own future after we destroy our country and our government goes awry.
0525478817|5.0|I am 17 years old (on my Mom's account) and an avid book reader and never have I found a book as heartbreaking and as compelling as this one. John has been and will always be my favorite author & hero. This book brought me on an unfathomable journey that made me laugh hysterically and cry so hard. There is no slow part to this book. Once the book begins it takes off. The imagery of the Amsterdam scenes was just brilliant and John Green describes the emotions so well, I began to feel them along side the main characters. This is the kind of book I will remember when I am 90. I will reccomend this to all of my friends. Although, the only part I did get a little frustrated on is how he ended the story like Peter ended his book. I want to know what happens to everyone!   One caution: This book is IMPOSSIBLE to put down. I refused to put it down in school and kind of regretted it when I got to the sad part and began to cry in my yoga class.
B0036S4CTS|3.0|This is just another typical loves story between friends who can never really seem to get the timing right on their relationship.  I expected great things after hearing rave reviews from my friends, but I think the book fell a little short.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|you have the amp to drive them. Something like a Burson Audio HA-160D does a great job and really allows the headphones come alive.
B0059XTTXC|1.0|I'll make this short and not so sweet.  This movie was dullsville!  Thriller of the year?  Did Rolling Stone and and the New York Times send out the comatose former employees or what?!  Actually, this movie could have been great,maybe, but the editing blows beyond comprehension! It is hard to follow, and completely dull.  There is very little action in this film, the flashbacks are extremely hard to follow.  And in all honesty, it's about as uninteresting as the rest of John leCarre's novels.
B004U5WZG8|5.0|I enjoyed the entire album very much, especially \\"1901\\", which has been played frequently by KCRW. \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" is a charming song with beautiful harmonies, but it is over so soon.  What am impressive album, and what a truly nice voice Birdy has.  All but one song are covers, but then she is only 15.  So, what did you accomplish by age 15?
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I was using springpad but could not find a springpad app for kindle fire.  Evermore is perfect for rememberinng web sites across my devices.  I save sites photos and notes.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote has to be the next best thing that has come along for me as a graduate student. Organization, ideas, easy to navigate and to input info. I love it and would definitely recommend it to those that are extremely busy.
031617615X|5.0|Great service...great price....a Christmas gift for one who had not read the book but had seen the movie part 1.  will order again
0374275637|5.0|I cannot review this item from the perspective of a reader because I have not yet read it.  I gave it as a gift, but it has turned out extremely well in that respect.  The recipient is delighted with it and is actually reading it while being very pressed for time
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I must say I was very surprised at the level I enjoyed reading this book. I normally stick to business books, biographies, sports related books and have not strayed to the story world, but i enjoyed every second of this book. I could not put it down. i would highly recommend it for anyone looking to read a fast paced action packed book.
B004529NLG|4.0|I'm a fan of 3D, and I bought this movie based on the enthusiastic reviews of its use of 3D. I wasn't disappointed, and I've always liked dance and dance music so the movie entertained me. I have to say, though, that the little girl who appears briefly in the Final Jam and during the credits, was IMHO the best dancer of them all. She had attitude in spades, and her performance was, as they say, worth the price of admission.
0062014102|1.0|So, I was looking for a very recent book that would explain the holographic principle to someone familiar with science but not advanced physics. Amongst all the scientific giants of astrophysics, laid this book. The publication date said 2011, the title was right and the book it was with were right. Having not read the book description carefully enough, I end up with this scientifically ancient book (copyright 1991) that is mostly filled with hokum and the left field of pseudoscience. Not to mention, when I search for a book on \\"holographic principle of the universe\\" I have to wade through dozens of other New Age mumbo jumbo books not about real science at all because of the bandwagon of new age authors using the holographic principle as a launch pad for all kinds of unsupported superstitions. Talbot, you have ruined the name \\"Holographic Principle\\". The only other book on the topic that was **actually** written in the last five years and is scientifically sound is by Leonard Susskind and filled with advanced physics equations and jargon beyond my reckoning. I have a Ph.D. in chemistry. Talbot's \\"The Holographic Universe\\" book is not a good science book for scientists or laypersons. I wish someone would write a good, scientifically reasonable book about the holographic universe for laypeople. Perhaps I will have to learn General Relativity math first and read Susskind's book.
0307165485|5.0|This was one of my favorite books as a child and I was ecstatic to see I could buy a copy for my kids!  I was hoping my kids (ages 2.5 & 4.5) would like this book as much as I did....and they do!  My kids like that there is a variety of things in the book.  They enjoy looking at the pages that just have pictures as much as they like having the short stories read to them.<br /><br />The cover maybe needs to be changed.  As a parent, I'm not crazy that the lion is smoking a pipe.  Maybe take the pipe out of his mouth but keep the same cover.  That's just my opinion.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun great time waster some games are easyier then others I honestly dont know what else to say I am nt very far
0321356683|5.0|A must-read for anyone with a little Java experience who wants to become a more solid developer. Within a week of starting it, I was using insights from it to fix things in my own code. It's well-organized, well-explained, comprehensive, and full of useful and intelligible examples. Bloch's credentials speak for themselves, and his advice is golden.
0141192429|4.0|The Lady in White, written by Wilkie Collins in 1859, is considered to be among the first mystery novels. The story is an early example of detective fiction with the hero, Walter Hartright, employing many of the sleuthing techniques of later private detectives. It has been produced on stage and as a film dozens of times. The story is also unique in that it is told by a series of narrators. A device that Vera Caspary used so well in the classic noir, Laura, which was also produced as a stage play.   Late one night, art teacher Walter Hartright is walking from Hampstead to London when he counters a ghostly woman dressed all in white. He helps her on her way to London but later learns that she has escaped from an asylum. The next day, he meets his new pupils, Laura Fairlie and her half-sister, Marian, and discovers that the sisters have mysterious ties to the woman in white.   Hartright can see that Laura has a striking resemblance to the woman in white, named Anne Catherick. The mentally unstable Anne had lived for a time in Cumberland as a child and was devoted to Laura's mother, who first dressed her in white. While she is ill, Laura is tricked into travelling to London. Her identity and that of Anne's are then switched. Anne dies of a heart condition and is buried in Cumberland as Laura, while Laura is drugged and placed in the asylum as Anne. When Marian visits the asylum hoping to learn something from Anne, she is startled to find... Laura alive!  Marian bribes the nurse and Laura escapes.   Although the text is slightly dated, as one might expect, the structure, the plot and the characters are timeless.
B005Z271Y6|4.0|Blueray was great except for the labeling. The songlist did not follow the actual performance! The sound and video quality was excellent.
0525478817|5.0|Honestly, I there aren't words for this book. I could never put the experience into words. The laughter. The sobbing. Literally. I have NEVER cried so hard from a book in my life. And I am a cry-er. At one point I set it down and swore I couldn't finish it. It took me 15 minutes to calm down and pick it back up. John Green truly brings Hazel and Augustus to life. The sweet, tender, apprehensive, and adorable romance is perfect. Green paints a tragic, painful, beautiful, funny, tender, sweet, raw, honest portrait of life and death. I was literally laughing and crying at the same time. I also spent a good deal of time squee-ing, smiling, giggling, and the sweet and beautiful romance. The tender moments Green painted so perfectly. TFiOS is pure perfection. John Green has truly outdone himself. And after finishing it all I could think was, \\"God, I need a hug.\\"
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it very easy to play and not bogged down with other items. I like this one over many others out there
0740797719|5.0|I have taken several art classes at a local college and I learned WAY more from this book than I did in those classes. James Gurney is very clear and to the point for each topic he covers. Just the visuals alone in this book are awesome! I usually will check out an art book at the library before I commit to buying it. Not here- I could tell right away from flipping through it that it was totally worth it.<br />Highly recommended for any aspiring artist!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I received this case for Christmas after getting the Kindle Fire as a gift also!  I love the artistic look of it as well as the look of elegance and sophistication.  It is very easy to insert the Kindle into the straps of the case and it holds the Kindle tightly providing a secure cover for the screen as well as the entire reader.  The case is very easy to hold with your fingers inserted in the pocket and the cover \\"bent backwards\\", but I'm so cautious about any creases in the spine of the cover, I hate to use it in the way it's designed to hold like this!  Just my preference of not wanting to hurt the cover I suppose :)  I would recommend this cover to anyone who wants an attractive, great cover for their Kindle Fire.
0060873027|1.0|The title and incomplete introduction were no doubt Michael Crichton.  All that follows was more likely to have been authored by my fifth grade daughter.  No offense to my daughter, but this 'book' reeks. Character development is non-existent; conversations are non-believable and the overall writing is sophomoric. Save your money, or better yet, donate it to a Crichton charity.
B005TMSN4E|5.0|I own a Nikon D60 and bought the telphoto, Micro and f1/8 10m lense.  When seeing the Nikon v1 I wanted this camera and spent the close to $900 for the single lense 10-30m version.  With the F mount I can use all the previous lense, also the telephoto 55-200m gives me closer to 400m (I read about it and it really is true) due to sensor diffrence (I am not sure why but it works).  Now I can take advantage of the V1 and not pay for the lenses twice.  Anyone who is on a budget and has  previous lenses should look into the F Mount.
0307595579|5.0|I am an advid reader who prefers biographies and nonfictional books, but discovered that Stieg Larsson was one of the best authors I've read.  On the last book, I read it slowly because I wanted to savor it knowing there would not be future books written by Mr. Larsson (death).  The tight control he has on his characters, the unbearable tension, the puzzling clues and the human reaction between characters kept me reading way into the night. Larsson's books do focus on dark subject matters but as a way to educate the public. Thomas Harris was a favorite author but felt he betrayed his loyal fans by writing a silly sequel \\"Hannible\\" In \\"Hannible\\" Clarice Starling's beliefs and values were compromised.  I have not read any more books by Thomas Harris.  When author's writings become too formula driven, I lose interest (e.g./Danielle Steel. Furthmore I felt the best Thomas Harris book written is \\"Red Dragon\\" and not (Silence of the \\"Lamb\\").  Be sure to read the Larsson books in their sequential order.  This Larsson trilogy of books has my highest praise and recommendation for a thrilling and chilly read.
159562015X|5.0|Strengthfinders is a great way to find your strengths as the title implies. I received it as part of a OPM management training course and it really focused on revealing my main five strenghs. I liked it so much that I bought and gave copies to my wife and son so they can find their strengths, too. I felt this was important because when they go to a job interview, they can give a solid answer when asked about their strengths. If you have not tried it and wondering if it works, it's a no-brainer. Read the first chapter, find your individual passcode and then take the web-based test. Everyone should take it to get a better handle on what you're really good at and perhaps change the direction of your career towards work that you are better suited for. A must for mid-career people thinking about changing jobs. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Good luck!
0452287022|3.0|I don't get what all the fuss is about.  This is a middling story at best, though decently written.<br /><br />I appreciated the look into Dutch life 300 years ago, but little else.  I didn't come away with much after reading it.  I found a few of the characters interesting but they were for the most part flat.  No secrets were revealed, no one changed or grew.  I didn't become emotionally attached to any of them.  The plot was dull and predictable with little bright spots that offered potential, but were left unexplored by the author.<br /><br />Read this when you haven't much else to read, but don't go out of your way to get your hands on it.
0385523912|5.0|Well written, very insightful, and a bit depressing...  I read 1984 by George Orwell shortly after and it drew many parallels.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this app for my kindle fire a few days ago. Game has worked really well on it so far.  If you like solitaire,  get this game.
B0015DROBO|3.0|There was so much hype around this book so I decided to buy it.  Millions of people can't be wrong, right?  Well I started reading it and was bored to tears.  I put it aside and picked it up again a year later deciding I was going to read this book if it killed me.  For it to be so popular, it has to get better right?  Well, it did about half way through the book, then got boring again.  There was so much blah blah blah blah during the first half of the book I found myself skipping pages just to get past the parts where too much time was spent on not important information.  Finally half way through the book (52% according to my Kindle) I started to care about what was going on and getting into the mystery.  I was really in to it and thought woooo this is going to be juicy!!  Then the mystery was just sort of over.  I don't think there was enough tension with \\"the bad guy\\", it just sort of was done.  Then the last 10% of the book went back to finishing the blah blah blah blah blah from the beginning. I kept reading hoping I'd turn the page and be wowed at something, then the book was over.  I have all 3 books in the series and was reluctant to pick of the others.  I just didn't really get into the characters when reading this book.<br /><br />Overall, it was an OK book.  It was a story with a lot of potential but too much focus on the boring details.  The Swedish movie version was a good representation of just the interesting parts from the book.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really liked book 1, and book 2 was good. This one went along ok, but I really, really did not like the ending. I'll try not to spoil anything, but one character I've never really cared about ended up in a situation I totally disapprove of, while a character I always rooted for did not end up where I had really hoped that character would. In a way, it's tarnished the whole series for me, because it means I disagree with the author and was somehow on the wrong track from the beginning. It's just disappointing. As for reviewers who say readers who disapprove wanted a fairy tale, actually I would have been satisfied with much more a tragedy. What it feels like to me is that the author tried to mix in some tragedy and some fairy tale, and I didn't like either of them. I confess myself now disappointed in the series as a whole.
B004G600A4|5.0|I really liked this one and requested it from my Husband for Christmas.<br /><br />You know the plot, so here's my takes on things.<br /><br />I LOVE that the horse is his own character and not a side-kick.  He is a kick-butt cop, doing his job at all costs.  He is the typical humanized animal with projected feelings, but it's a kids movie, he's supposed to be.<br /><br />Our star grows and learns to stand up for herself and be independent and make decisions for herself.  Our hero grows and learns to think of other people and make sacrifices for the one he loves.<br /><br />Our villain...maybe the creepiest ever for me.  The fact she is psychologically controlling/abusing a child from infancy is just really super disgusting and creepy to me.  So, definitely not light on villain for me.<br /><br />Cons would be the typical; they fall in love in about 2 days.  Not terribly realistic, but often occurs in movies.<br /><br />Love the chameleon, he's adorable.  Great movie!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|youversion is an amazing tool and a wonderful resource for reading the Bible. Social tools, highlighting, bookmarking, and taking notes make this a superb app.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is one of our favorite CD's.  My husband insisted I buy him a 2nd copy for Christmas because his was too damaged.  So I did.  He was thrilled.  This is his favorite band and they have so much material he can pretty much listen to nothing else and always be listening to something new.  This is one of their classics.  I like they're newer stuff better, but this is classic RHCP.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I c Hoffman think.that this is a very very very fun game and there classic games kinda that makes it more funner
B005EVVESM|5.0|I LOVED their first CD, then was disappointed by their 2nd.  This CD is great like the first one.  I am a bit in love with Adam Levine.  I mean his voice.  Not his hotness....Okay maybe that too.  There are some great songs that really show off his voice on this CD and it feels more like the first one, but more mature.  Great new album!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app! It's very easy to use. Great time waster if you are stuck in the doctors office.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game even though I often quit due to difficulty. I would recommend it to people who often travel. it is a great time waster.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|I really did enjoy these movies. After being very skeptical, my boyfriend talked me into watching them with him and I truly like them.  This was a great finale!
B003PBB4ME|1.0|[[VIDEOID:moHDMDBY1T1JKZ]]I bought this based on reviews and I must say I was horrified when mine was delivered. I would not trust my video camera to this flimsy piece of plastic. I cannot say anything good about this product - I guess you get what you pay for.  I have added a video to demonstrate some of its shortcomings.
B004WR125O|5.0|I love this tiny functional  piece attached to my new Onkyo receiver.  Fast response when you use it. No complaint whatsoever yet. I highly recommend  this accessory!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|nice games with all different types of games to choose from. Really cool to see some of the older games refine even better
0439023521|5.0|Overall a very well written book.  I felt that the ending was less than desirable. I guess I was just looking for closure between the continually twisting plot to have the last few chapters set you up for round two.  I am glad that I read this book and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good read.  I wont be catching fire though.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|pretty good app but could be better. it would be much more fun if the games were higher quality and harder
B005TZFZJC|5.0|It took me a little time to get into this, but when I did it was magical. From start to finish.

0439023521|5.0|I have not been this glued to a book since The DaVinci Code. It blows me away that this is young adult reading - don't let the age fool you; the whole series is a must read.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Yes, I know this set has a lot of complaints due to changes that were made. But with updated graphics it brings younger kids in to the Star Wars universe and that's a good thing!  Beautiful graphics, spectacular sound. I'm glad I bought it!
B002L9N4EM|3.0|I got this movie for my fiancee because it is his favorite. When I saw the description I thought that it came with actual chocolate, but it doesn't. I didn't pay more than I thought I should have, so that is good, but I was misled into thinking that there were actual chocolates included. There should be! The book and feather were neat, so he was still happy.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use. I like having a reading plan that saves and keeps track of your progress. And it will read it to me (on my kindle fire).
0131988425|5.0|There isn't much to review.  It's a textbook for a graduate-level course, so it doesn't make much sense to review the book itself.  5 stars because the seller shipped fast and the book arrived in brand-new condition.  It appeared to have never been opened at all, and was packed so thoroughly that not even the clumsiest USPS mail monkey could have damaged it.  That's what I want when buying big, heavy, weapons-grade books online.
1419702238|5.0|My son loves this series.  This was one we had to have and it hasn't dissappointed!  If your child likes this series, then they will enjoy this book as well!

0525478817|5.0|John Green is my favorite author. He is my favorite because of his books I have read I have not been disappointed by one of them (sadly I have not been able to read all of them). The Fault in Our Stars was, in my opinion, believable, and I was able to relate to it despite the fact that, well, I do not have cancer. I became quick friends with the characters and formed bonds with them early on in the story. The bond was what made the lives of the characters so poignant to me. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a book to become their favorite book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a pretty cool game.....I just wish more games were unlocked! But at least it was free.....it makes it less disappointing!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Just started using it with no problems so far, love taking notes for class.  very well organized and works well on kindle fire.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|3.5/5 STARS  This is a great product, As someone who is always on the go and popping in and out of many meetings. I need an application that allows me to take notes in a quick and efficient manner and this application allows just that. I truly enjoy the shrink text size option (check the resize the text when finish writing option and save pen) and the ability to change pens rapidly to allow me from going from writing text to drawing a figure if needed (where I can disable the shrink text size option -- You can go to the pen option and UNCHECK resize the text when finish writing - so you can draw figures in the size you want -- you can also adjust what your final text size will be - so if you want to draw figures but only shrink the size a little bit - you can adjust that - then save the pen so you can quickly pull up this pre-set pen for drawing figures).  The response of my writing is very quick and vey accurate and I have no complaints there.  This allows me to take 1 device (my kindle fire) to meetings that is loaded with everything I may need to access - Notes (these notes I send and compile in Evernote or email to myself or co-workers), my calendar, and all my articles that I've loaded. Not only is everything I essentially need now packaged in 1 small device - the kindle fire is very professional looking and fits into my white coat pocket or carry-on so easily!   A couple of requests to the developers:   - Thank you for the ability to export files to Evernote or email.  Is it possible to export the files as a PDF?  - Please an option to add multipages to your note -- sometimes i have to take lots of notes in a long mtg and it is difficult to save and then reopen a new file w/o losing valuable time. Then files are separate and later hard to organize. Possibly add a function to organize notes quickly in folders? (& export out the multi-page file as a PDF)   - Would it be possible to import a file (pdf, word doc) to edit on top of?  Overall this is a solid productfor note-taking and at minimum the ability to save/export files as PDF and adding multiple pages to the file would take this product to 5 stars!  I would recommend to purchase.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is a great way to allow your devices to &quot;friend&quot;  each other!  Seriously, having a way to organize your stuff for easy retrieval or update with synch from anywhere is awesome for today's device and knowledge junkies.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|games r ok . nothing wrong with it. n interesting esp when u get.tired.of.playing any other game just.come to this app they're quick n.easy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an amazing game. its fun and will keep someone entertained for hours! I would recommends this to any one!

B00005JPSM|4.0|Catherine Zeta-Jones is convincing in her role as Kate, a master chef who makes regimented control of her kitchen and her life a top priority. Circumstances, completely beyond her control, bring in changes that profoundly challenge the foundations upon which she has built her life. She is forced into a new role for which she is totally unprepared and must find ways to adjust to her new reality.<br /><br />This movie tracks her challenges and the changes she must make in order to cope; it is filled with humor, sadness, romance, and personal discovery and takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride as Kate explores the changes needed to make her new reality work. There are many hectic scenes in a commercial kitchen that give a picture of life in the completely different world of commercial food preparation; I am inclined to believe these scenes are not too far removed from reality.<br /><br />The movie is suitable for the entire family and provides an enjoyable evening's entertainment; it even has a feel good ending. I recommend it.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|I love using it except for the fact that 1 of my favorite station in san francisco keeps dropping and keeps saying stream over even if I'm not driving anywhere. Other stations work fine though
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I read a brief comment in our local paper about this movie and decided to buy it and another foreign vampire film.  The first time I watched this I had problems following the dialog as it was understated and the beautiful soundtrack was so loud.  I was shocked at a couple of the scenes and admit I did not understand what was going on until I secured my headphones and watched the movie all over again.  This is one of the best, yet creepy, vampire movies I have ever seen with an unusual female lead.  Do yourself a favor and buy this because you'll want to watch it more than once as I did.  No spoilers in this review.
0064440346|5.0|There are few writers of early readers who stand on the same level as Arnold Lobel. In this and other of his books, he writes very humorous stories about endearing characters who are concerned about and misunderstand the simplest of things. But their misunderstandings always result from big-heartedness and a belief that all things on Earth are related. This particular book contains five short stories. In the first, \\"The Guest,\\" Owl is enjoying himself at home on a cold wintery night -- so cold and so wintery that he worries about Winter, outside in the cold. So Owl invites Winter into the house.<br /><br />In \\"Strange Bumps,\\" Owl sees two strange bumps at the bottom of his sheets at night. He tries to shoo them away, then jump on them, but every time he goes back to sleep, the two huge bumps (his feet) are there. The third story, \\"Tear-Water Tea,\\" is sweet. The fourth, \\"Upstairs and Downstairs,\\" shows what happens when Owl tries to be both upstairs and downstairs in his house, at the same time: because, of course, he likes both the upstairs and the downstairs equally well and doesn't want to slight either one.<br /><br />The fifth story, \\"Owl and the Moon,\\" shows how Owl's belief in the simple goodness of all things is rewarded. Highly recommended!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love how you can Colorado coordinate and you can lock specific notes or lists that you want. By far 5 star app!!
0618154248|5.0|We purchased this set for our 1 year old and he still loves them at age four. The stories are the perfect length, long enough to be interesting but not too long. The books themselves are sturdy enough withstand the tortures of a rough toddler. And our pre-schooler loves putting them in the box to carry around \\"his\\" books. (Yes, the box has lasted too!)
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was very well written and the character's jumped off the page. It was very hard to put doen actually especially near the end. This was my first book by Jodi and I'm sure I will read more. I only wish that her books were priced lower as I would be more inclined to read them all.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is great and awesome awesome awesome it is really fun everyone should play this game for real it is sooooooooo. awesome!!!!!!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I got this game at first because it looked good, and now I love it!!! You get 117 games in all, but u only start out with the first page of games. The more games you win, the more points you get. With those points, you can &quot; buy&quot; more games. Don't worry, no money is required. I even got this app for free on my kindle! the games on here are so much fun and addicting! I absolutely love playing this app.
B000003FMY|4.0|Overall, the album is terrific.  But track 17, \\"Night on the Bare Mountain\\", just abruptly stops in the middle of the piece... at least it does on my copy.  Has anyone else noticed this?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is really fun. I really really really love this game I already mastered four games.  this game is cool
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|If you've read the first two books (which are very good), then you sort of have to read this one as well.  I'm sure that most readers would also feel that they know what to expect after reading the first two books.  Unfortunately, that isn't the case.  This book has a completely different feel from the others.  It's depressing, honestly.    I'll try to be vague enough to avoid any SPOILERS for those that want to read this book.  One of main characters in the story seems to spend half the book sedated.  Another character, due to a plot twist, is completely \\"out of character\\" for the entire book.  How was that supposed to work?  Collins takes a character that she's spent the last two books making us care about, and then strips that character of all those traits.  Bravo!    Another issue I have is that these books were introduced to me by my 10 year old son.  These books are very popular at his elementary school library.  There is no reason for 10 year olds to be reading these books!  They are extremely violent (especially this last book), the characters are dark and moody, and a great deal of the subtext is probably beyond their scope at that age.  I'd think twice before letting my kids get caught up in this trilogy.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I ordered this product from amazon and received it within about 5 days or so.  I received this package in tact, also thought it was received in a reasonable amount of time.  i love the shows and have no problem the DVD's.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|this app is really bad, it crashed all the apps on my tablet. i had to reset all the data to make it work again
B0066W1AZK|5.0|works well. beautiful graphic. challenges you at different skill levels.  easy to navigate. single player computer challenge great at testing  your skills.
1400052181|5.0|Yes, this book is about many things and yet it's the portrayal of the African American experience that comes off most vividly and with such heartbreak.<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks lived at a time and in a way that dealing with white folk was done only under dire circumstances like when stricken by a deadly disease.  John Hopkins University was founded by a man who dedicated special resources to black children and yet the hospital Ms. Lacks entered was segregated and she was treated as if unable to be trusted to know the nature or the ferocity of her illness.  Her death came rapidly but not without tremendous pain.  After death, came obscurity with her family was unable to purchase a tombstone for her grave.<br /><br />Yet her cells taken from her during a biopsy, lived after her death.  They become the basis for much of the scientific breakthroughs that occurred in the last 60 years.  They were sold and re-sold, producing great gobs of revenue along with a greater scientific understanding our human cellular growth.  And not one penny went to the Lacks.<br /><br />From all account, Henrietta was a strong, fun and giving woman who helps so many people in so many ways.  She had come from a rural outpost to Baltimore and found city life bewildering and often disagreeable but she prospered and used her experience to help the new folk that came to Baltimore.<br /><br />Her off-spring grew up in a chaotic family after her death.  They had trouble keeping jobs, managing their emotions and understanding how it was possible that their mother was still alive more than 20 years after death.  And when they learned about her immortal cells in 1970s, they didn't understand the difference between her cells and her being.  For them, any ongoing hardship involving her cells, caused her pain.  They also saw her as a goddess capable of striking down those at odds with her wishes.<br /><br />Yet through the description of her daughter Deborah, you get the sense of an unshakeable desire to learn about her mother, her legacy and honor it and her.<br /><br />With this book, Henrietta Lacks, an ordinary woman who died very young and buried in an unmarked grave, has emerged from her obscurity and been brought to life and dignity.and her.  With this book, Henrietta Lacks, an ordinary woman who died very young and buried in an unmarked grave, has emerged from her obscurity and been brought to life and dignity.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|this game is dumb my 8year old had a hard time and so did I the whole thing didn't make any senses
B006FE17Q6|5.0|I am not a big fan of the zombie genre, and I started watching this show one time on a fluke. Am I glad I did! I LOVE this story: the character development is excellent, the special effects are amazing, and the tension is real. I think Shane is really brave and smart; he just lacks Rick's talent for diplomacy. I have only ONE tiny quibble with this show: the men look appropriately grimy, stubbly, and sweaty most of the time. But the women all have clean shiny hair, shaven armpits, and they're wearing EARRINGS! Seriously, if I was surrounded by the hungry undead, the LAST things I'd be worrying about would be jewelry or washing my hair.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|App is okay. Some of the games are really easy, some don't make sense and some are actually kind of challenging.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was great in the way that Lone Survivor was great!  Told in a very straight forward manner, by someone who truly experienced things that most people will never.  To anyone who was in the military it's great the way that he talks candidly about his peers and superiors.  Thankfully for those who haven't served he explains his acronyms and other technical jargon pretty well.  This is my first review, that's how good I thought this book was!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is so challenging/relaxing /beautiful. love it. was skeptically at first due to other reviews. mentioning &quot;nags&quot; but I guess the developer fixed it. love it.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Force closes every time on my Galaxy Nexus. will occasionally load the first level but will never get past placing first plant. Most times it closes in the initial menu. this is a great game on other platforms but unplayable for me on this platform.
0060873027|2.0|The book's jacket says, \\"Crichton was well into the writing of Micro\\" at the time of his death.  I question that.  Micro is both predictable and unrealistic; two qualities absent in Crichton's other novels.  Buy the book as a homage to a great author, but don't expect too much.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|When I saw it was free - I figured &quot;why not?&quot;  The games can be corny, yet addictive. My only frustration was some of the games were a bit too hard for my younger son, but we helped so he could advance...4 out of 5!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was one of the best apps I ever had. it has millions of games. should get. very addictive. best game ever!!!!!!:)
B00004KD1A|3.0|I give it 2.5 stars. Not all that strong. The sound is muddy. Real muddy. Not sure what he and Donal were thinking by releasing this. I'm a Rory fan and I don't recommend this. If you want live, which is usually where it's at with Rory, then Irish Tour, Live in Europe and BBC sessions are all better. An opportunity missed.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|So many movies for kids are made for girls and girls who dream of being princesses!  This one presents a young boy named Andy and his favorite toys, Woody and Buzz Lightyear.  Woody was Andy's favorite toy until Buzz came along and begins a hostile relationship with him resulting in getting lost as a gas station.  A really bad boy next store who doesn't seem to know how to take care of toys and his mother lets him use matches unsupervised seems a particular menace.  How will Woody and Buzz Lightyear get back to nice boy Andy?  Wonderful movie with good insight into American suburban kids and families.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|I don't really like the the game, it actually kinda sucked. I completed it in 5 minutes no mistakes. I just feal bad for the person who made it, Cuz I was the crappyest game I have ever played I would rather play &quot;Would you rather&quot; with myself than to play this. just wanted to say, Put some more thought into your games, K? nice try tho.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game as a whole some of the mini games within are a little lacking but the concept is cool.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I got this app on my kindle fire and it was great! I wouldn't recommend ot to younger children though it's a bit difficult. MUST PLAY GAME!!!!!!!!
B005K2XUPK|5.0|Like the other reviewers, I agree this is a stylish and very functional case for the Kindle fire. It fits snugly, but not so snugly that you feel you have to jam it in.  Fabric on inside is nice and soft to protect the screen; outside it is a durable nylon(?) weave- very rugged. I bought this brand because one reviewer said they were made in the USA.  I've been trying to follow ABC news \\"Made in America\\" and was excited that something I wanted was US made- but, the tags on the inside clearly state it is made in China :( Other than that, it is a great product and Timbuk2 will even recycle the case when you're done with it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|self explanatory.  lol So many different games to choose from. Some are kind of tough at first but then its like &quot;wow, that was it?&quot; Challenging and fun.
1400079144|4.0|Overall I thought this was an entertaining thriller with plenty of twists and turns and unexpected developments. Does it live up to the hype of its impossible to follow predecessor, The Da Vinci Code? Barely. But what could? It certainly continues the formula, although I found it to be darker than DVC. At its heart, though, it's the same: the character Langdon hooks up with is of course connected extremely closely to the conflict, the conflict involves secret societies guarding some treasured knowledge of the ages at the intersection of science and religion, the fanatics die in the end while Langdon and his friends are left to reflect on some newfound understanding, and it all takes place in 24 hrs.. Good stuff. I would definitely read another one, although I think it could be a tad shorter next time.<br /><br />At the very end the clue references became overly circular and repetitive to the point of overkill, but overall this was one hell of a read. Maybe 50 pages or so could have been cut.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I could never get this app to work on my kindle fire. I'm new to the kindle world, so I kept trying to make it work thinking it was something I was doing wrong. I would enter the town name, wait, wait--nothing. After numerous attempts I gave up and uninstalled it.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I downloaded this thinking it would have a lot more to offer than the free version, but I was wrong. Yes, it does prevent unwanted adds from popping up, but there are way less things such as backgrounds and blades to unlock. I removed it from my device and continued playing the free version. This game was not worth my 99 cents.
078322737X|5.0|\\"American Graffiti\\" is a story about one night in the lives of a group of small town teens. They are all on the verge of something great, but none of them know it yet. That something is called growing up. This night is their farewell to innocent youth. It is an obvious parallel to what America was about to go through. Within a couple of years, most of the people that the film's characters represent would be affected by the chaotic events that occurred in this country. But on this night, none of that existed. These kids were still dealing with the all important activities of cruising, muscle cars, going steady, street racing, the choice between beach music and rock & roll, and whether or not they should wait a year before going off to college. It is the last great American night.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|Fun game which gives stars for each level based on the time to finish. There are also quite a few levels which is nice. The downside is that the game just crashes on my kindle fire. It doesn't happen every game but it is frustrating enough that I uninstalled to try another mahjong game.
1451648537|2.0|Although the news media regularly would sucker for Steve Jobs's influence techniques, glamor, and glitz, I had always thought that Walter Isaacsen was someone who could remain conscientiously centered, in spite of his subject's preference for image over integrity. I was wrong. Steve Jobs did some interesting things, but caused so much destruction along the way. It matters little to me that he was intense, especially given that he was not only entirely unethical, but also amoral. A glutton for power and praise, Jobs was also so terribly greedy. Isaacson missed so much. Finishing this book felt like chewing up gravel, then choking down the resulting sand.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Tired from a long day of toiling in her mechanic repair booth, at the shopping district of Beijing, Cinder carefully unfastens the worn screws attaching her metal prosthetic foot.  She vows to never wear that dreaded appendage again.  It is much too small,  it pinches and bites.  She sits calmly, with loose wires hanging from her leg, waiting for the return of her trusted robotic friend, Iko, who is bringing her a new prosthesis.  She enjoys the reprieve as she takes in the sights and sounds of the busy market.  Her respite is interrupted by a handsome, intruder.  She stares, tongue tied as her cyborg sensors inform her that the young man in the hooded sweatshirt, in front of her booth, is none other than Prince Kai, heir to the throne.  He brings her his android, in need of repair.  She was highly recommended to him as one of the best mechanics in Beijing.  Cinder is in awe of the friendly royal.  As he slinks back into the crowd she resumes her day, tinkering and repairing.  A scream shrills through the air, the woman who runs the bakery booth, exhibits signs of the deadly lumos plague, an instant death sentence.  A terror driven stampede evacuates the market within minutes.  Cinder and Iko huddle quietly waiting for their chance to escape.  The two finally sneak out and make home it safely.  Cinder, is not your average girl, she is a cyborg, part human part machine.  She has an aptitude for mechanics, thus she is forced to support her stepmother and step sisters.  Her cyborg status relegates her to life as a second class citizen, bereft of privileges.  Without warning the plague strikes her home and Cinder finds herself in a fight for her life.  Will she survive the virulent plague?<br /><br />What I Liked:<br /><br />*I was completely drawn into Ms. Meyer's world.  Cinder, is set in a futuristic Beijing. This book features a sci-fi aspect, with the inclusion of cyborg technology, the blend of humans with robotic technology. Spice it up with a bit of dystopia, which involves the repression of cyborgs living in a society ravaged by plague. Add in the world teetering on the brink of war, with the Lunar inhabitants of the moon. These elements fuel the anxiety driven feel of a dystopian story, that addicts of the genre crave, (myself included). Finally, this book offers an imaginative spin on the old fairy tale, Cinderalla.  All these ideas blend to form the basis of Cinder.  This book completely sucked me in!<br />*I admired Cinder.  She is a girl with sass, spunk and a few mechanical grease spots.  She is never without her tool belt.  Often, when she is nervous, she has a habit of twirling a wrench on her finger.  She is far from the usual demure, feminine depictions of Cinderella.  I was excited to see that she wasn't a sympathetic character sitting around waiting, dreaming and wishing her way out of her current situation.  Instead she was taking the bull by the horns, plotting a better life.<br />*I was thrilled that the relationship between Kai and Cinder, starts as a hesitant acquaintance, moving into a friendship.  No fairy tale love at first sight, butterflies in the tummy, sparks flying and batting of eyelashes.  This book establishes a real and believable bond between the two characters, with a hint of attraction, that starts as a  little spark and grows into a tiny sputtering flame.<br />*It was interesting the way Ms. Meyer, reinvented all the integral parts of the old fairy tale.  I won't spoil it for you, but it was exciting to see how the glass slipper, pumpkin coach, wicked stepmother etc. were retooled and inserted in the plot.  In addition to the Cinderella story line, the author adds in some fantastic divergent plots.  I was intrigued by the deadly illness sweeping through the world, as well as the building conflict with the mysterious moon inhabitants.  Let me tell you, the wicked stepmother is pleasant, in comparison to the Lunar Queen.  If you are thinking, I am not interested in reading a Cinderella story, think again. This book is a crisp, contemporary retooling of an old tale.  Definitely, worth reading.<br />*Finally, the cover.  I have been captivated by the unique cover of Cinder since it saw it months ago.  I love it!<br /><br />And The Not So Much:<br /><br />*I enjoyed Ms. Meyer's futuristic vision but I felt her world building lacked detail.  For instance, I would love to know more about the cyborg genetics and how they worked.  There was not enough detail on the surroundings, the book takes place in Beijing but it lacked the flavor of China.  There was not much mention of dress, culture or customs in this new age society.  Plus, there so many items in the story that were not described in detail.  What is a port? What is a hover? Tell me more about the droids.  I never had a full gauge of Cinder's appearance, I was surprised to discover late in the story, she had a storage compartment in her leg.  I knew little of the Lunar inhabitants, they remained a mystery.  I would love to know more about these enigmatic citizens on the moon.  The story needed further enrichment with descriptions and explanations.<br />*While I enjoyed the retooling of the Cinderella fairy tale, unfortunately it led to some predictability in the story.  Ms. Meyer does an excellent job of spiffing up an old well-known fable, by adding some unfamiliar plot twists.  Unfortunately, the big reveal comes as no surprise because Meyer's provides many details and hints along the way.  It was too obvious how the events were set to unfold regarding Cinder's true identity.<br />*I loved Cinder's character until the climax.  She lost a bit of her fire and spirit.  She almost stopped fighting.  In the beginning she is willing to take a stand against her stepmother, but later on in the book she relapses.  I was disappointed in the way Cinder backed down to her stepmother.  It was contradictory to her initial behavior.<br />*The ending, as I neared the final pages of the book, I was filled with a sinking dread, there was no way this story was going to wrap up with a neat resolution.  To my dismay, it does indeed just end.  Granted, it is not a terrible cliff hanger but the finale does not offer a definitive conclusion.  This book started with strong promise, but the climax is nothing thrilling or climatic and the ending is a disappointment.  Drawing the book to a more suitable and satisfying ending would have made this a five star book.<br /><br />Cinder, was one of my coveted, debut author reads of 2012.  I did enjoy this unique, novel twist on Cinderella.  The sci-fi and dystopian elements blended in, made this a compelling read.  I would recommend you pick it up and check it out, especially if you are looking for a new dystopian book.  Just beware, you will be anxious to know when the next book will be released.  Marissa Meyer is an author to watch.  Her debut novel, shows she is a promising new talent.  This is a strong, solid beginning to a new series. After reading Cinder, I pondered the possibility of this being made into a movie.  I would love to see this version of Cinderella brought to the big screen!<br /><br />Favorite Quotations:<br /><br />\\"The night sky was clear, and though the lights from the city blocked out any stars, the sharp crescent moon lurked near the horizon, a sleepy eye squinting through the haze.\\"<br /><br />\\"He was the fantasy of every girl in the country.  He was so far out of her realm, her world, that she should have stopped thinking about him the second the door had closed.  Should stop thinking about him immediately.

And yet, the memory of his fingers against her skin refused to fade.\\"<br /><br />\\"Imagine there was a cure, but finding it would cost you everything.  It would completely ruin your life.  What would you do?\\"<br /><br />\\"She was a cyborg, and she would never go to a ball.\\"<br /><br />At the time of this review, Amazon.com is offering thefirst five chapters for free.

B00005JKG9|5.0|I had always heard of the famous (or infamous) opening scene where Alec Baldwin completely tears into these poor salesmen. \\"What's my name? **** you! That's my name!\\" But watching the unedited scene in the context of the entire film is awesome. This movie might hit a little too close to home for the real life salemen out there but this really is a fantastic movie. It wouldn't be half of what it is without some of the best acting I've ever seen. Jack Lemmon is incredible, and Ed Harris and Al Pacino are great. Kevin Spacey does a great job as the unfortunate office manager who has to put up with daily and vicious abuse from this miserable lot.   The dialog between all of these powerhouse actors is incredibly entertaining, especially Al Pacino when he tears Kevin Spacey a new one after losing a client. As I said earlier, Jack Lemmon is incredible. I felt awful for his character because you can see and hear the desperation in his voice as he's trying to make a sale in the house of one of his customers. It really is sad.   I've never seen a more entertaining movie that's almost nothing but dialog. I'm not sure I could ever get tired of watching it.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I am pleasantly surprised at this book.  I am a stay at home mom and kindle is my lifeline for me wanting to continue reading with a 8 week old in my arms. No longer do I need to turn pages of a book with a hand that I really don't have. This book, drew me in not right away because I was starting to get vibes that it would be like an other college romance books, ugh bad boy and good girl with a past whose  just as scared to commit as the college lady killer.But that all changed for me the second I found out her past and the dangers it entails. Though many people will say their relationship volatile and unhealthy. I honestly think other wise, though there are moments of codependency. But at that age I can assure anyone who has given love a chance and gave into it fully is a little codependent because those feelings make a person who is broken, whole. Travis is someone who was empty but didn't know it, he took advantage of his looks and his fighting abilities to gain popularity and hurt nearly every girl on campus with his aloofness once they slept together. Abby changes all of that in him during a bet they made which you find out later bets are something she is very well accustomed too. This book is 3$ where can you possibly go wrong. I can promise you that this is a book you will stay awake reading even though your eyes start burning and your yawning has overcame any form of communication to those you love. In which they will then retaliate in an attempt to force you to finally go to sleep. But you wont because you cant wait to see what happens next

B004EPYZSU|2.0|I love westerns, but am bored to death by aliens.<br /><br />The movie started out as an acceptable (though not great)<br />western, but once the aliens showed up I started thinking<br />about my grocery list, vacuuming the living room, and<br />dentist appointments.<br /><br />I found the \\"mix\\" to be awkwardly put together,<br />like they were trying to do something fresh and new<br />and entertaining, but it was just wrong.  The hot chick<br />seemed to be thrown in there gratuitously, and didn't<br />really fit the part she played.  She's better than that,<br />as she played a lesbian doctor on House quite well.<br />Harrison Ford, well, he just isn't Indiana Jones anymore.<br />Sorry, Indy.<br /><br />I watched it because my husband wanted to,<br />so I had a nice nap.  Sleep is a good thing.
B004EPYZXU|2.0|I dont mind a bit of a shaky camera, but rolling , unfocus , scratched effects are<br />good if used once in a while, but for this movie you get it all the time...<br />Hey ..why buy this in blue ray...when there is no reason to want to have a better<br />picture ...because the picture has all these effects againts it.<br />  So after falling asleep  4 times on this, i was able to finish it.<br />1.5  stars go to the actors, which did a good job with what they had.  the rest<br />goes to those little creatures.<br />Its surely not a movie you will want to watch twice.
B0054SMID0|3.0|Either I missed something or this movie was out of its league/trying to hard/not worth the $14.99 rental.  I'm betting, all of the above.  Great cast? Yes.  Interesting story? Yes.  The story was disjointed, the legal account was less than accountable, and I'm no lawyer, and the wrap up went for something esoteric that totally missed the mark.  All in all, not a waste of a night but would have waited for instant on Netflix knowing what I know now.

0230754902|5.0|I have been a fan of early baldacci and his very inventive plots. I have kept reading him over the years, but more from voracious reading syndrome. I thought his work was slowly loosing it's very special appeal and was becoming stale and repetitive. With zero day, though, baldacci is back. The plot is very special and surprising. The characters are deep and complex, and the background is interestingly exotic: old mining country. I recommend it and hope baldacci will keep this level of niceness in his future work

0525478817|5.0|By default, a book by John Green will be intelligent, witty, humorous and thought-provoking. But this book was so much more than that. It was the book I always needed but never knew I was missing. It filled holes inside of me that I didn't know I had. It was equal parts heart-breaking and hilarious. I can do nothing but be thankful that John is in existence, albeit temporarily, and thinking and feeling and creating.   I recommend this book to absolutely everyone.

B0060ZJ74O|4.0|I saw a review somewhere on Amazon that said, \\"...you've got to LOVE baseball to like this movie.\\" I am still trying to figure out if that is true. Here is the deal. I went into watching this movie because:<br /><br />1) Brad Pitt is in it and despite all the annoying attention he gets because he is Angelina's other half, he is one of the most under-rated actors out there.<br />2) I love a good drama, especially about underdogs.<br />3) Oscar Buzz (yes, it's that time of year)<br /><br />Am I a fan of baseball? No. Actually, it's probably one of my least favorite sports and I know the bare minimum when it comes to the positions, rules, teams, players, etc. Other then watching a baseball school game or when my dad and brother have it turned on (they are big fans), I don't think I've ever watched a baseball game all the way through, from beginning to end.<br /><br />That being said, here are my thoughts, starting with Brad. Do I think this was his best performance? No, but I think this was one of his BETTER performances. Pitt's character definitely had me convinced that he was Billy Beane, the stretched out GM of the Oakland Atlantics. I could feel his frustration with every sudden outburst he had on screen. One of the more tender moments had nothing to do with baseball-- it was when he was sitting in the music store with his daughter, watching her play the guitar and convincing her to sing out loud. The lyrics of the song comes full circle in the end. You'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Now to the movie itself. I was worried first going into it because again, I don't know much about baseball. I was right to be worried because I will admit, there were some parts that I didn't understand. I would get the general idea, but not the full concept or importance of some of the business talk in the film. For example, when Billy and Peter (Jonah Hill's character) are trading players over the phone, it was a bit confusing. While it was supposed to be serious, I think it also was meant to be a bit comical, which I missed out on because of my lack of knowledge. My responses were prompted by their facial expressions or the air pumping of their fists.<br /><br />That being said, I liked Moneyball because it leaned more towards a character driven drama then a classic baseball tale. And because of this, I can appreciate the film from that aspect. This is why some hardcore baseball fans found the movie boring. They were going into it expecting tons of baseball action. They were expecting the film to focus more on shots of the players in the locker room to the drama out on the field. Instead, the camera rarely leaves Billy Beane's world. Even when he and Peter finally get the players they think will change the game to sign on, we don't get to see the players actually play for quite awhile. And when the games ARE going on, the camera follows Billy around as he works out his anxiety in the gym room (apparently, Billy Beane did not actually watch most of the games for fear of bad luck).<br /><br />I don't think you have to LOVE baseball to like the movie. I think you have to have a basic understanding of the sport to fully appreciate what it is trying to accomplish, and also go into it knowing that this is not your traditional baseball movie. The movie is not filled with 15-20 minute chunks of baseball in action. You're more likely to see a few 2 minutes clips of the real footage (the movie is based on a true story after all) throughout the film and then some short scenes of players actually playing the game.<br /><br />Overall, Moneyball was a good, solid drama. While I had a little bit of trouble following the baseball politics, I did understand in general what Billy Beane was trying to do for his underdog team and change the way people look at the sport. Like Jonah Hill's character says in the beginning, GM goals shouldn't be about buying players. It should be about buying wins. Speaking of Jonah Hill, I was pleasantly surprised by his humble, serious performance. He normally plays in comedies, so I give him and whoever gave him a shot for the role major kudos. As a matter of fact, I think the acting is one of the biggest strengths of this movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman had a small part but hell, he is so good at being a chameleon that I didn't even realize it was him at first.<br /><br />If there was one thing I would've added to give Moneyball a 5 star rating, instead of 4, it would be more scenes of the \\"misfit\\" players Billy Beane hires. Most of the people in Billy's tight circle absolutely detest his decisions for hiring these specific players, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman's character that refuses to even put them in the positions Billy hires them for. I just would have liked some more scenes maybe about their backgrounds, their frustrations, etc. It would have added a little more pull on the heartstrings.<br /><br />Do I think the movie is Oscar worthy? For a nomination, definitely. For the win, not so sure. Do I think Brad should be nominated? Yes! Win? It was a solid, convincing performance. Until I view some of the other leads, I will just leave it at that!<br /><br />Check out more of my reviews at [...]e him a shot for the role major kudos.

B0034G4OY0|2.0|Clint Eastwood, with Hereafter, manages to capture that feeling of getting your palm read for $5 on a boardwalk by a fickle old lady with cigarette stained teeth. You are promised a film about disaster, death, and the afterlife; what you end up with is a cheap imitation of all three.   Hereafter establishes the afterlife and the existence of heedful souls. The story follows George, a psychic who communicates with the dead, Marie, a news anchor who writes a book about her near death experience, and Marcus, a young boy who is coping with a death in the family. Their lives are intertwined and significant to one another with their respective fascination towards the afterlife.  The film opens with an earth shattering tsunami that immediately consumes you with a \\"I saw the light\\" sequence as one of the protagonists is teetering between life and death. You'll be hooked as this seems like a movie that aims to go where most films have not - exploring what happens when you die. If the 2012-esque sequence doesn't hook you, than the introduction to George and his ghost whispering abilities will. Unfortunately, Hereafter is a lot like sitting through the weather report eagerly awaiting the top story that was introduced at the top of the news broadcast. The three main plots are crafted with an almost Halmark card simplicity. They reek of heart wrenching solemnity - supplemented with guitar plucking music and tearful tragedy - but they are all so contrived and forced that there is no emotional attachment to any of the main characters.   Unfortunately, it gets worse. When the three narratives inevitably converge, it is done so in such clumsy, nonsensical fashion. Along with never even exploring the phenomenon of death and the afterlife, Hereafter decides it needs a love story and literally tacks one on right before the credits roll. This film certainly is not unwatchable. There are sequences that are entertaining and well done, but as a whole, it fails by holding back and resigningto mind-numbing Hollywood conventions. Allow this review of mine to serve as a free psychic reading for you- You will walk away from Hereafter utterly disappointed...

B005PTQPU0|4.0|Grey skies, swirling flakes, choir-boy son. In \\"50 Words for Snow,\\" her first new collection of songs in Bush pulls herself in a cold cloak of moody introspection that seems perfect for brooding on the shortest days of the year. The CD clocks in at a dreamy hour, with songs stretching as long as 13 minutes. Themes drift in and out, establishing themselves but never pulverizing you. \\"The World is so loud,\\" she quietly intones on the opening song, \\"but keep falling, I'll find you.\\" This is no \\"Running Up That Hill.\\" \\"50 Words for Snow\\" takes its time to accumulate.<br /><br />That may make it tough going for some listeners. Some of the songs here take on a classical, even operatic quality (comparisons to Tori Amos' recent \\"Night of Hunters\\" sprang to mind on my first listen) to many of the songs. There's also nothing here that ropes you in on a first listen. Kate is exploring a sensual world here, and it moves in slowly. Still, there are two moments of pure oddness here. On \\"Snowed In Atu Wheeler Street,\\" Kate may have drawn the absolute weirdest vocal performance out of Elton John's career, and on the title track, Stephen Fry drily keeps giving his 50 words, each phrase becoming increasingly odder as the song goes on. All the while, Kate is egging him on, singing \\"come on now, you've got 32 to go!\\" With its bubbly synth gliding underneath, it's the most likely song to become remixed into a single.<br /><br />Then again, despite the melancholy, cold feeling to the disc, \\"50 Words For Snow\\" contains songs about making love to a snowman (\\"Misty\\") and possibly getting it on with Bigfoot (\\"Wild Man\\"). Chilly or not, you never know what to expect when it comes to Kate Bush. I'm more than willing to sit by with a cup of hot cocoa and see where the seasons take her.
B005Q5OLC2|2.0|I would want to be warned, so I will warn readers that this review may contain spoilers.  So I love New York. I love Ireland. I love historical fiction as a genre. Overall, however, I did not love this book. It was beautifully written and very compelling and I tip my hat to the author for accomplishing that.  But I hated the ending and it has taken me a few days to figure out why.  I've heard it said recently that modern fiction is more apt to portray anti-heroes than heroes (or heroines) in its literature. I think Eilis, the main character, is a superb example of the modern anti-hero. Typically the main character would have some kind of moment where they realize what's wrong with their life and begin to change and the reader would see the changed hero at the end of the book. It would enhance and add to the catharsis and the denouement. Eilis does not change and seems convinced that if she just doesn't pay attention to her problems that they will all go away. It makes Eilis seem, at the end of the book, two dimensional and child-like.  On the back cover of the book, one of the reviewers said it was a great coming-of-age story. This is a little disturbing. I hope coming of age does not mean effing up your life and the lives of the people you love. I also hope coming of age does not mean failing to learn from your mistakes, failing to be honest with yourself, and failing to take control of your own life, instead of letting life happen to you. Actually, what Eilis does in the book is almost like regressing, rather than coming of age.  This book gets two stars for being well written, compelling, and making me want to finish it. It loses three stars for two dimensional characters and an ending devoid of any redemption or change in the main character.
0374275637|5.0|This book provides a truly unique exploration of how the mind works and how we make some of life's most important decisions. It is heavy on the research and light on the platitudes. I'd guess it'd appeal to fans of Gladwell who wish he was heavier on the research and, you guessed it, lighter on the platitudes.

B005HSG3U6|4.0|This case protects the Kindle Fire really well, fits snuggly and the stand function is easy to use and stays securely in place (with the strap around it).  Very happy, would buy again.  One con is that the grippy finish on the back (the white part since I got the white model) is wearing off on the corners (high rub) areas as it floats around in my Wife's purse.  It is white underneath though, so aesthetically, it looks fine.  Only other con is that the white stains a bit from use and time, so I would recommend getting the black or gray ones.  Overall, love it and would totally recommend it for fit, form and function!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have recommended this book to many people. This is an awesome read and I would highly suggest it. It is a great book as long as you are ok with the following things: dying, some details about dying and a some sadness. This is my favorite series of all time and plan on reading it again in the future! The author does a great job describing the characters and scenes! I would say the ages for this book should be good for people aged between 12-adult. I also will say that kids under 12 that are very mature for their age will be able to understand, comprehend and enjoy this book.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|After having problems ordering another cover for my Kindle Fire, I found this one and loved it instantly. I read many reviews saying that it was a very tight fit and that it didn't close. I did not have that problem at all. The elastic straps have just enough tension to hold my Kindle Fire, but allow me to take it out easily if I desire. And it closes all the way with no trouble. Its true that it smells a little funky when you first get it but that fades. Definitely worth the price. I would recommend to anyone!

Take out the center divider and you might get a camera body in there.  This is an Amazon signature item and not the fault of some vendor.  Amazon needs to cut the crap and tell customers the truth. This is false advertizing. The bag is actually of decent quality and if it were the size they say it is it would be a good deal.  It is a tiny bag.

I'd say that this is strictly for fans of the films and of Transformers who don't have the all the movies or don't mind a cool little collectible. The price isn't all that unreasonable depending what its final sales price is, and lets face it, they aren't making a whole lot of these, so this time next year, I can see these being a bit on the pricey side.

1433502410|5.0|This is easily the best Study Bible available. I have many others but this one gets everything right. Really the only complaint that can be held against it is if you don't like the ESV translation. As for the actual study notes and articles, everything is top notch and ecumenical in approach. There are various accusations about the notes in this Bible being biased but I have found them to be even handed in most areas, for example see the notes on 1 Timothy chapter 2.<br /><br />The actual construction and design of the ESV Study Bible is also of a very high quality. This is not a red letter Bible, which is a good thing in my opinion. The text is black, in a single column, and the references are placed in the inner margins. All of these things mean that this Bible is very easy to read and study from.<br /><br />If you have narrowed your search for a Study Bible down to this one and a few others than I recommend going with the ESV. Even though it is not my favorite translation, all of the features and designs in this book make it rise above the rest. I have a more thorough review on my blog, Discipulus Scripturae, if you are interested in more in-depth analysis and images. Just do a Google search for ESV Study Bible Review.

0525478817|5.0|To quote Hazel Grace, the book's delightfully insightful, smart, and empathetic FEMALE (YAY) narrator: \\"Sometimes you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.\\"<br /><br />That is exactly how I feel about The Fault in Our Stars.<br /><br />This book gutted me, and I mean that in the best possible way. John has found a way to take the reader on such a beautiful journey through this book...it's really a gift, more than a book. It's powerfully transcendent, in the way that John, through Hazel, can make observations about the human condition that are just so goddamn universal. There were so many moments when I literally said, out loud, \\"YES! Exactly.\\" It's also funny, quirky, and nerdy, as you would expect nothing less from a Nerdfighter. And yes, it's sad, but such a beautiful sadness. I sobbed through parts of the book, trying desperately to keep reading through my blurred vision and dripping nose.<br /><br />You MUST read this book!
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Ingmar Bergman's Persona is a complete picture of Transactional Analysis in action. Is there only one woman in the movie or three? TA is an approach to psychology & psychotherapy that was created by Dr. in Eric Byrne in the late 50's. Born in Canada the Dr. worked in the USA. Bergman was obviously very well versed in Transactional Analysis concepts & brings them to the scene as only he can.<br /><br />The more I look at these scenes & their construction the more impressed I am. I haven't seen every Bergman film but this is definitely the cream of the crop in my estimation. I will never tire of seeing this movie & being amazed at the care & skill put into its construction. It's a marvelous achievement & a joy to contemplate. The acting by Bibi Anderson & Liv Ullmann & cinematography (Sven Nykvist) are the equal of the directorial effort. Easily a 5 star Amazon rating for this film. Recommended to all.<br /><br />I do admit to being puzzled by the montage lead-in. It really didn't seem to relate to anything in the movie & resembled the pictures used to test convicted felons for abnormal sexual responses. IMO it leads in a false direction for the film but perhaps the viewer is being tested.

B0034DGPEU|3.0|I downloaded the audio version of this book.  Don't get me wrong, I love historical-ish books and I normally love the ones that I read.  This book had the makings of being a really great book; the descriptions of the characters and the area's they interacted with were wonderfully described and the subject matter is interesting (especially as a white girl born and raised in the North).  However, I found the characters were either very predictable or under developed.  I guess I was expecting a little more.  And one more things...wasn't the body count of all of the deaths that occur, within the book, kind of high?  It just seemed to get to the point where I was rolling my eyes every time another character \\"went to their great reward\\", so to speak.  Overall, it's not a bad book...there are redeeming qualities to it.  However, I guess I just expected a little bit more.
B005KELQEU|1.0|I read all the reviews...some said it was a tight fit; others said it fit fine. I own a regular Kindle...not a Kindle Touch and not a Kindle Fire. This sleeve was a joke! It did not come close to fitting. Perhaps mine was defective, but it didn't look big enough when I opened the package. I tried it on just to make sure, and almost a full inch of the Kindle stuck out.

B005TPCQ5I|2.0|Couldn't finish the book, don't know why I thought the movie would be tolerable. I ended up watching the whole thing, but not in one sitting.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is fun.  Great way to enjoy my Kindle fire. It plays well.  I have no complaints.  What else can I add.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I was looking for something for mmy kindle and this works the best for it :) it has woo many.options!!
B006GG1KOC|4.0|if this game is geared towards younger children the some of the levels are too hard. also with the photos some of them were frustrating to figure out. thank goodness for the help button otherwise they would have been all wrong on some levels. other than that the game runs smoothly.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a good game, not the best, but still it is fun to play when you are bored. I recomend this game!  :D
B006IGZWB2|5.0|The book was great, and they actually did a really job turning it into a movie. Book is still better, but in this case, both are very good.
0307362035|5.0|Fans of both P.D. James & Jane Austen will love this book! It is entertaining, true to the spirit of Pride & Prejudice (and containing references also to the Elliots of Persuasion!) and believable. If you have a young Austen fan at home, she will likely become a James fan and acquire a few new treasures for her vocabulary as well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I am on track to read Bible in a year. I highly recommend it. Currently, its my favotite app.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I got this cover for my brother. ---Awesome cover! So happy I got it for my new kindle fire! Its so pretty and nice to look at. It was snug putting the kindle in it but I am happy because it feels very secure. Its worth it for the price.
B0059XTTW8|3.0|Some film critics have given the movie version of Tinker Taylor high marks, but for me this long-awaited movie version was a sad disappointment.  Because the six-part television series (now on DVD) is of such high quality, I knew that the recently released theatre version would find the series to be a hard act to follow.  I saw the theatre version  26 December, 2011.  My concerns were fully justified.  In my subsequent discussions with a film professor, I had to clarify for him that my disappointment was not so much based upon the fact that the BBC series had the advantage of its longer length in which to more fully portray characters and personalities as well as more detailed and complete plot.  I evaluated the movie solely based upon its own  merits.  I thought at great length about every detail of the movie.  I finally had to come to the conclusion that everything remarkable and captivating about the BBC series is missing in the film.<br /><br />To start with, the original book is of high quality.  Then, the television screen play is excellent both from the stand point of plot and with dialogue.  In the series, each character was perfectly cast for physical appearance as well as admirable acting skill.  The viewer consequently is able to gain clear insight into the individuals' personalities, characters, roles in MI6, interaction among each other, their strengths and their weaknesses.  The characters come across as real people whom the viewer learns to know.  Sir Alec as George Smiley succeeds in communicating more with his tone of voice, pauses, and non-verbal communication than many actors can speaking words.  For example when near the end he is asked to \\"take charge for a while,\\"  the potent effect of Smiley's delivery upon the others at the meeting table is so memorable that I can quote those lines.<br /><br />In the movie, however, some actors just did not look the part.  The individual playing Percy reminded me more of the CIA buffoon in \\"Hopscotch\\" than the stuffed-shirt MI6 director.  In the film, the acting was not always consistent with what the characters should be.  I have great admiration for the acting skill of Gary Oldman based upon his diverse roles which I previously have seen.  In this film, however, his reserved demeanor looks more sullen and uncommunicative than aware and contemplative.<br /><br />It appeared to me that the screenwriters and director added some dialogue and action in an attempt to keep the story moving and to help the audience comprehend the story; however, these additions were so out of place that they stuck out like sore thumbs. Unfortunately, some scenes that were the most moving and impressive were omitted but could have been included with little additional time.  So little was portrayed of the character who turned out to be the mole that, when he was caught, the audience well may have asked, \\"Who is he?\\"<br /><br />In regard to the length of the film vs. the series, yes, the series does have the advantage of more time.  Tinker Taylor is a journey back into a different time, a cold-war time when the old-boys network dominated the intelligence services and time seemed not so rushed as it is in the 21st century.  The series permits sufficient time to allow for long pauses in dialogue during which the characters communicate much through their behavior and visual affect.  This is time well spent that any theatre version would be unlikely to take.  I have watched and shared the BBC DVD series several times with friends, and I never have grown tired of it.  My advice is to read the book and to see the BBC version.  I consider it to be my favorite cold-war spy story, and the quality of the series has much to do with it.<br /><br />Addendum October 2013.  I decided to give this film version of \\"Tinker\\" a second chance, bought the DVD, and watched it carefully.  My original disappointment was only amplified.  As a stand-alone film, it fails badly.  In contrast to the BBC series, it fails miserably.  I suspect that more positive reviews are swayed by the power of the original novel and the big names in the film.  Do purchase the DVD series.  If I were to move and take with me only 5% of my DVDs, I would keep the BBC series (along with \\"Smiley's People\\").

B001AFF25W|2.0|Eat That Frog! (like many other motivational books) contains several good ideas--make that big important scary project ('Big Ugly Frog') your priority; list all the steps to your BUF and which steps depend on which other steps; use daily planning lists to prioritize your day; write things down; etc....  Unfortunately, it suffers from the old adage, \\"What is novel isn't necessarily good, and what is good isn't necessarily novel.\\"    For someone in the business world with underlings to take over all the 'low value' jobs you'll discover you are 'wasting time' doing, what Brian Tracy has to say might be motivational and inspiring--for someone who is is currently in the position of BEING the underling the upward moving boss is pawning off the 'low value' jobs on (or someone not in the business world at all) this book is likely to be depressing at best or angering at worst.

0439023521|4.0|A fun, exciting, and compelling read.  The characterization and backstory development was well balanced, creating an immersive reading experience.  I finished the book  after a mere two days of reading and enjoyed it start to finish.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Warning: This review has spoilers from the first three books.  Don't read if you don't want to be spoiled on A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, or A Storm of Swords!  Alright, a lot of people are really mad about this book.  People are mad that their favorite characters are no where to be seen, people are mad that the boring characters get more attention, and people are mad about the lack of action.  While it is definitely no Storm of Swords, I still thought Feast for Crows was a really great book.  It wasn't as straightforward as the previous books, and it didn't have much action at all.  But I think it had a lot of really good moments, and really gave the story a sense of realism and development from characters you don't normally see.    The thing about Martin's books is that you don't know for sure who is right or wrong, and you don't know who is going to live or die.  I feel like this book is a story of the \\"other side.\\"  You get a lot more chapters about Cersie and Jaime, and seemingly unimportant characters like Brienne and characters from Dorne.  You get less Starks, less Snows, less Tyrion, less of the people you love.  But that's ok. Because there are (mostly) no good guys or bad guys, and every character has a story.  Think of Feast for Crows like a new book; you didn't know how awesome Jon Snow was or Eddard Stark or Tyrion or anyone until you actually got into Game of Thrones.  They were all new to you, and none of them had any significance.  Now that you've grown to love them, you are mad to see them practically disappear. New ones are being introduced, characters that have no meaning to you.  Just know that these characters will.  They develop, they grow, and they get just as awesome as your favorites (well, most of them do). Give them a chance, and you'll learn to love them.  Your favorite characters from before get their stories told in the next book, don't worry.  I give it a 4/5, while I would have given the others 5/5.  I think it's not as greatas the others, but still really good.  Give it a chance, the characters are still as awesome as before, they are just new.
B006QKJZMW|2.0|I bought this thing just to have the complete series. It's not a bad movie, but is poorly paced and edited. The best scenes are at the beginning and the ending is idiotic. Also, what happened to Anka? Please, give me stuff that has at least some logic in it.   Still, they didn't manage to kill the franchise and I will wait for another sequel hoping for the best.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Enjoyed finding this movie,in great shape, perfect picture and sound. Wanted it for a long time for my son. Thanks for the movie.
0525478817|5.0|John Green's latest book tackles hugely ambitious themes in a beautiful and touching way. the characters are all unique and intelligent, along with being very real and touching. The story is heartfelt and honest, both funny and sad, and the language is wonderfully thought provoking. Possibly the saddest part is when you finish and realize you  might have trouble finding a book that live up to this one. Don't hesitate to make this purchase; it is money well spent.  If you are interested in this book you maybe a nerdfighter. Do not panic, this is a good thing. Go to: [...] to lean more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great kind of game to just pass the time the games are easy but make you think worth a try! !!!
B006AX6ONI|4.0|When I began reading this book I realized how much Mark and I had in common. We both had several positions with different companies, were fired a few times. Both had the drive to do something more and better with our lives. Where things take a turn I am unfamiliar with is how he has gained wealth and I...am still waiting for that to happen. Mark offers many very good insights on how he has achieved through some conventional and unconventional ways. It's an interesting and quick read.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|The premise was OK, but still it was a downer. It would have been more interesting as a regular science fiction movie. Anyway, you may fall asleep watching this thing.
0525478817|5.0|I sat down to read this book yesterday, and was done by last night(although i did read though a class or two), and it was so phenomenal. I have said before that the only issues with any John Green book is that 1)They do not last long enough, and 2)They have a tendance to make me cry.<br /><br />This book is perfect, and though it had sad moments, is made me feel good.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I wouldn't say this game is the best one out there but for a time waster it works well. I get so close to unlocking the game that I cant stop. I keep thinking ok, just one more try. its a good free game.
B0063GORYU|5.0|it is a very fun and addicting game.  it is easy to learn and play.  it is definitely worth downloading.
0763644765|1.0|This book is just not very good.  It did not hold my child's interest at all.  The illustrations aren't great and the explanation about how to use the potty is really lacking.  Also, as a parent, it is hard to read this book because there is not much writing . . . just the illustrations.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was fortunate to get this app as one of the free app of the day offers from the Amazon App store.  If I hadn't gotten this app for free, I would certainly have paid for it.  This is one of the few apps that I've found that is actually worth what they're asking for it.  There is no better remote desktop app.  Connection outside of a local network is a breeze with your google account information, you can change the resolution, audio comes through the android device, and it just works really well.  This is the first app that I've written a review for, because I thought it was actually worth taking the time to tell others how great this is.  I recently purchased an android tablet, and this app works great on my android phone and my tablet.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok it could be better but its good wen ur bored and its free so why not so that's it
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|One of the most magical moments of my life.  Free tickets from a friend and I end up first row center at the Concert for Bengla-Desh...A dream come true.  The moment George Harrison walked out, standing in front of me, to announce Ravi was too much.  Yes it was incredible to see all that talent on stage.  George and Eric doing While My Guitar Gently Weeps was incredible....whether Eric was stoned or not...whatever.  Dylan, I couldn't have cared less if he was there...he's a drag, a well known drag!  Always a pleasure to see Ringo!  It was an amazing night hosted by a super amazing person.....RIP George, I think your journey is complete.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so far I have had a lot of fun with this game. the little mini games are fun and easy yo play.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|With the advent of so much technology, the odds of people who don't know about God picking up a  Bible seems low. Having an app like this is a great way of keeping the Bible accessible, and a way to reach those who may not know god otherwise.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Just finished this book, and I'm so sad it finished because it was absolutely amazing. From the moment I started reading I couldn't put it down. I would stay reading up late at night, knowing my son would wake up soon. I was seriously addicted. Amazing !!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is very fun, challenging, and just entertaining in general. You can't just sit down and beat the whole thing in one night which means it's lasting fun. It works great on the Kindle Fire as far as I can tell, and it's free.
B0068RGVMK|4.0|Nightwish has released their new album upon us, and this time, they're going above and beyond the music - they're working on a movie to work as a companion piece to this album. Or is the album the companion to the movie? Overall the album sounds like it could work as a movie soundtrack, so until the movie is released, we might only be hearing half of the entire \\"work.\\" It may not be completely realized and appreciated until we see the visuals with the audio. But I am somewhat digressing, I'm here to review the album itself.   I have been a Nightwish fan since probably 2004. I still consider \\"Once\\" to be their #1, unbeatable masterpiece. The introduction of Anette Olzon on Dark Passion Play as the new singer garnered its own drama and arguments amongst Nightwish fans - myself included. But that was in 2007. Since then, I've grown to accept the fact that we have a new singer for the band, one who sings in a completely different style than Tarja, and that she's here to stay. My expectations for Imaginaerum were high once I saw the \\"Storytime\\" video. After watching it the first time, I swore that Nightwish just shot themselves in the foot by releasing, hands down, THE best song off the whole album as a single, and that the rest of the album just might pale in comparison. Well, yes and no. Here is my track-by-track review.  1. \\"Taikatalvi\\" - this means \\"dream(s)\\" in Finnish. It is a two-and-a-half minute intro track with light orchestration and the sound of a music box winding up. Marco provides the light vocals in Finnish, sounding like a slightly mysterious ring leader introducing us to something grand. It segues right into....  2. \\"Storytime\\" - the first single off the album. I must have watched the video about 50 times before finally getting the album (I received it the day it was released here in North America). The chorus is sublime. Without a doubt one of the most memorable, catchiest melodies you may ever hear.   3. \\"Ghost River\\" - this one takes a few listens toreally appreciate, as there is a lot going on in all the musical layers. Marco's and Annette's vocals intertwine and positively menace your ears. Just wait for the short section with only the children's choir doing vocals. A pretty heavy song overall, lyrically and musically.  4. \\"Slow, Love, Slow\\" - well, what? A 1930's noir-style song on a Nightwish album? And yet, it works. I find it a little strange that this kind of major change in musical style takes place so early in the album, and it does feel like it interrupts the flow a bit...you start with an intro track that builds into an amazingly explosive opener with a phenomenal chorus, we settle down into metal territory with the next track, and then....out of nowhere all the bombast drops off and we get a very quite, sensual track. As good as the song is, I do think it belongs later in the album. But then again, if the album is telling a story from beginning to end, then that's just where it is. We'll see how it fits in when the movie is released.  5. \\"I Want My Tears Back\\" - I will be utterly amazed if this doesn't end up being single #2. Remember \\"Last of the Wilds\\" off of DPP? Expect more of the same Celtic instruments/melodies, but then add to it yet another memorable catchy chorus, a rousing musical breakdown with guitar and Celtic instrument. Love it to death. A truly stand-out track of the whole album.   6. \\"Scaretale\\" - This one is the most unique track on the whole album (not counting SLS, since that was of a completely different musical genre). It starts out epic, builds up, moves into heavy metal with some absolutely wicked and twisted vocals from Annette (imagine her as a dark Snow White or something). And then...at 4:15....the music changes drastically into what sounds like a psycho circus. Imagine Danny Elfman's more \\"out there\\" compositions. That's what it sounds like. Another memorable track.  7. \\"Arabesque\\" - a three-minute instrumental that, for the album's purposes, doesn't do much. It's nothing special, but maybe it's a key portion of the movie. We'll see. Meh.  8. \\"Turn Loose the Mermaids\\" - a quieter, folk-influenced song that is mainly acoustic with Annette singing. It's a pretty song. Makes up for DPP's \\"Eva\\" being so horrendously cliche'd and Nightwish's worst ballad ever. Actually, this song reminds me of \\"The Islander\\" off the same album, but with a little more instrumentation.  9. \\"Rest Calm\\" - at 7 minutes, it's nothing amazing. The last 3 minutes are very repetitive and just keep droning on. Not a bad song, but I had to play it again to remind myself of what it sounded like. Not a stand-out at all.  10. \\"The Crow, the Owl and the Dove\\" - half heavy-acoustic, half rock-oriented, this one has vocals by Marco and Annette. A really good one, the chorus is quite memorable. Sounds kinda folk-ish once again.  11. \\"Last Ride of the Day\\" - Awesome. Rousing, fantastic chorus, and epic at moments. Once again, a big Celtic/folk influence on the chorus' melody.  12. \\"Song of Myself\\" - ugh. This is it. This is the main reason I just can't give this album that one extra star. At 13 minutes, one would expect this song be the very definition of epic. I mean, prior to this album, we've had \\"The Pharaoh Sales to Orion,\\" \\"Fantasmic,\\" \\"Beauty of the Beast,\\" \\"Ghost Love Score\\" (the single best song Nightwish has ever made, hands down), and then DPP's \\"The Poet and the Pendulum.\\" Every one of these \\"epic\\" tracks were fantastic. So what happened here? Well, it starts out awesome. It builds up with orchestration and the usual metal sound...the staccato choir outbursts give me chills down my spine. In the 2nd section of the song (it's broken down into 4 named parts), which begins at about 3:40, it slows down and remains heavy. All is still well, this could become a sweeping arc like Ghost Love Score. And then, the seven-minute mark arrives, and it all goes downhill from there. From that 7-minute mark all the way to the final second of the song at 13:38 (so basically, 6and a half minutes), we are treated to light orchestration while spoken word poetry is narrated. And that's it. The music stops about 45 seconds before the narration ends. I felt absolutely cheated to have the big, epic \\"finale\\" song end up promising so much, and it just gets robbed from you. Maybe the poetry means a lot to somebody. And I'm sure it's beautiful to certain people. I'm sure when the movie is released, this poetry is going to make a whole lot more sense in the grander scheme of the overall work. Heck, I'll even go so far as to say that I wouldn't have been nearly as disappointed if the spoken word was three minutes long. But six?? And don't forget, this is the CLIMAX to a fantastic album, and there's absolutely no payoff.   13. \\"Imaginaerum\\" - a 6-minute medley of all of the main themes heard throughout the album, entirely orchestrated. This is a bittersweet track. It the final entry of a great album overall, and it basically summarizes all the great things you just heard over the past 68 minutes. BUT - it comes after the horrendous spoken word narration. You're too busy being annoyed at how the album ends to really appreciate the final track, which Tumoas has said is the \\"ending credits\\" soundtrack. But how can I feel satisfied when the end credits come up if I was just cheated out of an ending that could have been breathtaking (once again, I refer to \\"Ghost Love Score\\" as the perfect climax to any Nightwish album).  So in the end, I have to give the album 4/5 stars. \\"Song of Myself\\" just ruined the end for me, and the final track just isn't strong enough of a band-aid. In fact, listening to it makes the wound sting even more because it follows something that could have been so good....but wasn't. The narration should have been cut out or cut down - and I would have been much happier if it was cut down.   Nightwish, you guys made another great album, but pulled the rug out from me at the very end. Hopefully the movie will prove to me the purpose andreasoning of the narration and show me that it was the right ending to this musical journey.
B0053TMP24|5.0|i read thhhis book in 5 days an i dont normally read fast. so  that means it is a good book.
0553801473|2.0|It looks like this series is headed for disaster. Classic example of a writer self indulging himself into irrelevance. JRR Martin obviously has completely disconnected with the reason we read fiction and fantasy in particular, which is to be entertained. This story has lost most of what made it so entertaining in the first three books. There is no significant plot progression for two books now. Two 1000+ page books I might add...  !!!!<br /><br />I'm sick of the fanboys defending these last two books with \\"Martin is setting up the final two books with these last two\\" and suggesting that I'm not a mature reader because I don't want to read hundreds of pages of what is obviously needless filler. This book and Feast sucked, although this one sucked a little less, which is the reason for the second star which I'm not really sure it deserves. If you can't set up the end of the series without writing two boring books, what does that say about the writer? Am I wrong to want to be entertained by the middle books of a series? The Two Towers was not boring, The Empire Strikes Back was not boring. Why must Feast and Dance be so boring and un-plot driven? The only answer is that Martin has lost the thread here, and I'm pretty pissed off that I've spent time and money slugging through the last two books and then I'm expected to just accept it on the chance (and I think it's a slim one) that Martin will actually make something happen in the next book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the best thing that can happen now is for Martin to give up and let somebody else ghost write the rest of the series for him. At this point, I don't think I'm going to even read the next book, but I don't have to make that decision for at lease four more years as Martin will take at least that long to crap out another book.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|This app is listed as being compatible with my Samsung Galaxy Nexus. It is fun while it works (which is usually about a minute.) After that it locks up, and it's a forced close. This bug needs to be fixed by the developers.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I would rate this app at 3 out of 5 stars. It is a fun app with lots of game possibilities, but some of the games are difficult or confusing to play. Worth downloading.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's not the best thing I ever played and the ads are a bit intrusive. However it does its job well. The minigames all make for a quick, easy experience in casual gaming that makes it easy to put down if you need to go do something and then pick it right back up again later. Plenty of variety, too.

B000MV8XPG|5.0|I purchased this item as a Christmas present for my 28-month-old. He absolutely loves it!  He has already mastered the two levers (one makes the arm go up and down, the other moves the \\"digger\\"). He makes piles of blocks or other toys so he can \\"dig\\" them up. Can't wait for spring so we can take it out to the sandbox!  My other two children (ages 6 & 8) also love playing with it.  It appears to be well made.  The assembly instructions were a bit hard to decipher at first, but once I got going, it went together pretty quickly.  Would definitely recommend this product.

B006O5XYWG|4.0|The movie Rise of the Planet of the Apes is about a genetically engineered chimp named Caesar, who was created in San Francisco lab, by an ambitious scientist. Caesar uses his powerful intellect to lead an ape uprising against all human kind.     This movie is an unbelievable movie, I enjoyed it very much. I think who ever watches it should appreciate it. This movie got     a total rating of 4.2 stars out of 5 in IMDB and 83% out of 100 in rotten tomatoes, which is great. The age group I suggest for this movie is PG-13, because it is more appropriate for the age. If you are younger than that age group you would probably lose track during the movie.       There are many reasons that make this movie incredible. The special effects in the movie make the situation in the scene look very realistic. Famous actors as, James Franco and Freida pinto are in this movie. The director of this movie is, Rupert Wyatt, which is a good sign, because he also directed and wrote the movie, The Escapist and Subterrain. The pro of this movie is, that while you watch it, you get more attracted to it. One con for it is, that the entire movie is supposed to be about the chimps uprising on the human kind, but in the end after the chimps escape and go to the forest nothing more than that happens.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|The game was fun and can be challenging. It is very easy to beat the entire game though. Took me 15 minutes. If you don't get it for free, don't waste your money on it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a very fun app. It is the easiest way to get lots of fun games without paying for it. I recommend this app for anyone who enjoys playing random games just to pass the time.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|What can i say....works fantastic!... works very much like Windows Remote ...plus..the added perk is that you can harass your teenage son without him knowing who it is while he is on Facebook. Lol

0802130208|4.0|This is where Amazon always out does anyone.....want a book?  Check Amazon.  The book came quickly and packaged in a neatly fitting box.  Pristine condition paperbacks, sound price and assurance what you order is what you get, expectations included.  If you haven't read Confederacy of Dunces, you are indeed going to read a true literary treat!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|The first time I met Ignatius J. Reilly was many years back as a young man in my teens.  The book was beyond anything I'd ever read up to that point in my life.  The characters are richly imagined and beautifully portrayed down to the N'Awlins accent!  A must read for anyone with a sense of humor or love of the city of New Orleans!
B002RSDW8A|4.0|Let me just say that this movie is delightful. For those that have read the book as I have, it may be disappointing if you're expecting a word for word depiction. However, if you're willing to accept some \\"artistic license\\" in the movie than I fully believe you'll love it. I'm a librarian by day, and amateur gourmet chef by night. I love cooking and this is actually one of my favorite movies to pop in while making a pie (my specialty!) or enjoying a rainy afternoon. Meryl Streep delivers a Julia Child that is shockingly realistic. Amy Adams fully captures the charm and somewhat childish nature of Julie Powell. Fabulous actors like Stanley Tucci are just a bonus to the overall package. The only reason I gave the movie four instead of five stars is that there are a few scenes from the book that I really loved that were not included. Overall, a wonderful movie with a wonderful cast that I will enjoy for many wonderful years to come.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|I love the books and i could not tear my self away from them. i would find every little spare min or my date to read the trilogy, and after i finished the 3rd one i heard that there is going to be a movie. i watched the trailer and it looks like they are keeping to the book so i hope it will be as soon as the books were or they (the directors) are going to have some really angry fans of the books. I cant wait!!!!
B004FOA84A|3.0|super fun, but REALLY short. I just feltnlike I was getting into the game and it was over. I wish there was more. Especially since this wasn't a free game. I finished it in about an hour.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some of the games are pretty fun but as said before there are a TON of ads. If you can get over the ads it is a decent app. They even have a version of snake from the old nokia phones!

1451648537|5.0|A fascinating book on a fascinating individual. Isaacson does a great job balancing the power and influence of Jobs with his quirky and maniacal personality in an easy to read biography.<br /><br />There are lots said or implied about Jobs in the book, but most of all it was Jobs' uncanny ability to focus and to convince others that something impossible could be done. In fact, had to be done. He became the catalyst that made the impossible happen.<br /><br />I've always had a fascination for the zen-like purity, simplicity and utility of design in Apple's hardware, software and user interface. If you look at it from an engineering, or even artistic, point of view, its what we should always strive for.<br /><br />I've had my share of software development projects and in my own way I tried to create something really better. But more often than not, we normal people create something \\"good enough\\" or sometimes worse, \\"what the user wants.\\"<br /><br />Jobs was not bound to those normal rules. Fortunately, he was successful early and had the funding and contacts to pursue his dreams. He did not believe in market research or surveys. He felt he knew, or had the responsibility to figure out, what users really wanted before they even knew. I know that feeling too, and basically he is right - if you have the guts and ability to risk everything and create really ground-breaking products.<br /><br />Isaacson describes Job's philosophy as merging the humanities with technology. Its a good way to put technology in its best light. The best technology helps us live and work in a way that improves our humanity. We communicate better, work more efficiently, know more, and take pleasure in what we can accomplish with the aid of technology.<br /><br />Jobs could be cruel, distant, blunt, obstinate, and hateful. But I'd like to think that time and his last years mellowed him a bit as he pondered death approaching. He was human after all. You could argue he could have been more human. But would that have changed what he accomplished?<br /><br />The book was personal for me. I may not be the perfect critic of its contents. But I enjoyed the experience of reliving thirty years of awe-inspiring ideas and inventions, bold and brash business challenges, and mostly, the inspiration to believe in and push for excellence. Rather, than a the typical corporate suit story this was more the story of a generation that could and would do better. We need more Steve Jobs.ok was personal for me.

1591843790|5.0|I admit it-I am a fan of Kawasaki's writings. I am also a fan of books without fluff and platitudes, books that tell it like it is and spell out practical step by step useful and specific information.  Enchantment is such a book. He exercises a sharp eloquence and drives points home with examples, do's and don'ts in a very relatable way.  I am in the middle of my 2nd read through the book and I am getting even more out of it than the first time.  Kawasaki revisits some of the concepts from his other great book \\"Rules for revolutionaries\\".  This book is a must read. Give yourself the gift of clarity on the concepts presented. [...]

B0034G4ORC|1.0|Some films are void of all merit.  You want to find something worthy of your time within them, but they just rest there like the complete failure that they are.  I wasn't expecting something great from `Battle: Los Angeles' but I was expecting something.  Instead, what I got was a halfbaked attempt at infusing a science fiction, alien film with a war mentality.  There are a slew of characters all layered with `real life issues' and yet none of them feel even remotely `real'.  They are all empty and soulless and `who really cares' and yet, this film thinks that it is saying something important.  I hate when a film thinks it is saying more than it really is.  This film desperately wanted to be `District 9', or at least capitalize on its success, but it lacked so much of the formers rooted realism.  Instead, `Battle: Los Angeles' tosses balance out the window and meanders so long that it becomes a boring, pointless, misguided waste of time.  In the wise words of my Ammy Twin; \\"GOOD GRIEF!\\"

When he reached the last cd it was scratch and caused the cd to   freeze on the first part of the movie. we finally got it going when we advanced it.

0439023521|5.0|After hearing all of my friends give The Hunger Games such glowing reviews I decided to give the book a shot. My friends were not overselling it, the book is fantastic.  Over 3 days I read the entire series, I could not put the books down! The first book is by far my favorite and I cannot wait to read it again in the future. I loved everything about The Hunger Games, the realism of the characters, the vibrant imagery, and the momentum.<br /><br />I will give a warning to parents or younger readers: The book centers around children dying. While not very graphic the movie version could have easily had an R rating. The author does not go into gory detail about the deaths but I know that some people will find the deaths unsettling.
B00628RVV0|4.0|I've read the book upon which this movie is based, and also reviewed it. The book makes for a thoughtful discussion on the Holocaust, though it did have some problems having to do with plot implausibilities. Yet despite all of that, I did think the book added some value to novels dealing with the Holocaust, especially in portraying the story from the 8-year-old German Aryan boy's point of view.<br /><br />Now on to the movie - the story follows the book closely with some adaptations. Set during WW II, 8-year-old German Aryan, Bruno finds his carefree life in Berlin is about to come to an end as his father [David Thelis] has been promoted to the position of Kommandant thus necessitating the family's move to a rural outpost which is nameless. So, Bruno [Asa Butterfield], his 12-year-old sister Gretel [Amber Beattie], mother [Vera Farmiga] and dad make the move. Bruno is initially not impressed with his new surroundings - there are no other houses nearby and the children are not able to attend school, taught instead by a bigoted old tutor who subscribes to Nazi ideology. Bruno in the meantime has discovered a 'farm' close by and to his immense delight, meets another 8-year-old boy with the curious name of Schmuel [Jack Scanlon] who seems to have tons of 'friends' and has the luxury of wearing 'pajamas' all day. Though he is forbidden to explore the back of the house, Bruno makes clandestine visits to his friend, who sadly cannot play with him as they are separated by a barbed wire fence, which Bruno thinks is to keep the animals out. The pair's friendship grows every day, and Bruno begins to learn some disturbing things, such as the ill-treatment of Jews. In the meantime, Bruno's mother Ilse [Vera Farmiga] begins to fall apart as she makes some horrific discoveries of her own. The rest of the story deals with what happens to Bruno and Schmuel.<br /><br />There are some plot implausibilities - the fact that Bruno is so incredibly naive about Jews and the ideology of hatred against them is hard to accept if only because most German Aryan boys of Bruno's age would have been in the Hitler Youth and thus exposed to such teachings. Bruno being a high-ranking Nazi officer's son would most certainly have been in the Hitler Youth as would his sister. Also, Ilse's naivete seems implausible. As for Schmuel, most young children were immediately selected for the gas chambers upon arrival, and it seems almost miraculous that Schmuel survived for as long as he did, and was able to meet Bruno so often without detection.<br /><br />But, implausibilities aside, I still liked this movie - it manages to portray the innocence of children in a depraved world so very credibly, and this is largely due to Asa Butterfield's amazing performance as the naive Bruno whose eyes are slowly 'opened' to the cruelty evident around him. Jack Scanlon's Schmuel is also credible -the chemistry between the two boys is very real, and their friendship is altogether believable. Vera Farmiga's performance as the tormented Ilse is the most powerful adult performance in this movie - she delivers a finely-nuanced performance that makes us believe Ilse was truly horrified by what was being done to the Jews. The other adult male characters delivered rather weak performances - David Thewlis as the Kommandant was stiff in his role and seemed ill at ease for the most part, the sadistic Nazi driver seemed very much a one-dimensional character, and even the Jewish houseworker was not given much character development.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" succeeds in getting under one's skin and doesn't cop out with a happily ever after ending, for the climax is brutal and mind-numbing. The child actors' powerful performances enables the movie to address questions about humanity and man's capacity for evil.red against them is hard to accept if only because most German Aryan boys of Bruno's age would have been in the Hitler Youth and thus exposed to such teachings.

1608191664|4.0|Hopefully, all the candidates running so hard to win The Presidency have read this book. It is so straightforward that I believe all of those folks could read and understand it. However, whether they would act in a positive manner after learning the author's explanation of economic facts (which they should already know) is quite a different matter, I am very doubtful they will.   I did put the book down in frustration a few times while reading.   Because the  author details how and why we are in such a financial mess, it is difficult not to be perturbed upon learning the details.   Do you think the economic godhead Greenspan could get through more than thing one, thing two, and thing three?  The book should be used in college level economics courses.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|I downloaded this app for free just for fun. It's not very complex, but it's still challenging for an adult. Some of the categories were surprisingly thoughtful and I did have to get 'hints' a few times. I imagine children would have a great deal of fun with this, particularly younger children.

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this game, played it on the relaxed setting, nice to know that all the fun isn't over and I have the other levels. to play through.  Next time I hope I don't stay up all night. On a critical note the verbal. exchange were tedious,  but needed for the plot line. It would be nice if they could flow a little better. over all great game that kept me ingaged.

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|As far as I was concerned, my ticket to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was paid for as soon as the opening credits rolled. After an awkward cold open in which two old men share one line of dialog, Trent Reznor and Karen O's cover of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song breaks the quiet mood. While Karen screams about those Scandinavians \\"from the land of ice and snow,\\" silvery images of breaking faces, bleeding technology, unfurling flowers, fire, and who knows what else rip across the screen.  Based on the first book in the Swedish Stieg Larsson's trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo follows journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) and computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), the former head of the grand Vanger enterprises, lures Blomkvist to a small town on an island in order to solve the mystery of his long lost niece. Because she disappeared during a family reunion, at a time when an accident blocked off access to the island, Vanger is convinced a relative murdered her. Meanwhile, the audience also follows Salander, a punkish young woman who is under the care of the state for violent behavior. We witness her abuse, her ruthless, methodical reaction to said abuse, and her genius with a computer.  The film manages to overcome one of my biggest pet peeves: characters in a foreign country speak English with a foreign accent. (Why bother? They're supposed to be speaking another language anyway. The whole world doesn't revolve around English.) The mostly British and American cast tend to speak with a slight Swedish lilt. Another problem with the movie is a certain violent scene which lingers on the perpetrator's sadism, seemingly in order to justify retaliation.  Reznor and Atticus Ross's ambient soundtrack is sometimes self-conscious, as are the sharp editing and Jeff Cronenweth's striking cinematography. However, this approach works: it infuses the film with suspense, conveys the book's intensity, and turns moments which could have been difficult to translate from the page into resonant scenes.  Steven Zaillian's script has been very well edited, weaving subtle themes about greed, victimization, and xenophobia. In general, the few changes from the book clarify the plot. The screenplay is a surprisingly successful balance of character development, dramatic tension, and satisfying solutions.  Most of the characterizations are intriguing and true to their source. Craig's believable and sympathetic Blomkvist might be an improvement on the original. Mara depicts the wildly popular Salander's mixture of detachment, calculation, viciousness, and vulnerability. Plummer's friendly but cunning Vanger is especially close to Larsson's description. Other Vanger relatives are played by Stellen Skarsgaard (excellent as Henrik's amiable nephew), an appropriately cold Geraldine James, and a sensitive Joely Richardson.  Niels Arden Oplev's 2009 Swedish adaptation of the same novel had the disadvantage of a shorter length (it was cut down from a miniseries) and a smaller budget (I assume). The two stars Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace were fantastic, but the series lacked imagination. Overall Fincher's version better captures the feel of the book, and in some cases even improves upon it. I would love to see the sequels to this beautifully shot, gripping adaptation.
0312641893|5.0|First off, I was disappointed that all the books in the series aren't already in print.  Secondly, the character development is well paced and the story line had me hooked after the first couple of pages.  Obviously, I enjoyed it and I'm ready for the next installment.  I hope that you will have the same reaction.  For a first book, it's very well planned and paced and again, the only drawback is that the other books aren't already available.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is fun because there is all kinds of different games for anything you wanted to play! I totally recommend it because there is a huge variety of games for everyon

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Easy to order, excellent turnaround, and no hassle. DVD was in perfect condition. I would definitely order from this vendor again.
0525478817|5.0|I received \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" by John Green in perfect condition and it was early for arriving! It was a signed copy(because I pre-ordered it)!
0783239955|3.0|I finally saw \\"The Dinner Game\\" this week after much anticipation. It was difficult to get a copy of the film at my local video store so I had to sign up for the online version of the store in order to access French films. Let me say I do enjoy French films immensely. I am a big Francis Veber fan, loving \\"The Closet,\\" \\"Les Comperes\\" and most recently \\"The Valet.\\" This was highly reviewed but I have to say it was not as funny as I expected.<br /><br />The film is about misunderstandings and a man who doesn't have much common sense. He keeps getting our protagonist into a deep hole by basically ruining his marriage, getting him audited and just being a plain ole nuissance. You'll hate Pignon but the minute you think \\"can this man be any stupider?\\" he does something amazing and you like him....for a minute!<br /><br />Again the film is recommendable, especially if you enjoy French humor, but this is not Veber's best, at least not in my opinion.

B003UESJH4|5.0|As a history major, I love films that take you back in time and give you a sense of the luminaries who dominated an age.  This film does that, capturing the urbane, confident Edward and his more awkward, unsocially-glib brother, Bertie.  The real story is the relationship between the king and his speech therapist, Logue, brilliantly acted by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush who are friends in real life.  They were the perfect foil to each other. What an amazing relationship depicted between them!  What's fascinating is the director of this movie had no idea the audience would find their scenes together as being comic. Comic, tender and poignant.    Helen Bonham Carter reigned as the Queen and a talented supporting cast added to the excellence of the movie.  It was so entertaining my 26-year-old son recommended it to me and stayed to watch it again.  Loved the set design and film color which gave the appearance of the era being a muted greige (grey + beige) which suited the pallor of the times.  The film was an original delight and the best film I saw this past year.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have to say when I came here looking for others reviews to help me decide if I really wanted to finish the series I was totally turned off! So many said this was a horrible ending to their beloved Hunger Games trilogy. But I must argue that this final book is truly worth reading!!!  While I was in the beginning hoping that the books would evolve more around Katniss and Peeta, i finally realized that Collins wanted so much more then just a love story set to a post-apocalyptic world! It was about life, and findng how to live in a world that is no longer humane, and finding a way to see past all the tragic and horrifng things to get back to some sort of a life once your forced to grow up way too fast! This book is great, give it chance!
1400079144|5.0|I just finished The Lost Symbol and I have to say, after reading some of these scathing reviews, I don't get all the criticism.   My first thought after finishing the last page was, \\"What great fun!\\" That's what it was to me. A great, fun read, filled with some absolutely fascinating information that I didn't take entirely seriously, but enjoyed nevertheless. DC is one of my favorite cities and I was fascinated by the minutiae accompanying  the descriptions of the buildings, history, paintings, rituals, etc. Sometimes I'd run to the computer in mid-chapter just to look up something (the reading room at the Library of Congress, the Apotheosis) so I got an education on top of a good time. That's how I look at it, anyway.   I always view Dan Brown's work as a mix of fantasy and reality, with characters being able to do things that real people couldn't get away with (wouldn't all those car chases and helicopters draw the attention of law enforcement and/or media in one of the most watched cities in the world? How could Katherine survive being almost bled to death and still be climbing catwalks? things like that) BUT... that's what makes it so FUN. I don't question Indiana Jones being dragged underneath a truck and still being chipper enough to save the day. It's FANTASY.  Wordsworth said \\"we murder to dissect.\\" The more you analyze this book the more you kill it. Just relax and enjoy it. I think it more than fulfilled its goal of entertainment so it did everything I expected it to. I didn't want it to end.  In fact, I'm going to read it all over again - now that I know the ending - and I bet I love it even more.
B006FE17Q6|3.0|Fire the writer  slash the budget  and stretch out the story as long as one can in order squeeze an extra season or two.  But I guess by watering it down it ensures the Non scfi set will watch too.  pity Frank was shafted I would have like to see the \\"Fall of Alanta\\" that sounds like it would have really spiced up the season.  No doubt AMC  are already aware they messed up.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its just a little hard to get points because. some of the games are hard for me. its still fun though.
0446567337|2.0|Not one of Spark's best.  The book moves at a slow pace, the characters are predictable and worse, flat; Sparks never manages to make the reader care about what happens to them. Die-hard hopeful, I read to the end, hoping for a twist or for some type of redemption in the slow and non-engaging story. It never arrived.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|I bought this item and it arrived on time and in great condition. I have no children but this one is for me. I know, I know. At 44 years old some might think I am a bit too old to be playing with Legos but this one reminds me of when the real space shuttle was still in development and considered by some to be impossible. Even with the tragedies of Challenger and Columbia, this was a successful program by any standard. I wanted something I could build to honor the men and women of the Shuttle era but had no wish to build a simple plastic model. I have always loved whiling away the hours with a lego set because it helps me relax after a long day. One is never too old for classic play.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|My younger cousins like it. But, the game controls are super slow, and the games are not explained very well ... you have to get points to unlock the other games, which means you have to play games that you didn't really want to play ...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun game very addicting j cant stop playing it in my opinion overall a good game and hope more games like this are made

B0061JPYX2|5.0|I bought this for a friend for Christmas.  He loves it and so do I.  We are so sad that she is gone.  Beautiful Music.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|A gift for a new owner of Kindle Fire.  Perfect fit and she loved the strap for a handle along with the ability to have a stand.
B002HFJ77S|3.0|Twenties Girl is a cute chick read about Lara and her great aunt Sadie who has recently passed away. Lara and others think she's crazy when Lara starts seeing and talking to her dead great aunt Sadie. The story is full of humor, love, mystery, and family. It's an easy read, but the story line is too far fetched in some areas. Not one of Kinsella's best.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|very slow and boring game-rajes forever ti unlock any new games!! waste of time and device memory. even little kids cant stand this!!
B0014XCMVM|5.0|Just love her music.  She has such a unique voice.  I bought it for myself for Christmas.  I enjoy listening to her.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This movie is absolutely fantastic. Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler were spot on. I fell in love with Gerard Butler when I saw him in \\"PS I Love You\\" But WOW - What a voice. He just knocked me out with the opera singing and what a hunk. And Emmy Rossum has a superior opera voice, especially for someone so young. And she's just so beautiful. I saw the opera twice but was so impressed with this movie. BRAVO!!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Very convenient and provides a good measure of protection for the Kindle. Like the magnetic snap cover and the secure fit as well.
B005VPRETE|5.0|This is a great set with good value. It's very customizable (ie you don't need to follow the instructions to make a great looking treehouse). I like how this toy stimulates thinking beyond the \\"instructions\\" unlike a lot of the Star Wars Lego vehicles for example which don't really reconfigure well. The best part of course is that my 6year old is finally excited about a Lego set; she totally loves it, and I'm sure more of them will make it on to the wish list. You won't regret this purchase!
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I've been using this app for ages with no problems. It's installed on my Evo4g, iPod Touch, PC and now my Kindle Fire. The problem is - The version offered in the Android Market is version 3.4.2 while the version in the Amazon App Market is version 3.2.2<br /><br />Even after removing the app from my phone and installing the older Amazon offered version, the app notifies constantly there is an update available. Yes, but not here on Amazon! This is also causing the notification to appear on my Kindle Fire. It's become so annoying I'm ready to look for another cross platform note taking app.<br /><br />I keep my life on Evernote, and love the features. It's been great to snap pics through the app on my phone and have them instantly on all my devices.<br /><br />I don't understand why it takes Amazon so long to release updates, especially from trusted, tried and true productivity developers.<br /><br />I don't want to give up on Evernote, but the false update notifications showing up on my android devices is getting really tiresome and old.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these are the type of games you can play with no real thought and little commitment.  good addition to any fire.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|I liked the movie, despite critics' reviews. I suppose they were expecting more from this movie than what it really is: plain old fun. Nothing like watching a bunch of cowboys on horseback fighting aliens. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It looks and sounds great on blu ray, as expected. I am glad I bought it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This was the first app I added to my Kindle Fire, and it works well.  It took me a few minutes to learn how to use it well, but I'm comfortable with it now.
0060931736|5.0|Good item. The only problem was the way it was packaged, I had to rip it open to get the book out, so I ripped the back cover.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Throughout Thirteen Reasons Why, I felt like I was along with Clay Jensen on his journey to figure out why exactly Hannah Baker committed suicide. Every time he went somewhere, I pictured that I was sitting right next to him listening to every one of Hannah's thirteen reasons. This book had me reading day in and day out, and even in the dark at night with a flashlight just like a kid. I really liked how the author had me thinking about how important it is to help people out when they're in need. Every little thing you say to someone could leave an emotional scar.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|Very bad acting and even worse plot. One of the worst movies I ever tried to watch. I tossed it in the garbage after the 1st viewing. Ten minutes into the movie they have an extended scene showing a 16 year old guy masturbating. Yes, they have an extended scene showing the guy masturbating. I DID NOT WANT A SNUFF FILM!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|For the price I bought this ($70.00) was a good deal for me and the detail looks great.  I don't know what I'm going to do with all the regular dvd's now that I have this new box set.  This new set takes up very little room compared to the old ones.  I was first impressed with the first movie in the kitchen scene when Harry comes back from the speaking to \\"the snake \\" scene.  I plan on watching the other movies soon.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games.are.really fun. I don't think the games allow you to earn enough points to be able to unlock more. I don't like the points thing at all. it would take forever to unlock all the games. if it wasn't for needing zoology many points than it would be a really awesome game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an addicting game that goes on forever!  it is a lot of fun to do with my friends.  I have experienced 0 bugs or viruses
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app! love having the different choices of types of bibles and being able to read anywhere I go.  I recommend this to anyone who lives on the go!

0307593312|4.0|If you are familiar with Murakami's books and like them, I probably don't have to do too much to convince to read this one. It's done in the same whimsical style as his other books and just as good. A warning to the reader: it has a lot more NSFW scenes in comparison to his other works.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this is a awesome product I don't know why u wouldn't want to get this app I love playing allods onlone and wow with this product only probe is that's the controls r hard to work in games also no lag
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Very little instruction on how to play but pretty fun. I like having to unlock the games as I go. Games are difficult without being impossible.
B005QUQP76|1.0|Not sure if the previous reviewers are real people or working for Corsair. The new Corsair Mouse (both the M60 and M90) does not work as intended. Corsairs own forums are on fire with complaints and unhappy customers.   The mouse itself looks and feels good. But it ends there. The software it comes with is impossible to understand or use. There are no instructions and nothing makes sense. IF you do manage to figure out how to reassign keys / macro keys then you'll soon find that it can do a lot more including messing up your system.   I would highly recommend everyone to look elsewhere. This is the worst piece of hardware I've ever tried.
B0039UTDA6|5.0|The reviews complaining about Oprah may be from die hard Attenborough fans, Oprah does a fine job.  I am using the series in a school in Queens, NY and Oprah's voice is more appealing to these students than is Attenborough's English accent.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Stevie Wonder never had anything \\"little\\" about him; his music is intensely original, memorable, tuneful, melodic, and quite simply some of the best rock music of the 20th and 21st centuries. Period!

1451627289|5.0|This is an old project by Stephen King and he finally took the time to realize it, and thanks god he did take the time because his mature tone and style were needed on such a project. More about this later.<br /><br />The first thing to be said is that this book is about time travel from the present to the past. He is aware of the butterfly effect and he knows that going back to the past will disturb things no matter how little but it will disturb and each disturbance will have consequences on its future, that is to say on our present. The hero, Jake Epping, was led into that project of going back into the past to change it, what's more to prevent the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, by an older man, a cook in a diner, where the crossing bubble was, who had no notion of what he was doing. Every week on the same day at the same time he would cross into the past where he was arriving every single time on the same day at the same time. Then he walked down the main street, went to the butcher's and bought the meat he needed for his diner at 1958 price to sell it dog cheap in 2011, in fact that had been going on for years. And every week of our time, in fact on one particular day, at one particular time, every single time the same in 1958 he would buy his meat from the same butcher, hence buy and then sell the same meat, over and over again week after week.<br /><br />Then one day that man decided to stay over there till 1963 to see John Fitzgerald Kennedy and try to prevent his assassination. But he got a severe case of galloping cancer and had to come back to find a younger substitute that could go again and do it in his place. Actually he will die of an overdose of his \\"pain\\" killer just before that substitute goes.<br /><br />The substitute had tried two little trips already and was able to see the small changes on the gate warden, a wino who is there begging for some green backs. He is innocuous, but Jake Epping becomes suspicious when he sees that the card he is carrying in his fedora had changes colors from one trip to the next. But at first it is fun to buy the same car three times, to have the same discussion with the greengrocer three times, etc. In fact Jake Epping notices there are small differences from one time to the next and he wonders what would happen if he changed small details in what he says or does. And there is the butterfly fluttering by.<br /><br />His first motivation was to repair the damage done to the janitor of his school in 2011 by his father when he was a kid in 1958: this father of his killed his mother, one brother, his sister and maimed him, the janitor. Jake Epping wants to prevent that and kill the father before it happens. The first time he more or less waits too much and got into complications. The boy who will be the janitor is saved from maiming, but he ends up dead in the Tet offensive in Vietnam in 1968. No luck. So the second time he does it properly, but this time he stays till November 1963 and actually prevents the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. What a mistake indeed.<br /><br />That leads to the first remark of importance here. Stephen King follows the model of Back To The Future films and accept the idea that changing one little thing here or there will instantly change the future of that event. He disregards the position of Simon Wells who in his version of his great grandfather's The Time Machine shows that you cannot change the past: as soon as one fact is avoided, the result happens nevertheless but in different circumstances just immediately afterwards. You cannot change the past or rather if you try to change the past it immediately corrects that change. He even disregard the position advocated in the Terminator saga that if the machines from the future come back into the past to change it, in fact the future will send two people or cyborgs, one from each side (humans and machines) that will fight to the death and the good cyborg will win, preventing the badcyborg from changing the past. The past cannot be changed in other words.<br /><br />Stephen King only keeps the same principle in his mind: the future, the present and the past are happening simultaneously, which means the time line is happening in its totality at any moment, but yet he accepts the idea that changing the past will change the future. We are far from The Langoliers. You step out into the past and you can spend as many years as you want there but you will come out two minutes after your time of departure from the present and the world will be there still, though not necessarily the same. In other words Stephen King stays on the line of Back To The Future and instead of making it a comedy, he makes it a dramatic romance or a tragic nightmare. Luckily, each time you go down, or someone goes down the past is reset to what it was originally and the whole future at the same time, or so you may think, though you will be wrong because each passage leaves a residue behind and the future is slightly different because of it, and the passage becomes more and more unstable.<br /><br />But there is more, and Jake Epping is a constant witness to that fact. The past, or even time, is not neutral as for you, the changer of clocks. It resists. As he says the past is obdurate and does not want to be changed. What's more it tries to mislead you by harmonizing facts so that you find echoes from one situation to another. The past or time is trying to make you dizzy and forget your initial intention, just let go and start relaxing, dreaming and even meditating if not contemplating, but please do nothing. Time is like music and Stephen King's calls it the devil's music and the devil's music it sure is.<br /><br />Stephen king is very careful to imagine every situation in his long sojourn in the past: language, attitudes, prices, films, books, TV programs, illusions and dreams. At times this is so extremely precise that you just wonder how he could know all that about this 1958-1963 period and of course you remember he was eleven in 1958 and sixteen in 1963. So he could have a real memory of this period. Some research to make details accurate but he had it in his hip pocket, if I can say so.<br /><br />Of course he falls in love and that love affair is dramatic and I am not going to reveal the details of that. Let's say that he succeeds in preventing what he wanted to prevent but he comes back alone from his adventure. Just before crossing the bubble back to 2011 the gate keeper tells him he is dumb as his thumb and orders him to cross again, see what he has produced on the other side and then please come back and reset things to right before going out a last time. Jake Epping does not want to believe one word about all that ranting and raving, but as soon as he crosses he knows things are wrong and then in about one or two hours he finds out Maine is no longer what it used to be and certainly not what anyone could have dreamt it to be in the near future.<br /><br />This present produced by the prevention of the assassination of JFK is a nightmare and the janitor who is no janitor is in a wheel chair, the only crippled survivor of a helicopter that crashed when the few American soldiers left Vietnam in a hurried rush in the 1960s. Jake Epping has understood. He then goes down again, disregards the protest from the gate keeper and stays on the other side a few weeks, writing down a full account of what he had done and burying it in a safe box in a field for an eventual future curious person to come across it by accident. And he goes back to a present world that is seemingly the same as the one he had left behind. The time line has been reset.<br /><br />Then in 2011, his curiosity kills the cat and he finally goes down south and tries to find the woman he had loved and finds her and she is eighty years old, and there I will stop: you have to read the book to see what finally happens when he has come back after finally accepting that the past is sacred and must not be touched.<br /><br />That's where I find this novel a lot more mature than the novels that are dealing with the same or a similar subject. It is in the first person from beginning to end, which is rare with Stephen King. He comes back to the question he asked in The Dead Zone: if you knew what Hitler was going to do in 1932, would you let him live and bring the apocalypse? He has understood first that history cannot be remade, and second that history the way it is is balanced in such a way that the outcome is always the best you can imagine in the long run. If Hitler had been shot dead in 1932, what would have happened? Probably a vast take over of the whole of Europe by the Communists, and then what? A world Gulag? History is a fragile equilibrium among millions of parameters that goes towards an end which will be no terminus or termination but the slow emergence of a better situation, with setbacks like the assassination of JFK or MLK, but in the long run it will get better. If one disrupts this equilibrium with a voluntary action that forces history or speeds up history, then the balance is broken and catastrophes come up like Stalin and his gulag, like Hitler and his Holocaust, like Mao Zedong and his Cultural Revolution, or Mussolini and his Brown Shirts. That is a mature position because it is trust in history and not a personal individualistic and idealistic position.<br /><br />The only shortcoming I may think of is that the tone of the book is slower than what we are used to with Stephen King. That could also be seen as a sign of maturity: takes time to consider all options and all the butterflies you may crush or disturb.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUn 1963.

Traveling back into the past was reliving life as it was in the late 50's early 60's. An entertaining, moving romance that keep me wanting more.  Did not disappoint.

1586487981|3.0|The authors are experts on collecting data for the poverty research. The book is full of numbers, percentages, such as 8.2 births per 1000 women, 10%, etc. Every page is a result of their research.  It makes a compelling read.<br /><br />  But the flow of the book is bad.  One paragraph talks about India, then next sentence deals with China, Indonesia or other villages. It is difficult to understand the main theme of each chapter. S-shape curve and Jeffery Sachs kept popping up, but the explanation is different each time. Then they talk about the theory and the results do not match.<br /><br />  Therefore it is back to square ONE.  How do you solve the poverty issue?  Micro Finance, Yes and No.  Government intervention, Yes and No.  Lower interest rate, Yes and No. The end result, is no clear solution or recommendation. As a reader, I am more confused after reading this book.<br /><br />  I will recommend this book for students that are Economics majors in University.  This book is not for the general public.

B003R0LBVW|4.0|I loved \\"The Corrections,\\" like many reviewers here, and found this one hard to read.  I could feel the writer striving to out-do himself, and it effected the overall believability of the characters.  Franzen is very gifted, but perhaps there was too much pressure on him, since \\"The Corrections\\" garnered so much praise and was embraced so deeply by his fans.  That's a lot to live up to.  Still, there was enough here to recommend.

0316017930|5.0|One of the most popular myths in the USA is the one in which a person success against all odds by themselves. These are the `rag-to-riches' stories told throughout the nation to give hope to those `without' while boosting the pride of those `with.'<br /><br />Yet as Malcolm Gladwell shows in his book \\"Outliers: The Story of Success\\" these stories are far from truthful. Instead they leave out very important details about how a person rose through the ranks - details that show that individual people own a ton more to their ancestors, the people around them and their cultural than perhaps they want to admit.<br /><br />Take for example Canadian hockey players. If you look at the birthdates of all the professional hockey players in Canada you will find that an overwhelmingly number of them were born in January, February or March versus the other nine months of the year. Why is that?<br /><br />Well in Canada, the youth hockey league determines eligibility based upon birthdates with a start time of January 1st. Therefore children born closer to the beginning of the year have longer to develop physically and mentally than their team mates who were born at the end of the year. This advantage causes them to stand out among their peer which gives them more face time with the coaches who like to encourage start players. As time goes on, the slight advantage of a birth date builds into a huge advantage that eventually leads to disproportionate birthday numbers mentioned.<br /><br />In continuing along those lines Gladwell shows how `rags-to-riches' superstar Bill Gates - the college dropout turn world's richest man - owns his success not to his own work ethic, which does helped mind you, but to the opportunities given to him by his family.  As in, Gate's parents put him in an exclusive preparatory middle school which just-so-happened to have both a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and the mainframe computer time to run it - something virtually unheard in 1968.<br /><br />This slight advantage over others in his generation lead to various opportunities in high school for Gates to work as a computer programmer during the beginning of the computer revolution.  As time went on all of these choices combined to propel Gates to the forefront of success - something that could never have happened without the opportunities offered to him by his family and the location of his schooling.<br /><br />It is as Dallben said to Taran in Lloyd Alexander's [[ASIN:0805080481 The Book of Three (The Chronicles of Prydain Book 1)]]:<br /><br />\\"Nothing we do is ever done entirely alone. There is a part of us in everyone else...\\"<br /><br />We are all interconnected to each other and to a Creator who is watching and working among us. Yes, we have the freedom to decided what we do with the opportunities presented to us - but the opportunities themselves are usually determined not by our own merits but by those around us including the Lord God Himself as well as where and when we are born.<br /><br />We are not lone ships on an ocean but part of a tapestry woven by the Lord of Heaven and Earth.ad to various opportunities in high school for Gates to work as a computer programmer during the beginning of the computer revolution.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|despite the need to unlock games it's good. And of course instead of unlocking you can buy points to buy games.
B0000640SA|1.0|I liked Guy Pirece from \\"LA. Confidential\\", and I was really looking forward to this film.  While the concept could have good, it completely breaks down.  This is one of the worst movies, in that you keep hoping it will be explained, or get better..... IT DOES NOT !
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an easy app to use. It's fast, smart, and convenient. Use it on the go, or at church, home, and at work. BRILLIANT!! &hearts; IT!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love how this app stays in the notifications area and shows the weather at every weather update. When one taps the notification spot it shows the weather and if one taps the weather it goes in greater detail. I have uninstalled my weather apps from my computer since installing this on my kindle fire...works fine on my kindle, maybe some that don't work has manufacter problems and isn't the apps fault, just sayin.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|All the movies, great quality video, great audio, heaps of extras...   Actually, Phantom Menace has really grown on me since I first saw it, and with a good sound system the pod race is quite impressive ...
0393051587|5.0|The Annotated Christmas Carol is a wonderful resource for the reader compulsive enough to want to know particulars of early Victorian society that the then contemporary reader would take for granted. It enriches the reading of this perennial favorite and allows one's imagination to take him/her to the London of 1843 in an almost palpable way. Recommended without reservation for any fan of the story and/or Charles Dickens in general.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Anyone who rated this game over 2 star most likely didn't play longer than 15 minutes yet.  It is simply a blatant advertisement scam packaged in a cheap gimmick.  Once you progress past the first set of levels it becomes nearly impossible to progress without signing up with their sponsers.. unless you have the willpower to rack up 400,000 points at 5000 points per no-replay-value game to unlock a single additional game.  Great concept turned into a miserable experience.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I'm very pleased with this product! The Fire fits perfectly inside, and the soft inside cover protects the screen when it's closed. You can easily fold the cover back for reading, or prop up for viewing movies or tv. It also comes in a varitey of colors. A perfect accessory to the Fire.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|My kids enjoyed this very much.  I am not a fan myself, but nothing here to complain about .... it's what it says, the complete 8 film collection, and not much else, which is fine if that's what you are looking for.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this app got me back into reading the Bible on a daily basis because it can go everywhere I go, the multiple reading plans available and social media sharing
B006GG1KOC|2.0|it was ok but it was kinds weird but it was fun.it would be fun if u were a kid.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that this is a pretty good set of games. Glad I had it with me to keep my nephew occupied while at the hospital!
B003CRM6QO|4.0|While the video and audio are strong (and the soundtrack rocks) and the experience to be as I expected, I found the audio commentary by the director fascinating.  I have been a longtime fan of this movie, but never heard of the amazing back story of its production ... well worth it for that alone.
