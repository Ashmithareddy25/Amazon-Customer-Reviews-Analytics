B001AQO3QA|3.0|Part one, two, and four are great.  Part three is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.  It is as boring as the latest twilight Saga part one where the lady gave birth to a vampire creature.  It just drags on for ever and ever...  Should have just bought movies separately.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The idea of Earth falling into a dystopian state has been rehashed so many times that it has long since ceased to stand on its own as an element of curious science fiction.  These books, therefore, could not rely alone on the premise of a post-nuclear apocalypse to provide it with substance and intrigue.  What was the most fascinating aspect of these books was the world-building.  Months after having read the books I can conjure in my mind scenes of the silos so detailed that I can smell the acrid odor of worn, metal handrails mixed with fresh soil and mechanics grease.  I can hear the echos of familiar laughs, cries, and the mundane chatter that make up any human microcosm.<br />I felt that the characters were all very believable, and many of them were relatable (an essential component of storytelling sorely lacking from many works of fiction I've come across lately).  While the seeming romantic relationship between the two main characters felt a little forced, or perhaps too juvenile for their respective ages, the relationships between friends and colleagues were so realistic that I was immersed in their interactions.  I'm not sure how all of this was transcribed with often frightening lucidity, but rest assured there was no listing ad nauseam of nouns and adjectives.<br />For me, this was a story about how strongly humans cling to the status quo as a mechanism for survival and stability.  Our window into this study is through a microscope poised over a petri dish.  What was most compelling, however, was the vivid description of the dish and the complexity of its residents.
B00402FGE4|5.0|This show is awesome!  However, I don't like communication stone. They are stupid and they don't make sense.  The first season is great, but the second season seem like it was running out of juice.
0307913147|5.0|I don't really read a lot of fictions these days, but when I first listened to the audio book of \\"Read Player One\\", I was hooked. There is something spiritual about this book which makes the exciting story richer and more intriguing.<br /><br />The author himself must be a fan of pop culture in the 80's - all those games, movies and music. I'm an immigrant from China in 2002 so I barely had any background of those games, movies and music, but it didn't stop me from enjoying this book. That's fascinating. In fact, I never played any electronic games in my life but still it didn't stop me from fully enjoying this books about games.<br /><br />This book paints a beautiful picture of obsession.<br /><br />What amused me is that I keep thinking about myself living this life as, indeed, an avatar, in a game. The player is my soul. I'm here on this planet earth in this journey to explore myself. My Ester Egg hunting game is for the realization that I AM immortal. To achieve it, it's a question of how to maintain a relationship with my soul,  energetically - She who's behind the computer, having the access of the eternal at her fingertips - and decode the language of my soul, learn how to listen, and align to her intentions, so I don't get lost in this world, in which I constantly feel like an outsider.<br /><br />What's important in this game of life? To find the copper, jade, and crystal keys? To locate the Ester Egg? To become multi billionaire?<br /><br />The book ended when Wade acquired all of those.<br /><br />Because what's important in any game is to PLAY.
B001993Y2C|5.0|The movie is great, but you already know that.  Packaging does suck.  It is easy to figure out, however, when you're trying to get a movie to watch everything falls out of the package, like you're holding hot potatoes.  The little Cylon is awesome. But it does not stand easily.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not going to comment about the story directly. I read another Hugh Howey novella, \\"The Plagiarist.\\" I had not read any of his other work, and I did not read the description well. I was enthralled by the story, only disappointed at its short length. When I reread the description (noting the length), I could only be thankful that info didn't turn me away. It was the best .99 I ever accidentally spent!<br /><br />I then came across Wool. Motivated by the reviews, I downloaded a sample. I didn't bother finishing the sample, and bought it. It was then that I recognized the same author of both stories.<br /><br />What they have in common is an uncommonly great use of writing as a craft to tell a story. While many people can write and tell a story, it's rare that one can forget, totally, that you are reading. The language is nearly faultless. I would guess that Mr. Howey would write a great grocery list! I've read from every genre and era, from Stephen King to Tolstoy, John Bunyan to Ernest Hemingway. I would place Mr. Howey's writing ability well above most.<br /><br />The characters are complex and well rounded. I quickly felt empathy for them, even those that might be pigeon holed as the \\"bad guys.\\" Nothing is ever as simple as it seems.<br /><br />In reading a 4 star review, it was evident the reader either had not read enough to understand the story line, or missed the point all together. Ignore the 4-star nay sayers. Ignore the sci-fi label. Join the Wool cult.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is lots of fun and I like the animals.  I play it all the time.  I really like watching the movie.
B003EYVXTG|1.0|This movie is a rather disheartening portrayal of the life of a young woman in an area of the hills where there is a lot of whiskey produced but very little trust. Although there is a bit of encouragement at the very end, life for her is rather thankless.  Her only joy comes from two younger siblings. Winter's Bone will certainly not make you feel good.

B007M6OME0|5.0|The Good Wife has quickly become my favorite show.  Amazon has made it super easy to watch any of the episodes I have missed!!!  Thanks!!!!
B007PS0X0W|4.0|I watched Underworld Awakening with low expectations because I'd heard it had low reviews.<br />I was expecting fun action but didn't know if there would be any story or characterization to go with it.<br />I was extremely disappointed with Rise of the Lycans and felt that story idea was a great story that could've have been told allot more powerfully.<br />So I was concerned about the quality level of Underworld Awakening. I thought it might do a disservice to the original Underworld ethos.<br />I was pleasantly surprised. Underworld Awakening is an engaging and suspenseful action movie from the beginning.<br />It is everything an action movie should be and the action and related suspense is well done.<br />But it is more than just meaningless action. It has a good story to it.<br />The desires and motivations of the characters are well portrayed. There are a number of surprises and plot twists as well.<br />What I'm trying to say is that the action is driven by the motivation, desires and emotions of Selene and the other characters.<br />The movie does move at a frenetic, breakneck pace but there is depth in the story, not just meaningless action.<br />I've seen plenty of meaningless, banal action movies and I detest them so I'm not one who is quick to praise every action movie just because of the \\"wow\\" factor.<br />I require more than explosions, spectacular fight scenes and action. I require that there be a story and that there be characterization, that the movie has depth. And good directing is really nice and rather essential too.<br />Don't believe the poor reviews of this movie. Those people simply don't understand it or mistake it for something else.<br />If you liked the first Underworld movie, you'll like this one.<br />If you liked the sequel you'll love this one.<br />I thought the sequel to Underworld was okay and a bit of a letdown in some ways, however still possessing good qualities. But this movie, in my mind, captures the magic of the original movie, albeit in a different way.<br />I think some people are put off by the pace of the movie, that the whole movie takes place in no more than 2 to 3 days.<br />That isn't a problem for me.<br />Bottom line:<br />The story carries the action and makes this movie meaningful, enjoyable and satisfying.<br />If there is a sequel to this one (and the ending of Awakening begs for a sequel) I hope it is a well directed, well scripted movie that the creators take seriously and not just driven by hollywood greed.<br />Excellent movie - Don't believe the poor reviewers - Highly recommended.
0439023513|3.0|Well I was not impressed with this final book the  war ending in just 3 pages seemed rushed to be finished, however I was pleased how it ended. The first book is the best of the 3.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game was great and extremely addictive.  However, that joy was short lived because of the problems.  I reached around level 20 and everything seemed to take an amount of time that is unreachable.  I agree with the other reviews, this game is great to a point then it's virtually unless.  I also, must mention that I took this app on the value of five stars and now I realized I should have read the reviews.  I think Amazon giving it 4 stars is very misleading and that number should be greatly reduced.  I guess I will have unload the app and forget the fun I had in the beginning/
0553801473|3.0|I enjoyed most of the series and I will line up to get the next book, but I really could have done without so many wild goose chases in the series. The Reek chapters had me actually glancing away in distaste at the disgusting writing. And there was one book that focused entirely on Cersei and Brienne which was terribly annoying since they are both supposed to be empowered women... which I have nothing against, but it just detracted from the story and its believability plus their part in the story was pointless as is much in the books. Again I like the series but I would have liked it better if there was less throw away sub-stories and more resolution with the main characters.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She loved all 3. It was an easier read for her, but she couldn't stop herself from finishing the book as quick as she could. She was used to Nicholas Sparks books, but I bought this for her for the reviews. She finished it in all her spare time in 2 weeks and said it was amazing.

0307951529|4.0|I read Chris Guillebeau's The Art of Non-Conformity and was pretty impressed with it.  When I was given a chance to read The $100 Startup, I was pretty excited about that, especially since I've been wanting to \\"go it on my own\\" for a while now.  I need a business that I can operate from anywhere and I didn't know how to go about doing that.<br /><br />This book gives a lot of ideas and helpful advice.  Now I'm wracking my brain, trying to figure out what I can do that makes me happy, yet has value to other people.  What can I do to help other people (something that he mentions as being something that makes it more likely you can succeed--give people something they want and need, but helping people in the process will make you stand out that much more positively).<br /><br />I only gave it a four star instead of five, since he made starting up a business sound so easy, and it's anything but.  It was accidental for a lot of people who started theirs in his examples and some of them got really lucky.  I think it makes it seem like that is just going to happen to everybody. It may not.<br /><br />But I sure want to try!  I look forward to putting the strategies in this book to work.

B000GWE44U|5.0|If you believe in ghosts then this is what you need to see. Also if you enjoy watching movies that got lots and lots of blood. This has some sort of Pet Cemetary theory to it. Warnings and images, much drama and a pool of blood every now and then.
0307951529|5.0|The $100 Startup is what 4HWW could have been.<br /><br />Start with something you are passionate about. Don't build something gimmicky. Realize that your passion doesn't mean there is a market. Look for real needs. Realize that deciding to act put something in motion - deciding is a future tense verb. By pg. 30 (which is as far as most of us get in business books) I had scribbled in the margins five times - and I DON'T scribble in the margins. I couldn't help it.<br /><br />Then Guillebeau jumps into classic ideas like understanding the Job To Be Done by your product (Christensen, The Innovator's Series) and rapidly follows it up by breaking down the difference between features and benefits. All concepts that float around business books - but he makes it so damn readable, consumable and applicable. He doesn't waste words, he minimizes fluff - even the illustrations are brilliant. I'm a book snob, and I'm telling you this is brilliant. If you don't like it - I'd almost give you your money back. (The *almost* is for logistical reasons, contact the publisher instead. :)<br /><br />By page 30, I'm ashamed I bought 4HWW and would rank this above The E-Myth in terms of handing out to business owners and helping them come up to speed on useful ideas.<br /><br />Well done, Chris. Well done.
044654759X|3.0|As with any Nicholas Sparks book, I looked forward to a good, easy read though obviously not a literary masterpiece. Safe Haven is no different. In this book Mr. Sparks depicts the struggles of life that Ms. Katie endures. She is the mysterious new resident of a town in none other than North Carolina, imagine my surprise! Anyway, Ms. Katie meets Alex, a kind store owner with two beautiful children. They tragically lost their wife/mother a few years back. Ms. Katie is attempting to move on from a disastrous, abusive relationship. The last thing she wants is to form a new romantic connection. However, Alex has a certain allure that she can't seem to shake off. Of course, the two embark on a sweet, endearing relationship. However, as good a man as Alex is, Katie can't help but feel frightened and distrustful towards him at times. She's too scarred and traumatized because of the horrible way that she was treated by Kevin, her ex-husband. Ms. Katie escaped from Kevin's overbearing and unhealthy grasp and he is maniacally searching for her. I won't go into too many details, I think its rude when people reveal too much of a book in a review. This is a mostly-typical Sparks novel, exactly what I love after reading serious novels all year. By the fall, my mouth is practically watering for the new Sparks book and I'm first in line, waiting to buy it.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and I do hope that he continues to take these types of risks with his future novels, they work. My only complaint is that from Kevin's point of view, reading can become tedious and redundant. I do believe that at one point I even became dizzy.  He constantly went in circles in his head, its clear that this man has serious mental issues and needs immediate help, but I think Mr. Sparks overdid it. I was forced to skim over those sections, as it became too difficult to get through. I became tempted to rip those pages out. They simply had too much angst for my liking.<br /><br />For the most part though, I enjoyed it and I am eagerly awaiting Mr. Sparks' next novel. I also look forward to any literary works that he develops similar to this one, minus the exaggerated hostility and psycho-like tendencies emanating from the villain.

0439023513|2.0|So after reading Catching Fire I wasn't really impressed but I like to finish what I start, so I picked this book up and decided to see if Suzanne Collins had anything else up her sleeve that I might like.  I was disappointed.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />So the book starts out and we are in the mysterious District 13 that was supposedly destroyed in that war that we heard about before and Katniss is there and is safe.  Right at the beginning she finds out that the Capitol bombed District 12 and most of the people there died, and Katniss blames District 13 for this.  Ummm, why???  They didn't bomb District 12, the Capitol did.<br /><br />We also find out that the leader of District 13, President Coin, runs the place with an Iron Fist and she's just as big a dictator as Snow is.  I'm serious, she and Snow might as well dance around yelling out, I'M EVIL, I'M EVIL!!!  I'M GOING TO BETRAY YOU IN THE END!!!  Sometimes subtlety is a good thing, but I guess Suzanne Collins doesn't think that's important.<br /><br />Also, on what planet would ANYONE allow a 14 yr old girl to work in a hospital?  I'm referring to Prim, the sister of Katniss.  When they arrive in District 13 it is discovered that she has a talent for healing like her mother does.  So they put her to work in their hospital.  WHY!?!  You're telling me that a 14 yr old who learned from watching her mother who in turn was a healer that used herbal medicine, is fully trained and knows enough to work in a hospital?  That's like saying that I've watched a few street fights therefore I am fully qualified to be a boxing coach.  Or that I watched every episode of Hells Kitchen so now I'm qualified to work at a 5 star restaurant.<br /><br />On top of that, Gale who is like 17 or 18, and Katniss who is 17 are being trained to become deadly commandos to help infiltrate the capitol and try to kill Snow.  Why?  You don't have any other soldiers in your city and you're so desperate that you're recruiting kids whose previous combat training is using bows and arrows against deer for a top secret high profile assassination?  Also the others that go with the two of them are so bland and flat that they are literally named \\"Legg 1\\" and \\"Legg 2\\"  Really?  You couldn't come up with names for your characters so you just gave them a last name and gave them numbers?<br /><br />Plus, why the hell did they parachute Peeta in?  We've already been told that the character has been brainwashed and wants to kill Katniss because he's been made to think she is evil and is the source of all his problems.  So why the hell would you send him to her when she's in the middle of an assassination attempt?  On what planet does that make sense!?!<br /><br />So the war ends, the Capitol is defeated and the rebels decide they'll execute Snow publicly and hold one last Hunger Games but the pool of tributes will be drawn from the children of the leaders of the Capitol so they can finally get a taste of their own medicine, but they decide not to at the last minute.  Why?  These people have kidnapped, starved, maimed, crippled and MURDERED your children for the last 75 years and you're just going to let them off with a slap on the wrist?  Ummm... okay how about the next time we catch a serial killer in the real world, let's just give him a stern talking to and hope he never does it again.  Yeah, that'll really get the message across!<br /><br />Katniss really doesn't contribute anything to this story at all.  I mean it, you could take her out of this story and you wouldn't lose anything from the story.  The only thing she really does in this book is kill President Coin so she can't rise to power and be another Snow.  Then Gale leaves and gets a job in district 2 and Katniss goes home and marries Peeta.  Why?  She doesn't love him, we've established that over and over again.  Peeta does love Katniss, of that there is no doubt, but to marry a guy just cuz he's really nice and you owe him, that doesn't make sense!  You can't build a marriage because someone is nice and you owe him one.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />I really don't know what happened with this series.  I started reading these books cuz the movie was awesome.  The book of the Hunger Games was great!  Catching Fire was just okay, and Mocking Jay was just a bore.  This didn't need to be a trilogy, it could have just been one book and been left at that.  The series started out with a bang, but ended with a whimper.<br /><br />If I could tell a new reader of the series anything, I would say, read the first book and forget the sequels.we him, that doesn't make sense!

B002RI9PKO|4.0|Very, very interesting, definately a good read for two reasons: it is thought-provoking when it comes to our idea of how success is achieved and it is very well written! In the ending, when the author chooses to use his own family history to illustrate the point he makes throughout the book, there are some shocking passages on racism, it really makes us realize how far we've come and how much is still to be accomplished. The chapter on aviation and the way culture influences how we act is pretty engaging. I had a really good time reading the book!
B005R32L66|3.0|We use Skype as our phone on the computer and I hoped this would let me basically use my smartphone instead when I'm around WiFi.  Well... no such luck.<br /><br />It's great for calling or Skype to Skype calls.  They're even getting to where they support video calls on smartphones.  Quality is great and you'd never know it was an internet call instead of a phone call.<br /><br />The downside is it doesn't receive calls.  The first problem is most smartphones shut off their Wifi when not used for a few minutes, but even if you are using your phone at the time, Skype only seems to catch one in three calls I get on my smartphone, while my computer has no problem.  Sometimes it will ring, but will take about 20 seconds to start, and you only have 30 seconds to answer before the voice-mail picks up.
0345803485|1.0|Not only is the writing awful, so is the subject matter.  Should we be entertained by men that disrespect women?  I hear women say this book is hot.  That is disappointing considering I often hear women complain about the way their men treat them.  We're turned on by men that treat us badly. Sad.  Those of you out there who don't have to imagine having great sex, and are actually in a good relationship, will hate this book.  I wish I would have researched the book when someone suggested I read it.<br /><br />Don't buy this book!

0307951529|5.0|I have been finding very challenging to read business books in the past... and I have rarely came to the end of most of them. Chris book is different: it hooked my attention since the first page, because it's full of value, inspiration and great ideas! And it's made of real people stories. People just like you and me. It shows that passion is the engine that makes everything move and mostly, it shows how everyone in this World can make a difference (and also profit) by pursuing a dream. I have bought some copies of the book for friends that are struggling to find their way... and I know for sure that they'll get so much value out of it.  In this moment in history full of uncertainty and negativity, Chris gives an important lesson: no matter what your economic situation is, you can still do big things for yourself and others. Kudos to the awesome Chris Guillebeau! :)
1582406723|5.0|Spectacular graphic novel. Black and white, the way a horror GN should be. Amazing character development, and no character is too big to be killed off less Rick Grimes of course. What to do when the zombie apocolypse actually happens and you have been in a coma in the hospital? Find ya kids, find ya wife, find ya hus...wait, find your gun and kill every last undead geek you come across. The story is captivating and you CAN'T stop turning the pages. Unless you can get a hold of the originals(good luck moneybags), or want to just get the compendium, this series is an absolute must! MUST! MUST!!! Also, avoid the reviews about people giving 1 star for lack of kindle, or poor packaging. This is a review of the product, not packaging.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This is one of the greatest horror shows that I have seen in a long time, and truly befitting of its title. It truly amazes me when people call it brutal and violent like the title leads them to believe otherwise. If you are not a horror fan then this is not the show for you If you prefer watered down pretend horror then maybe you should watch Twilight instead. It is fantastic and creepy and will make you think twice about moving into a home with a past.<br /><br /> The acting and writing is top notch and I would highly recommend this season to all horror fans, you won't be disappointed!
B004I744AS|4.0|Nice mobile app for my android phone.  Convenient word look up and you don't have to shrink and expand the screen, as is the problem with lots of mobile down loads.  I like it.
B006Z7Z3R2|1.0|The first 20 minutes or so the dialogue and acting led me think that a creative, well written and produced haunted movie was in the works. Wrong! They either quickly ran out of writing inspiration or money or both. It quickly fell into a cheap formulaic abyss. The rest of the movie moves like redundant molasses.<br />Proof?<br />(1.) Well, lots of newspaper clippings is a cheap storyteller and in this case it was newspaper clippings on a web page - shown over and over.<br />(2.) Usual cheap prop of an army surplus recorder with analogue vu display to indicate some unknown sound. Duh, digital has been around for decades and, anyway, they have a limited frequency and amplitude range, so what's the point.<br />(3.) Usual, couple of guests that add nothing to the story and you're left wondering why they were even in the story. Well, one guy decides to slit his wrists, in a bathtub, of course.<br />(4.) Usual, mysterious sounds - well, they are in an old hotel!<br />(5.) The usual mysterious self-closing door. Actually, a prop person standing behind and pushing it. Scary!<br />(6.) Lack of details such as why the two inn employees are there; why they are closing such a expensively appointed and well maintained inn. Their dialogue dominates the rest of the movie and although it started out interesting it simply got tiresome after 90 minutes.<br />(7.) Usual chain locked cellar door.<br />Spoiler follows:<br />(8.) Usual girl starts imaging ghosts and locks herself in the basement to subsequently die of fright complications thinking a ghost is chasing her but it's her co-worker banging on the door.

B004LWZW8S|1.0|Probably a good movie but the entire movie was filmed in darkness. Someone forgot to turn on the lights!! The film had about 3 minutes of acceptable light. I watched it in double fast forward.

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is the first time I spent over $1.00 for a game and it is money well spent.  I love it!!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|This is what I call an action thriller!<br />It's been a while since a great pure actioner or spy film has been released, the last ones being Casino Royale, Mi3 and Bourne 3(superhero movies/crime films notwithstanding).  The next 15 contain what every Mission Impossible movie always has: the infiltration. The scene is even better than the Vatican sequence in Mi3. After that, you get some action, and the plot thickens, and meet the fourth member of the leading team. Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, and Paula Patton come in the beginning. Then comes Jeremy Renner. After the first 45 minutes, the movie becomes all about their team. They are all fantastic. Renner is great, and has some cool action scenes. Pegg occasionally steals the show. Patton is solid and looks hot. Cruise does very well, and his stunts are incredible. The Burjh Kalifa sequence is just applause worthy. You guys can hate on him all you want behind your computers, but will you ever have the guts to do something crazy like Cruise? He's a solid actor as well. However, kudos to director Brad Bird. From the opening, to the bombing of the Kremlin, avoiding bullets in a lake, every scene in Dubai, and the epic conclusion, the direction is consistent. The action keeps getting better(excluding the climb, that is meant to be the best part). The fights and chases are just so fantastic. The scene in Mumbai in the automated car garage(I guess?) is just so creative. This movie is filled with non stop thrills. The only flaw is that the story isn't a story, just a plot device. But with incredible action, great teamwork and solid acting, this is the movie to buy on Bluray!<br />9.7/10<br />P.S.- the 1 star reviews and much of the two star reviews are BS. They hate on Tom Cruise and disguise the hate by trashing the film. Yes, this is a straightforward action film. But how is this crap like Michael Bay films? The film doesn't go from action to action by skipping over plot progression and character detail. The action is boring? Seriously, I'm tired of watching quick-cut fights and shoot-outs. Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is a true spy action film, well above other mindless trash.
0307951529|5.0|An inspiring and thought-provoking book not just for start-up businesses,<br />but also for established businesses interested in reinventing and retooling<br />themselves for the future. If, when you think of business, you think<br />about venture capital and IPOs, then there are already plenty of books<br />out there for you. But if instead you dream of doing what you love and<br />getting paid for it, The $100 Startup is a must-read. Not a road map<br />to guaranteed financial success, but rather a how-to guide for your own<br />off-trail adventure into the world of self-employment.<br /><br />Guillebeau articulates things about business (yes, even my own business)<br />I've thought about and I suppose have known for years, but just didn't<br />have the words to say. He is a shrewd observer, particularly of the<br />relationship between a business and its customers or clients. His<br />observation that old-school definitions of \\"demographics\\" and<br />\\"target markets\\" may no longer apply are spot-on, as is<br />his advice on eschewing the all-sacred business plan in favor of a<br />direct-action approach. His discussions on product launching,<br />self-promotion (\\"hustling\\"), \\"contest\\" vs \\"giveaway\\", \\"benefits\\" vs<br />\\"features,\\" \\"value\\" vs \\"cost\\" are far-reaching yet concise.<br /><br />On avocation morphing into vocation, Guillebeau asks the very<br />important question \\"will it ruin your hobby if you turn it into a<br />business?\\" His nuancing of that question helped a lot: perhaps a<br />certain aspect of one's hobby (or something tangential to it) might<br />more than pay the bills and not spoil the fun.<br /><br />The businesses portrayed in this book seem very humane and their owners<br />down-to-earth - all had some important lesson to share, and they were<br />rollicking good stories, too! Sure, I wanted to read The $100 Startup to<br />see my own company immortalized in print, but I came away truly<br />inspired, refreshed and ready for the next chapter in my business.in my business.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  Definately a must read, but not for those under 18! I'm in love with Grey and my husband is jealous...
0439023491|5.0|Loved the book, was a quick read and couldn't put it down. Would recommend it for all ages and those that like to hunt.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|This cd is very good. Definitly buy if you love the music of jason mraz. Great songs with a live flare to it. No im not gay, just love this music.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I never heard of the Hunger games until the movie came out this summer so I guess I am a bit behind..<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews on here and having just finished the book just now I can understand how some people feel a bit uneasy about the ending. It is certainly not your usual sugar coated happy ending. But to me, somewhere around the middle of the 2nd book it became obvious that this is not your usual happy ending love story. I cannot tell if this book is a realistic description on how a veteran fells. But I would think that being exposed to war at such a young age as our main character would certainly have a effect on you. To expect that everybody would go on as nothing has happened is a bit of a illusion I would say.<br /><br />I thought it was a good read, although a bit rushed at the end - but then again, I am not sure if another 30 pages would have really made me feel better. I think the point is that you are not really suppose to feel that great when putting down the book.<br /><br />And also, a lot of people read reviews before buying a book... so it would be nice if you other people who review the book would not spell out the whole plot
B00785P2QC|5.0|sweet little city building / management game.  make lots of $ when your not even playing!  the key seems to be upgrading the trucks &amp; keeping them running. lvl 13 on day 1!
B006ZZC3D6|4.0|It is a fun game, that becomes a little more difficult in the later levels. Not my favorite, but something that is fun to play when I am board.
B000BKHL1K|5.0|What a fab wine rack! It is exactly as described and installation was a piece of cake. Very nice! This was purchased for a client's wine bar. Now I want one for our home...may need to order a 2nd one...
B007BDK3SS|1.0|Maybe I do not know how to work my phone, but I really could get the hang of this game. I tried it a couple of times, but deleted. I think if you don't mind taking the time to figure out the controls, it could be fun, but would get boring.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Hey all you people not giving it a good rating : YOUR CRAZY OR YOUR KINDLES MESSED UP!!!!! I love love love this game! its so spooky but there's a twist. not telling you, but it'll leave you speechless by the end. I stayed up all night playing it! so don't be dumb and buy it!  the waitings worth it!!
B007CKNX28|5.0|It took a few listens to develop an ear for some of the new incorporations to his ever-evolving sound, but a solid 9+. I'm inclined to agree w/ so many others, don't know if he could walk on water, but seems he can do no wrong. Rock on Jack!!!
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|I love Game of Thrones, and I was really excited to purchase it, but I was sad when the first disk didn't read on my computer. I had to figure out some other way to watch the first two episodes. The rest worked fine, but I wish the manufacturers had checked before distributing the DVDs.
0439023521|5.0|Joshua Stewart<br />Period #1<br />AP Language and Composition<br />April 29, 2012<br /><br />The Hunger Games<br />By: Suzanne Collins<br />Great book to read and good story to follow when reading, April 29, 2012<br />Most of the books I have read had to do with fantasy, historical fiction, and non-fiction that provided a great story to develop. When I first heard about this book and movie, I actually was actually convinced when I saw it and I wanted to read it. Suzanne Collins put some great effort into this book and it actually gives great detail of the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, and what is happening around her in the story. Collins uses mostly 1st person so that she can get the reader to think that Katniss is telling the story to them. What mainly happens in this story is that there is a tradition (Hunger Games) that occurs every year to gather 2 children (male and female age 12-18) from every 13 districts to fight to the death for victory and honor for their district filled with poverty. This story provides a great plot of the action, suspense, and the climax, but this book does lack some tone in it. I think this is a good book to read and that it would be great to continue reading the series for the suspense and for what is going to happen to the protagonist and the hunger games. The audience intended for this book would be mostly young readers who are into fiction, suspense, and has a good plot to it. I would consider that people should read this for a good story, but for a lack of tone quality.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I LOVE this show.  It's the story about 2 brothers Sam and Dean on a road trip across America hunting paranormal.  They are searching for answers re: the death of their mother 22 years prior and the death of Sam's girlfriend Jessica and they're searching for the whereabouts of their missing father.  Each episode they encounter a different urban legend or creepy scenario in a different town.  Its a mystery suspense drama and in my opinion this is SUPER.  I look forward to buying all seasons and would rate this tv 14 for the gore and scare factor.  There are 6 discs and running time is 936 minutes.  5 stars on this show !  Wow is this fun !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book disappointed many reviewers, but no other realistic ending would have been better.  Maybe some people thought that the heroine could undergo two bloody games and a war without deforming her mind, but that is laughable.  The two choices that Katniss makes toward the book's end 1) assure that the rebels' goals of democracy will not be thrown away, and 2) allow Katniss to recover herself, as much as anybody in her shoes could, and 3) show how she escaped from remaining a pawn.<br /><br />However, people who gave this book poor reviews are correct about the quality of writing.  It is atrocious.  Sentence fragments are fine for dialogue and internal thoughts, but they do not belong in the narrative.  Also, it is difficult at times to separate the narrative from Katniss' thoughts.  Ms Collins is a great storyteller, and the force of her story made these books into best sellers, despite the poor grammar.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I really thought this was going to be a stupid movie. Bored the other night, I decided to watch it whilst working on jewelry. I ended up setting my project aside because I really started to enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Surprise for me was the chemistry between Timberlake & Kunis. More so, I was impressed with Justin Timberlake's acting. He was actually pretty good. Sweet, sympathetic and caring towards Kunis's character. Kunis plays a Headhunter who gets Timberlake's character an Art Director job at GQ. Friends becoming friends with benefits and the positives & the negatives it creates. Entertaining.<br /><br />Quite a few laugh out loud moments. Cute film and I highly recommend it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game is soo fun! the only thing is that once you finish a level it takes a while to realize it. this game along with all angry birds games are perfect for both kids and adults. waaay cool game!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is really great for the whole family. My son loves playing the scrat game. I would love to see more of theses games available. Also I would like more aways to gain acorns.<br />I have had a few tech problems...mainly with connecting to friends..but I am sure it will get resolved<br /><br />Love the game
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A friend and I challenged each other to read a book that was chosen by the other person. This is what she chose for me. All I can say is wow! How on earth has this author flown under the radar for this long? How have I not known about this series? I read the entire thing in one weekend and am very much looking forward to reading more of his books.<br /><br />The premise is fresh and the characters are well articulated. A very enjoyable read that I would highly recommend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it has lots of fun games to play and challanges you to get more points so you can get more fun games!!(:
B0055SWM08|4.0|I had low expectations of this game but came out impressed of how peaceful/relaxing, yet fun this game is. I play it at least once a day.
0985114606|5.0|I just finished this book. I bought it yesterday and I had a really hard time putting it down. I read it until my eyes crossed. Which of course I had to go back and read again because I didn't want to miss anything. Like the other reviewers mentioned this couple is really messed up. They have such a large amoumt of baggage that they need knee boots to get through it all. With that said dont you think that is has to take a really dedicated couple to get through all of that together? While I was reading this book there were times that it just grabed my by the throat and would not let go. This is a very emotional read, it was also a very hot read. The sex that they had keep them grounded. It was where there was no holding back and they made love/not sex with everthing they felt for eachother. You will find out about Eva skeletons but you are left hanging about Gideons issues. If felt so bad for Gideon, he is so broken, but he wants to be a better and stronger person. Gideon only feels this with way with Eva. I hoping that in the next book that he works on being stronger for himself as much for Eva's sake.<br /><br />Read this book...It really was a wonderful read. Try to ignore the typos...If you are in the mood for a really deep and moving book this is the one for you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is wonderful and it is also really entertaining.  I strongly recomemd downloading it (it is a great app for all ages, too)
B000V86OKG|5.0|I have been quite satisfied with the product and the price. In fact, this is only one of several orders for video & power cable for our security cameras. Flexible and durable to date, the wiring has solidly met my needs. It reflects excellent quality for the price and I will undoubtedly buy more as the need arises.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Warning... I have uninstalled this virus daily. DO NOT install on any device! Dangerous program, phishing or data mining or worse.
B0019NG73G|3.0|Although better than the \\"epic\\" \\"Gods and Generals\\", \\"Gettysburg\\" was lacking in historical verity. As merely a drama, it was entertaining enough--Jeff Daniels was superb as Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain; however, Martin Sheen as Gen. R.E. Lee was stiff and did not have the dramatic presence to carry off such an important roll. I also liked Sam Elliot as Union Cavalry General John Buford.<br /><br />In short, Shaara's book, \\"The Killer Angels\\" is much more entertaining and more worth your time than this movie.
B007UPDE9W|2.0|Five stars for content, 2 for formatting.  At the very beginning of the book,after Abhorsen has brought the baby back from the dead, he's asked what her name will be.  In my edition (this edition) the text says:<br />\\"Sabriel With Bonus Material.\\"<br /><br />Hello?
B007HO392S|5.0|I love this album! I really feel Carrie maturing with this album, some of my favorite songs ever by Carrie.<br /><br />My top 5 songs on the album( in order) are:<br /><br />1) Blown Away: I LOVE this song and will be a major hit for Carrie, I can't wait to see the music video for this song it will be epic! Very cool pop/country song with a powerful message and tone.<br />2) Two Black Cadillac: Amazing story and has a Adel like feel to the song. Just amazing enough said.<br />3) Good in Goodbye: This song really hits home for a lot of people and Carrie's vocals are stunning on this song<br />4) Cupid's Got a Shotgun: I like this song much better then Good Girl and I would have loved for this song to be the lead single off the album. I can't help but sing along and roll my head around to this rocki'n song!<br />5) Wine After Whisky: Such a beautiful ballad that once again most people could relate to. I believe Carrie will make this a single and this will be a number one for her once again.<br /><br />If I had room I would have added Who Are You and See You Again, but the top 5 songs are stronger.<br />Great Job Carrie, you have proven that you are the Queen of Country Music once again!
B005CMSDLE|4.0|Even though much of the plot could've been deduced merely from watching the very publicized trailer for the film and the plotline at times requires one to utter lose their disbelief, rather than merely suspending it, I actually was entertained by Hanna, in spite of the obvious flaws that other reviewers have pointed out. Movies fall into two camps that I will define as popcorn-entertainment verses artistic storytelling that tugs at your heartstrings. Hanna falls into the first category without a doubt. It was very aesthetically beautiful, I want their cinematographer if I ever do a film. I felt the music fit the action sequences well, even if the action itself was suspect.<br /><br />Hanna is an interesting take of the coming of age story mixed with elements of Huxley's Brave New World-the notion of creating perfect soldiers like Hanna drawing parallels with the creation of these pleasure seeking drug addicted ones found in Brave New World. The problem is that I'm not sure we haven't seen this movie somewhere before, and as Ezra Pound once said \\"Make it New.\\" To question further, the alternative ending might have been a better fit, than the uh, okay, what now ending we got. For my entertainment, I'll go four stars.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This show was a favorite for my son when he was growing up! He is now 22 and requested ir to be purchased for our dvd collection for his birthday. Good for all ages.
B00701897I|5.0|Good to see they are starting to include iTunes digital versions again. The only thing that made the cost of BluRays worth it was the HD disc coupled with an iTunes digital copy. I have no need for that UltraViolet crap.<br /><br />Great movie by the way. A lot of fun.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I missed this mini searies when it was out. It was full of history in a great story so of way. The actors did a great job. I purchased it used for less than it would of cost me to rent all three disks. Plus no one had it in the area to rent also.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book in this series in two days, I bought this book and couldn't put it down.  It is definitely a page turner and will keep you awake into the wee hours of the night/early morning.  Would I suggest this book.  DEFINITELY!!!!!  Yes it is just as erotic as book one but putting that aside the story in itself is amazing.  Buy this book, you won't regret it.  Christian and Ana will become a part of your household.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this application not only because it is the Bible it is because. I can get in a quite place and just let the word if GOD flow in my spirit

B004I744AS|5.0|better than what I thought I was getting. lots of information. I say enough good things about. very easy to use
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I picked up the BK2 after doing a lot of research for a good, simple survival knife. Price wasn't a huge consideration. I was looking at Cold Steel and ESEE knives as well. After watching many videos onYyouTube and reading many reviews in the 'net, especially over at Blade Forums, I decided to go with the BK2. Price was good, and I saw that I could customize it if I felt the need. Well, I LOVE this knife. The sheath is okay, but the floppy nylon back sucks. It can be removed fairly easily and replaced with another type of attachment. I haven't done this yet, but I probably will. Many aftermarket custom sheath options available too.<br /><br />After just a few days with this knife I went ahead and also ordered the BK9 and the BK16 to round out the collection. I probably will get more along the line too. For the money, these are just great knives. It has that solid, substantial feel of an expensive knife, but it's simplistic, utilitarian design similar to a Glock pistol. There is nothing on the knife that doesn't serve a purpose. The grips are fine. I stippled mine with a soldering iron and then sanded them down. Great purchase on the knife. I also stripped the black coating from the BK2 and etched the blade with cold blue and bleach, then patina'd the whole thing, giving it an aged antique look. Very cool. Check out Blade Forums for some great customization ideas.
0393088774|5.0|There are many lies and myths told about this depression, and Krugman answers them with clarity and force.  For example, when inequality protesters picketed the Chicago Board of Trade last year, they were showered with McDonald's job application forms.  Those mocking them didn't seem aware that a million people applied for 50,000 jobs at McDonald's in April that year.  It's just not true that everyone who is eager to work can find a job.  The immediate economic waste in having so many people unemployed and underemployed amounts to at least a trillion dollars a year in the US, as millions sit at home producing nothing and vainly trying to find a job.  Gradually the long term unemployed become permanently unemployable, at enormous long-term cost to society.<br /><br />Wise heads scratch their chins and say that the problems are structural.  We need to retrain workers and so nothing can be done in the short term.  But this is nonsense, as anyone who looks at the actual statistics of what kinds of jobs have been lost can see.  Structural problems are not suddenly much worse than they were just before the financial crisis.  It always looks wise to point to deep problems and long term solutions, but this is just an excuse for inaction.  So many people are unemployed because their work is not needed at the moment, since everyone is spending less.  The only deep structural problems are in the workings of our politics that prevent action.<br /><br />Adjusted for inflation, the cost to the US government of borrowing money is currently zero.  Yet we have eliminated 700,000 state and local government employees in the past three years and canceled infrastructure projects because we are suddenly worrying now now now about possible future dangers of deficit spending, instead of the much larger real and present damage to the economy caused by continued high unemployment.  If not for state and local government austerity measures, we'd already be well on our way out of this mess.<br/><br />A depression is an unusual time.  There is so little demand that many companies would rather park their money safely at zero real interest than invest in new projects and capacity.  This results in an enormous unemployed workforce.  But this also means that the US federal government can borrow money right now for free to put people who are currently producing nothing back to work, teaching our kids and building our infrastructure.  It just has to give aid to the states to reverse their austerity.  Read the book to understand how backwards our response to this crisis has been, and then add your voice to the call to end this depression now!

B000XR4OC0|5.0|I had a problem with my order.  My 15yr old daughter had found very unique shoes for her mother for Mother's day.  She asked me to order them which I did.  Yesterday I received an email which stated that the shoes would not arrive until Monday (the day after Mothers Day).  I had ordered the shoes on May 3rd and they were the Mother's Day Navy Vegan Classics, an online exclusive specific to Mothers Day.  I thought that my order was placed with plenty of lead time to get them here.  So I was quite disappointed that they would not be here by Mother's day.<br /><br />Although it takes some time to work through customer service (probably because of Toms popularity and growing pains) I ended up with a great customer experience.  I contacted Toms via email and chat and told them of my situation.  They worked with me to get me the shoes here by Mothers Day.  Now I don't have to explain to my daughter why dad didn't get the shoes here on time.  Thanks to Celia and Blake at Toms for great customer service and saving dad on Mother's day.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is the kind of book one cannot put down and then is sad when it is finished.  Weaves in the conflict between a father's love and his job in the D.A.s office.  Keeps one in suspense!
B004EPYZQM|5.0|Great movie with lots of action. The latest in the Fast and Furious series. Loved fight scenes with the \\"Rock\\" and Vin Diesel. Great driving scenes.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|This little DAC / amp is well built, looks good, and has some nice features. But depending on your equipment, it may or may not improve your sound quality. Using my MacBook Pro and two styles of high-end headphones I could not tell any difference in sound, even after several hours of careful comparisons. Using my very-sensitive Shure SE535 in-ear monitors, there was a slight decrease in background hiss, but it was only apparent during complete silence.<br /><br />Evaluation equipment:<br />- MacBook Pro hooked up via USB (or straight from headphone jack for comparison)<br />- iPhone via headphone jack (for comparison)<br />- Apple Lossless and 256kbps AAC files<br />- Denon AH-D5000 over-the-ear headphones<br />- Shure SE535 in-ear monitors<br /><br />There are really only a couple specific situations where you may benefit from a device like this DAC / amp:<br /><br />- You have a low-quality music player right now. (Apple's products actually have very good DACs and amps, and I couldn't notice any difference comparing this E17 to my MacBook Pro or my iPhone.)<br />- You have very high-impedence headphones that are difficult to drive for mass-market devices. My Denons don't have this characteristic, so maybe that's why I'm not hearing any difference.<br />- You have extremely sensitive In-Ear Monitors that can pick up even a very low amount of background noise during silent passages. My Shure 535s pick up some slight hiss from my MacBook Pro during silence. There is still a hiss on this amp, but it's reduced somewhat.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Nice black metal finish. Build quality seems solid.<br />- Bright screen with controls for bass/treble, gain, sleep timer, etc. Most headphone amps in this price range have few options and no screen.<br />- Bass and treble adjustments are actually pretty good. Way better than the iTunes equalizer, for example.<br />- For high-impedence headphones or unusually bad sound cards you may hear a sound quality increase (I didn't).<br />- Slight reduction in background hiss (\\"noise floor\\") for very sensitive in-ear monitors.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Screen stays on until you shut the device off, unless you put it in \\"hold\\" mode and then none of the buttons work. I wish the screen would just go to sleep after a minute or two.<br />- If you dock it with an E9 amp, you have to turn both devices on and off independently, which is a hassle. Also, the relationship between the volume controls on the E9 and E17 is unclear -- both still work. If the E9 is supposed to be bypassing the amp in the E17, why are both volume controls available?<br /><br />Overall, an external DAC/amp is another device that sits on your desk and it has to prove it's worth. This didn't do it for me and I'm sending it back. It seems a little unfair to knock a product based on my needs and not just it's performance, but there ya go. There are a lot of reviews and comments that claim that a headphone amp & DAC is required to get the most out of your music. That may be true in some situations, but as a general rule it's just not true.<br /><br />If you do decide to buy this (or any other DAC/headphone amp), do yourself the favor of honestly evaluating whether it has improved your music experience. There is a lot of \\"expectation bias\\" around high-end audio components that leads people to believe there should be a difference even when there's not.<br /><br />EDIT 7/15/2012<br />Wow, this review has prompted a lot of comments, many of them critical. That's ok, audio equipment is pretty personal, so of course there are going to be strong opinions. All I can say is that I did several hours of careful comparisons, and I honestly could not hear a difference. Maybe it's because Apple gear is pretty good as far as consumer audio goes. Maybe the Denon and Shure headphones I own are easy to drive and therefore don't really benefit from an amp. Who knows. I'm just saying, it's worth evaluating for yourself whether this is a piece of equipment you want to spend money on.<br /><br />EDIT 1/8/2013<br />This review continues to get a lot of comments. I returned the E17 so I can't really update the review other than to reaffirm my opinion that any potential buyer should carefully evaluate whether this is a good product for them. Several people have pointed out that the headphones I happen to own don't benefit much from an amp. That's exactly my point: I'm not saying this is a bad product, although I did have a few minor quibbles. I'm just saying you may not need one, even with high-end headphones. Don't believe the hype that you *must* have an amp to get good performance.
B0031RSA24|5.0|Do you have doubts about religion? Do you call yourself an Agnostic and do not know what to believe? In this book Dawkins presents a sustained and logical case for rejecting all forms of religious and supernatural beliefs, professing atheism and setting one's own ethical standards. To this reviewer's mind, Dawkins does make a sustained attack on religion only as far as necessary to establish the case for atheism and establish boundaries for a society where athiests can have an equal place with everyone else and where government, law, health, education, etc. cannot be controlled by those who think they know the mind of an (imaginary to Dawkins) god. Most of the book is written in plain easily read English and is hard to put down. It should be remembered however that Dawkns is a professor of biology and uses relevent academic terms when discussing evolution versus creationism and use of a kindle with an automatic dictionary is recommended when reading this book.

B0074JODP8|5.0|After being pretty disappointed with Joe's recent CD with Beth Hart, I was elated to be knocked out by this DVD! Joe and his band and special guests are firing on all cylinders throughout! The only track I wasn't too excited about when I saw the listing is Mountain Time, as that tune has appeared on just about every one of his concert videos, if not all of them completely. It's a good song, but...it would have been nice to have some seemingly forgotten gems of his instead, like Pain and Sorrow from his So It's Like That CD...GREAT SONG! Hendrix would be proud! Why can't we have a treat like that on DVD, Joe??<br /><br />But...no huge deal...minor gripe. Joe's playing is phenomenal in this concert, and he sports not one, but TWO '59 Les Pauls!! Dang...most of us mortals could never find, let alone even coming close to affording, one! The greatest electric guitar in existence, hands down, and Joe shows us why on this video...THE TONE! Nothing so sweet have you ever heard! I don't know what he paid for those babies, but I'm sure he feels they were worth every penny! I'm envious, of course, but if one person in this world deserves to have two '59's, Joe is it!<br /><br />Beth Hart does a great job on her selections, and John Hiatt was fantastic...great voice, and a legendary songwriter! Paul Rodgers...out of this world! Singing just as well as he did over 40 years ago, and looking youthful and fit!<br /><br />If Heartaches Were Nickels was a real treat, as that is a great song, and I was disappointed that he didn't sing a complete version of it on his Live From Nowhere CD. He makes up for it here by churning out a scorching electric version of it on the bonus disc of extras!!<br /><br />I thought Joe's Royal Albert Hall video, while still very good, was not as great as his Rockpalast DVD, but this Beacon DVD is right up there with the Rockpalast disc, for me!  An indispensable addition to the collection of any Joe B. or blues rock fan!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I very rarely write reviews on books, movies, or music.  This is because everyone has different tastes, just because you like or dislike something does not mean I will agree.  I have read both this book and the 2nd, starting the 3rd tomorrow.  I have enjoyed what I have read so far because it is entertaining, shocking, and completely different from my everyday life.  Isn't that what books and movies are supposed to be? An chance to experience something new, something you may never ever try?  All I have to say is if you are thinking about reading this book make sure you go in with an open mind.  This is either a book you will love or hate.  In my opinion, anyone writing reviews (including critics)lacks empathy, an imagination, and the unwillingness to try anything new.  I hope this review helps you to decide, just make sure it is your decision.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Hyped as the greatest superhero film ever made, 2012's &#34;The Avengers&#34; is an entertaining superhero team flick. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), introduced in 2011's &#34;Thor,&#34; comes to earth intent on an otherworldly invasion and total conquest. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of the Federal agency S.H.I.E.L.D. gathers together &#34;earth's mightiest heroes&#34; to prevent the invasion – Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, The Black Widow, Hawkeye and, believe it or not, the Hulk.<br /><br />The film's hype and record-breaking success raises expectations that are letdown by a set-up that goes on & on and isn't overly absorbing, plus way too much time is spent on the SHIELD heli-carrier, which creates a somewhat one-dimensional vibe. Lastly, although Loki is an excellent villain, the otherworldly army known as the Chitauri are stereotypically ee-vil, faceless villains who are way too-easily slaughtered, excepting the colossal mechanical snake-creatures.<br /><br />Despite those few negatives, there are numerous highlights: Scarlett Johannson as Black Widow; straight-laced and Old-fashioned Captain America at odds with the overly-hip Tony Stark/Iron Man (Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. respectively); Chris Hemsworth as the noble Thor; Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury; a touching subplot concerning the Black Widow & Hawkeye (Jeremey Renner); and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner.<br /><br />Speaking of Bruce Banner, the Hulk easily steals the show. The best scenes and literal punch lines have to do with the Hulk. As much as I like both the '03 and '08 film versions of the green goliath, this is the definitive rendition.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: &#34;The Avengers&#34; is definitely an entertaining superhero team flick, but it has its shortcomings. A slow build-up, the one-dimensional setting and a weak army of foes work against the movie, but it's filled with a myriad highlights, including the Hulk and the witty dialog. The third act delivers the goods as a wholly kinetic and engaging superhero team flick.<br /><br />The film runs 142 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: A-runs 142 minutes.  GRADE: A-

B001C08RHA|4.0|I try not to get too wrapped up into movies based on comic books (er, graphic novels, excuse moi); I tend to find them too trite and superfluous.  But I'm a big Robert Downey Jr. fan, and Downey's astounding performance in IRON MAN is the stellar exception to my disdain for this action hero genre.  Downey brings a rich authenticity and ebullient eccentricity to every role he plays, and this is certainly the case here; his portrayal of billionaire weapons designer Tony Stark is humorous, compelling, and--yes, even in an over the top super hero flick--believable.  Even rocketing through the skies in his IRON MAN suit Downey's Stark is funny, vulnerable, and pragmatic--in other words, all too human.  While demonstrating a new weapon in the Afghanistan wilderness before assembled Army VIPs he nonchalantly sips his drink while behind him chaos reigns supreme, and it's grand fun to watch.<br /><br />Is the story silly and farfetched?  Yes.  Is it occasionally sophomoric and extreme?  Yes.  Does it require a titanic suspension of disbelief?  Of course, but who cares?  Following a nasty stint as a hostage to some snarling jihadists (and escaping via an iron suit of his own making), Stark disavows the weapons of mass carnage his company has made, and focuses entirely on the technology to replicate the iron suit utilizing state-of-the-art technology.  This places him at odds with longtime business partner Obadiah Stane (played magnificently by Jeff Bridges), who, incidentally, is working on a suit of his own.  And of course this leads at breakneck speed to the ultimate battle of the Iron Men, who create carnage and mayhem in overload volume in downtown LA--all while Stark's personal assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow is stunning) looks on in terror and dismay.  The special effects are terrific, the action sequences heartpounding, and the pacing fast and furious; IRON MAN may be based on comic books, but this is one super hero film worth relishing again and again.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.q.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|My son turned me on to this series - I knew it was on television but I hadn't seen any of the books.  Got the Kindle version so I could read it on my iPad, just like the first two books in the series, and already am having a hard time getting anything done other than reading it!  I did watch the first season on DVD, and really enjoyed it.  One of the few times I can say that the \\"movie\\" is as good as the book!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book has got to be one of the worst written books ever. But here's my real beef, the dabbling of the author into the \\"dominant' lifestyle field. As someone who lives this every day, all I can say to her pseudo dominant scenes is that they are incredibly childish. They obviously come from a mind that has no experience in the field, and it adds on more negativity to the already present lack of good writing, the repetitiveness, and the wishy washy character definition.
B007Z9RAX4|2.0|Knew nothing about this flick but wanted action. WELL, got action in the way of punch and kick and apparently action lady, woman, person, is real martial artist (did not know) and so action scenes are good BUT plot is a tangled mess. Great scenery and loved the soundtrack and editing as it crisp but gave up on trying to figure out who doing what to whom and why. Would really have liked a sort of Jamie (woman) Bond and woman in this could have carried that off. If you want to watch this, watch and play on the computer at same time and you will miss nothing,
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Not quite as much fun as I expected. And the screens with the game notes move too fast to read them. Maybe I'm missing someway to hold the screen until it's read. Any advice?
B004EPZ03O|5.0|The Muppet characters are classic. I love how there have always been people characters incorporated in their movies and their shows. This movie is great!
B000022TSH|5.0|I don't have to write a long and elaborate review, you'll find plenty of that here on Amazon. All I have to say is: this film is a real classic, one of the greatest film ever made, and I believe everybody should add this wonderful movie to their DVD collection.<br /><br />I have a huge interest for True Crime, Criminology, Unsolved murder cases and missing person cases. The unsolved cases from the 30's and 40's are my favorites; Thelma Todd, Georgette Bauerdorf, Elizabeth Short, Jeanne French, Jean Spangler, Mimi Boomhower, and others. This movie is so good, the acting is so believable that you have the feeling that you are watching a real investigation, that you are really following the work of the detective day by day, that you are part of the investigation. That's how good this movie is.<br /><br />If, like me, you like a good mystery and have a passion for anything related to True Crime or the 30's-40's then you need to add this movie to your collection. And for less than 10$ it's a really good deal. :)

B004QL7K70|4.0|Did you spend your entire high school career as someone with few friends who will more than likely be forgotten by the student body moments after graduating? What could you do to change that?<br /><br />  Thomas (played by Thomas Mann) is turning seventeen and his parents are leaving town. His parents (played by relative unknowns Peter Mackenzie and Caitlin Dullany) fully expect him to throw a party in their absence and simply ask that it be kept under control. Still his friends Costa (played by Oliver Cooper) and JB (played by Jonathan Daniel Brown) believe that they can bring into being an epic gathering that will elevate their friend and themselves to legendary status simply through social networking and word of mouth. Unsure of what to expect, they encounter a former classmate who recently graduated and invite him only to discover he's already planning to attend. And, every step of the way, Kirby (played by Kirby Bliss Blanton) is telling Thomas that Costa's party is a bad idea. Kirby is apparently Thomas's only female friend. Of course Blanton is quite attractive herself and while they've never been more than friends, Thomas entertains numerous fantasies regarding Alexis (another student played by Alexis Knapp) who has no idea he's alive.<br /><br />  The title is terribly unoriginal, but it was initially intended to be a placeholder until it started to generate interest. Whether that was in any way related to the 1968 science fiction film of the same name or the 1987 comedy-science fiction-thriller starring Matthew Broderick, I can't say. I will say that I and many others in the theater laughed out loud numerous times throughout the film. Some have called this film irresponsible and said it sets a bad example to high school students. Then again, a film that sets a good example would probably depict a party where no alcohol or drugs are consumed, no cigarettes are smoked, and everyone returned home and went to bed at a decent hour after, of course, helping to clean up. Would ANYBODY see that? I wouldn't. It's not revolutionary and there are no profound life lessons but it is unmistakably a good time.lean up. Would ANYBODY see that? I wouldn't.

0441013597|5.0|One of my favorite books ever. Probably the best science fiction novel you'll find.  Exciting.  Not difficult to read yet also very deep.  I've read this four or five times over the last decade and it is still great. Read this.
B006SV2LWA|2.0|Just rented this but haven't watched it yet; in anticipation of the impact to the brain this is no doubt going to cause....why am I doing this?  Well, the preview looked good.

By coincidence, I have Terminator I in my computer; was going to re-view this for the 10000,00000.00 time but then saw this movie on Amazon Instant-got (cough, cough) hooked, I think!  Anyway, will view this now but while holding my breath for a nightmare, daymare, whatever...Hope not!  (Haven't had the flu since 2003, and would like to keep it that way)!

B006RUJST6|5.0|Slammed is so incredible I'm not sure I can do it justice, but I'll give it a go. Hands down, Slammed has taken the top spot as my all-time favorite novel. The characters are some of the best developed I've ever read. I love the way the story is focused on everything that's going on and that the secondary characters are not just filler. It's written in a way that the characters all feel like my own friends and I am absolutely in love with them. This book had me laughing, crying, hoping, smiling, laughing and crying some more...several times simultaneously. Colleen Hoover has this amazing writing style that made me feel like I couldn't breathe until the end.<br /><br />This truly is a MUST read.<br /><br />FYI, Point of Retreat (Book 2) is just as awesome.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I started to read this book because of all the hype, but was immediately disappointed that it was about a 27 year old, CEO punk who takes S&M sexual advantage of a virgin college student. I returned it at about 25% in (Kindle)...if that. Women being turned on by Christian baffles me.<br /><br />Beyond that, the writing style was lazy with many repeated phrases. I'm not a Twilight fan, so I can't address those references, but the writing was rigid. I couldn't care less about any of the characters; in fact, quite the opposite.<br /><br />I was relieved to see so many other one star reviews.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|What amazes me about the latest epic 'Marvel' Comics movie is how many things go right.  With the ensemble of so many superheroes placed on one screen:  [Captain America, (Evans); Black Widow, (Johansson); Iron Man, (Downey, Jr.); The Incredible Hulk, (Ruffalo); Thor, (Hemsworth); and Hawkeye (Renner)]; the results easily could have been a cluttered mess.  Instead, nearly all the necessary elements are properly placed.  First of all, the menace of Thor's brother, Loki (Hiddleston), and his army of gothic extraterrestrials provides enough peril to keep all the mighty guardians on the ropes for substantial stretches of the film.  The second element is keeping the mood intact.  'The Avengers' gets campy in plenty of places, yet stays serious enough to sustain its suspense.  How a movie juggles these two mood swings can easily make or break it.  ('Star Wars' is the supreme example of stellar success; while 'Armageddon' remains a prime contender as one of the worst juggling acts.) Between the nimble work of Screenwriter/Director, Joss Whedon, (with screenwriter, Zak Penn) and editors (Ford and Lassek), the film seldom loses a step or its nerve.  Added to that Samuel L. Jackson, as helmsman Nick Fury, the story stabilizes and prevents the exposition from becoming cloudy or long-winded.<br /><br />One of the ingenious elements found in the fray is the chemistry of characters and the interplay of their indomitable egos.  Front in center for both the banter and suspense is top ego, 'Iron Man' (Oddly, one of the few icons who relies on human invention rather than on superhuman strength.) played by Downey, who by his talent and the usual snappy script, propels the entertainment to its best heights.  However, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" (played by an unusually fragile Ruffalo) goes closest to the precipice of danger, providing an unstable danger to the core team.  In an unusual twist, these superheroes are at such odds with each other, the threat of their enemies remains elusive until they can get their act together.<br /><br />The plot is perhaps the lesser player next to the clashing arcade.  Loki who is the incorrigible demi god (and brother Thor's alter ego) has an insatiable desire to subjugate everyone on planet earth.  Using the forbidden, frozen substance used in the film 'Thor,' Loki and his henchmen seek to change and control mankind with this power and convert mankind by servile fear.<br /><br />While 'The Avengers' is nearly pitch perfect entertainment, not all of the conflicts and dialogue succeeds.  While I loved and admired all the wonderful, escapist elements the movie offers, it lacked some of the overall quality found in recent 'Marvel' offerings.  It doesn't match the perfection of the first 'Iron Man,' the poignancy of 'Thor,' nor the cohesiveness of 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. A comparison with comic book classics such as 'The Dark Knight,' 'Spiderman 2,' or the splendor of the first two 'Superman' movies, and this film surely falls short. (Although I certainly admired how they wove all the recent 'Marvel' movies so seamlessly together--another tell-tale sign that this movie could have easily been a disaster!)<br /><br />But where `The Avengers' succeeds, it does so in spades.  As perfect popcorn entertainment, 'The Avengers' gets it right--good enough to spend your extra dollars for 3D or I-Max, and enough for people with home entertainment centers to be extra grateful during Thanksgiving or another part of the holiday season when this film will undoubtedly come out on DVD.

The keys are very responsive although I can't say the same about the beat pad.

1451648537|5.0|The biography of Steve Jobs is one of the most captivating book I have ever read. The book begins with a background/history of Steve jobs which include his childhood, family etc. I can deduce from the book that Steve jobs at a young age search his identity/role in this world. He is a complicated character and engrossing. The author does a great job to cover every aspect of the man. After reading this book, you will come to believe that geniuses are not born but they are made and that success comes through determination, passion and persistence. Even with the abundant flaws Steve had, he was still able to change history. That means anybody can become successful. I strongly believe that everyone from college graduates to business people MUST read this book. Steve jobs said that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Probably, it was this philosophy that made him put a dent in the universe before his death. I strongly encourage everyone to read this book!
0345803485|4.0|I have to say, I started reading the first book three days ago and I almost finished with the third. I heard of the book through a friend who is in love with it. I have to admit, that while I am not crazy about all the sex going on, the book itself is an easy read, it keeps me interested. It moves at a good pace and the main characters evolve as the books continue. Who wouldn't want to marry a 27 year old millionaire? It's a fantasy...so I don't get all the negative reviews...if you take out all the sex scenes, it's every girls dream, falling in love with an awesome guy who only has eyes for her. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good love story with a little bit of kinky.

0545265355|5.0|For Suzanne Collins to have 1) envisioned and conceived this hauntingly-believable dystopian world, 2) structured the story with such compelling twists and lures and, 3) executed the concept and characters so brilliantly... well, that takes the imagination and consummate skill of a gifted writer.  Any flaws a reader might perceive (real or not real) while experiencing this epic trilogy are minor.  This is a major accomplishment from beginning, through the middle, to the end.  A work of art.

B007ZD17XO|5.0|GREAT GAME, VERY ADDICTING! HAVE SPENT HOURS PLAYING IT SO FAR. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT IF YOU LIKE THE JEWEL GAMES
B0016492BW|4.0|Ok, so to be fair, I have always enjoyed this movie. To call it a classic is an understatement. That said, I was ecstatic that it finally was coming to BluRay (I have the Collector's Edition on DVD), and pre-ordered it (as well as bough the iPad app to go with it). The extras are fun, even though a lot of them were on the DVD, and not all were HD (to be expected). It does work really well with the iPad app, which made it that much more fun!<br /><br />On to the next part...<br /><br />The quality on the film transfer has left me underwhelmed. Some parts look OMGmazing, but several parts seem really grainy/pixelated. The audio quality is decent (I don't have surround sound hooked up to hear the overall experience, so take that with a grain of salt).<br /><br />I still recommend it to hardcore Python fans, as well as the accompanying iPad app for that much more fun. Maybe your experience will be better or worse.
0345803485|5.0|I started this book on a Friday night and by Tuesday morning i had read all 3 in the trilogy, i just couldn't put it down, it was a thrill to read ( and i am not generally a big fan of reading).  I fell in love with the character Christian Grey and i sincerely hope that E L James writes another trilogy like this.......its definitely a MUST READ in my opinion.

I sometimes have a fan going on low speed about 5 feet away from me, and it doesn't interfere, even while blowing on me. To be fair, I have a foam windscreen on the mic itself.

B007K87C4M|5.0|This album will take you on a strange and beautiful journey through music and sound. You may not \\"get it\\" on first listen, but that doesn't mean it's AT ALL inaccessible for the somewhat musically adventurous. It just takes a few listens and you realize just how fantastic the material is. Highly recommended in 5.1 by the way - it's just MADE for it. In fact I haven't even listened to it in stereo. It's not \\"drive your kids to school\\" music. It's sit down and immerse yourself music - like Pink Floyd, Tangerine Dream, Sigur Ros, etc.<br /><br />For me, the second and third listens were key. First listen I liked some of it but was bemused and bewildered a bit by the whole thing in general. Second and third go rounds and now I can't get enough. It really is beautifully crafted - the tones, the performances, the production, the mix - amazing! SW really is the guy to beat when it comes to sound - especially in the 5.1 domain.<br /><br />Especially if you have a nice 5.1 system - sit down, open your mind...and listen. You'll be gone awhile, but should return safe and sound to your living room. Enjoy! And look at it this way - by purchasing this album you are supporting artists that are doing their own thing, crafting true art, and supporting hi-fidelity (not to mention surround) music on Blu-Ray.
0812550706|5.0|Young Adult Science Fiction just doesn't get any better this. From the first chapter on, Ender's Game grabbed my interest and didn't let me go until the end. What a well-though-out, well written, thoughtful and entertaining novel this turned out to be.<br /><br />I think that one thing that I really liked about this book is that it takes us through Ender's schooling and training in one fell swoop instead of spreading it out over several books. Yes, I know that this is a series, but this book feels like it is a stand-alone novel rather than a Book 1 of X in a series. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of YA series, but it's nice to read something that doesn't leave you feeling like you must go on to the next book right away. I'm sure that I will follow up on the rest of the series in the future, but I don't feel like I have to do it now.<br /><br />I really enjoyed most of the characters in the book and really hated those that I was supposed to hate. The action in the training scenes is nicely offset by Ender's experience outside of class and his struggles making friends, fitting in with the others and generally growing up.<br /><br />Overall, I thought that this was a great book that I would recommend to teens and adults alike. There is a lot that one can get out of this book just off of the surface and many more rewards to be found by digging deeper into the text and analyzing things more critically.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading Mockingjay but I honestly would have liked a more positive ending. Katniss thought that she couldn't love anyone more than friends and she chose Peta just because the accident with her sister. Who would she have chose if the accident didn't happen? I'm pretty sure it would have been Gale but the only person who knows that is the author and it's her book so. I wasn't really impressed with the last two books, they had their moments but it had more moments when nothing was goin on.
0345803485|5.0|This book is amazing! I had to pick it up after hearing all the rave reviews... And now I know why. Absolutely AMAZING!
B006CDCWDM|5.0|This book not only is good for people who loves tennis, it should be made the \\"must-read\\" book for any parents/children like. Rafal could be a role model for all kids who has ambition to archive something amazing in life. Highly recommended.

She is now an Amazon junkie, lol. Again, it was quickly shipped (to Trinidad, Caribbean) in GREAT condition and very reasonably priced!!!

B007WV05GY|4.0|easily one of the best wilderness survival fliks i've seen...the problem is simple...you are the isolated and unarmed prey of minus 100 deg. cold, hunger, and a pack of wolves the size of horses...you are on ground they know intimately and defend ferociously, as you happen to be in the middle of their hunting range...which means these are not the isolated and shy wolves you are expecting from national geographic documentaries...you have been targeted for annhilation, and as clint said: \\"fair has got nothin' to do with it\\"...they will isolate individuals and attack in cadres...your chances are low and falling...ready or not, the game is on.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|What garbage. I could not finish this book. I got 75% through it and could not even finish it by skimming. Let me first say that I decided to finally read this book after all the comparisons between this book and the Twilight series. Let me assure you, the two have nothing to do with one another - the characters could not be more different - atleast the men in the stories. Edward Cullen was so irresistible due to his desire to protect Bella, to love her and cherish her - do what was in her best interest even at the expense of his \\"life\\" (if you call a vampire having a \\"life\\"). Christian Grey is no Edward Cullen. He knows his interest are based from some twisted messed up traumatic series of events in his life. Knowing that his indulgences are toxic and twisted, he still decides to bring in an innocent girl into this dark world of bondage. He puts his needs ahead of her well being. Its disgusting - he manipulates her with sex. I just can not say how demeaning this book is to women. It amazes me it has the following it has. It is poorly written, makes Stephanie Meyers' books seem like literary works of art, which says alot (love the Twilight series but lets face it, the writing is well, basic). Christian Grey's character is just gross and well, downright unbelievable. He is selfish, controlling with no respect for women. Ana, well she is just an idiot. Atleast Bella had a strong sense of protection for those she loved (and she was a pretty weak heroine) - but Ana Steele, oh my, where to begin in her lack of anything remarkable. Maybe her virginity was her only redeemable quality - and the fact that he could claim all her sexual experiences as just \\"his\\" - creepy and gross. I fantasize for a man to adore me, to protect me, to never want to bring me down - not Christian Grey - he wants to beat you to submission so you can adore him - tear you down to bring you back up to raise him higher - that is not the meaning of a man. That is a coward and this is a man I would everfantasize about. It saddens me to no end to think there are so many women thinking this story is wonderful and that these characters are worth any mention in our lives. They are destructive. If EL James made Christian Grey some guy living out of a trailer, then no one would even be reading this garbage. Are women really that attracted to money that they would forgo their soul? Sad. Disturbing.And no, so poorly written that it was not entertaining. Plain Garbage, I say \\"as I cock my head to one side\\" *rolleyes*
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is among our greatest living guitar players. And you may not know who he is. Such is the peril of the blues. The difference in units sold between the No. 1 album on the pop charts vs. the blues charts can be in the hundreds of thousands. As a blues mainstay, five of his 12 albums have debuted at No. 1 and seven have reached the top spot.  The 34- year old West Hartford, NY native regularly opened for B.B. King as a teenager.  He has since sold out London's Royal Albert Hall and shared the stage with the likes of Clapton, John Hiatt and Paul Rogers. The fact that blues players are primarily featured in guitar magazines full of technical jargon and equipment features make them further inaccessible to the mainstream. Nonetheless, Bonamassa's brilliant under the radar career has been defined by a tireless work ethic and the simple passion for making music in the most puritanical sense. He mainly plays small venues and cuts albums whose sole criterion is to produce his best work every time. Some are destined to become blues classics.  As often as the term guitar hero is ascribed to him, pop culture antihero is also equally accurate. In a 2011 American Blues Scene Interview, when  asked why he wasn't featured on the Rolling Stone Top 100  guitar players of all-time list, he replied, \\"Have you seen who's on the cover this week?(It was Snooki) Rolling Stone has about as much credibility as The National Enquirer.\\"  The only time he was ever mentioned in a mainstream music magazine was in an issue of SPIN, when he took out a full page ad to promote his tour. The terms \\"blues titan\\" and \\"the next Stevie Ray\\" have not unfairly been ascribed to him. His newest album, \\"Driving Towards the Daylight\\" (out May 22) is a balanced back-to-basics album that highlights Bonamassa's signature style of roots blues with rock-and-roll guts, while honoring the traditions of the original blues musicians. \\"We've taken some really traditional old blues songs and we've tried to imagine how they would be done in a rock context,\\" said producer Kevin Shirley. \\"It's a very exciting return to the blues in a very visceral way. It's vibrant and it's gutsy and it's really, really rugged.\\" Special guests Brad Whitford (Aerosmith guitarist), drummer Anton Fig  and Carmine Rojas pulling bass duty. Initial reactions from rock critics have been overwhelmingly favorable and  suggest that Bonamassa will likely become a crossover star with this latest effort. It was once rumored that at Live Aid, Clapton said to Mark Knopfler, \\"I think we're in trouble,\\" after seeing Stevie Ray play.

It's short, simple and to the point...yet beautifully written.  I'm so glad I believed the reviews and bought it.  It's def a book I will read over and over again. It has put so much peace in my heart.

0307951529|5.0|Lots of business books offer loads of statistics, case studies and paragraphs on how anyone can start-up a business - \\"with the proper education and experience\\" of course - then leave you there with that thought - as if you don't have enough of something to begin.<br /><br />Chris's book gives you all of those reports, plus real-world examples, personal experiences AND the tools to make it happen.  One step at a time.  It is real, believable and doable.  Buy the book, read it, then do what most people don't do --- TAKE ACTION!!
1401937519|5.0|This is one of the best, most insightful and motivating books in my library.  Anita brings messages that we all need to hear about who we are.  It give insight into the disease -- her friends killed her with their negativity.  When the patient is surrounded by negative people, they will not do good.  I witnessed a woman who had coded in ER.  She was transferred to ICU to pass over in peace.  Her family was told to go in a say their good-byes.  As Nursing supervisor, I was watching her cardiac rhythm on the monitor.  Her heart went from a lethal rhythm, to normal sinus rhythm, when the family surrounded her and took her hands.  When I left the unit, she was sitting up and putting on a hospital gown.  There is so much that we don't know about life and death. I am grateful that Anita shared with me.  I have recommended her book to many people.  The only thing that I might say about the book that isn't positive is before her death, her dialog keep going around, repeating the same thing.  The reader does have memory and repeating the same thing doesn't help and is seem as filler.  But that flaw can be easily overlooked.  A worthwhile read for anyone with a body.  Kaye
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|I bought Drake's first cd and was amazed by the r&b/proudction value that it had. So the day this cd came out I went to my local Target and gave it a try. Allot of my friends do not enjoy r&b and are more into the Youn Jeezy rap.There is nothing wrong with that but when you buy a Drake cd you have to enjoy R&B as well because he is on of the only artist that gives you rap/r&b equally on the same cd. This cd is amazing. Drake really spits with emotion and you can tell he took his time picking each song.The production value is really good as well thanks allot to \\"40\\" his producer.Some people/haters will tell you they didn't like this cd. But I will bet anyone this: Tell me one cd that came out the same year as this with the same artistry and just overall quality? The only 2 cd's that are comparable are Watch the Throne & 21 by Adele. Drake really is an amazing artist very well done!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book and it was great to have it on both my Ipad and Iphone!  I can't wait to download another book!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I never considered myself a fan of Fantasy Novels, but this has completely changed my mind. Martin brought Winterfell to life in a way that made me shiver while reading the book on warm sunny days. The variety of the characters are brilliantly woven into the fabric of the storyline. I came to love even those on the wrong side of the cause, and I can't wait to start Book 2.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|'The Hunger Games'' was very awesome book And it was a very good book! :]  . I loved it! - Team Peeta!!!!!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I see how this book is like Harry Potter. I'm a Harry Potter fan myself. I had never thought about reading these books untill I got  assigned to read it. Riordan took us on a journey through the young teen Percy Jackson's life. The scenes I can actually visualize and I have read many book series and the only ones I can picture the scenes happening is in Hunter's Warriors series, Pearson's Kingom Keepers, and Rowling's Harry Potter. But I have to give this one to Rick. He describes the scenes vividly. I can totally see the Harry Potter in it but as I said Ive got to give this one to Rick. I am waiting for The Mark of Athena, wich should be realesed in the fall. Overall, The Lighting Theif and the rest of the PJO series is a must read!
B003O86FMW|5.0|'Catching Fire' was a very awesome . The ending was very dramatic and suspensful just like the 'Hunger Games' ending . The ending of 'Catching Fire' makes you realy want to read 'Mockingjay' the last book of the series . -Team Peeta!!!
B0042J6VUS|5.0|Wanted to add my own experience because I benefitted so much from others' reviews here. I'll keep it short: This is a perfectly decent product for the price. It is \\"cheap?\\" Yes, both in price and build quality. That doesn't make it inferior or unacceptable. It's FINE. Just -- you know -- don't beat it to death.<br /><br />I like it because it's universal to smartphones of all sorts. I don't wanna buy separate (and twice-the-price) iphone-tripod gizmos for my 3g and 4. That's stupid. Furthermore, if I wanna stick somebody's Droid in this harness, I can.<br /><br />Case closed. I'd buy it again in a second.<br /><br />Oh -- the tripod: meh. Who cares. Never hurts to have another cheap tiny tripod around, I guess.<br /><br />But I spent my money on the camera holder. And IMO it's utterly completely worth it. I got exactly what I ordered and it does exactly what I want it to do. I've used it dozens of times now.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|okay game kinds gets boring but good for over time play. I enjoy it and would recommend it to peoplen
B005COO1X6|1.0|That was my first thought, as I finished this story...The story was old and tired; probably not unlike it's author.  No, Mr. King, it is not short stories that are ailing....what is ailing is your writing style. Too bad too. This could have been a great short story if it were not for the fact that \\"evil cars\\" had already been done to death by Stephen King.  In other words, no surprises....same old, same old.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that Mr. King can come up with something fresh...or consider getting out while he is still ahead of the game.

B00633W614|4.0|I received the book yesterday and started reading last evening.  It is classic Archer with the usual twists and turns and as usual I was unable to put it down until I was finished.  Even though the ending set up the plot for the next installment, it clearly wasn't as attention grabbing and leaving me count the days until it would be available, as the ending of the 1st installment.  If you like Jeffrey Archer, then don't miss reading this, but please don't judge his work on this one book.
0765357151|5.0|This is hand's down my favorite book by Richard Matheson.  For it's time, it had a lot of unique ideas and twists on the vampire lore.  And as is usually the case, the book is much, much better than any of the movies based on it.
0817439390|5.0|The first thing I have to say about this book is the fact that the author truly knows how to utilize a light source.  He almost never uses a flash, and he always has the best photos.  He explains how to meter off of the right objects so that you aren't  over or under-exposing.  He knows a lot of the old lingo like \\"sunny 16\\" and how to meter off of the palm of your hand at bright places like a beach for the perfect exposure.  Get this book. It is worth every penny.  I recommend getting his field guide after this book, because this book is a great introduction to the field guide.
044024367X|5.0|Fortunately I do not pay much attention to other people's reviews, I want to present mine for comparison. I thought this was one of the best, if not even the best to date, of Lee Child's novels.It is part of a series, therefore we are expected to have read some of its predecessors and to be somewhat familiar with the protagonist, who travels from book to book, and to recognize his characteristics. Likewise the plots are not all the same, they differ in most books but all carry along certain aspects, common enemies (not necessarily human but human characteristics, often the worst aspects) which our hero contends against. These are the common denominator, the features that tie  our protagonist to the story and the series and which serve, hopefully, to keep interest alive. In most of the predecessors these aspects differ from book to book, in \\"Nothing To Lose\\" he is forced to comply with local laws and ordinances which are often ignored in the earlier books but are of use in this book, and also his sexual forays in the earlier books are not portrayed in this one, it helps to diversify the story line. Here, business is boss and how magnates use business to keep their help in line is well portrayed but from an overused viewpoint which slows down the book. A lot of the plot is a rerun of other , too similar plots, which does destroy the story. Still, Child does a good job of keeping his characters employed in the lines he has selected. Familiarity does destroy that part of the book, I almost downgraded the book by a couple of stars for that reason. still, Child pulled himself through with his depiction  of Reacher and his reaction to events.

B007JWKLMO|3.0|As a huge Beatles fan I couldn't wait to see this film. Some parts of it were very moving, especially when Olivia Harrison was speaking about George. Unfortunately that access also means that the film was not as informative as it could have been. His wife hints at and infidelities and drug use is sort of passed over. The conflicts of say George's criticism of the drug fueled flower child era, with his own later (intense?) drug use is never explored. The whole thing paints a sort of saintly picture of the man which I feel actually undermines his standing, by not exploring his complexity further. Of course there are many interesting parts, especially for a Beatles addict like me. But I do not feel there is anything new here and perhaps a chance was missed. It's worth watching but not not a definitive exploration of the subject. Certainly not up to the standards of the spate of Dylan documentaries that came out.
0307951529|5.0|The $100 Startup is just what I have been searching for. It is a powerful guide to creating the freedom you desire and a job that has purpose and value.<br /><br />It is one of the most amazing, simplistic, action based business books I have ever read. You will walk away with a clear blueprint on how to create a life and job on your terms!<br /><br />There's no magic, get-rich quick scheme. It takes hard work, innovation, commitment and perseverance but it's possible. The book is packed full of realistic approaches and the the quest is all about helping others.<br /><br />True success stories are ones that can be replicated. If you know yourself, know the steps, know the patterns and have clarity on the life you want, you can create your own success story!<br /><br />You finish the book with a clear guide of what you need to do next in your own journey as well as an outline for future growth ideas.<br /><br />It was truly a fantastic book and I have read, re-read, highlighted and have written all over it.  It's just one of those books that you will reference for years to come.  Get the paper copy instead of the Kindle for that reason!
1592402690|5.0|I'll say upfront that some others in the recording industry have taken issue with some of the things Geoff Emerick says about the Beatles personalities and musicianship. Another Beatles engineer Ken Scott, in particular, took issue with some of the opinions and facts written here. However as a dye hard Beatles fan who grew up in the same place and time as them, it brought back many memories to me and added a huge amount of information and added enjoyment, of their music. I believe readers have to bear in mind Geoff Emerick was writing about the events or personalities as he saw and worked with them in the studio. The subjects may have been different around other people (maybe George was not so moody around other friends or studio employees) but this is how Geoff Emerick experienced them day to day when they were making records at their peak. I have heard some say that the book short changes George Martin. I did not think so. I thought he explained very well how Martin schooled The Beatles in the studio, nourished their musical talents and essentially saw them fly from the nest. Emerick does pay homage to Paul as the best musician. But if that it true and it probably was, then why criticize him for saying how it showed itself in the studio?<br /><br />Overall this is a VERY readable book and sheds light on a hugely important time in the development of popular music.

B005OUB7MQ|5.0|By far her best album. It just keeps rewarding many repeat listens. It's been a long time since I heard an album that has no weak tracks while being more than the sum of its parts. There are moments on some tracks I get a natural high that you only get on a trail that overlooks a beautiful landscape.
0345803485|5.0|A friend of mine told me about this book that she was reading. So I looked it up and started to read it. I was shocked at first but then I couldn't put it down. I read all 3 book in a week and loved it. I am not a sick person by any means but if it is a good book and can hold my attention I will read it. Don't care who the arthor is or wether it is romance, thriller, or any of them I will read it.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was my first online book purchase that I read on the kindle app on my android phone. It was for my bookclub. I loved it. I had no idea that there was a language of flowers, and enjoyed learning about it. But it was more than just a book about flowers. It was a love story, and a story about friendships, and childhood and growing up. The book held my interest and I didn't want it to end. And reading on the kindle app was a great experience. I definitely recommend this book.

0385341008|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I think the trouble was that I read it too late.  Everyone I know read this book several years ago and raved about it and I am just reading it now.  THe style took a few minutes to adjust to but once I did, I really enjoyed the choppy format and feel I came to know the characters more intimately than I would have had the story followed a straight narrative.  I think I just expected to adore it and it fell slightly short.  that said, if I wait several months and read it again, I am sure I will love it!

For anyone new to food photography or anyone who's past the beginner stage but not sure how to take her food photography to the next level (like me), this is the book for you. Beautifully photographed, informative and inspiring. After devouring her book and employing Dujardin's suggestions, I was able to immediately elevate my photography. \\"Thank you, Helene, for sharing your talent with us!!\\"

B005FISBTO|3.0|The best thing about this season is the examination of religion. Dexter has always been attacked by conservatives and I think this is a way to give some back. Which makes a great reason to watch & examine our own beliefs, through Dexter & his observations.<br /><br /> But the issue with this series & the 5th is their are too many holes in the plot. I'm still wondering why Quinn has not pursued Dexter with his suspicions, especially after the detective been found murdered after investigating Dexter & its never even brought up in this season, like nothing happened, shows laziness on the writer behalf. The increased risk taking by Dexter seems to ruin the plot, seems the writers are just lazy, can't be bothered finding an original twist.<br /><br /> But part from it being the worst season so far (1st & 4th being the stand outs), it is still Dexter & one of the top ten series of the 21st century, its still fantastic viewing television, just sack a couple of writers please & don't ruin Dexter & its place in history as one of the best.<br /><br /> Bring on season 7, I'm addicted to Dexter, just hope its not a bad line.

Get all three books, or at least have next handy when almost done with first two books.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have owned this DVD for several years, but this year is the first time I gave it a serious try.  I have been doing it regularly for 3 months now and I am SO much stronger than when I started.  I started out doing Level 1 4 times a week for a month, then alternating Level 1 and Level 2 4 times a week, and now I alternate Levels 1, 2, and 3 4 times a week.  Each level does prepare you for the next one, but I feel like each one gives you such a different workout that it is a good idea to alternate them so you really work your muscles completely.  Honestly, though, they are challenging enough that I can't imagine doing one of these workouts every single day of the week- for me, 4 times a week is plenty!  I make time to warm up by walking for 15 minutes or so before each workout and I find that helps reduce soreness.  Now that I am up to being able to complete Level 3, I have taken some of the Level 3 modifications and I apply them to the easier workouts (holding weights to do punches, butt-kicks and jumping jacks, etc) and that way I am continuing to build more strength and challenge myself with each workout.<br /><br />I have lost about 3lbs since I started doing the workouts 3 months ago, but I wish I had taken measurements because my clothes are quite a bit looser from my muscles being tighter.  Even though I haven't lost much weight, everything looks smaller and tighter.  I am sure if I added a stricter diet along with this workout that I could really lose some pounds, but right now I am just focusing on the fitness aspect.

B004LUS390|5.0|I was using the free version, which works great, and the reviews for this paid version was making me think I would regret the purchase. I went with my gut and installed the app with no troubles.<br /><br />When I first opened it, I kept waiting for something to go wrong, and nothing did. I used every brush and effect, added many layers, saved the work into the apps gallery, and re-opened it with no problems, then saved the image to different formats.<br /><br />I have had no problems with this app as of yet, 5/7/2012, and hope to never experience any.

B0018QQQK8|3.0|I usually don't read romance novels, but after seeing the trailer for the movie and being a military wife it sparked some of my interest. Overall I thought the book was good, but the ending was lacking some depth. It basically started to work up to be a good ending, but then it just ended. For example you never find out how Logan was able to survive after being held underwater by Clayton. Lastly I had a huge problem with Beth during the section where she finds out how or why Logan came to Hampton. She seemed to be very excepting of Logan after they began to have a relationship, but she couldn't think that her crazy ex could manipulate her from a far and believe his fictitious story of Logan being a stalker; that Logan's story of the photograph could not be true, when it is. As a military wife I found this to be the point here I wanted to smack her. Soldiers will hold onto anything that reminds them of home, because of what they go through and see overseas. Plus it is away for them to have hope that they will come home again.

B003J7HOKU|5.0|Deep Blue was released in 2010 by Australian Metalcore act Parkway Drive, it was their third full-length studio album and the fan-anticipation surrounding its release was immense.<br /><br />The album marks a shift in production style for the band as production was not handled by Adam D (of Killwitch Engage) for the first time on a full-length Parkway Drive album. Musically, The band concentrate on the heavier side of their sound, especially favoring their breakdowns and big riffs, which results in a very direct and hard sounding album full of very solid and well constructed songs following a pretty strict musical formula.<br /><br />The album is a real grower and repeat listens really bring out all the character and little touches. The whole album flows pretty well and each song boasts some some vocal chant that will be stuck in your head for a long time. The real standout tracks are the single `Sleepwalker,' the catchy `Home Is For The Heartless,' and the absolutely gigantic sounding `Deadweight,' which features one of the best breakdowns on the whole album.<br /><br />If you were being unkind you could call the album one-dimensional but the band also include a few their contemplative passages and technical sections to break up the barrage of aggression and additionally the album is conceptual in nature with the songs all unified by shared lyrical ideas (telling the story of a disillusioned man attempting to find understanding by venturing under the sea only to return to where he started) and both these elements inject enough creativity into the mix to make the album stand out from the crowd as a great record, even among other Parkway Drive albums.<br /><br />Interestingly for a concept album, Deep Blue is remarkably music-focused and the narrative doesn't interrupt or overwhelm the music at any point. Its not so much a rock opera with non-musical dialogue and sound effects as an album that just ended up telling a story. It can stand on its own as a set of tight, independent songs or you can sit down with the lyrics and enjoy it with a hidden extra layer of depth and both ways work equally well.<br /><br />The more you listen to it the more you realize that Deep Blue is an almost flawless album and the only thing that could really be considered wrong with it, is if you already don't like or have heard too much of the style of music that the band play. While Parkway Drive do not break huge amounts of new ground however, what they do, they do very well indeed. Parkway Drive have Metalcore down to a science and with their rejection of clean vocals altogether, still have something new to offer to metal fans who dislike or have grown tired of the over-saturated clean/light Metalcore sound. You can't realistically accuse them of ripping off Killswitch Engage exclusively if they don't employ the same giant clean choruses, arguably the biggest factor in the Killswitch sound.<br /><br />Overall; the quality of the music speaks for itself and I if you are a fan of the genre, Deep Blue is definitely an album you need to be listening to. It is tight, confident and perfectly formed.independent songs or you can sit down with the lyrics and enjoy it with a hidden extra layer of depth and both ways work equally well.<br /><br />The more you listen to it the more you realize that Deep Blue is an almost flawless album and the only thing that could really be considered wrong with it, is if you already don't like or have heard too much of the style of music that the band play.

0812550706|5.0|When I was in the sixth grade back in 1991, my parents handed me their dog eared copy of Ender's Game, a book my mother still claims as her favorite book of them all. I read it and I was completely hooked. I did a book cover poster on the cover, though I have no idea where that thing is now. I completely fell in love with the story of little Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin and his reluctant journey to become the savior of the human race.<br /><br />His birth is a special case. Families are only allowed two children each and they're looking for one particular genius child to become the military leader to help them defeat the formics, an insect race that nearly destroyed humans years ago. Since the Wiggins produce genius children, the government \\"requisitions\\" a third child after their son Peter and daughter Valentine prove for differing reasons to be unsuitable for the job. Ridiculed as a Third all his life, Ender is taken from his parents when he's a mere six years old and shipped off to the military Battle School, which orbits Earth.<br /><br />Set up constantly to be picked on, we watch as Ender adapts to every situation he's thrown into during his journey through Battle School. The book ends with a shocker and then quietly takes you off into the sunset, leaving you yearning for more and wanting so much to embrace this poor child made to endure a rigorous and cruel military training from such a terribly young age.<br /><br />It's been 21 years since I first became a fan of the books and now I have a six year old son of my own, which of course makes me think of him whenever I read the start of the book. A movie is currently in production in New Orleans and stars Asa Butterfield, Harrison Ford, Viola Davis, and Sir Ben Kingsley. It'll be interesting to see how the movie holds up to fans that have been waiting for decades. Lord of the Rings managed to come out amazingly on top, so hopefully the same thing happens here.<br /><br />Ender's Game is a science fiction classic, but can also be considered young adult. By today's standards of YA fiction, Ender's Game won't turn off Twilight or Hunger Games haters because there's no cliche love triangle to drive you crazy. It's truly a book for all readers from ages 10 and up.can also be considered young adult.

There are 12 distrects in the country of Panam on the continet of North america after world war 3. The book was amazing read it for yourself. I don't want to ruin the book for you.

0439023491|3.0|Not a good book. That's the problem with trilogies. The first book is great and the next two books are bad. In this case it's the same problem.Catching Fire is a long drawn out book that only tells you about how Catniss survives another Hunger Games in the quater quell. The quater quell is when every 25 years the winners of the hunger games have to compete again in a another hunger games.The book also surprise's you at the end by telling you that district 12 is no more and wanting you itching for answers. So I guess I'll just read the third book just for answers. I give this book a 3 out of five just because I liked the first book. I say that the book was a good etempet at a trilogie.[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, Book 2)]]
B000AMWIVM|5.0|SAW is the most interesting movie ive ever had the honor to view. Though the acting is not the greatest,the overall theme and various messeges of the movie make it all worth while. In order to enjoy it,you have to try to get inside the jigsaw killer's twisted mind. He is not a killer. He tests his victims to see what they will do to stay alive (to prove the value of life). There is an art to the jigsaw killers actions...almost poetic.<br /><br />This film goes to show that evenwith a dirt-low production value, a great film can be made.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've been watching Vlog Brothers videos for some time now, and was excited to actually read a John Green novel. I heard him read the first two chapters on youtube, and read the first two chapters in a John Green Esampler offered on Amazon. The other three sample chapters didn't grab me this way The Fault in Our Stars did. It might have something to do with 'me being there' during the creation of this book.<br /><br />I put off reading it for a while, as I had a pile of other books to plow through, but in actuality because I was afraid to read it. I knew that it was going to be sad, and I'd read tweets and tumblr posts about how the book made someone cry. I've read sad books before, but yet and still, I was afraid to read it. To that end, I'm not sure if that really was the case. It may have been a case where it was so built up by all the other Nerdfighters that I didn't want to read it in case I was disappointed. I read it. I was not prepared for what this book did to me.<br /><br />I read The Fault in Our Stars in about twelve hours. In that time I was struck with how sweet and awkward Hazel and Augustus were with each other. I was blown away with the love Augustus had for Hazel. It wasn't the puppy love you usually equate with teenagers, but something much more mature. It was the I'm ready to spend the rest of my life with you love...<br /><br />I cried. I stopped. I cried some more. This was the first book to make me cry. I teared up while reading the Deathly Hallows, but never truly cried. I was not prepared for the tears the flowed while reading this book. The more I read the more my heart broke. The more I read the more tears flowed. The more I read this book the moved I became.<br /><br />I've read YA books before.  A lot of them seem to be Twilight copies, or if not that, along the same vein as Twilight. There was no depth to them, and they were found to be wanting. This book has completely restored my faith in the YA genre, as I often read YA books to recommend to my baby sister. This book was so beautiful and perfect and heartbreaking. I want to share it with people, but yet keep it to myself.<br /><br />Never has a book affected me so deeply. Suffice it to say, I highly recommend this book.mend to my baby sister.

0385341008|5.0|Don't want to give anything away, so I will just say this did not feel like I was reading a book.  I felt like I was spying on people's lives and couldn't get enough of them.  When I had to put the book down, all I could think about how I was missing out on what was going on in Guernsey.  I was wondering what Kit, Dawsey, Isola, Juliet, etc were doing.  Felt like a little kid who had to go in the house while all her friends were still outside playing.  That is how much it drew me in and lost me in the book.  I have not felt that way about a book in a long time.  Excellent escape.
B007MDB71O|4.0|I had no plans of any kind to see this movie (due to the cheesy, laughable trailers), however, my son and I found ourselves standing in the theater one day back in mid-March, with no other movies starting anytime soon...so we decided to take a chance on John Carter.  I have to say, it was great...as far as space operas go, it wasn't on par with, say, \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (then again, what is?) but it was significantly more fun and engaging than any of the Star Wars prequels.  Bottom line - if you're into the sci-fi or adventure genre, I'd say give this one a chance.  We both loved it.<br /><br />In fact, of movies that have come out in the past six to nine months, I'd say the only one we had a better time at was \\"The Avengers.\\" :-)

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay (Final book of Hunger Games Trilogy)<br /><br />I read Hunger Games and Catching Fire within a few weeks of each other, so I was able to piece together the stories quite readily. I found that Mockingjay was a solid continuation of the second book and wraps up the stories and character development quite nicely. The level of violence in Mockingjay is significantly higher than the first two books, especially when they enter the Capitol and have to engage the various \\"pods\\" and new mutts.<br /><br />That brings me to another area of the story. Some of the pods and challenges were believable (like tracker jackers that release based on proximity), but many of the other pods weren't as feasible. The black ooze, the entire section of the street that opens up, and the boiling steam. If the District 13 level of technology was as high as the Capitol, they'd be able to detect the thermals from the steam generation machines. Instead, the soldiers seemed to just run around amok tripping the pods. They eventually used unmanned vehicles to set off the pods, but that wasn't quite a successful strategy since the Capitol would manually trigger them.<br /><br />Towards the end, the death of Prim was done rather haphazardly and the epilogue stories for the other surviving characters wasn't quite clear and was rather brief. Some of the more interesting supporting characters (e.g. Johanna Mason) weren't developed as fully as I'd like.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars

076535618X|5.0|In the third book of the \\"Old Man's War\\" series, John Scalzi shifts gears to the more political side of the setting in 2007's The Last Colony. Though there's certainly still action in this volume, the emphasis is now more on political intrigue both within the Colonial Union and with the alien races who are humanity's neighbors in the galaxy.<br /><br />Returning to the story is the Old Man of Old Man's War John Perry, as well as his wife Jane Sagan, who featured in both Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades, as well as Zoe Boutin-Perry, their adopted daughter. Having retired from Colonial Defense Forces (CDF), Perry and Sagan are happy on their colony world of Huckleberry when they're tapped by the CU to lead a new colony made up of, for the first time, colonists from other colony worlds, instead of Earth. This, of course, makes it politically sensitive.<br /><br />Oh, and there's the little matter of the 412 alien races who have formed an alliance called the Conclave and vowed to destroy new colonies of any races who aren't a member of the club. Which, by the way, the Colonial Union isn't.<br /><br />The majority of the book focuses on Perry and Sagan's efforts to make the colony a success while evading Conclave detection and Colonial Union politics. There's a lot of excitement on each of these fronts, and the story moves in unexpected ways as Perry and Sagan uncover more of the truth behind it all.<br /><br />I enjoyed The Last Colony as much as Old Man's War (in no small part because of John Perry's return) and more than The Ghost Brigades. One of the parts of Scalzi's narrative that has had me hooked since the start of the series has been the politics of the setting and the interactions between the alien races. As such, while I really enjoyed the military action of the previous books, I'm happy to trade it at this point for a new approach to the series focusing on Colonial Union and interstellar politics.<br /><br />If you've enjoyed Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades, there's no reason not to go pick up The Last Colony right now. Even if you haven't read the first two, the setup for The Last Colony is sufficient that you can dive right into it if the political angle is more interesting to you than the military. But do yourself a favor and read the first two book anyways.rigades, there's no reason not to go pick up The Last Colony right now.

B003V4AK8E|3.0|I bought this controller because playing Mass Effect 2 and 3 was giving me cramps in my arms.  Although the Sony PS3 controllers offer tight control, they are small and not very comfortable to use for long gaming sessions.<br /><br />I hoped that this controller would alleviate that situation. It did - unfortunately, it turned out that the controls simply were not tight enough in the sticks for me.  The buttons are nice.  The grip is nice.  The size is awesome.  The position of the sticks is good - it's all very similar to the X-Box 360 controller (except for the nubbly, rubbery feel,and a slightly lighter weight).  The problem is that the sticks are (A) too tall and (B) full of dead space.  There's just too much play in them to make them good for shooters - it's hard to line up sights or keep from going all wally in high tension situations where you have a lot of enemies to contend with at one time.<br /><br />Sigh.  I'm disappointed, because although I like the tight control I get with the default Sony controllers,  I don't like the tight feeling in my arms and hands after an hour or so.  Someone please, come up with a better PlayStation controller!<br /><br />Sadly, for me, this isn't it.
0670023329|4.0|Shin Dong-hyuk was born in the usual way, but in a far-from-usual place.  He is the only person born in a North Korean prison camp who is known to have escaped.  His story, as told by Blaine Harden, is an account of 23 years of life so defined by confinement, paranoia, oppression, torture, fear, and privation that it is hard to know what to compare it to.  Prison?  Well, yes, of course, except that children born in prison usually are not, simply by virtue of their birth, prisoners themselves, equally guilty with their parents.  A concentration camp?  That's closer to the mark.  A living hell?  Closer still.<br /><br />The story, in short, is this.  Shin was born in \\"Camp 14,\\" one of a string of prison camps that dot the North Korean landscape.  Camp 14 is apparently one of the more ruthless and restrictive camps.  Shin's parents were allowed, perhaps even assigned, to have children in the camp, and Shin and his older brother were the result.  Shin grew up learning that his highest duty was to snitch on everyone around him, including his family.  This led to disastrous consequences for some of them, though it may have saved his own life.  It took him a long time to open up to the possibility that there might be a basis for human relationships other than power, fear, and utility--that trust and compassion might actually exist.  Those qualities are not only in short supply in the camps, they are liabilities.  In the end, of course, Shin did escape, though even his escape was marked by tragedy and broken relationships.  He lived the life of a wandering vagrant in North Korea for a time, made it across the semi-porous border into China, and survived on odd jobs until he met a journalist who helped facilitate his departure via the South Korean consulate in Shanghai.  Shin now lives in the US, where his adjustment has been far from smooth (and is, one assumes, not yet complete).<br /><br />Life in the camp was absolutely horrifying.  At any moment, and without warning, a prisoner could be set upon by guards for the tiniest of reasons or no reason at all.  The result could be a beating, torture, the loss of food, humiliation, or even death.  Prisoners were worked to death, beaten to death, starved to death, shot and hanged to death.  They were all there to die, really, so why should the camp officials care if it came one way rather than another?<br /><br />The book should be riveting.  Curiously, very often it is not.  Harden's account is straightforward and unadorned, which is certainly better than letting the writing take over the story.  But his style of telling the story also does little to bring out the drama inherent in Shin's life.  And toward the end the book not only gets a bit rushed, it loses focus as well.  The final scene is very good, though in general the last three chapters are desultory, wandering, aimless.  But maybe that's an accurate reflection of Shin's life.<br /><br />Still, Escape from Camp 14 is worth reading.  Shin's life is a reminder of just how completely a state can trample the life out of its people, and how worthless an individual human being can become in the eyes of rulers who have purged themselves of any real humanity.
B005IQZB14|2.0|This book should have been titled, \\"Poor Me: Yet I am so interesting\\".<br />What a waste of time and money. The story of a self-important, self-indulgent person who makes consistantly poor choices. Whether it is because she is stupid and lost and numb or just not too bright but narcissistic enough to fool herself I am not sure. This is not a nature book, nor it is a book about getting wiser as you bumble around. I will not go into detail as I don't want to mention any spoilers. This book is not about the Pacific Coast Trail. Interiew any cub scout or brownie girl scout and learn more about being on the trail than this author knows. The fact that she admits that she knows this over and over again does not make her endearing. It is not a survival a story but a story about an author who finds herself fascinating and then even more fascinating. Do yourself a favor and skip it.

B00701897I|2.0|Disappointed with 3D, unlike Hugo the image was flat. The only scene that I felt achieved the experience was the flying scene.
0316098329|5.0|I finished this book a week ago and I am still thinking about it.  The plot and the characters have stuck in my mind and left me so hungry for more that I am having urges to read the book again.  This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I initially passed on it because of the subject matter.  I was afraid it would be dark and disturbing.  However, I am glad I broke down and read it because it is just the opposite- optimistic and full of warmth.  It is a happy story out of a horrific situation.  I fell so in love with Jack that there was a scene in the book when my heart was literally racing and my adrenaline was on overload because I was so afraid for him.  If you don't read this book, you are robbing yourself of a wonderful story.
B006RED4GA|1.0|Nothing happens until the last 30 minutes and even that wasn't worth waiting for; I found myself answering email, checking out CNN.com and fast forwarding to see if there was something at all intelligent or interesting about this story. The acting is over-the-top ridiculous, loooong panning with the camera, making me think that they were trying to fill up empty time with long pans. Nothing is ever explained, the dots don't connect. Ending is hackneyed and completely predictable. Great big bore and poorly done. If you want a good ghost story, rent \\"The Haunting\\" (not the Liam Neeson version, though I adore him; get the Claire Bloom version) or better still \\"The Innocents.\\" Sheesh, even Paranormal Activity was better than this.
0345803485|1.0|I thought that all the hype about this book was ridiculous.  Not compelling, not erotic, not even interesting.  Having Anastasia repeatedly using the phrase \\"oh my\\" made we want to scream!  And to believe that a innocent virgin would continually be worried about her \\"inner goddess\\" was laughable.  If this book gets you heated up, you should reconsider your own sex life!  In my opinion, don't bother buying this one.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Don't play this game, don't let kids play this game!  This isn't a game, it is a secret DARPA project to inculcate youth with an intuitive grasp of orbital mechanics.<br /><br />This absolutely confirms the the existence of extraterrestrials.  There would be not need to condition children with an unconscious grasp of maneuvering in variable gravities, the mechanisms of multiple gravity sources, and desensitizing people to violence against green beings in space suits unless there were aliens to fight.<br /><br />Obviously, the rest of the Angry Birds games were just a hook to get people interested and lead them to Angry Birds Space.  Obviously, anyone involved with this would deny it, confirming to sensitive and classified nature of these games, and again confirming the involvement of aliens in our government!<br /><br />Don't play this game!

B005EGXTEE|5.0|Fantastic read as the triology doesnt allow you to stop at the first. It is always better than the movie. A must for anyone!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I was a little sceptical about starting book 1 after I finished watching the first Season of Game of Thrones.  If you are in the same boat, don't worry!  It is more like re-visiting old friend and telling stories around a glass of wine.  Watching the first season actually gave me a some faces to put the names to... which usually I hate, but there are so many \\"families\\" and characters in these books that it can get quite confusing.  As always the movie/show left quite a bit out of what is actually in the book, they kept the hard basics the same and made small changes to better adapt to visual (TV) rather than imagionation (book).  You get more of a background on the characters and what is going on in their heads while reading through.  A definate must!<br /><br />As for the \\"Kindle - Bundle Version\\", is cheaper than the individual books on Kindle, but still more expensive than the cheap book version.  Order over $20 and they ship for free, so they can't even say it offsets the shipping price.  Definatly not happy over that.
B0064BWDRW|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with the Phantom. It did not measure up to the usual standard set by Jo Nesbo. At times it was hard to follow and it wasn't the compulsive read I expected. I hope Hary Holt survives.[[ASIN:0307960471 Phantom (Harry Hole)]]

B007SYWFRM|1.0|I had the same problem as everyone else with this app. It was kind of cute but after 10 minutes or so, I soon tired of it, and wanted to go back and finish a book I was reading. Same problem. I tapped my finger all over the screen and the menu never came up. I tried shutting it down over and over, but same story - couldn't get back to the menu. My Kindle Fire sat there, completely useless to me, with several hundred books just sitting in my cloud. I've been reading on my 3G Kindle, which is adequate, but not the same.<br /><br />Finally today, I was determined to complain to Amazon Support, but first came here. I tried the suggestions to go to \\"stuff,\\" but same story - couldn't find it. Then I remembered advice on a Kindle forum I frequent for unlocking the Kindle Fire (which was frozen for another reason). The easy fix: With the Fire closed down, hold in the activate button for about 10 seconds. You'll see \\"Kindle Fire\\" appear in the screen. After another 10-15 seconds the Fire reboots, and voila! You're back in business with your cloud.<br /><br />I haven't done it yet, but my next step will be to go to my account and \\"manage your apps and devices,\\" locate this diabolical app and click the \\"actions\\" dropdown and select \\"delete.\\" You'll get a warning that the app won't work on any other device. That's just fine with me.<br /><br />This would probably be a great app for kids on their iPhones, whatever, but until the developers correct this problem I DO NOT recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

My physician suggested a gluten free diet which I started in November 2011 and it really seems to help.<br />I bought this book which gave me some insight into why so many people are sensitive to wheat and gluten theses days.  I found it very interesting and informative.  After I went on a no wheat diet my blood glucose returned to normal from a pre-diabetic status and my lipid panel was normal.  I am a believer in eating no wheat or gluten containing products.

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I grew up watching Stargate SG-1 (first aired in 1997) and then Stargate Atlantis and I loved the shows. I checked out Stargate Universe, just because I've been a fan since I was 13, and it was so much more than I expected. I love the ensemble cast and how the series builds from one episode to the next (Watch it in order or you will be lost). I've read about some people comparing it to Battlestar Galactica, and I can see some similarities, but it doesn't feel like a ripoff. It feels like a darker-toned version of Stargate. I always felt like it was still Stargate.<br /><br />SGU is a more mature, intense, and darker show than SG1 or SGA. The storylines often address some deep issues and how the characters all deal with hard decisions and circumstances differently. I wouldn't recommend it for children younger than 13. It's not offensively inappropriate though, either. The most sexual scene is actually in the first 15 minutes of the pilot where two SGC members are getting busy in a storage room. But just fast forward if it bothers you, the rest of the series doesn't have scenes like that (Kind of like the pilot for SG-1. If you've seen the pilot unedited, there's nudity. But the rest of the series didn't have anything like that.)<br /><br />I highly recommend Stargate Universe to Stargate and Sci-Fi fans. If you are eternally embittered to the fact that SG-1 and SGA have past on and that SGU isn't a copy of either show, then unless you can keep an open mind you will probably be unhappy with the two seasons of SGU (although SG-1 and SGA characters do make appearances in SGU). You definitely don't have to watch all 10 seasons of Stargate SG-1 and all five seasons of Stargate Atlantis to understand Stargate Universe, either. Although I recommend all three shows. It's fun to watch how it evolves over several years of production.

B003V4AK8E|5.0|The Pro Elite Wireless controller by Power A looks a bit unassuming, but trust me, you'll probably never want to go back to the stock controller again. I'm a HUGE fan of the Xbox 360 controller, with the exception of the terrible D-pad. This controller has all of the best features of the Xbox 360 controller AND a great D-pad. The stock PS3 controller has the analog sticks too close together for my comfort, and I prefer the off-set analog sticks anyway (commonly referred to as reverse analog sticks, but that makes no sense to me). The fact that the buttons light up is just cool, though totally unnecessary. I also MUCH prefer the concave analog stick tops versus the convex ones present on the stock PS3 controller; it's just so much easier to maintain a good hold on the stick when I can put my thumb into the slight groove. The \\"massaging\\" bead-like grips are pure awesome, and I really like the feel. The shoulder buttons are much better than the PS3, particularly the back ones since they won't accidentally get pressed when you set the controller down on a hard surface (as can happen with the PS3 stock controller). I also like the weightier feel, as the stock PS3 controller feels like a cheap plastic toy. It's a plus that it uses the same mini-USB port as the stock PS3 controller, and of course includes a built-in battery pack. Like the stock controller, you cannot easily replace the battery pack, but then again if you were to do that the PS3 would probably be an outdated system by then.<br /><br />So while I love the controller and have said all good stuff so far, is there anything negative? Well, yes, one issue that some of you may not like:  the controller is unable to power on the system. The controller works wirelessly via a USB dongle that must remain plugged into the system AT ALL TIMES when using the controller. Therefore, the connection is not present until the system is already on, so this controller cannot power on the system. No problem for me, I don't mind,but it's good to know that ahead of time.<br /><br />I have to say that this controller has no real negatives for me. I love it.

B0053B347M|4.0|For the price I think this is worth it. It makes an ambient glow, not bright that does help with the eye strain in a dark room. Two strips may be better, I have just one for now.  I plan to get a back lit keyboard so I'll revisit this later.  I did notice the adhesive can pull off but this is the weight of the cord causing a daisy chain effect.  One small piece of duct tape fixed that.  To have it turn off when you power off your machine go to your bios settings and look for your usb settings.  On my motherboard it was under power management and you just enable ErP support.  This makes it so your computer consumes less than 1w in S5 (shutdown) state.  This is disabled by default.  By doing this you lose wake up by:keyboard,mouse, lan and others.  Also, if you like to charge your cell or tablets etc when your PC is off then I believe this would disable that.  Once I enabled this feature the led strip turns on when I turn on my PC and when I shutdown it follows suit.  It does stay on in sleep status and to wake from sleep I just have to tap the power button.  This is a nice product at a fair price.  It seems to disturb my wife much less while she sleeps over the lamp I was using before this.
B000003C2U|4.0|I am one of the few people to have actually seen Death play live.  As we all know, Death's mastermind, Chuck passed on.  However, his influence to music is tremendous even to this day.  Although Death was not the most popular death metal band, in my opinion they are one of the best.  100 years from now they might still talk about Chuck.  Why?  It's called death metal for a reason, and that is because it is named after this band, \\"Death.\\"  If I had to rate this album as far as its influence, I would have to give it 5 stars.  If I had to write it when it came out, I'd give it 4 stars.<br />Human is both an extremely aggressive and cerebral album, a sound which Death became noted for.  People that criticize death metal should start by trying to play this stuff.  If this music does not humble you musically, then I would say that you are a phenomenal player and have forgotten how much work it takes to get to this level of skill.  The album Human made death not only a force for creating some of the heaviest music, but also gives credence to its genre as not only valid, but par as a genre.  You could take this album and play it for any classically trained musician or any jazz musician, and if they are honest that technical prowess is an intricate part of music, they may not like the style, but they will have to admit that there is genius on this album.<br />So, why not 5 stars?  I have just got done praising this album more than I would ever praise most metal albums, and I didn't give it 5 stars.  What gives?  The problem is in the fact that the vocals and the guitar just don't mesh on this album.  It sounds like they were recorded at separate times, and then merged.  That is Chuck's voice sounds like it was done at a different time than the rest of the album.  The bass, drums, and guitar are together though.  And, though Death does have albums where the vocals and the music mesh better, on the whole this album probably has the best songs of any Death album, but not by much, as while they were making music, if you bought a Death album, you pretty much couldn't go wrong.<br />The production on Human is somewhat crude.  It hails from a time when drummers actually had to be good and they couldn't just trigger their drums to sound the same way.  Also, since this album, guitar distortion technology greatly evolved.  As I recall, when Nu Metal bands like Def Biscuit and the Korn Tones (I can't take credit for this ingenious term,) Chuck was vehemently denouncing them as second rate, and he especially criticized drummers for using triggers, calling it, \\"Cheating.\\"h, as while they were making music, if you bought a Death album, you pretty much couldn't go wrong.<br />The production on Human is somewhat crude.

0307951529|5.0|The $100 Startup is a must-read for any individual planning to go into business for themselves. The book gives countless examples of real people doing what they love and getting paid to do it. Rather than giving a narrow step-by-step guide to a specific kind of business, Guillebeau covers the concept of microbusiness in broad strokes. This book will help you regardless of your industry, field or pursuit- the general principles he lays out apply across the board.<br /><br />Personally, I couldn't get through more than a few pages without stopping to write down my own ideas. I can't think of a better recommendation for a book on business- it sparked so much creative thought. I usually tear through books like this, but instead of spending a few hours flipping pages, I spent a week taking extensive notes for my own business. Every chapter gave me new insight and guidance. I can't recommend this book highly enough to new entrepreneurs.

0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is an absolute masterpiece. Suzanne Collins absolutely knows what she's doing, as she is the ultimate game master of the series. The plot is full of diabolical twists, as Katniss finds everything and all the people she thought she could depend on turned upside down. I was, as usual, in a state of constant suspense throughout the whole book, especially as games turned into war, which somehow still resembled the games. Mockingjay almost would have ended in the same suspense, if not for a brief epilogue.<br /><br />Even without that, however, it clearly was the end of the trilogy, the way it wrapped the entire story back together, returning in the end to some elements of both previous books. Personally, I would highly suggest the lovely boxed set, as between all the suspense and unity of the three books, you will want to read all of the Hunger Games books in one big rush, without having to go back to the bookstore to get the next book in the series.

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire was an insane book, full of unexpected psychological horrors inflicted on the characters, and the main character's struggle between her affection for two very different guys. After reading The Hunger Games, I thought I had a rough sense of what would happen next because Katniss thought about what the usual routine was and her role after the Games were over. But everything changes horribly and the suspense was unbearable on every page, once again.<br /><br />This book focused on life under a totalitarian regime, where the news is censored and any rebellion is crushed mercilessly. Fear and flashbacks beat hunger as defining emotional forces in this book, as the world of the Hunger Games catches on fire. I could hardly bear to read such things; but I could barely tear my eyes off the pages, either. An astonishing book, and not to be clich&eacute;d, but I was blown away, especially by the ending.  This book hardly needs a review--if you read the first book, you will need to read this one, given the suspense at the end of the Hunger Games.

By all rights, as awful as many of her trail experiences were, it could and should have been even worse.<br /><br />To me, this book is a powerful reminder about the importance of taking on the near-impossible task/experience and facing down one's demons.<br />It is the journey of the hero, but told by a woman who felt like anything but when she set out.<br />Yes, she was horribly underprepared to trek the PCT and it was nuts to do it solo, and some of the confident hikers who commented scathingly  can't forgive her that.<br />People who hate Elisabeth Gilbert of Eat, Pray, Love for leaving her perfectly sweet husband to \\"find herself\\" abroad will probably hate Cheryl Strayed for similar crimes, including self-indulgence.<br /><br />But I found this a very powerful book. One that I expect to be thinking about for many years. One that I expect, and hope, will influence my own life.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I purchased this book after hearing about all the hype.  I downloaded the sample and purchased the book without reading any reviews (which I never do). After I bought the book I read some reviews are started to regret my decision (maybe I shouldn't have \\"wasted\\" my money).  Boy, am I glad I skipped the reviews!! I personally loved the book. The storyline and the connection between the characters (Ana and Christian) was great! There were little things that got on my nerves, the use of the same words over and over again and the \\"inter goddess\\", but those weren't deal breakers for me.  I just finished the third book and I am a little sad it's over.  I'll definately be re-reading this trilogy! Buy it - you won't regret it!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game of solitaire had me glued for hours.  I play it day and night for entertainment. totally deserves five stars.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I've always had a reaction (internal) to seeing KJI's face.  Reading this book brought context to what I had reacted to for years.  The cruelty is profoundly and astoundingly sad.  Shin is an individual with strength, courage and great intelligence.  This is a powerful story of a true hero and a true human.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I received this headphones and they arrived in good condition. They work as expected and I'm satisfied with them.  I use them for jogging and hiking for which they are appropriate.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Even though different from the first two books, still very interesting and got to know the characters better.  More violent and dark than the previous ones.  Excellent twists and not always knowing which character to trust.  Also was never sure who was going to survive.  Ending did not seem rushed and was satisfying.  Excellent end to an excellent trilogy!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|i love it. couldnt go without it... if i had to buy it i would... if you dont have it you should...
0345803485|1.0|I wish there was a way to give this book series \\"0\\" as a ranking! I bought all three, based on friends' recommendations.  Too bad I didn't read the reviews on Amazon.  Started to read the first book...couldn't believe the trival! Lousy plot! Lousy sex scenes. Started laughing hysterically when every time she bit her lip, he became aroused...orgasms the second time they have sex? Even right after she loses her virginity that night to him? C'mon!  Contrived, unimaginative...downright boring and silly. I've read many good erotic romantic books - this series appears to be the pits of them all. Threw down the first book midway through (and won't go to the second or third book).  Came to the stark realization that I had wasted a few precious hours of life chasing the hype this series has been given by the women who are raving over it. If this series is spicing up love lives as many women are swearing to, all I can say is - \\"huh?\\"
B005K17RU0|3.0|its hard to find the forecasted temp for the day, it  only shows the current temp and conditions. I can see that out of my window! I want to know how to dress for the day.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|not right no one dose any thing you don't see people it dosent. make sense its really really stupid takes forever to load and its hard to exit out of good idea bad exicution an update and some sense would make this review a lot higher it has poteintal really dose but not now
B002LB13SE|3.0|Once again baffled by some reviewers...  This movie is worth a look see if you saw the original 70's movie, which was one of the worst wastes of time I've ever spent in front of the tv.<br /><br />This movie is way better than that one, although I'm glad I rented it.  There's no bumbling sheriff in this one with hokey music to confuse audiences as to which genre the movie is.<br /><br />There is actually somewhat satisfying revenge in this one and the acting is way better.<br /><br />I don't want to give any spoilers, but there were also vast improvements from the shoddy story of the original.<br /><br />I'm not sure why it was unrated; there was very little nudity and the rape scene, although portrayed realistically, was pretty tame compared to others I've seen.  The gore wasn't anything too outlandish.  It seems something was left out even though this says unrated version.<br /><br />Again, this is worth a rent if you saw the original 70's version and you want to take a chance to see if it was improved upon.  If you haven't seen the original, there's not much to appreciate here besides a lackluster tale of criminality and revenge.
B005LAIGWS|1.0|This movie was beyond terrible if it wasn't for having my son with me at the theater I would've have walked out about quarter of the way through.  I can't even begiin to describe how upset I was watching this film.  I've enjoyed reading the comics since i was still in school and still find time to read the graphic novels.  I thought the first was bad until I watched this.  This one makes the first look like an oscar nomination.  That is not how I remember the spirit of vengence coming about.  This bike was another nightmare..The first bike fit the rider, the second one a Yamaha V Max looks like the found it in a burned out cycle shop and added red led lights for this.  This is one movie IF I do get this for my marvel collection it will be outta the 5 dollar bin at walmart or a pawn shop
B000R9RGF6|2.0|It's likely that I saw the label \\"minimalist\\" applied to Mr Einaudi & that's what led me to this CD. He is, from what I read, a successful & prolific composer & pianist but this is the first time I've heard him. This doesn't sound minimalist to me, nor does it belong in the classical genre. It could be categorized as \\"easy-listening\\" music: relaxing (to those who like this sort of thing) but shallow & with nothing interesting or inventive going on musically. It's well-done so I could readily recommend it to folks who like Yanni & Kenny G.
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put these books down and I am so upset that it has ended.  This book is pure fantasy, love, lust, action, drama, and hot sex!  I have my family and friends into this book and they all agree and they too can not put it down.  My only disappointment is, there is not a book four, five, six....
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Mark Cuban never disappoints.  This book is a must read for any business owner or entrepreneur!  It is a concise, quick read, yet full of great information, advice and motivation.  Spend the few dollars on this book, you'll make it back quickly when you implement his advice.
0345803485|4.0|This is my first book of this genre.  Normally I am a James Patterson (Alex Cross) kind of reader.  Overall fun escapism.<br /><br />As I read and found out I wanted more for Ana....and usually could identify the writing with her character, expect for a few \\"error\\" that kept bring me back to EL James as the British writer ....and not the words/thoughts of the \\"character\\" Ana.  It's an enticing story, but there are some things like \\"have a shower\\" and \\"ring the phone\\" that do not translate well as to how Americans speak. (We \\"take a shower\\" and \\"call someone on the phone\\"....you get my drift.)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|people i have just read the book and it is so freaking awesome. the ending is so sad!!!!!!!<br />makes me want to read the next book.<br />by the way spoiler, pecabeth never has a fight or even threatens to break up. the next book is called<br />house of hades
B004SGWYW4|5.0|This anime blew me out of my socks.  I have never seen a zombie flick match the mastery of this anime series.  The characters are intense, the drama is top notch, the imagery is very haunting - this was made prior to the 9.3 earthquake(!) The musical score is... just wow!  Yes, there is fan-service, and the inuendo is never ending... however, I have this in my collection and it is in the \\"Masterpieces\\" section.<br />the downer is that with the success of season one, and the cult following it has,.. will there EVER be a second season, and the conclusion of the Manga turned anime series?  The way things are going I may be really old before such a thing happens!!!... please if you are holding your breath - breathe! Because we may have to count this and the OAV (that should be released soon to the U.S.) as the only examples we have of the masterpiece of zombie films we have called, HOTD.  But we can only hope...
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It Has Been Awhile since the Hype, Expectations and Delivery of a Product has met the Quality Worthy of Our Eyes and Hearts. And to think it was Disney really blows my socks off. Great Job Disney and Crew. You/We Deserve It. Thank You. Now for the Announced Sequel, when it delivers, Hog Heaven will never be so Nice.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|addicting! just go to options to get out. other than that its great. go ahead. and playmate I recommend. it
B007PKOKTK|3.0|Movie was pretty corny but overall ok. The kids aged 4,5, and 7 liked it enough to watch it again the next morning!
0307951529|5.0|This book isn't fluff, hype, or empty motivation. It's got real examples of real people who made the transition to successful entrepreneur.<br /><br />It's an inspiring read for sure, but more importantly, it has solid tactics for how you can get started, like a 39 step(!) product launch checklist. It's that kind of detail that gets you to think, \\"hey, maybe I can do this...\\"<br />What Chris does forcefully, but in a comforting way, is call your bluff. If you think you need a million dollars to start a business this book will prove you wrong.<br /><br />If you want a roadmap for building a business, and someone to obliterate all your excuses that are preventing you from getting started today, this is it.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Grabbed this book after searching for something to read for motivation and was pleasantly surprised. I expected the book to be a lot about form and very instructional but it is more of a story with bits of advice and motivation sprinkled through it, as well an enjoyable read that will have you wanting to run out the door (even if your reading it at midnight!).<br /><br />I didn't enjoy running before reading this and saw it as a real chore. Now I focus on the enjoyment of running. Ive stopped running with an iPod, stopped measuring runs, stopped recording runs and enjoy it more than ever before. Just run til your not enjoying it anymore. Cant be more simple that.<br /><br />The barefoot/minimal/naturalist running technique (or whatever you want to call it) actually feels a lot more natural once you get used to it, but be prepared for sore calves for a while. I would highly recommend the Merrell barefoot shoes and the matching App. Also be prepared for a weird fetish you will develop of watching other runners foot strikes.
B0042EJD8A|1.0|Really poorly done. This is for people who know nothing about anything and will believe anything. Doesn't even go into detail about the process. A total smear job.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Well, the title says it all. This is a professionally-produced work of genius. Gameplay is simple and rewarding, and it just looks awesome. Worth a buck!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great and challenging game that I love to play.I bet many love this game too,but I love it more then anyone.
B006VUPCEM|5.0|Kiske + Hansen = Great<br />The other band members are also great musicians.<br />Can't wait to get their tour dates and looking forward to future records.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|In this post I will be reviewing The Forever Girl: Sophia's Journey by Rebecca Hamilton, an urban fantasy novel that is bringing \\"New Adult\\" to the fore. Not only is it an excellent story just because the pace is so exquisite, it is actually cutting-edge in terms of the content that it tackles.<br /><br />The book follows the first-person account of Sophia, an engaging female protagonist that certainly appeals to the average reader of any age, really. In her early 20's, she is definitely too worldly to be considered a YA protagonist, but not so experienced so as to be considered an adult protagonist, letting her fall right in the middle. Why am I making such a big deal about this? Firstly, I am in my early 20's and my generation is startlingly underrepresented in popular fiction and, not surprisingly, misrepresented in much literary fiction. It was definitely refreshing to see that there is a new brand of literature that is actively seeking to create protagonists (likable ones at that) out of my generation that is continually labelled as a tech-dependent and lazy. Furthermore, it is also on the cutting edge of contemporary fiction because it is portraying a strong female protagonist in an action-packed story. It is one thing to write very cerebral, symbolic stories that have an implicit amount of female heroism. It is quite another feat to write a climactic, fast-paced, speculative fiction novel with a female as the consummate hero. So, kudos to Rebecca Hamilton for tackling this.<br /><br />As you can tell, this story is principally driven by character and I am a firm believer that most good fiction is character-driven. However, I must say that the plot itself was quite exhilarating in of itself. The fact that the diction was so carefully chosen to enhance the story as well as make it accessible is just a credit to the author. If I could use one word to describe the book itself in terms of craft, I would have to say it would unquestionably be \\"balanced\\".<br /><br />Although this term may be a little unorthodox in terms of describing a story, I think that the term is certainly à propos and applies to the aspects of background information, diction, and pace related to the action at hand.<br /><br />I commend Hamilton for her creation of her own mythos within a modern setting and being able to adapt various mythologies and dogmatic extrapolations of both elemental reverence and Wicca. It is clear that a tremendous amount of research went into the book. However, rather than inundate the reader with a deluge of Wicca ritual specifics and unnecessary detail, she (the author) carefully balances the necessity of understanding historical / dogmatic context with the need to keep pace with the action. A lot of writers would be all-too-eager to present all their hard work and research in a huge array, potentially extending the novel by hundreds of completely erroneous pages. Let's be honest, Rebecca Hamilton clearly knows her readers and absolutely crafts the story and the ambient supernatural universe accordingly.<br /><br />The other aspect I mentioned was diction. Hamilton's command of language is very evident, but it is not over-the-top. I love that she is able to string words together that make the story both elevated and accessible to a wide range of readers. Through a combination of concrete nouns and unique, vivid verbs, the overall syntax of the work is incredibly cohesive that helps bring the speculative nature of the book to life to even the most casual of urban fantasy fans.<br /><br />Now, I don't want to spoil too much of the plot because I want everyone to read this one for themselves and keep up with the series as they are released. But, I will say that if you are tired of reading speculative fiction that doesn't really capture the nature of what we call \\"monsters\\" and \\"witches\\", then you might want to pick up a copy, available in paperback and on Amazon Kindle. In a nutshell, this was a phenomenal read and it kept me engaged throughout the work - well written, perfectly paced, and Sophia brought me along with her the entire time. The Forever Girl is a great synthesis of genres and features a blood-pounding-in-your-ears type of climax that will absolutely leave you with a craving for more Rhinoceros transformations infused with a Cruor-killing weapon (just saying...).
B000E33W1C|1.0|I received the DVD all wrapped and looking good inside out, but I CANNOT PLAY IT BACK in any player, old and new, Blu-ray or not, PC or laptop.Can I send it back ? Thanks.
159102594X|5.0|Best fantasy trilogy ever and I'm not just saying that because there's no stupid songs...  Everyone I have ever recommended this to has loved it and if you don't like it, you probably have no sense of humor and should probably just switch to reading pre-teen novels stolen from a famous Japanese book.
B0070W75RW|4.0|If you've liked Overkill in he past then you will not be disappointed with Electric Age. The Thrash veterans show the world how it's done w/ another well crafted album sticking to their tried and true style. The only thing i was a little less happy w/ was the included dvd which contained the short studio footage and commentary I had already seen on youtube. Would've been better had they waited till they had shot a video or two for tunes off the album or maybe some footage of the Ironbound tour. Otherwise a very strong album for the original Jersey Crew!
0307592731|2.0|Good trail-hiking narratives can be wonderful, and I've read and enjoyed several. When I read the enthusiastic review of \\"Wild\\" in The Week magazine, it sounded so good that I did what I rarely let myself do, bought a new hardcover book. My budget and my available time for reading are both awfully small, and I'm sorry that I spent both money and time on this book. The author may well have received insight and peace of mind from her journey, and that's great for her. But as a trail book, it was both annoying and frustrating; annoying for the endless navel-gazing and self pity and rehashing of her personal problems, and frustrating because the Pacific Crest Trail has always sounded fascinating to me, and I learned almost nothing about it in this account. The author's lack of forethought and preparation for such a major hike is astonishing, her lack of concern for the pristine areas through which she moved is appalling. I kept reading in part out of sheer stubbornness (dammit, I paid for it, I'm going to read it!) and in part for the rare crumbs of insight into what the trail is like. If you want to read a self-absorbed young woman's efforts to exorcise her inner demons, you might like it. If you want to read a good, well-written, thoughtful trail book, you'd do well to look elsewhere.
B0019IB0II|4.0|Jill Bolte Taylor offers a fascinating look from the inside out about what a patient experiences from the moment a stroke occurs.  Some points are repeated more than necessary throughout the book, but it is definitely an interesting read for anyone who thinks about how the brain relearns after a trauma.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Great read, hard to put down.  The characters were real, and likable. Would definitely recommend to friends.  It was a coming of age mixed in with romance and mystery.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I love this watch! There are a lot of good functions and the GPS is wonderful. It works very well. I recomend it!
B000A6T262|5.0|Finally spent the money to buy a full set because we had a pieced together sort of pirated set from my brother.  Now all the DVD's work and my daughter has turned into a Trekky!  Thank you for the great price!

B003BWERF8|5.0|This is the coolest item ever!  I also bought the wireless headset to go with.  Couldn't seem to keep earbuds in my ears. Kept getting them caught on anything and nothing at all, very frusrating. Once I went wireless, you can do any activity with them.  They are louder also. Love that.  Bought the watch that the ipod fits into and it's a great set up.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I use this on my benchmade auto and other similar knives and for about 20 seconds of sharpening... This will do it, it might take a little longer with knives that were first used with this sharpener to get the angle of the blade to the angle of the sharpener but after that a few swipes.. blade is new, not razor sharp.. but good enough to have the blade do its job with ease.. everyone I showed this to want one bad.. best thing is that its cheap and works great.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|i like this game, but it gets a little boring after a while.....because you dont have enough coins to unlock a new game....otherwise it is pretty good.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|Okay, okay I will freely confess that as a boy I did not, I steadfastly did not, read a girls' book, Charlotte Bronte's  Jane Eyre. And I did not, as we live a confessional age, read her sisters' books or even, damned to hell, Jane Austen's stuff. And you would not have either (or at least not have said so publicly) any place near my corner boys society growing up absurd in the 1950s old North Adamsville neighborhood. See you either didn't read, and made a big virtues out of it preferring chasing cars and girls, or for those like my corner boy, Frankie Larkin, and me, who did we read mad Jack Keroauc, or besotted Scott Fitzgerald, or best of all, the max daddy mad adventurer Ernest Hemingway. Period.<br /><br />Moreover if we didn't read guy novelists then we were crazy (and make that I was crazy) for history books. But not girls' books, no way. Which is a shame in a way because the trials and tribulations of Jane Eyre (and other female characters created by 19th European women writers, and not just women writers either, like the aforementioned Jane Austen) related experiences of class, race and social oppression (intertwined with a little off-hand romance to sell books then, and now, to the female reading public) that resonate with this writer today.<br /><br />So it is something of a gift from the heavens that over the past couple of  decades many of the writers that I did not read, steadfastly did not read in case you forgot, have had their work adapted to the screen. Happily this is true for the film under review. That means that this reviewer gets to, as he has on other occasions, see the story line of the book unfold in order to determine whether he would  decide to read this book after viewing the film.<br /><br />And the judgment? There is now a high bar for British romances set by Ms. Austen, most notably with her Miss Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darby in Pride and Prejudice in the matter of 19th century sensibility. While that standard was not surpassed in this film Ms. Bronte (and the actors here) did give a very decent sense of the oddball (to our eyes), anti-democratic and socially savage way that women, women of no means (or no known means), were shunted off in the backwoods of society.<br /><br />But spunk is a value we can all appreciate and to use a more modern phrase than would be proper in jolly old England back in the day to describe the evolving plot line- a girl has got ot do what a girl has got to do. On that level  this thing is a classic girl (okay woman, Ms. Eyre) meets boy (okay man, Mr. Rochester) story. And, lo and behold, the girl is actually ten times stronger than the boy. And, frankly, twenty times more interesting.  Maybe that is why I, steadfastly, did not read Jane Eyre and the others then.  But will now.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|fun way to relax after a long busy day.<br />Easy to understand.<br />the only frustrating part is the length of time it takes to cook certain foods and sometimes they go bad before you come back if you don't play frequently enough.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I used to bag groceries for a living so it is kind of fun to see it I can get them all to fit in the bag or smashing them is fun too.  Do I have 20 words yet? Or should I just keep rambling on about this game? Ya know it's really stupid that I need 20 words I just wanted to say that this game was fun.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was in a void. I had just finished the George RR Martin song of fire and ice series, finished the hunger game series, finished the Inheritence Cycle series, in short read the majority of the classic sci-fi/fantasy epics available. So I started reading samples. Much to my dissapointment. Then I got to this book. It was absolutely amazing. After the first book I was hooked, I simply cannot wait to see how this story evolves! Please WRITE MORE!!!<br /><br />The author is very talented.  I think the subject of this book is very dark and depressing. But I did not feel like I was reading a dark and depressing story, it was masterfully written.  I was explaining to someone about the book and I said it sounds depressing, but its very well written! (Guess I have to work on my explanations). Seriously though his style of writing I find more enjoyable than George RR Martin and the author has a better understanding of human emotion and life's struggles than I think most of the others do.  It was easy to connect with the characters of the story and become lost in this world. I can't wait to see what else you have for us!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is not the best written book, but it is strangely addictive. I consumed all three books in the series within a week and really wanted to begin all over again.<br />I have never read anything like it before, but I highly recommend others to read the trilogy.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Okay, so this game has NEVER force closed on me ever, so it must be a problem with everyone else's Kindle Fires.  This game is the best game imaginable, hands down.  It's so addicting I play it all day long, and I can't stop playing it until my Kindle dies.  I got this game for free, hooray, because they had a deal on it, but if you are planning to get this app for three bucks,  GET IT WITHOUT ANY HESITATIONS!!!!!!!  It is so fun mixing the elements to make new things and I love to see and create the new things that come up when I mix things!  Just believe me - this app is better than the best and won't let you down!
B002UXRGM0|2.0|I am showing this Blue Ray version to my Biology high school students, whose faces of awe are worth watching. The filming is just above any expectations, and in blueray just awesome.  But I hesitate to understand why replacing Oprah Winfrey with Sir D.Attenborough. Sir A's voice is way past his prime, sometimes difficult to understand, and an irritating to the ear (it was so in previous installments of these magnificent BBC productions). Ms. Winfrey, on the other hand, communicates so well the marvels, with clarity and gusto. I am definitely not supporting this over Winfrey's original. And I would prefer any other voice used (e.g., Sigourney Weaver) than DA's.
B005IQZB14|5.0|_Wild_ was a page-turning memoir laced with thoughtful observations and insights.  The writing was often lyrical.<br />Indeed, an excellent memoir.
0345803485|1.0|I am shocked that this book has garnered so much attention.  That is, in itself, a very sad commentary on our society.  This book is written at a 2nd or 3rd grade level and the plot is exactly as you would expect.  The main character's \\"breath hitches\\" about a zillion times in the story.  It'd be great if the author could think of another way to describe that.  But alas, apparently there's no need to be creative as society has just gobbled up this book.<br /><br />I feel dumber for having read this book.  Don't even think of buying it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|With the death of Whitney Houston, Adele is now unchallenged as the greatest living female singer.  This album is a triumph and is great music for the car or the gym.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the games... challenging enough for adults but not too hard for kids. Great way to pass time or keep the kids entertained
1401207529|2.0|There are a couple of issues with this work - it's entertaining, yes, but not really \\"good.\\" It's worth owning for the historical perspective, but there are some really fatal flaws herein.<br /><br />The artwork is fine, I actually don't mind the style. The only part of it that really shows its age is the coloring, but even then it holds up fairly well.<br /><br />It's the writing where this work really falls flat. I wait with baited breath for the day Frank Miller writes an adult female character that isn't a prostitute or stripper. Seriously man, women are more than 50% of the population, they can't all be sex workers. Miller's inability to write female characters is only half the problem - he can't write male characters either. Everybody is a two-dimensional parody that falls into one of three categories:<br /><br />Heroic right-wing reactionary<br />Wimpy liberal who doesn't understand what \\"needs to be done\\" and just gets in the way<br />or<br />Generic gangster/corrupt cop/bad guy<br /><br />That's all the characterization you get. Women are sex objects and men are either manly, hairy-chested Ayn-Randian heroes, effeminate wimps, or evil.<br /><br />Yes, there's some interesting insights into Batman's background and training, but these observations get repeated so often in other publications that there's no real need to read or purchase this volume except out of historical interest or to complete a collection.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I bought this for my new Fire and was disappointed with the way the stand works. It only works for the landscape view, which is a problem for applications that won't shift from portrait. Also, the little groove where the top catches to hold it up is very narrow and would easily slip out, letting the Fire drop back onto the table. I used it for a couple of days and decided to return it for a cover that is a little more sturdy.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I have not seen the movie, but decided to purchase the book.  The book was good and I enjoyed reading it, but not as deep as I expected.  I hope the next one will have deeper story line.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I think overall the game is very fun. My only problem with it is that it won't allow you to visit other friends' villages. You CAN actually exit the game tho unlike everyone else is saying. You have to go to stuff --&gt; options and then the little arrow appears at the bottom. This was kinda hard to figure out tho and I agree the app should make it more obvious. You do have to watch out to make sure you do not buy anything with real money but I think it is obvious when you are about to buy something with cash because it says the USD dollar price rout next to the thing you are trying to buy. Plus if you end up buying it by accident it will say purchasing and load for a while and you can just X out and there will be no purchase. Overall it is a very fun game. I do agree that they try to get you to pay with real money a lot but that is how the company makes a profit. I recommend downloading it but maybe not for younger kids. The app is a lot of fun! :)
B0042J6VUS|5.0|This takes a few minutes to set up (I put it on incorrectly a few times) but once it does, it is well worth it.  Just be aware that this is meant for use on a table or bench-- the legs are somewhat short and only raise the phone about 10 inches off of the surface.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is a great little piece of strangeness.  I really enjoyed it and will keep it around for years to come.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Played this with my son and we both loved it. Just the right amount of challenge to occasionally make us scratch our heads for a few minutes, but nothing too off the wall that we had to seek help. I want to see more great point 'n click adventures on Android! Keep 'em coming, Fire Maple!
B005UG53NS|5.0|Exceeded my expectations!!  I was truly blown away by how artistically creative this movie was.  Very well-portrayed, and the actors all were very believable.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very enjoyable game.  I like the option to deal either a winning or a random hand.  Fun and easy to play.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It's a pretty good game. Just enough to be slightly addicting. Fun to play, fun concept. Is it possible to go back to old waves?
B005STGJDA|5.0|Confession: I did not purchase this to play on a record player, because I don't have one.  As a wall hanging, this looks great.  The colors are rich and it is big enough to make an impact.  Strongly recommend as apartment art!
0385342055|5.0|O.K., so the plot isn't super great, and the impossible situations are, well impossible.  However, I have to say that this book had me laughing out loud about every 4 pages.  For anyone who has children the situations involving Becky and her daughter are SO FUNNY, it is worth reading it just for that.  The dialogue between Beckys parents also had me laughing so hard I had tears running down my face!  As I sat reading this in my living room, I would periodically burst out laughing and my kids and husband would ask me what was so funny.  I even shared some of the book with my husband one night because it was just so funny. Read it for the health benefits of laughter.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|Best movie ever in the history of movies. Cant wait for the rest of the movies to come out. Hoping that it will be soon
0345803485|3.0|First, I want to say that I have respect for those individuals who can write a book.  Some books may not be as interesting as others, but it does take a lot of dedication to create each story.  With that said, this book was a quick read.  I did find it interesting.  However, by the time I got to the end, I was relieved to be done with it.  The characters needed a bit more depth.  The use of the \\"F\\" word was a bit much, but it was within the context of the book.  I will not be reading the follow-up stories.
B004LX0D36|4.0|An amazing book. Mr Darcy and Elizabeths journey is very engrossing even in today's times.. A must read for everyone.
B0036T31YY|1.0|Don't waste your time watching this movie. It goes around and around in circles to no where. This movie tries to do what classics like the Fog did so well but it failed miserably so find something better to do with your time.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|This CD has been the only one in my car for about 4 months.  It is truly the best songs of one of the best bands ever.  They picked the right pieces and arranged them appropriately.
B0053O89WY|5.0|the best show !! i love them<br />i have the rest of the seasons and i just can't stop!!<br />My favourites are Leonard, Sheldon, penny and Amy
B0038P59A0|5.0|I had been wanting to see the movie Sherlock Holmes ever since I first saw previews, but had been unable to until recently. I adore Robert Downey Jr and with Jude Law, this movie was every bit as great as I had hoped! A bit dark at times, and of course unrealistic, but the plot and antics stayed in tune with the many Sherlock Holmes books I have read over the years. Acting was well cast and executed and now I am waiting to see the sequel with wondrous anticipation! Highly recommend!
0938045768|5.0|I for one actually read the book and follow the steps to the \\"T\\" milking every exercise. I have seen a few reviews downing this book but wonder if the ones downing this book skip to the harder techniques and failed; therefore, becoming angry at their failure write crappy reviews to discourage others. The techniques and exercise are for the smart gym rats who know that perfection in strength comes with time and dedication. This book is not for those looking to gain quick results and a pretty boy beach body no no my friend if that's what your looking for then stick with your steroids and Jane Fonda tapes! This book is to develop combat and survival strength that takes time and understanding of kinesiology and body synergy taking the time to master and train the smaller muscles to contribute to the major muscles. I pity those who bought this treasure and became angry at the book because of lack of understanding and not emptying their tea cup to further their enlightenment. All in all this book is for the treasured few who seek to forge their strength within the fires of their own will! I've been a navy corpsman for 6 years and I agree with everything mention in the book in terms of anatomy, and in my six years I have seen everything from herniated discs down to rhabdomyolysis due to poor training techniques and failure to rest when the time is needed. Paul wade is a genus and rather you believe is prison principles or not the man speaks the truth.<br /><br />I recommend this look for anyone with an open mind to what true strength is all about and promise you you will not be disappointed IF! you follow the directions and read this book and not try to rush to the next step just because it looks bad ass and you want to impress your friends if you do you will sadly be sadly disappointed and your pride will be shattered by your own ignorance. This book works and will take you beyond pointless machines and barbells if used correctly I my self currently reign on stage 5 on all exercises displayed in this book and power i never thought I had in Ving tsun, and JKD MA.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|I think this watch is pretty decent and I like it a lot. So you can have a look at it and check more info about it. I think most of the customers will share the same.
B0031RS2HC|2.0|The plot had some potential but was ruined by the laughably unrealistic nature of the main character, jack Reacher. His ability to get everything right all the time was comical. It will be a long time before I'll be able to face another Lee Child novel.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Easy to see from this album why the kid is getting so much attention and tours so much.  His songs are fun and his voice is addictive.
B0061QD7ZM|5.0|IT SHIPPED QUICKLY. I HAVE A 4 YR OLD \\"ADOPTED\\" GRANDDAUGHTER. I REMEMBER WHEN I GREW UP, THIS WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DISNEY MOVIES. A CLASSIC.<br />SHE LOVES IT.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I've had this cooler running on a standard AM2+ board for the past two years.  It has always run quiet and, most importantly, it keeps my processor COOL with a modest overclock.<br /><br />My only complaint about this product is that it requires mounting directly to the motherboard with its own faceplate.  This requires you to completely remove your motherboard from your case in order to attach it.  This would not be a problem with a new build, though!<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this cooler!  It has served me well and I hopefully will use it in many builds and upgrades in the future.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this product. I take my Kindle everywhere. While I am working out I play solitare. It is a great way to pass the time while riding the exercise bike. I am so thankful for this purchase.
B002ZG9788|5.0|I loved 300, so it was no surprise that I loved Clash of the Titans. It looks great on bluray and the action was cool. The CGI was really well done, can't comment on the 3d version cause I have read that out really sucked so I didn't even bother with it. Great all around fighting flick, check it out and sit back and enjoy!
B004OC07GM|5.0|a really great book on management, maybe the best i've ever read. it is the first time that someone enters the process of managing a company\product in such a deep way
1451648537|5.0|This book is very revealing and well written.  It is a good blend of chronological and topical, so that you can understand Jobs' life and process while also learning a lot about changes in technology over the past few decades.  It is both a biography and a cultural exploration.
B006J2QW3M|5.0|AWESOME...IT DID TAKE A WHILE TO GET IT, AS IT WAS PRODUCED IN JAPAN.I HAVE EVERYTHING THEY HAVE EVER DONE. THEY ARE SUCH A FABULOUS GROUP....HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|def would get this. keeps you busy and they are a bit challenging so it keeps you going and going
B005LAIGSM|3.0|ok... Just let me say the movie doesn't start off bad... They could have made this movie better. The Movie has some interesting loops, but highly predictable. THE ENDING WAS TERRIBLE!!!!!!! I AM NOT SPOILING ANYTHING, BUT THEY NEVER SHOWED SO MANY THINGS! WHAT ABOUT HIS MUSIC CAREER? WHAT HAPPENED?! WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY TRIED TO LIVE THEIR NEW LIFESTYLE?<br /><br />If you want to watch an AMAZING movie, buy or rent 50 first dates. This movie will have you crying laughing and crying sadly.<br />It has the same basic plot but in 50 first dates there are some minor differences, involving him trying to make her fall in love with him everyday. YOU WILL LOVE IT IT IS SET IN HAWAII.<br /><br />if u are interested here is the plot<br /><br />Henry Roth is a man afraid of commitment up until he meets the beautiful Lucy. They hit it off and Henry think he's finally found the girl of his dreams, until he discovers she has short-term memory loss and forgets him the very next day.
B005IZLPME|5.0|This is a awesome movie. My two year old boy loves Captain America and he has watched this movie over and over and never gets tired of it. The action was great and there were some pretty funny parts mixed in to. All around great movie, can't wait to see The Avengers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very easy to play. I love being able to play any where I go. good format. easy to understand and play.
B007SGM084|1.0|STOP COM-PLAINING ABOUT THE PRICE.  YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FREE FROM YOUR LIBRARY. SO FAR I AM HOOKED ONTHE FIRST BOOK. AS I CONTINUED READING IT WAS SO FAR OUT THERE I HAD TO STOP READING.  BECAME TOOO DEMEANING TO YOUNG  WOMEN. THE FEMALE CHARACTER TOO YOUNG, AN OLDER WOMEN MAYBE. APPARENTLY THE BOOK DID NOT REACH MY EXPECTATIONS. TOO MANY GOOD OR WELL WRITTEN BOOKD TO WASTE TIME ON THIS ONE.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|clips on easily and offer a high level of protection ,but the screen protector is easy to scratch and the aplicator is too hard to not scratch the protector at half the price of costco
B003O86FMW|5.0|It has a bird on it, so it must be art - right?  All kidding aside, read as quickly as the first and is a great premise for a movie, I am sure!
B000002HJR|5.0|This album is boring at first listen but it's amazing after the third or fourth listen. I must say that I miss Superjoint Ritual though. Am I the only one who's seen the hidden artwork on the back of the first Superjoint cd case? Hint: U gotta take a specific drug to see it...there's some crazy stuff there though.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|This was the first 3D movie we watched at home and let me tell you we were not disappointed. The snow looks like it is coming down right in your house. Just unbelievable. This is one of the better 3d movies available. Check it out you wont be disappointed. Oh yeah there are a couple scares in it to. Enjoy!
0446572993|5.0|Great!!!  Fast service and good price. I will order again, I like their service and easy ordering system. I trust them to ship what I order.
B002GHHHKQ|1.0|BUYER BEWARE ! The DVD I got was not the movie.It was a commentary about the movie ,not the actual movie. therefor I felt I was ripped off . I think the movie was great and I wonted to add it to my collection. So take heed and be sure to read the product description and get what you're paying for.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved the book and am looking forward to reading the 3rd book.  I found it very interesting and admired the characters in this book especially their intelligence.  I plan on reading it again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely loved this series. The first few chapters of the first book were slow but after chapter 5 I couldn't put any of the books down. I read all 3 books in a week and a half!!!! Was sad to finish and not have any more of 50 Shades!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is awesome. 101 mini games in 1 app for free! The game is worth more than free.
B007M45PMU|5.0|This is one of those bands that I will have in my head for weeks and don't mind it a bit.  The moment I play the album, my mood is immediately uplifted.  I am happy to say I saw them at the Casbah a month ago and they came down to the floor and played and I got to pat them on the back, becuase I know that within a year, I will be fighting huge crowds just to get anywhere near the huge stages they will be playing on.  They are band you just want to share with others.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its has different games but you have to complete so many to unlock more games. its good cause its like all in one
B00003JRCQ|3.0|I love the book, so I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  The problem with this movie is that none of the emotions from the book translated to the movie.  I didn't sense any chemistry between Wentworth and Anne and even when they finally got together at the end, I barely cared.
B00466HN6S|1.0|Not only was this movie horrible, but they stoop to a very low level when the Easter bunny visits the Playboy Mansion! They are brand marketing pornography to children in this tactless film.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely loved this series. The first few chapters of the first book were slow but after chapter 5 I couldn't put any of the books down. I read all 3 books in a week and a half!!!! Was sad to finish and not have any more of 50 Shades!!!
0345803493|3.0|The second installment in E.L. James' \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy takes a more melodramatic and emotionally bipolar delve into the worlds of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele.  These nymphomaniacs will have their relationship tested by a crazed ex-lover, a sexually inappropriate (and not in that good way!) boss, a shocking helicopter crash, and and their seemingly incompatible lifestyles; but don't fret, they will still manage to find enough time in their days to do the horizontal mambo at least fifteen times.  Is this realistic?  Absolutely not.  Are you going to want to smack the characters and their author?  Probably.  James' elementary style shows little improvement, and her editor still needs to be (non-sexually) beaten.  Is \\"Darker\\" kinky enough to live up to the original?  Mmm, perhaps a little less so than the original installment, but you'll still have the pleasure of reading about spreader bars, butt plugs, and ball gags . . . OH MY!  So break out your Wartenberg pinwheels and get to it, kids!
B005HSL626|5.0|Good game. It has got realistic physics and great graphics. It is a little like AB in the way it is fun at first but then out of no where you are addicted. Wish it had the fruit you swipe at the end of arcade mode but it is pretty good. It is free so it makes up for it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I fell in love with the characters in this book!! A unique story that was so well written.  I finished it in a day and then bought the sequel and finished it in a night!
0978607651|4.0|I'm a huge Charles Harper fan.  I bought a number of his serigraphs while I was living in Cincinnati and was sorry to learn that he passed away several years ago.  I appreciated the simplicity of his art, and the excellent way in which he captured the humor of the natural world.  Always got a \\"kick\\" out of the blurbs he attached to his various pieces of artwork.<br /><br />I especially enjoy the book as there were a number of pictures that I had never seen before.  The only criticism I have is that I wish it had been printed on a higher grade of paper.  It didn't do justice to the color palate of the plates that were reproduced.  Other than that, it was a very comprehensive product.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|[[ASIN:B007RWGYHM Tickle Your Amygdala]] Although I found this book somewhat interesting, a book that I found much more enjoyable is Neil Slade's >>>Tickle Your Amygdala, which I give five stars all around. If I had a choice between the two, I'd Tickle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger games was addicting. I read it in one day. the plot had a few cliched moments but overall it was incredible.

0062060562|4.0|This book is fantastic. My only negative would be that the book did start to drag in the middle and I found myself skimming the pages but the novel really picks up at the end. Their is a huge twist at the end that kept me up because I had to find out what happens. Great book - would recommend to anyone!
0385736002|5.0|It is my favorite book, it is exciting, well written and it has a lot of battles which I like.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is my favorite Hidden Object game out of the 15-20 that I have played.  Fire Maple Games seem to be my favorite designer... I can't wait until they come out with another game.  :)  (hint, hint)<br /><br />This game makes some of the other Hidden Object games look like a joke!  The entire package here is amazing.  Some apps charge $4.99 for games that are half this good!!
B0058SNI58|5.0|these shoes are amazing....i could wear these all day without my feet hurting.....these are a must.....after i bought them 2 of my friends bought them because they tried them on and felt the same way about them
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I've heard of the concept of the five love languages for many years. It's only now that I am reading the book. And now I finally understand why this concept has made such a big impact on our culture. Gary Chapman has eloquently explained the basic needs of man in the five love languages.
B001F6TXME|5.0|great product! the shipping was fast as well. i ordered on friday and got it the tuesday after, definitely worth the price. the device works just like the shutter button on your camera, it also has a feature in which you can slide it up to hold, so it will take multiple shots for you without even having to hold the button yourself. i only wish the cord was a bit longer so it were better for self portraits, that being my main purpose of getting it. but great product, price, and shipping. you won't be disappointed. i use this with my nikon D3100<br />!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I like this game lot but its full of bugs and needs a update. all my timers are reset to 500 hrs after I restarted my kindle fire when the app crashed.
B001F6TXME|4.0|This useful product let me take pictures without be near the camera but the truth is that the cable isn't long enough. The remote works very good, but i tried to do some pictures of me with a 50mm lens and i coudn't do it because the cable is too short. I know that there is a wireless remote but it doesn't compatible with my camera.
B001E45XT4|2.0|There were lots of good reviews, so I got these headphones. Turns out they don't work with a Mac (Macbook). They are also kinda tight if you have a big head.
B007PS0X0W|2.0|Short, boring movie with little plot - like a really long trailer for a better movie.  If you are looking for some Underworld action, I suggest you just watch one of the earlier versions.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Either Amazon or pop cap is slacking by not updating this app, the new version with the Zen garden is in the play store and I really want to take advantage of that
B004JZBGWI|5.0|good job I like it the colors are great five stars definatly. now I remember things better and I like to make lists. its awesome!!!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was uncetain if I would enjoy this book.  I am in my 60's and it had been touted as a young readers book.  Once I got started I could not put it down and found myself totally into the characters.  fully enjoyed the book and could not wait to start the 2nd.<br /><br />Ssigler
0545091020|5.0|I resisted the Hunger Games for quite a while just because it was so insanely popular.  Finally, I broke down and bought an audiobook copy.  Now I understand why it is so popular!<br /><br />The story is unusual, character-driven, action-packed, and written in a style so direct and clear it comes across as intense as the characters and circumstances it describes.  The storyline is often grim but interspersed with flashes of humor.  My 12 year old son loved this book and the rest of the trilogy, even though the main character is a girl.<br /><br />Finally, I enjoyed the voice of the actress who read the book aloud.  When looking to buy the audiobooks for the next two stories, I ran across a number of reviews that criticized the reader of those books - said she was unsuitable, too old for Katness, didn't make her voice masculine enough for the male characters, etc.  I rushed to see if the publishers had changed the reading voice - and it was the same actress!  I think she does a great job, her voice is compelling and not quite smooth, gets across the occasional harshness of the characters and the story.  I think some people not familiar with being read aloud to, were perhaps expecting an audiobook to sound more like a play?  That's the only reason I can come up with for understanding the point of view of those reviews.<br /><br />Since then I have listened to both Catching Fire and Mockingjay on audiobook, loved the stories and how they were read aloud.  The books are great, and particularly suited to listening to, in the car or otherwise.<br /><br />I highly recommend the audiobooks, and these books in any media, for kids maybe 11 and up, and for adults as well.
0307951529|5.0|I was a $100 startup. Or pretty close to it, since back in 1996 I was talking with a lawyer friend who idly suggested I might want to register a Limited Liability Company to cover my media production work.<br /><br />I went online. I believe it was right around $100 to register an LLC. I called back my lawyer friend. \\"Um...now what?\\" I asked.<br /><br />His response was: \\"You...did...what?\\" Apparently there was a bit more planning that should have been done.<br /><br />This book is the blueprint I needed then. I was expecting to enjoy it, since I'm (admittedly) a fan of Chris' from way back. \\"Art of NonConformity\\" was a great boost for my already-unconventional life back when I needed it, but it was more of a manifesto than a blueprint. $100 Startup, on the other hand, is the opposite: it pretty much assumes that you've decided to make the leap, and then proceeds to give you detailed templates, exercises, and plans to make it happen.<br /><br />This isn't to say it makes it easy, or guaranteed. What he does is look at what has worked in the past, and distilled it into some simple worksheets, questions, and strategic planning methods that have both immediate and long-term benefits.<br /><br />It's also not only for \\"startups\\". As I mentioned, I've had my own business now for well over a decade, but there are definite changes that I've gleaned from this book that I can see will benefit my business, both in media and in my newest venture, [...].<br /><br />Frankly, even if you have no intention of starting your own business, I'd recommend you put this into a glass cabinet labeled \\"IN CASE OF LAYOFF, BREAK GLASS.\\" A lot of the case studies - the really successful ones - were born not of desire but of necessity. Having this book as a \\"safety net\\" in an uncertain employment world would be a very, very wise move.<br /><br />Good luck!
B005FMZX9Q|3.0|The watch looks very nice. I was a little dissapointed that the strap has broken after only owning it for about 3 weeks.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app. I did have Sketch With Friends, but this is a much better version of basically the same thing. Only thing I'd change is I wish they had a way to report players. I haven't seen anyone being inappropriate but there is an issue with people writing the word you're supposed to guess, just to get easy coins. That's no fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has all diffent kinds of games that can entertain us also it can let us do someting that's why u should play it
B000F3UAFC|2.0|This could have been a wonderful movie to watch over and over again.  I loved the setting, the costumes, the atmosphere, and the script was fine as a stand alone as long as one didn't try to make an Oscar Wilde piece out of it.  I watched it twice to enjoy the scenery and costumes, but it was painful watching Helen Hunt and Scarlett Johansson since they are so very badly miscast. Helen Hunt looked lovely, but had no depth, no charm, no seductiveness and it was difficult imagining her being sought after, especially by the brilliant Tom Wilkinson.  Scarlette Johansson was mistaking looking vacuous with looking naive and was also too voluptious to play a young socialite of the period.  I had to try to imagine Michelle Pfeiffer as Mrs. Erlynne and perhaps Kate Bosworth as Mrs. Windemere and could then appreciate everything else that went into the making of this movie.  What astounds me is why no one noticed during filming that the two actresses were so wrong for the parts?  Tom Wilkinson saved the day and the movie, but, though he made a good effort to charm Mrs. Erlynne, I could see no spark between them certainly not from her side.  What a waste of what could have been a lovely movie.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|Everything has already been said so I will try to keep this short.<br /><br />Aside from the whole \\"remotely controlling an avatar\\" thing, there is very little originality in this film. And even THAT is pretty unoriginal: the comic series \\"Surrogates\\" did it recently before (and had a movie come out the same year as Avatar), and similar sci-fi instances of this are not hard to come by.<br /><br />The whole plot was basically ripped off from \\"Dances with Wolves\\"...the further on the movie got, the more blatant it became.<br /><br />Even the MUSIC is unoriginal. The composer was long-time Cameron collaborator James Horner, who seems to have seen it fit to rip-off his own work on other films. Off the top of my head two examples stand out: towards the middle/end of the film, there is some music that is an almost direct copy of some stuff from \\"Aliens\\". Then towards the end, he flat out rips off his own theme from the film \\"Glory\\".<br /><br />While it's entertaining for sure, everything about this film screams \\"derivative\\".
B007PTJOV0|5.0|so worth it even if it wasn't free!<br />I only wish there were more levels!<br />it reminds me of super mario game&hellip;so if you like those you will love this game
B007PTJOV0|5.0|a lot like old time Mario bros.  I love it I could play it for hours. its simple while still being entertaining.
B000AYQNYI|5.0|a great sacd version of the original.the surround sound mix is exceptional.i would recommend it to anyone wanting to hear a great album in surround version.
B00127RAJY|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me when I will get a DVD, master it and think well nothing else will be hard, then I order another DVD and wow it is hard. This DVD is not for getting a six-pack, its not for getting huge muscles, its for burning calories and YES IT DOES, I have been exercising moderately for a good long while and this DVD on level 1 does make me sweat a good bit, I like it, she is not rude or nasty and this is very effective. Doing this is a little hard on the knees but with taking care of them and doing proper stretching you will get over that issue really quickly.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a fun build a city type game. there is plenty of coins to be earned and collections tobe gathered
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a great game and very time consuming and has many great challenging games. this game makes you want to play it all the time
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. I organize my whole life with it. I have it synced up to my laptop, my desktop, my Kindle, and my Droid phone. I use it everywhere. I have a separate notebook for every project at work, every project at home, every random interest. It's great!
B00007FOMP|5.0|This is going to be my second Marvin Gaye's What's going on CD.  This album is so contemporary, even though the wars have changed, we are still dealing with the issues of war today (2012).  Unemployment and taxes are still matters we are discussing today (2012).  This album is decades old and the issues are still the same.  This CD is a classic, it will never be obsolete.  The more things change, the more they remain the same.  What's going on?!
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|if you could make it to where I could install it id be very happyi want a refund unless there are true plans to fix this cause with nothing installed I still need an extra 1.3gigs like really I love gameloft but sorry very disappointed
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Pretty easy for me to use. If it had an option to flip between two passages without reentering it that would be helpful.
B004XWLN20|3.0|I started watching this show based on a recommendation from a friend of mine starting with season 5. I went back and watched all the previous seasons of the show. I found the show to be interesting enough. The special effects are pretty good for a TV show. I always felt that the show was rather sappy. The dialog was alright but after a while it can get on your nerves. When I would record the show, I would sometimes skim through the dialog. Just like the original Batman movies, the villains were more interesting at times. I enjoyed the limited battles but as the series progressed, they tried to up the stakes as well as the battles. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.<br />I thought the series did a good job with the season ending episodes but after season 7, I started to really loose interest in the show. It really wasn't getting any better. I always hoped that some new blood would change the overall feel and tone of the show but that never did happen. The way the show always worked was they would introduce a villain in the first episode and then Clark would beat him in the final episode but with an added cliff hanger to get you to come back and watch the next season. I felt that season 8, 9, and 10 were all disappointments in the end. Even in the final episode of the series, he beat the enemy far too easily. To not give too much away, it all centered on him being able to fly and him taking on the mantel of Superman. Overall, I was very disappointed.<br />Don't buy this show on DVD. Just watch random episodes when you're bored.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|This movie has a lot of heart and the artistry of the animation is first-rate. There's something  more human or fluid to hand generated animation.This is a great film for kids and the kid in all of us.
B002T8KTMU|5.0|I was sorry to see this series was cancelled. I thought it was very good and enjoyed it. It was better than the final season of Atlantis(though pretty much anything including cheezy tv commercials are more entertaining than the last season of Atlantis).<br /><br />I would have liked to see a better connection of stories though, but it was still an entertaining series even for those who may not have been into SG1 but still like scifi.
B003XE1D9W|5.0|I ended up buying 3 of this type of croc!  They are so comfy, and the colors terrific.  They work well in my care-giving job.
B005LAIGLE|2.0|This movie is cheezy and fake,  definately not worth buying,  the plot doesn't flow together well and the movie comes across really unrealistic.  Fear was one of Mark Whalbergs better movies.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|This is a fun movie and the musical numbers are pretty cool. It's worth it. Stockard Channing's Rizzo is a standout.
0345803485|3.0|This series came highly recommended, and I was extremely excited to read it. The story line kept me interested enough to read it through, it gets better about mid way, however is completely unrealistic. I enjoy a book I can feel like I'm a part of, and this was just so off the wall. Unfortunately, the \\"erotic\\" parts left something to be desired. They were brief and poorly executed. You can tell this is the authors first publication, she could have done with a thesaurus and better editors. The number of times the words \\"murmur\\" and \\"dryly\\" are used actually became distracting to the point I was counting them.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it. it reminders of playing the old school Mario brothers. cant wait to bkeep playing to get to more levels
0345803485|5.0|i purchased these books for my friends who I had been bragging to forever about reading this book!!  They all loved it and I think I might read them again!!!  Great read, couldn't put it down!!  Must have for every woman!!
B001HM1PFO|5.0|This movie is still a hoot and still presses the social envelope of being oneself - equality that's still pertinent decades after its making. This Blu-Ray is a good buy.
0307951529|5.0|I loved Chris' first book, The Art of Nonconformity, so I was really excited to get my hands on a copy of The $100 Startup, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />As someone who has maybe a teeeeensy problem with organizing my thoughts so I can press forward with starting my own business, it was great to have all this information in one place (extremely well organized), with some amazing anecdotes from people who have already \\"been there, done that\\" to motivate me.  In fact, I found the case studies to be the most educational for me.<br /><br />I've been stuck on having a \\"location\\" for a while now, but after reading this, I can see that it would be most beneficial for me to build up my business online first (and with far less risk!)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so hard to. beat thee games and to get more. would be much more fun if it was just a little easier.
B007Z9RAX4|2.0|Gina's acting was good but the movie itself was terrible. Atmosphere felt like a B movie at best. Action scenes are few and far between; weak dialogue and the movie plot barely held my interest. Would not recommend.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I purchased this because I hate shadow buddies and the harsh flash light. This flash gives a soft lighting, is lightweight, and easy to use.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok but only when you're really board. like say I'm in a waiting room I'd probably take it out and play.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|This product was one of the BEST deals I have found to the most amazing package of this collectible Classic movie.  With all the memorabilia, lobby cards, a small version of Robbie the Robot, and an additional movie included of the \\"Invisible Boy\\" featuring Robbie, I thought I'd won the lottery.  It is truly a great collectible and a valued treasure for years to come.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read all three books in three days. Need I say more! Make sure you have number 3 to hand as you'll want to follow on straight away!
B005VKMB42|4.0|I have to commend the producers of this CD for not overwhelming Birdy's voice. Even if Birdy's voice doesn't mature beyond where it is now, she's still magnificent. And I an happy to say I am now hearing her music on TV.
0307951529|5.0|It was so good that I kept talking about it with my wife. Before I could finish it, the book disappeared from \\"my\\" pile of books to \\"her\\" pile of books. At the top. I hope she gives it back.<br /><br />This book has an easy style, and makes great points without beating ideas to death. I found myself jotting notes as I read, since there are business pearls throughout.<br /><br />I was provided a pre-release copy of this book in return for a fair review. If I paid for this book, my review would be unchanged.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I found myself lost in this book! While it was not the best book I've read, it certainly was not the worst. There were times I skimmed along the pages but for the most part I enjoyed the story. Oh Christian Grey, how every woman needs a man like you! I am not interested in the whole dominance thing but it was nice to read about something out of my comfort zone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. Read all three books in less than a week that's how good they are. I want a real life Christan T. Grey.
B007PS0X0W|2.0|I almost turned it off. I am not a movie snob, and I don't mind pointless violence. However, the rest of the Underworld series has had great story lines, AND great violence/action. This one has a VERY weak story, and mediocre action. You can tell that they didn't have as good of a budget for this film. All in all, it was ok at best.
B00003CXRM|4.0|but extremely entertaining.  Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are hilarious.  In reality, every role was played to the hilt and well-done.
B006UIUJ2A|5.0|Intimidating and riveting. Engrossing and enlighening. Highly recommended for the book club.<br />Why do men like this exist throughout history? They always have and always will? To name a few - Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Kim etc. They behave and act like Gods themselves.<br />This highly ambitious novel tries to show us behind the North Korean curtain to see what life is really like. Nobody in our world really knows for sure but this is a very good estimate. Where human beings are a resource and a material.<br />Just fantastic to see that our age is still writing and creating such outstanding fiction.
B0080CL0HM|5.0|This was a good movie, saw it twice. Robert Pattinson was the best actor for that role. Really showed true emotion. Would watch it over and over again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a very entertaining book! I couldn't put it down and when I was done I HAD to get the rest; I needed to know what was going on with Christina and Ana! If you haven't read it you need to do it now!!
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot and can't figure the negative 1-star reviews as my Blu-ray DVD played perfectly.  The emotional trauma of such an experience were perfectly portrayed.
B0059XTUB8|1.0|I guess I kept hoping that it would redeem itself somewhere. That did not happen.<br /><br />Michelle Williams plays Marilyn Monroe. Unfortunately, Michelle Wililams is no Marilyn Monroe, at all. She does not have the face, body or voice. She is cute. Not beautiful. She just didn't have it. It was almost painful to watch. And there was something weird she did with her eyes, when she was listening to Colin talk - as if she was thinking and having some revelation inside her head - possible, but didn't come across as good acting. Just strange.<br /><br />I also didn't believe that Monroe would become dependent on Colin Clark and they would have this wonderful day together, skinny-dipping and visiting Windsor Castle and all. When did she stop to take her pills?<br /><br />Everyone around her told Colin to leave her alone or he would get hurt. He was warned that he would be used. Of course he did not care, what young man would? But I don't think this relationship happened, except in his fantasies.<br /><br />Olivier seemed most on target that he could see through Monroe. She knew exactly what she was doing, being late, manipulating people, pretending to be helpless and stupid and not know her lines. And that she did not need rescuing. He was right about all that. But there was something strange about Kenneth Branagh playing Laurence Olivier. He wasn't right for the part either. I think his acting and speech were good, but physically, there was something disturbing. He didn't look like him, but it wasn't just that - his cheeks were too fat, his hair too slick? Just a bit off kilter there.<br /><br />To sum up this film, sorry I wasted my time. In my defense for renting it from the library, I thought it was going to be about her time spent with Jim Haspiel.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved how easy to read these books are. It is also nice that it is set up for all three books in one product. The navigation is good. Easy to get to where you want to.
0439023513|2.0|I finished this last book of the \\"Hunger Game Trilogy\\" and I don't know if I would refer it to another reader. What was the purpose of this story? It certainly wasn't to make the reader happy or freightened; this story was just too detached from reality with no meaning or value to do that. The main character, Katniss, \\"The Mockingjay\\" should have been called the \\"Analyzerjay\\" because that's what she did the whole trilogy both of herself and the other characters.<br /><br />What was the message being sent to young readers by the author with all the violence and killings. The story did not connect me with the characters, because I only knew them through the mind of Katniss. The ending fit the rest of the story dull and unreal; nothing here stirred my imagination.
B0057ZAA6W|5.0|All I can say is that the main characters of 'Trainspotting': Rents, Spud, Sick boy and the Beggarman have never left me since reading the novel of the same name by Irvin Welsh back in the 90's. This darkly humorous, provocative and hard edged movie interpretation of Irvin Welsh's awesome `Trainspotting' novel follows the exploits of these now famous four and puts working class Edinburgh on the map. The local dialect/vocabulary, characters, theme music and storyline is as distinctive and at time challenging as Burgesses `Clockwork Orange'. Welsh is the bard of the new century Scots working class consciousness in distress and this movie version is pure catnip to his established and first time fans. A must see unless you're easily offended, too old or Tory i.e. English conservative.

B004LWZW24|5.0|ONE of the best haunted house movies in decades with well-paced scares, chilling music, and some of the most bone-chilling images iv seen in a while. Im 18, maybe not the toughest guy in the world but projected images dont scare me.I bought this movie (in perfect condition) on amazon expecting some watered down horror flick with some jump in your seat moments but nothing memorable. I was pleasantly disappointed when i finally watched this movie by my self and slept with the light on afraid i would see a demonic figure standing beside my bed. Mark my words, this movie will scare the hell out of you.
0345803493|5.0|I must say I was scared to read the second installment. The first one left me gasping for breath, some of the details were a little too much for me.<br />But seeing Christian change and become a romantic was delicious.<br />The progress in their relationship very satisfying.<br />There were a few things I didn't like for example: it seems like every kinky thought or action is always blamed on a traumatizing experience. Why can't he just like domination for the hell of it? It was upsetting knowing his dark past led him to it.<br />His vulnerability was not hot.<br />Although at the time of his nightmare his vulnerability was hot.<br />I don't understand it what is it with shrinks and the color green? Seriously, thinking about one brings color green to mind just like Flynn's office.<br />Oh my god, submissive Christian was totally hot no wonder coldhearted Elena can't leave him alone. I'd like to dominate him like crazy.<br />And I wasn't okay with Ana thinking of him as \\"f**** up\\" such a degrading term to use on someone she supposedly loves.<br />Great book.
1400069289|5.0|We all vaguely know we have \\"habits\\" but this book really examines what habits truly are.  What do Peposodent, Febreze, Alcoholics Anonymous and the Alcoa corporation  have in common?  They all understood HABITS. -- how habits are triggered and how to change them.  The big accomplishment of this book, is that it presents  scholarly work WITHOUT BEING BORING.  The author covers the \\"habits of societies\\" -- oh it really gets interesting here!  How movements begin & spread.  How corporations manipulate our habits.  The positive role of routines in the organization of human work.  You'll never think of your daily \\"routines\\" in the same way.  Fabulous, fascinating book which will help people understand and change their habits.
0307951529|5.0|Chris Guillebeau's latest book (The $100 Startup) contains a wealth of information for anybody considering the jump to ANY small business (not just consulting.) It is a mix of inspiration and real-world examples backed up with proven business advice.<br /><br />This is Chris's second book. The first, the Art of Nonconformity, encourages people to follow their passions and live their lives with gusto. But it is not just talk -- Chris actually lives that way.  In addition to starting several successful businesses along with a very successful blog, he is but a few countries from personally visiting EVERY country in the world. All this at under 35 years old!<br /><br />The $100 Startup, however, is not about Chris nor his latest adventures, but is based on real business research. This book details 50 case studies on successful micro-businesses started from modest investments (many under $100.) The case studies were derived from a survey Chris conducted of over 1500 people who, like Chris, have built businesses earning $50,000 year or more.<br /><br />In addition to the success stories, the book is loaded with useful charts, checklists, and other tools to help you start your own business. All practical nuts and bolts stuff. The stories or tools alone would make the book worthwhile, but couple those with his insights and advice, and you have a winner.<br /><br />Two thumbs up! (Enjoyed is so much, I actually read it through twice.)

B001GQSY5K|1.0|Some may say that this series \\"redeems\\" the prequels, but to me, this series is about as equivalent to the prequels as you can get. Lack of quality dialogue and good narrative writing in favor for high content explosions and eye candy.
1609613937|3.0|I read the book in one sitting. That wasn't hard to do since half of the book is vegan recipes. There isn't much here that he hasn't covered in prior books. I did notice that he focused more heavily on extracted vegetable oils. I'm glad he did since I read a research paper presented at the annual convention of the American Oil Chemist Society (can you believe the world has become this specialized?) on 5/6/2012. These are the guys that work with vegetable oils and figure out how to shove this stuff in every processed food in your grocery store. The health hazards of vegetable oil have proven to be even more harmful than animal fat. The discovery that heating vegetable oil repeatedly (there is a slight cooling and heating of the oil each time a basket of food is dropped into the oil) to temperatures used for frying and holding the oil at that temperature produced HNE's in as little as 3 hours. This should be devastating news to anyone with an ounce of sense. HNE's are some of the most carcinogenic elements known to science.<br /><br />As I read the book the doctor eliminated one food after another on a typical Western diet, I had to ask myself, can I do this; the answer was yes. It was yes until I got near the end and he started to caveat the starch solution. After telling me that it would be difficult to limit those forbidden animal products to some lower safe level and better to exclude them, he announces that the Starch Solution won't work well if you have a chronic disease, are near to having a chronic disease or wanted to lose weight unless you do the same with some vegan foods.......what? Hey, why would I want to give up all the food I grew up with unless I was fat, sick or near dead? Now we learn that many other non-animal food items including any product made from flours including whole grain flours &#34;will substantially slow down our progress to good health and normal weight. &#34; Yet, what do I find in his quick start diet section; meal after meal with items like pancakes, whole wheat bread, whole grain tortillas and pasta. I'm confused! What also confused me is his statement that the Japanese eat less than 2 ounces of soy products a day and that maybe eating soy at the level that American Vegans do might not be healthy (7th Day Adventist vegan women who eat soy more than 2 times per week have higher breast cancer rates than those women eating the standard American diet). But then he loads his recipe section with soy. Either this stuff is good for you or it isn't. And if it isn't why feature so much of this product in so many recipes. If meat isn't healthy even in small quantities as he says, well, shouldn't the same apply to soy? You would have thought that instead of coming up with a &#34;wildly popular&#34; (among his family) soy burger he would have come up with a Vegan bean burger instead.<br /><br />I started eating pretty much as he suggested six months ago. Based on blood work my kidney function has improved substantially. Cancer (multiple Myeloma) and the chemo used to hold it at bay caused a 53% loss of kidney function. I spent the last eight years killing my kidneys even further with a high protein diet thinking this was the way to health. It was not! First, I couldn't eat high protein/high fat with minimum carbs long term (l love my carbs). Second, it damaged my kidneys even further. I never realized how heavy a load protein puts on the kidneys, and my doctors never informed me, or suggested a change in diet, nor questioned my eating habits. My doctors tried solving the problem with numerous medications, each having their own side effects when a simple change in diet would have saved me a lot of pain and grief.<br /><br />The doctor focuses heavily on the fact that throughout history ALL major populations were based on a starch diet. This is fact and it cannot be disputed. But what is also fact is that none of these populations were Vegan, or even close to it. He points out that as long as a population stayed on their traditional diet (and it follows that means regardless of what that was. Doesn't this start to sound a lot like Weston Price?) they stayed healthy. The further they strayed from that path the fatter and sicker they got. This makes sense since research shows that as little as 20 generations are required for adaptation to any pattern of eating. In my case coming from a Northern European background, fruit as much as I love it presents a problem. The single month that I went on a 100% ultra-low fat (about 6%) Vegan diet I gained one pound. I was also cycling one hour a day five days a week. I discovered it was the fruit. Once I cut fruit consumption to one piece each day I started to lose weight again. I assume the reason was my ancestry didn't have access to fruit year round and therefore genetically I'm not programed to burn it effectively. In Northern Europe fruit was available in two very small slivers of time, spring for berries and fall for berries and apples. Fruit is one carbohydrate that my body loves to store as fat.<br /><br />Oh, you also need to be just a little skeptical about some of the health claims of the plant based doctors. They claim they can cure everything from cancer to a broken heart and have testimonials to prove it. Plus they can do it in record time. Ornish tells you he can cure type 2 diabetes in just over a year and it might take up to two for tough cases, Neal Barnard says he can do it in 22 weeks, Gabriel Cousens does it in 8 weeks, Pritikin used to do it in 28 days, and Dr. McDougall can do it in his 10 day live in program. Kind of like &#34;Name That Tune&#34;, each doctor can do it in fewer notes.<br /><br />Another recommendation you need to be careful about is ultra-low protein (less than 10%). I see nothing wrong at keeping protein (plant based of course) as high (it is difficult to get beyond 15% eating low fat vegan) as 10 to 20 percent (the old Atkins at 30% was nuts and hard on the kidneys). The focus in the book and the on-line site is to keep protein as close to the minimum required as possible. The doctor tells you NOT to eat more than one cup of beans a day in order to keep the protein number as low as possible. I know all the plant based doctors give you the same recommendation. They use the Okinawans, Kitavans and Tarahumara peoples as the pictures of perfect health. And from a heart disease perspective I guess they are, but the average height of the males in these societies is under 5-4 with the Okinawa Centenarian men at 4-10 and their women at 4-6. I'm sure you don't want you male children to be this tiny. That's why I believe that feeding this kind of diet to a growing child is dangerous to their development. If you're going to go low fat vegan make sure it's AFTER your final growth spurt....unless as a mother of a male child you don't mind him looking up at his dates.<br /><br />In the end I do believe he has something of value to say; a something that would make us all healthier if we listen. The push to be 100% Vegan isn't necessary unless you want to do it for environmental or personal reasons. But of course if nothing else Vegans are passionate about their food.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />After being on this new way of eating for almost a year and participating in the on-line website you discover the contrary to what the doctor says you CAN'T eat large quantities of starches and lose weight; in fact you gain weight. You'll find that it's a low calorie diet with many people eating in the 1000 to 1400 calorie range (called MWL, Maximum Weight Loss program in the book and on-line) and if they eat more than that they don't lose weight and some gain. Yes, you don't COUNT calories, but by eating less starch and more green and yellow vegetables and salads you're doing the same thing with a trick they call calorie density. The folks on Weight Watchers don't count calories either: they count points. You've got all these gimmicks trying to convince you that somehow calories don't count or need to be counted: they do! According to their on-line Nutritionist (Novick) it all comes down to &#34;food density;&#34; if you stick with large amounts of green and yellow vegetables and salads and keep the starches relatively lower you lose weight and the fiber from the vegetables fills you up. I've found in practice this just isn't true. You need the starch to keep you satiated and under these circumstances the weight might come off at a snail's pace; one pounds every couple of months. I still think from health perspective it's the way to eat, but from a weight loss point of view it's hardly a quick solution. I've found if you add eight ounces of egg protein shake to your meals it leaves you satisfied without the fat that would come with most animal sources which is the real villain in most chronic diseases. This has allowed me to eat only two or three meals a day instead of every three hours and pooping three times a day. On the program you feel like you spend your entire day either preparing food, eating it or sitting on the toilet. Most of the people on the program cook a half dozen baked potatoes at one time and keep them in the frig to munch to get past the constant cooking. They do the same with rice, beans and most other grains. The idea of cold baked potatoes just doesn't appeal to me. The other down side is the gas problem. Eating that much volume and fiber makes you a one person greenhouse gas disaster. Forget about eating out unless you're satisfied with dry salad (remember that oils are a no, no) and social events will find you going hungry or bringing your own food. From a weight loss perspective the book would be better called the green and yellow vegetable solution with starch added. The shear volume of food required on the program is other than starch.<br /><br />Is it hard to do the McDougal program? Yes, if it was easy you wouldn't need a support board to keep you on track. The question you have to ask yourself is how far are you willing to go for health and is a program this strict really necessary to achieve it?<br /><br />11/22/2013<br /><br />2nd update<br /><br />Yes, I'm still eating vegan, but not ultra-low fat. I've added seeds and nuts to the diet plus vitamin D, B12 and Flax for the Omega 3. The seeds and nuts allowed me to knock off the protein shake and gave me the same satiation as the shake AND finally dropped my Triglycerides to 87 from their near 300 level and finally reduced my fasting glucose from 110/113 to 78/82. This higher fat way is starting to get closer to the recommendation of another plant based doctor named Fuhrman. My hair was starting to thin and fall out and after some research I figured out it was the D. Doctor McDougall doesn't believe in added vitamins except for B12, but if you give it some thought the only way of getting vitamin D on this diet is via the sun. For those of us living north we are a little short of sun for vitamin D. Your other option is to eat &#34;junk vegan&#34; with lots of processed food that has vitamin D added. What the doctor fails to realize is that in the standard American diet packaged foods like bread, cereal, juice and even milk and cheese have vitamin D added by the processor or manufacturer as does processed vegan food. If you follow the book's instruction and eat only a whole food plant based diet you're eliminating all these sources of vitamin D. There is another vegan doctor named Greger who posted a YouTube video called &#34;40 year vegan dies of heart attack&#34; or something very close to this. He reviews various vegetarian and vegan studies and points out that they die at the same level of heart attacks, strokes, and a higher death rate from brain disorders. He goes on to point out why, and that why is a lack of vitamin D, B12 levels that are too low and an omega 3 to 6 ratio that is wildly (40 to 1, instead of from 4 or better yet 2 to 1) out of whack. He points out that adding these supplements to a vegan diet puts it back into the super healthy range. The reality is that the McDougall program hasn't changed a lick in 40 years and there have been an average of 16,000 studies produced each year. Can we believe there hasn’t been one credible study done out of the 640,000 studies done during that period that would require a modification of his program? At some point Dr. McDougall will be required to modify his program (as Dr. Ornish did by OKing fish) based on today's science instead of what was known 40 years ago. Let's look at reality; all the plant based doctors took what Pritikin first came up with in the 60's and modified it a bit. Pritikin made sure his body was autopsied upon his death and what they discovered were arteries that were almost as clean as when he was born. Yet, Pritikin ate fish several times a week and chicken from time to time, proving you don't have to be full blown vegan to reap the health benefits of a plant based whole food, no oils diet. Sadly, seafood has always made me gag and therefore I've never eaten the stuff.<br /><br />By the way, if you join the McDougall site I wouldn't question any of the information put into the book on-line, or the studies done by plant based doctors like Campbell. If you disagree on minor points or dare to simply question what's been written the site manager, will allow three or four of the board's cyber bullies to work you over on any posts you make. If you stand up to these bullies he'll immediately step on you while at the same time allowing them to insult and demean you and your opinion. If you don't take the hint and leave the board voluntarily, you’ll ultimately be banned from the site. The purpose of a support group should be to provide a SAFE environment where people can open up and talk about what they really feel and any doubts they may have; help that allows them to stay on the diet and new life style. When the board administrator allows cyber bullies to take over and enforce their own version of what's right he damages the entire concept of compassionate support. It's natural to have doubts and questions when you first start something as new and radical as this way of eating. Don't allow these bullies and poor management of their actions by the administrator to turn you off to this way of eating. The message is sound even though those in charge of it aren't. Veganism at this level is closer to a religion than simply a dietary change and deviations won't be tolerated. Of course the average person should know that diets this strict whether McDougall, Pritikin or Atkins are not going to be followed to the letter. But then the world isn't about perfection and some deviation is expected, you simply can't admit to it on-line. I still believe this is a healthy way of eating once you add the vitamins and fats I mentioned. This still complies with the heart of the book which is a whole food plant based diet.<br /><br />May 2014 Update<br /><br />It's now be over two years that I've been eating a plant based vegan no oils diet. Do I eat the McDougall program? NO! I'm eating closer to 15/20 percent fat depending on the day. The additional fat comes from seeds, nuts and coconut products. My protein intake is higher than 10% max based on the amount of beans I eat. I'm guessing it's closer to 12/15%. I'm also taking supplements like vitamin D, K2, zinc and fish oils. All of which are against the McDougall program. At some point I as an individual came to realize that thousands of studies have been done since Dr. McDougall came out with his modified Pritikin requirements and called them his own 40 years ago. Those studies have pointed out the flaws in his 40 year old program and how to get around those shortcomings. It truly is sad that the doctor has so much emotionally invested in wanting to be right that there is no room to admit that science has progressed in those 40 years. What's even sadder is the fact that he and his people make every effort to suppress those findingon his site and they ban anyone who points out those shortcomings or even comes to that conclusion and posts it. We have 31/38 vegans in our meeting group and seven joined the McDougall site over two years ago, six have been banned or pushed out. Joe, the sixth member was banned in April for posting that based on a dozen studies it would seem that how much you ate had as much impact as what you ate. Sue, our seventh is still a member because she has only posted a couple of times at most. I made it until October of 2013 after pointing out that the Okinawan diet was neither vegan, nor low oil and certainly not low salt. All six of us are still vegan but no longer welcome on the McDougall site.<br /><br />There have been some interesting developments since I last reviewed the program and website. Dr. Campbell has written an article now stating that saturated fat DOES NOT cause heart disease and there hasn't been even one study that shows it does. Is this the same Dr. Campbell of the China Study? Yep! What's more he has published at least six new studies based on re-analysis of the original China study data that directly conflicts with his original analysis of that data in the book. It seems that meat isn't all that bad and doesn't cause certain cancers but wheat is correlated more with cancer. It would seem Denise Menger has been right all along. Additionally, Dr. McDougall's MS study results have been leaked by one of the researchers a year after completion. It was a total bust. Not only were there no regression of MS lesions, they didn't even slow down. In fact they grew and new ones formed with the McDougall diet at the same rate as the control group. The conclusion? Diet has no effect on MS. Of course they are excusing the results by saying we don't have all the facts; the study was too small or we don't know how it was set up and followed, or it wasn't long enough to tell. The reality is that it was Dr. McDougall and his people who came up with the study, selected the members, its parameters including length and requirements and therefore they had it exactly his way and it still busted flat.<br /><br />My final conclusion is that veganism isn't necessary and creates its own problems, BUT all can be handled with supplements. Those supplements wouldn't be necessary if you ate fish a few times a week as the Japanese and Okinawans do. Sadly, I can't stand seafood and I'm stuck with supplements. What are the real evils in the modern diet? Extracted oils are the number one killer, processed grain products come next, followed by too much meat.<br /><br />Plant based but not necessarily plant exclusive is the way to real health.<br /><br />May 13, 2015<br />Another year has passed and I’m still a vegan, but not because I still think meat, fish and fat are bad. I’m a vegan on a modified version of whole foods diet. I eat about 20% in fat from nuts and seeds instead of under 10, and 12/15% in protein versus the recommended under 10%. I’m a vegan because I dislike meat and just can’t stomach fish.<br /><br />I’ve come to determine that energy overload is the primary cause of type 2 diabetes and obesity. That’s why both high fat (vegan and omnivore) and low fat ways of eating show “cures”. They all are associated with weight loss. There isn’t a single study that has shown a cure for type 2 without weight loss: eliminate the energy overload no matter what diet you use and diabetes disappears in the vast majority of people.<br /><br />If you keep pumping tons of starch or sugar into the body it will protect itself by becoming insulin resistant and in time you’ll develop type 2. High levels of glucose are dangerous to the body and it will do everything (burn excess carbs as heat and pump in all they insulin it can produce) to reduce those levels. It first stores glucose in the liver and muscle cells and once those are full it starts burning as much of the excess as it can as heat in the muscle cells. But the cells canonly do this for so many years. You can’t keep pumping massive amounts of high octane fuel into the cells year after year generating high levels of heat without damaging them. The body will protect itself by forced conversion of carbs to fat through insulin resistance (that’s why high carb vegans end up with very high trig levels. Trig are the storage form of fat). The body burns fat slowly and effectively. It is after all the storage medium of the body. If saturated fat is dangerous to heart health and causes type 2 the body wouldn’t be converting every calorie of excess glucose into saturated fat? Then there is the fact that our mothers’ feed us breast milk with more saturated fat than cow’s milk.<br /><br />The excess of glucose produces high levels of heat which causes inflammation in the cells that contributes to heart disease and the reason why so many with type 2 have heart attacks.<br /><br />Contrary to vegan beliefs carbs are not the preferred fuel of the body; the brain yes, but not the body. The reason the body uses carbs first isn’t because it prefers carbs, but because carbs as glucose sitting for long periods in the blood are toxic. The body does everything in its power to get blood glucose down.<br /><br />All sub-caloric diets are high fat diets because you’re burning lots of your own fat (most of it saturated). So, you might be eating under 10% fat but you’re burning 40% of your calories daily as fat. The body can’t differentiate fat coming from the body versus fat from your diet..  And all diets are also low carb diets. It isn’t the percentage of carbs in the diet that counts, but the absolute value of carbs per gram of ideal body weight that makes a difference. If you need 2000 calories a day to fuel your body and If you eat 100% of your calories from carbs (I’m ignoring the normal fat and protein in all foods just to make the math easy) at 2000 calories a day you’d eat 500 grams of carbs. When you go on a very low fat vegan diet you’ll be eating say 1200 calories which equals 300 gram of carbs. That’s a sixty percent reduction in the absolute amount of carbs you’ll be eating. Where does the additional 800 calories that are required to fuel the body come from? Yep, from your body fat. That translates into 40% of the calories required to fuel your body will come from fat. That’s a high saturated fat diet. Do you really think the body cares if the fat comes from your food or from your body? Of course not, fat is fat.<br /><br />What finally convinced me that it’s not the meat or saturated or oils that cause heart disease (maybe there is some correlation with cancer) was discovered by pure accident. It all started the day I read Dr. McDougall’s take on why the autopsy studies on soldiers killed in action showed 70 percent blockage in some arteries for those killed in Korea and 40 percent for those who died in Viet Nam? Dr. McDougall’s answer was it’s the meat and other animal products. I thought, yeah that makes sense….until I ran across the autopsy study for guys killed in action from the Afghan and Iraq conflict a few months ago. Their blockage was 8 percent. We’ve been eating more meat (red meat started to drop in the late 70’s but it’s still higher than in the 50’s), animal products like cheese and yogurt each decade since 1900. We’ve also radically increased our extracted oils consumption since the 70’s. So, why has each decade shown a reduction in artery blockage of our young men killed in action when meat, saturated fat and oils has gone up each of those periods (hey, but remember obesity and type 2 has gone way up, but we’re talking heart disease as the moment)? Obviously it wasn’t the meat and other animal products or the oils. We’ve got to be very careful before we start assigning disease to a single cause.<br /><br />Is beef and chicken in reasonable quantities bad for you? Besides what I’ve already concluded I’ll answer it in this way:people are allergic to many foods, but have you ever heard of anybody allergic to beef or chicken? The answer is NO. Why is it that people can be sensitive to stuff like peanuts, grains, the nightshade family and almost any other plant food, but you never hear of them being sensitive to beef or chicken? The answer is simple. Man has been adapted to meat over the last three million years. Those who couldn’t tolerate meat were selected out over a million years ago. On the other hand since various plants have only left their country of origin in the last few hundred years many people haven’t adapted and therefore have problems.<br /><br />The conclusion I’ve come to is that all vegan doctors got it right and also got it wrong. Each has figured out a piece of the puzzle, but none are about to admit they might have part of it wrong. These guys are intelligent men I’m sure most have figured it out, but after decades of making a living off of their version of the truth they just can’t bear to come out and say they’ve got parts of the story wrong. They’ve all got the eating of greens and veggies right, McDougall got the starch part right, Fuhrman gave us the beans, Cousen the nuts and Ornish/Pritikin the fish. If you combine their stories you end up with a lower carb, higher protein diet (1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight). Add fish to the mix, up your fruit and vegetables dump most of your flour products and you’ve got it right. The cravings disappear on lower carbs/higher protein and the amount of calories you’ll eat will naturally be just what your ideal body weight wants to see. You’ll get enough protein to maintain your muscle and bones while slowly losing the excess weight and you won’t be hungry because the higher fat, protein and starch will satiate. After all, the healthiest and longest lived people in America are the subgroup of Seventh Day Adventists who consider themselves vegan, but eat fish. Based on a 2000 calorie diet they eat 34% of their calories from fat that comes from fish, nuts and oils, and 15% to 17% of their calories from protein and the balance as carbs. Even the real vegans eat 29% of their calories from fat in the form of nuts, seeds and oils. It’s interesting to note that based on the Adventist 2 study that those considering themselves real vegans still eat animal products once or twice a month ( want to guess what that animal product is?  Ice cream). These folks are NOT low fat vegans, and neither is any other population including the longest lived Okinawans when viewed from a fat gram per kilogram basis.<br /><br />My biggest concern about Dr. McDougall is his increasing fear of the medical profession he’s been a part of for fifty years.  Last year he became faint and collapsed moving from his bed to the bathroom.  He fractured his hip, two lower vertebrae, and had a spiral fracture of his upper tight bone.  Yet, he refused to go to the hospital.  His claim was a fear of having his heart stented without his permission.  Since you can refuse any medical procedure I highly doubt that was his fear.  It’s more likely he feared the x-rays that would be required prior to being treated for his fractures would be leaked to the public as were Dr. Atkin’s records.  Various vegan Doctors used Dr. Atkins hospital records after his death to attack his way of eating.  Dr. McDougall having that much bone damage from a simple collapse in his bedroom  speaks to severe osteoporosis.  If that information were to have leaked it would have spelled disaster for his program and his income.  You can read this story in his own words by going to the McDougall site and checking into to the  monthly newsletters.<br /><br />If you’ve read ALL my thoughts on The Starch Solution you’ve lived with me through three years of a N=1 experiment. You’ve listened to my original thoughts and how they’ve changed over that period based on my body’s reaction to the food on the program. I hope this willbe of benefit and allow you to avoid some of the mistakes I’ve made. As someone once said, “a smart person learns from his mistakes, but a wise person learns from the mistakes of others.” Where exactly am I and where did I come from? My high weight was 263 at 5-9 and when I started the program it was 241. My current weight is a muscular 165 thanks to my new way of eating and lots of weight work. My total cholesterol is 157 with LDL at 79 and HDL of 63. My blood pressure came down from 162/95 to 110/72, my Trigs from 298 to 76 and my fasting sugars from roughly 110 to 79, after meals they never move above 128.<br /><br />May good health bless you all.<br /><br />9/16/2016<br /><br />Last week I had a major heart attack and was lucky to survive. The chemo from my cancer treatment over a decade ago damaged my heart and this attack did more damage. I had a stent placed and am doing well. So much for being heart attack proof by having very low cholesterol, perfect weight, great blood sugar, wonderful blood pressure, exercised and ate right and still almost died.  No one is heart attack proof.his site and they ban anyone who points out those shortcomings or even comes to that conclusion and posts it.

0307951529|5.0|\\"The $100 Startup\\" is a book that primarily focuses on moving past the barriers that we and others place in front of our desires. These barriers (not enough money, knowledge, experience, demand, etc.)make it easy for us to not go into business. Not going into business allows us not to fail. However, this self-protective instinct automatically allows us not to succeed either. The book encourages a quick, no-holds barred start-up, because the leap is what is often the most difficult. Following the leap, there are other helpful hints in this manuscript that relate to pricing and sales. Mr. Guillebeau illustrates that sometimes income is better with slightly higher pricing, and slightly lower sales volume, then it is based on quantity alone. Other helpful points cover whether or not to hire employees, whether or not to grow, when to say no, why you might not want EVERY potential customer, and so on.<br /><br />I think this book might be just as helpful to existing small business owners as it is to those looking to start a business. The different sections on differentiation and customer service are insightful and seem to repeat themselves over and over through a variety of the case studies. And as mentioned before, the section on pricing is very interesting and perhaps not as intuitive as might be expected.

B007SGM084|5.0|WOW!!!! E L James is one amazing author. Her writing makes you feel like you are there.... part of the conversation. The story is compelling and the characters are believable. James takes a woman's perspective of lustful romance to new heights. Could not put it down. VERY GLAD I bought the trilogy, not just the first book.<br /><br />This book is better than some sex toys!<br /><br />WHEN is she writing her next series?
B006SHVIWS|5.0|Downton Abbey ( seasons 1 and 2) are simply fabulous. This a great series which I really enjoyed. The acting and costumes are worth it alone, but the story is wonderful too.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent book. Love the time travel aspect and always have been a history buuf and it is a different way to approach the subject.
0345803485|5.0|I read the reviews in the papers and decided to give this book a whirl. Not my normal type of book but I found myself completely submerged in Anastasias life. It is graffic with some pretty raunchy scenes that some might find disturbing but the underlying story is complex and really entertaining. Very well written and addictive. I found myself wondering all day what would be the next twist in the story. I would highly recommend this book to those with an open mind.

0800141660|3.0|I just finished reading the book and watching both this movie and the latest Masterpiece Theater... The book does not spend much time with Edward played by Grant.  He is hesitant and shy but it is implied that he opens up and becomes deeply engaged with Elinor- on a one to one with someone you are comfortable with, shyness largely disappates.  Well, except for the end in which he is charming, he portrays Edward as stuttering and almost buffoonish- and NOT someone attractive.  All they had to do was show them interacting and conversing and having intelligent interaction as couples who like one another do.  Edward had to be ultimately likeable and attractive for the story to work so this was extremely dumb and happened no doubt because the book has to be read carefully to infer the type of person that Austen intended for the story to make sense.<br /><br />I would like to add that Dr. House- Hugh Laurie is brilliant as Mr. Palmer... brilliant comic relief!
B003Y5H5FG|3.0|Okay, what should I say about this movie?  First, let me try and not compare it severely to the original.  If I did, it would receive an F.  I simply love the original with Chris Sarandon, the totally most handsome vampire ever.  I liked all of the original cast members as well, straight down to Charlie Brewster's Mom.<br /><br />This remake with Colin Farrell was more sinister and evil in this film.  It was quite dark and a little humorous.  He was more of a rugged, brutal, killer.  It  didn't appear that there was a love interest in this movie for him.  Just kill, kill, and more kill.  Motivation was, \\"I need Blood to Survive and I want it Now\\".<br /><br />I wasn't too fond of Evil.  His friendship with Charlie seemed a little strained.  I felt that Charlie was trying to do something different with his life, which didn't include Evil.  Evil seemed to resent Charlie and his new friends.  The new Peter Vincent was weird and I guess added a more modern feel to the character.  They even included more interaction with Charlie's Mom.  Amy still loved Charlie, but I found her a little boring.  She was not as perky as the original Amy for me.  Though Jerry went after Amy, their connection was different from the original movie.<br /><br />Though I did not expect this movie to be as the original, I did not like some of the story line as much.  Though it showed a few of the additions from the first movie a little differently, it just did not flow as smoothly for me.  It was a little rugged on some of the edges.  All in all, it was just okay for me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wish I had read the reviews before I tried this book!  Thank goodness I only ordered a sample for my kindle and did not waste money along with my time.<br />This is such shallow character writing -- I kept waiting for it to move up a bit...it didn't move at all.<br />People who are giving 5 stars...REALLY???? Why?<br />I honestly don't understand how anyone would rate this above a two star...I can't believe I finished the sample!  On second thought, I don't think I did. And this is one time that it was a sizeable sample.<br />There are so many great books out there and so little time to get to them all!

0345803493|5.0|This book was amazing... The whole trilogy was.... It's not just the way the author discribed in detail about the sex... It truly was a love story and how a man changes after falling in love with a beautiful strong willed woman!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|it is very mind blowing . it is just so amazing.<br />not a bad game. love it so much my mom loves it to
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Much better than the movie.  Hard to put down (stayed up later than I should have a few times!).  The kindle version was so convenient.  I purchased on-line, turned on the kindle, it downloaded quickly and I was reading in less than 5 minutes.

0345803485|2.0|Geeze, where do I start...firstly, this is one of the worst written books I've ever read.  One step above a romance novel...If the author just one more time used the term \\"he/she murmured\\" I was going to vomit....however, I couldn't seem to put it down...and it wasn't just about all the sex, there was something interesting about it....I know so very little about S&M that I was fascinated to learn more about the psychology of this type of sex.  I was curious as to what type of woman would toletate a completely submissive type of relationship.  Still am...There was so much domineering sex that I became bored and kept hoping for something different.  Didn't happen.<br /><br />I was relieved when it was over and I can most assuridly state that I will not continue with the \\"trilogy\\".
B000FCKC4C|2.0|So what's the big deal about this book?  10th anniversary celebrations? Who cares?  If I'd read it 10 years ago I probably wouldn't have finished it.  I only got through it this time cos I kept waiting for an epiphany as to why everyone raves about it. I never did discover why.  Lots of 'deep' cliched morality messages wrapped up in a dopey story. Much ado about nothing. Yawn.
B005IF5H2S|4.0|I picked this up when it was 99 cents and for the price, how can you try to complain?  Good CD regardless though, good band.

B0047SF41G|5.0|Great film brings back the feelings the 1987 cult classic did so many years ago!  The movie is a little gorey, and pretty suspenseful, and makes a great addition to the predator films!

B005MYEPXC|5.0|Best movie I've seen in quite a while, and I watch a lot of movies!  Even if you usually don't care for Woody Allen movies, this is a great film.  It's all a movie should be!

B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I read the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy twice.  I absolutely loved it!  I couldn't get enough of Christian and was so sad for it to end.  One of my girlfriends recommended Bared to You OMG!! I was enthralled the moment I started reading.  I will say it's almost identical to Fifty but the writing is so much better because Sylvia Day is a seasoned writer.  The sex scenes are so well written, they blew me away.  I loved the story line and disappointed to learn I have to wait till October for the second book.<br /><br />If you can wait for the second book, definitely pick this up, if not, just wait till the second book comes out.  I don't think it will disappoint you.  The reading is superior and loved the story line as well.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is an awesome game I recommend u get it. 2 get to the homescreen just press STUFF THEN OPTIONS and the kindle arrow will come up
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Just placed the order sunday night and got it wednesday morning, great service! Going to give this as a mothers day gift. Just in time!
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|I really didn't expect to like this movie, but I was pleasantly surprized.  This is not high drama Oscar material, but it doesn't pretend to be.  It is what it claims to be:  an action-packed adrenaline-fueled romp.  To that end, it fits the bill beautifully.  Carano holds her own in the acting department and the fight scenes are simply awesome (and there's a lot of 'em!)  I watched this movie expecting action escapism and that's what it is, but it also has a decent story and the acting is solid.  I'm glad I took a chance on it in spite of the negative reviews.  I agree with the reviewer who suggested Carano for Wonder Woman.  Take heed, DC Comics Movies!
0743277465|4.0|Most books tend to bring out step by step instructions on how things are done - this book just works like a journal of a man driven by his passion for one activity and what goes through his mind and his actions that accomplishes the higher levels of performance.<br /><br />Good applications towards his transition from Chess to Martial Arts does have some cross reference for transferable skill sets in learning.<br /><br />I will definitely give my future children this book as required reading material as it would be a much more useful text for those who are younger and have passion in their activities that require high performance.
B000YDI9UG|5.0|These are the nicest boots I've ever owned.  They are more for style and not working, but I wear them when I'm working anyway.

B0007OY2MG|3.0|Great gift for my girlfriend who loved this show. Priced well and was the next season that she needed when it couldn't be found in store.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Henry Higgins said it best: \\"Why is thinking something women never do? / Why is logic never even tried? / Straightening up their hair is all they ever do. / Why don't they straighten up the mess that's inside?\\" Now while that was supposed to be satirical--I hope--and while it does a staggering disservice to great female writers like Hélène Cixous, Julia Kristeva, Iris Murdoch, Susan Sontag, A. S. Byatt, Gayatri Chakravorty, Virginia Woolf, Emily Brontë, Sappho, J. K. Rowling, Georgette Heyer, Alice Walker--hell, even my girl Judith Krantz--it certainly nails the mental make-up of the women who've made the authors of vapid piffle like this and the \\"Twilight\\" books very wealthy women.<br /><br />Two stars, because the sex is, actually, pretty decent and because they actually have it and do not wait till marriage. And because the use of Classical music sufficiently eludes cliché; though the immediately identifiable and cringeworthily predictable use of the \\"Flower Duet\\" from \\"Lakmé\\"--known to lesbians everywhere as \\"Lick Me\\"--was unnecessary. But at the heart of it all is a heroine who is only slightly less vacuous than Bella Swann. How you could be more vacuous than Bella Swann and not actually be a vacuum limned in invisible ink, I don't possess enough knowledge of biophysics--or ink--to say. Though if any date changed my Verdi for Britney Spears, that would have been the beginning of the end, the prelude to the last day or last week of the fling. Yet that alone tells you, even if she was kinda-sorta doing it as a joke, how profoundly silly Ana is, and how incompatible these two lovers are.<br /><br />Ana is an insult to English majors everywhere. I've taught college--seniors in college--and if any of them turned in a paper demonstrating such appalling competence with the English language, they've have earned a D. And that's about what this novel is. Not an F--to be fair--but a nice, shiny, solid D. For ditz, if you will; or dunce, if you're more classically inclined.<br /><br />But there is a darker side to it: I suspect literary historians will club these works together as the Electra Group of writers, because heroines like Bella and Ana are basically looking to date their fathers. In fact, at one point in \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\"--and why does she spell grey in the title with an e and in the text, when describing Christian's eyes, with an a--the author actually clues you in, none to subtly, when describing a date: \\"It reminds me of when I was ten and spent the day at Disneyland with Ray. It was a perfect day, and this is sure shaping up to be the same\\" (455).<br /><br />Ray is Ana's most positive father-figure, though he isn't a biological parent. Fathers and boyfriends allegorize, respectively, the protective and the dangerous sides of the phallus; and writers like James and Meyer are acknowledging their terror of the phallus--James more honestly, admittedly--by creating cowardly, tremulous heroines who idolize boys who are daddy-surrogates: boys who shower them with gifts, make them feel safe, treat them like princesses, and will never hurt them.  Imagine a guy saying a date reminded him of a day he spent with his mom and how creepy that would sound to his buddies.<br /><br />This book proves, all over again, that we have a generation of--I suspect--largely anti-intellectual female readers, seeking validation through fiction, and making the authors who allow them to find it extremely rich. Regardless of literary excellence, artistry, intelligence, irony, paradox, or any possibility of psychological complexity. Back in the Victorian era, there was a female novelist who churned out pap like this relative to her own time. Her name was Mrs Henry Wood. She is largely forgotten, though geniuses like George Eliot and Charles Dickens are still spoken of with reverence. Mrs Wood, it is interesting to note, strongly opposed giving women the right to vote.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I haven't had the app that long, but so far I really like it. I may have rated it higher, but the app asked me to rate and didn't provide me with a remind me later option which would have given me more time to experience the app.
B004IYISSK|4.0|I must have watched the film a dozen times. Something about it kept me enraptured. Maybe it was because I was myself a child of immigrants (Russian rather than Chinese). The movie spoke to me about the sadness of cultural conflict between a parent who tries so hard to instill a certain cultural awareness in a child who resists it. So I finally decided to read the book. While it was jarring, it was also a personal story that left me wondering about my own history and that of my parents. For that I am thankful to the author for sharing this story.<br /><br />The book is a far richer story than the movie was. By that I mean that there is more background, more history, and much more Chinese culture(s). And the language used is beautiful to read. Amy Tan manages to evoke an entire milieu with her words. But the movie was what I was used to. I tried to put aside the images from the movie, but I kept returning to it and while reading I kept thinking to myself that this was not how it was in the movie.<br /><br />So, the book. It is a story about 4 Chinese women and their 4 Chinese-American daughters.  The book is set up in 16 chapters so that we get the perspective of all 4 mothers and their 4 daughters respectively, although since one mother has died, that part of the book is told from the perspective of the deceased woman's husband and daughter. In mainland China this woman, Suyuan Woo,  was displaced during the war (Chinese-Japanese War during the 30s and 40s) and formed a Joy Luck Club that would play mahjong while sharing the joys and sadness in each others' lives. Now displaced again because of the Japanese invasion, Suyuan forms another Joy Luck Club in San Francisco in 1949, where she met the other 3 Chinese mothers through a local church.<br /><br />In the book, and in the film, we see the backgrounds of the mothers in China. The stories are varied although there is an undercurrent of tragedy in all of them. Those were not easy times to live in China and certainly not as a woman. We are witness to an entire sociocultural world that somehow only gets transplanted in bits and pieces to the United States. This creates serious tensions in all four of the mother-daughter relationships as the mothers and daughters live in different worlds even while inhabiting the same space. So in addition to the usual generation gap, there is also a cultural gap. The mothers have all their history from China while the daughters all have their own emotional issues to deal with as children of immigrants in a new society. As they try to understand each other, the story progresses so that by the end, when we return to China, we see that an emotional bridge has been created between mother and daughter. A bridge that allows the gap to be crossed.not as a woman. We are witness to an entire sociocultural world that somehow only gets transplanted in bits and pieces to the United States.

B007M45PMU|5.0|Save yourself the money and just buy the whole album.  If you just buy the good songs, you'll be out $10.  This is one of those great albums that gets better with each additional listen.  Strong lyrics that are deep and well thought out, but don't make you want to slit your wrists.  The songs also have great hooks and the recording doesn't have that compressed sound that so many albums have these days.  Just a great all around album.

Now, the last half of the book...was addicting! I could not put it down! I was reading till late hours of the night. I had not felt this way about a book since the fifty shades trilogy

B001EN71HC|3.0|I think we all at this point know what these films are about so I will spare you the plot reviews. I will say that the films get worse as they go along. The first one \\"International Man of Mystery\\" was one of the best films of the 90's and is really a cult classic now. It's one of those films you can watch over and over and still enjoy it. As the films progress the humour becomes more forced and juvenile. By the last film it was just a few moments worth watching. I also hated the fact that they changed the love interest in each film, esp considering both Hurley and Graham both expressed interest in staying.<br /><br />\\"International Man of Mystery\\" = solid \\"A\\"<br />\\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\\" = \\"B-\\"<br />\\"Goldmember\\" = \\"C-/D+\\"<br /><br />As far as the three DVD package goes I am very happy with the product and the the Bluray quality is fantastic! I also really like how it was packaged, usually I throw away all the packaging and put the disks into my disk holder but I kept these they way they were.<br /><br />Enjoy, if you have never seen them you are in for some good fun!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|it is an interesting game but when you get to wave 50 you have to buy tokens to get passed it. I mean major money to pass it.so idk if worth it so good luck with it. but it pretty worth the download.

B003Y5H5EW|1.0|I'm a fan of the Underworld franchise. I found most of the films to be sleek, and stylish with amazing special effects, and of course, Kate Beckinsale as Selena is great. I even liked Underworld: Rise of the Lycans,  the one that doesn't have Kate in it.<br /><br />Can't say I liked Awakening. The plot is lame, the acting is worse. All Kate/Selene does is kill lycans. Yawn.
0345803485|5.0|This book is not for the faint hearted or anyone who is not really into Dom/sub. It might be offensive to feminists in general too, because submission seems to be kind of bad for women (for obvious reasons). The book, to me, is refreshing and original. Christian Grey is a sexy dominant..every woman's dream and every man's envy. The only thing I dislike was the portrayal of Jose, to be honest the writer is from UK if I am not mistaken she doesnt seem to know that Hispanic-americans don't usually say mamacita or cara mia on a daily basis. It just isn't realistic. It seems like Jose was portrayed like a cheap and sleazy guy, uneducated at best. Other than that the book is good and I am considering to get entire trilogy. Maybe on kindle form since I am not too sure if I want people to find out I read these kind of books.
B007HJ91HU|4.0|After seeing the 2012 Footloose remake last night, I honestly can't see what the big deal is. Is it because it is a remake and therefore evil by existing?<br /><br />All in all it is not a movie to get worked up over. My complaint of the movie is that is too much like the original. While it did try to update some of the events, it did preserve most of the plot and remaking some of the iconic scenes in exacting detail.<br /><br />It should have been a lot more different.<br /><br />Also, while the inclusion of the songs from the first movie was a good move in my estimation, giving them a rockabilly twang does not work for me.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Product arrived quick in decent packaging (bubble insulated package) plastic wrapped, proper CD everything there.<br />Only minor complaints was the corners being a bit squished and warn (CD case is a soy paper not plastic) kind of a downfall for \\"brand new\\". And the \\"Parental Advisory\\" is not a sticker but is actually printed on the case, I don't blame the seller, but I was hoping for a clean case; as I was going to put this and Hypnotize together on a display self...Not the most attractive item to use for display when there is a blunt white sticker on a black background.<br />I have two copies of Hypnotize, unedited and the sticker was on the plastic when i opened them, so the front of cases artwork is unaltered; I figured this would be the same...<br />anyways no biggie if you don't care for a perfectO case as I do.
B004K4IZ3G|2.0|I am the least qualified person to review this movie, I've never seen the original, I was basically dragged into this with no interest, and I didn't even watch the whole thing! So you'd probably be saving some time just hitting the 'no' button now and moving on.<br /><br />Anywhoo Tron: Legacy continues the apparent legacy of the man who created an alternate reality is passed on to his son, who is like some mega-genius hacker who's living like a slob off his dad's company. I enjoyed this part quite a bit though, the company has a boring meeting when the son messes with them and runs away from the police, the whole presentation was very Disney adventure like.<br /><br />When the kid gets into the alternate reality at first it was kinda cool, he was being transported in some 1984 world where programs are forced to fight each other I guess to please the dad's clone. After awhile though what should've been dramatic movie action turned into one long video game, and in between the action scenes the dialogue/story were too basic to really delve into the realm of sci-fi, and too much of a mish mash of CGI with almost no human elements, and when those elements come on it's a vapid experience. Everything except Olivia Wilde's smokin' body that is.<br /><br />It starts to really drag on at the point where the son met his real father so my friend decided to skip to the last scene where the characters were trying to escape in some timed portal. After the movie I had no questions, there were no apparent plot holes, the whole story made sense without watching the second act in the movie. This is the only movie I've seen that seemingly had a completely unnecessary middle part.<br /><br />Daft Punk did the soundtrack, I've never really given their music a fair chance but it seems like bland techno for people who usually don't like techno, and the soundtrack in this film from what I've heard were very simple dumb 'thump thump thump' sounds. Their cameo was kinda clever, -ish.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges was really good in this like he usually is, but him alone can't carry this film. The main actor was good enough, he had some passion in his mission and goal. Olivia Wilde wasn't really much more than some T&A but she served that purpose well.<br /><br />Overall I don't really care about Tron or Disney, it seems like more mindless entertainment which is how I saw it, and if this review helped you in any way about the product then I want some of what you're smoking.r />Jeff Bridges was really good in this like he usually is, but him alone can't carry this film.

Which is why he has no problem interviewing over a hundred people about how they got their start-up started whilst tramping about the world, and why he managed to write a book about it in more or less the same period of time it takes me to figure out what barbecue sauce to eat on my chicken strips.<br /><br />My point here is this: The $100 Startup is right about everything, but it is a little overwhelming for the newcomers.<br /><br />Having had my own business for over seven years now, it's easy for me to see how each of the chapters in this book apply to business models, and I will say this: I have yet to encounter a page in this book where Guillebeau has said something with which I actually disagree. He's right, and he's actively and specifically and powerfully right. If you have the will and the wits to sit down and work your way through this book from beginning to end, you will have a viable business and no business school debt. It's a pretty excellent book for anyone wishing to start a business that they truly love.<br /><br />That said: if you are hesitant, if you have no idea what you want to do, if you start getting twitchy every time some helpful friend tries to investigate what you might, possibly, want to do, this book will not help you. This book is for those ready to take the world by the shoulders and shake the living crap out of it until all the attributes of a life well-lived are shaken out of its pockets.<br /><br />Hopefully, that describes you. If not, this book will freak you out. My recommendation: buy it anyway. Read it. Put it aside. And pick it up at least once every six months. At some point, you're going to actually get out a pencil and start going through the exercises in this book, and by the time you get to the end, you'll have a business model. And, if you actually wake up and get started, the next morning, you will have a viable business.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|When you first get this film you think oh great another low budget art film. You will be sadly mistaken. This is a cross between the Paranormal and Blair witch franchise styles. It draws yo in neatly and cleanly into an innocent group of journalism students search for truth around bears and bear hunting. By the time you exit at the end you are left wondering how the hell you got here. The special effects are awesome and they even manage a fart joke along the way.<br /><br />But this DVD and learn why they have power lines in circles!!

B007ZD17XO|5.0|I've been playing the Treasures of Montezuma games on PC (1, 2, and 3) for a while now, and LOVE them all (especially 2, which has much longer matches).  Treasures of Montezuma 3 is one of the best, if not THE best, matching games on any portable system.  I have it on my Droid X and Kindle Fire, and it looks and runs great on both platforms; especially on the bigger 7 inch screen of the Fire!  HIGHLY recommended if you like matching games, this is by far one of the best!!!  FIVE STARS PLUS!!!

0060254920|5.0|With the recent passing of Maurice Sendak, it made me think again of this classic book, Where The Wild Things Are.  I remember first reading the book and being a little frightened of the Wild Things, but also wishing that my room could turn into a jungle with trees and that I could be a king.  The book does what all great books should do, it opens your mind and imagination.

B007CKNX28|4.0|This CD is a Pleasure to listen to....and for me a bit retro....as in some songs reminding me of early Led Zepplin.<br />There's some blues and some country-gospel sounds here and all of it makes for a very enjoyable Listen.<br />I will echo some of the previous reviewers here. This is one of the Best CD's released in 2012. Springsteen's being my top favorite. In a time of \\"covers\\" and Disney-Pop, it is Great to listen to such a great CD that for me, joins my collection of Classic rock. Thanks jack! BTW: Best cuts: Missing Pieces, and Love interruption. Nothing weak though, IMHO! Enjoy!<br /><br />Atreides
B000WTNCYA|4.0|With respect to Gardot's style, this album makes for EXCELLENT background music! The first song I heard by Gardot was \\"High Night\\" when she was featured on Till Bronner's Rio. I guess from the beginning I had set myself up. I expected Gardot to be something she isn't.<br /><br />If you are looking for an upbeat future classic to add to your collection you might be looking in the wrong place, but if you are looking for a very soft voice accompanied with some very smooth jazzy instrumentals this may be the album for you. In addition, the lyrics are pretty well written.<br /><br />I cannot see this album being any jazz fans favorite, but it could hold a solid place in any collection.
0307594165|4.0|\\"Whose house is this?\\" - Toni Morrison    It is this question that ushers us into the world of Toni Morrison's tenth novel Home. Like so many of Morrison's novels, Home is not a singular thing, but a stand-in for many different conceptions. Throughout the novel, Toni Morrison asks us to think about what \\"home\\" is, and what it means to be \\"at home\\" with ones self.    Home's plot is relatively simple. Frank Money, a discharged Korean War, returns two an American brimming with racism. He receives an urgent letter telling him that he must return to Georgia to save his sister. We are to join him on his \\"odyssey\\" as he returns \\"home.\\"    At just 147 pages, I would be lying if I said I didn't wish that Home were longer. There are many chapters, like the one dedicated to Lenore (the \\"evil\\" matriarch) that I wish were longer. After a life changing incident, Lenore is forced \\"to be content with the company of the person she prized most of all-herself.\\" Morrison, unlike so many writers, has never apologized for writing women who are beholden only to themselves. She breaks away from the patriarchal tendency to believe that a woman should be someone else's best thing before she is her own. I could have spent the entire book reading about Lenore, but this is Toni Morrison's story to tell, and I can't fault her for not allowing her characters, dynamic as they are, to run off with the story. I wish more would have let her characters soar rather that just appear. They are dynamic, but dimmed a bit. I think you will find Lenore's chapter to be quite powerful.    As powerful as Lenore's chapter is, this is the story of Frank Money. It is through his eyes, and as you will find out his defiance, that we are allowed into the \\"home\\" that Morrison has constructed. Frank Money is scarred psychologically from his time spent at war. As Money returns to Georgia Morrison imbues his journey with the beautiful social commentary that only she can provide. We are asked to grapple with the consequences of war, the dynamics of intimate relationships, the painful history of medical experimentation upon Blacks, Jim Craw laws as well as customs, and many other issues that are not unique to the 1950s. One of the main issues that Morrison concerns herself with in Home, is what it means to be a man that is \\"at home\\" with himself? Is manhood honesty, vulnerability, action, or apathy? Perhaps a mixture of all?    Morrison's writing is beautiful, but understated. The scope of the novel is small, but the themes are large. This is the Morrison that we know and love, but toned down and more restrained. It's as if Morrison wrOte the entire novel with \\"less is more\\" constantly on her mind.    Overall, Home is a fitting chronicle of a particular period in the Black experience. It serves as an approachable history, one not rendered cold as can often be the case in non-fiction books. There is a shocking revelation at the end of the novel, and it perfectly encapsulates what it means to be \\"at home\\" with oneself. The events following this revelation allow the main character to be \\"at home\\" with himself. It provides an example to us all of what it means to come home.    We should work hard to not become strangers in our own house. We should strive to not be a house of lies. Frank takes on this challenge. Will you?    Review By: @Anti_Intellect.

1416960953|5.0|This whimsical book has superb illustrations. Holly Black's witty text is very good but the drawings and watercolors of the various members of the fairy families are outstanding. The drawings are elegant and color illustrations are accompanied by charcoal and pencil drawings of exceptional skill and elegance. I collect art history and art books and I purchased this book due to the exceptional quality of the illustrations.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I am enjoying the game so far.  The zoom comes in handy and I had a little trouble reading the boxes of text.  most puzzles were straight forward but a couple needed hints which you're punished for using.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I have read this book twice now. Both times were amazing! The description of the characters makes it feel as if you have known them forever and that they are right beside you. King knows how to make you feel like you are inside the story and participating in everything the characters are going through. For those who like a long read and to get their heart racing, this is the perfect book for you!
B000GIXLO8|5.0|a great movie, and an even better extended edition! definitely worth the 6 dollars I paid for it! being able to have both in such an inexpensive set (that actually looks fairly nice on the shelf) is an awesome deal.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was a little hard but it was also hard to put it down<br />it also depends what kind of person you are if you are a fussterated person  no  if you are a person that likes challenges  yes
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I was so disappointed in this book.  It came highly recommended for my book group which in itself was disappointing because there wasn't much to discuss.  I almost felt like it was written to be a made for TV movie with every element of disaster in it.  There were parts that were very readable with a good story line and then it devolved into the Perils of Pauline!!  I almost expected the heroine of the book to be tied to the railroad tracks.  There was so much promise and we all felt that it was very short on delivery.

B003Y5H5EW|2.0|Pretty weak story, been done before with other films.  Pretty predictable as well.  The acting was alright, pretty much Kate being the sole player in this whole movie.
0688014291|1.0|I normally don't understand how reviewers can give a book 1-Star when the majority of other reviewers have given it 5-Stars.  I've assumed the 1-Star peeps just didn't \\"get it\\" or that they were exaggerating their low rating for effect.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I now find myself in that position.  This book was horrible.  I tried to pull some value from it, but it just wasn't in there.  During the 30 minutes it took to read this (yes, it's that short), I found myself starting to feel bad for the authors.  Kind of in the way you feel bad for a child that does something totally incorrectly, but her parents don't want to hurt her feelings, so they give unwarranted praise instead.  But then I realized they've obviously made boatloads of money off of this thing, so now I just feel bad for everyone who has read it.<br /><br />Seriously, there are so many great business books out there.  How this one has managed to sneak its way near the top is baffling.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|A bit of a wonderful enigma, this Adele is.<br /><br />On the one hand, she's one of the truly great vocalists of our time.  A voice so full of nuance and emotion that she pulls your heart strings every which way, and often transports you into the past, a past partly real and partly imagined.  She's a youngster, yet she sings with a maturity that suggests already having lived a long and rich life.<br /><br />On the other hand, when she banters with the audience, she can be downright crass, making it clear that her British background has almost surely not been upper-crusty.  Her youth becomes strikingly evident.<br /><br />The enigma actually works though, because it gives Adele an air of authenticity.  Enough to convince me that she's the real deal, a rarely wonderful diamond in the rough who's now being cut and polished, with the result that her brilliance is quickly sparkling more and more brightly, indeed dazzling us.<br /><br />I look forward to experiencing what her evolution as an artist will bring.  I can only imagine ... or maybe I can't.  Meanwhile, watch this live performance and try to catch this shooting star!
B0063IH60K|4.0|the graphics are excellent too many turns from the stack make the game too easy. I win too often. make it real.
B006Z7Z3R2|3.0|I really wanted to love this movie since I am a Connecticut resident (movie was filmed here) who loves good low-budget horror & the beginning of The House of the Devil.  Unfortunately the great slow burn that Ti West produced led to a completely unbelievable and over the top ending much like The House of the Devil.  My favorite parts of this movie are when the innkeepers Claire and Luke are talking amongst themselves and looking for EVPs.  Horror movies don't need to have something new happening every 5 minutes to be interesting, and I appreciated that West took the time to develop the personalities of Claire and Luke.  I just wish that West used the main characters' naivety to show how \\"believers\\" really act when they are confronted with realistic paranormal activity.  The ending was similar to action horror that is spit out of Hollywood every autumn and it did not fit with the tone of the rest of the movie.  The next time I watch this I'll probably turn it off around the time that Claire gets a warning from the celebrity Ms. Rease-Jones.  Ti West is a great horror writer/director when it comes to tone, ambience, and character development.  I'm crossing my fingers that when his next movie comes out that he puts more effort into writing a really good, thought provoking ending that will garner him more respect in the horror community.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is fun but the &quot;price&quot; of the game goes up till it is so hard to earn anything new so itgets kind of old

B000FC1HBY|5.0|(***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST BOOK***)<br />For some reason it seems that most liked this book less than the first. I must admit that I don't get it. The only reason that I can think of is that they were Ned Stark fans.<br />The new characters are great. Davos, Melisandre, Stannis Baratheon and all the rest...<br />We dive deeper into the religious world of ASoIaF. New religions are being introduced, and we learn more about the belief in the old gods and the new ones (The Seven).<br />The characters we've come to know and love in the first book gain depth and it really feels like GRRM knows the people he writes about. The introduction of Theon Greyjoy, a neglectable character in the first book, as a viewpoint character is great. He is by far one of the most interesting additions.<br />Tyrion Lannister and Arya Stark seems to become the center of focus in this book, and Ned's absence did not bother me at all.<br />The plot revolves around the continuation of the war between the Starks and the Lannister, with the addition of the Baratheon brothers, each claiming the throne to himself. Daenerys Targaryen's journy continues after the birth of her dragons, and Jon Snow's adventures further broaden our knowledge on the world beyond the wall.<br />After reading more than 2,000 pages I wanted to take a break from the ASoIaF universe, but after a few weeks I stopped reading whatever it was I was reading, and started the third book, anxious to learn what happens next.<br />I truly enjoyed this book.

0307951529|5.0|I stayed up all night reading The $100 Startfup without stopping - it was that good of a read. The problem was, that after reading I could not go to to sleep, as I had so many ideas flowing and wanted to begin taking action right away.<br /><br />As a self-employed and location-independent business owner since 1995, I took away a ton of inspiration and fresh ideas from The $100 Startup.<br /><br />As mentioned in the title of my review, I wish this book existed before got my MBA. Chris is correct in stating in his book that business school doesn't train people to operate a small business. Something I learned the hard and expensive way. I also used to teach MBA students marketing and found it frustrating that there were no simple tools available to help the many solo entrpreneurs (like me) launch and market their businesses. For example, a typical MBA has nearly a half dozen or so marketing courses, complete with gigantic textbooks full of marketing theory and strategy examining corporate businesses.<br /><br />What I love about The $100 Startup is that it simplifies everything you need to do to launch a profitable business, and leaves out all of the stuff that you don't need to do.<br /><br />How about filling in the blanks to get a one page business plan? A one page promotion plan? Yes, this is all you need to begin. It doesn't have to be overwhelming, confusing, difficult. Or expensive.<br /><br />Main takeaway: Stop with the analysis paralysis and overthinking and go put your offer on the market. Learn from what you do, and tweak as you go. Rinse. Repeat.<br /><br />Chris lays out a comple strategy for launching a business in a simple an easy-to-impletment form (6 Steps to Getting Started Right Now), complete with check lists, templates, case studies and dozens of questions you can ask yourself to clarify your offer and easily connect with your audience.<br /><br />Already have a business and wish if were bringing in more money?

Exactly how to connect the dollars with the work we love to do is also outlined in this book.<br /><br />Speaking to the $100 Startup Title:<br />The title of the book comes directly from the research Chris and his team compiled over the course of three years. One of the first things they did was survey over 1,500 people like him, who built businesses earning more than $50K from a modest investment. 36% started with less than $100. I remember filling out that survey myself over three years ago and trying hard to come up with any expenses beyond domain registration and website hosting fees for launching The Creative Entrepreneur. Another 22% launched with less than $500.<br /><br />This information shows up quite far into the book, while the first two stories in the book lead with owners of retail shops. For that reason, I was initiallly skeptical about the title and claim of The $100 Startup, thinking it sounded sort of hype-y, a la \\"4 Hour Workweek\\". I think the book would have elimitated this skepticism by leading with several $100 startup stories, and fitting in the other examples a bit later in the book, and by introducing that research chart sooner.<br /><br />Overall Advice: Read this book and get inspired. Read it again with paper and pen to map out your startup. Then...go startup.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games movie affected me in a way I would not have completely predicted. It is, of course, a cautionary tale of a dystopian future that we should all wish to avoid. That said, I was moved to order the book for my Kindle to see how closely the movie followed the book. Quite closely, it turns out. Later, I ordered books 2 and 3.  While the second and third books are not quite as compelling as the first book, they are page turners and well worth reading. I believe I heard that movies of books 2 and 3 are in the making. I am looking forward to seeing them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy is totally addicting!!  I am not an avid reader but once I caught wind of the buzz surrounding these books I purchased Fifty Shades for my Kindle Fire and was instantly hooked.  Never in my 37 years have I been so quickly sucked into a book.  The writing is basic and repetitive but this erotic love story will captivate you.  These books are hard to put down and even harder to say goodbye to once finished. The author leaves her readers begging for more, more, more!
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|this is the best gravity game yet that I ever played. you should get this app because you have gravitation

B004QL7K70|3.0|\\"Tonight's about the girls we never had a shot at. Tonight's about changing the game.\\" When three \\"loser\\" high school seniors decide to throw the biggest party of the year in order to become more popular they had no idea what they were getting into. Plans and rules go out the window as what starts as a party of no more then 50 begins to escalate quickly. I have been saying that the \\"reality\\" movies have been used up and are really kind of annoying to watch. While this isn't a total exception this one is at least watchable. On the other hand it is also nothing new. Combine \\"American Pie\\" with \\"Superbad\\" and a hand-held camera and you get this movie. This is nothing amazing at all and those other movies were much better, but I have also seen much worse and this one was at least entertaining. Very, very unbelievable but entertaining. I again wonder if I just went to the wrong school because nothing like this was even thought up when I went. Does that make me old?. Overall, nothing original but a watchable teenage party movie. I give it a B.

Guillebeau's message: You have everything you need - the money, the skills & the idea you have are all you need to get started. I wish someone had told me this before I spent money, time and worry floundering over a business plan I never really needed. This book reminds unconventional entrepreneurs that the best way to begin is simply to begin. And then offers lots of actionable, practical tips to help improve your small business along the way. Great book -- mucho big thanks to Guillebeau for offering these ideas up to the world!

B004FOA84A|5.0|I was worried about this game playing on my Kindle Fire but it played beautifully. I see a lot of complaints about it being too short and it is a bit quickly played only if you're familiar with this type of game. Besides the game is only  49&cent;. I just wish it was longer because it was so fun. I did need online help with some of it. For players new to this type of game, ignore nothing and tap on every inch of the screen because if you don't you will feel like a complete idiot when you get help and realize the answers are staring you in the face. I know I did.
0385535139|4.0|I noticed the way life has changed the last 20 or 25 years and its what concerns us. Here in north america<br />we are very much more educated,very savy,and very intent on learning about the kind of life we've sketched<br />out for ourselves...a niche in our ecosystems. Even our politicians know that even though we're not really<br />spiritual or religious that much,we just like the relics of thinking we are,but we do like the imagery of<br />being clean refreshed...like the current debate in politics in labelling the other guy as dirty. The court room<br />theatrics with all the deep knowledge of dissonance,or giving the other side unfavourable images of the other side is taking the place of rational debates...almost like we really dont want to debate since we are convinced we will lose we fabricate stories or tear someone apart everything but debate. That's why these books of john grisham are so relevant and good to read and so popular...they tell us about law and order...people fabricating making things up and the heart of our communities lie criminals and deadbeats. In this case we cant say these stories are not true he has pulled them from our newspapers..Finley & Figg the dickens type law firm and you must read to learn about them<br />and the novel is largely about them and how they can be dismantled at novels end,there are elements about legal teams sexualizing themselves in the court room,always like a legal team dresses up a young lady to disturb the flow in the court room...the author describes it in this way. We also have the case of an anti cholesterol drug which is defeated in a lawsuit(its claims anyways) and almost bankrupts its legal team. There is also a case where american companies are using poisonous toys from children,due to the lead or whatever coating made in china-mexico-and many southeast asian nations...and this is successful and the plaintiff's success seek and get redress. This is largely a subplot introduced here about children,their oral fixations as children,poisonings...what metaphors is this author elaborating on...to me the cases showcase the relevance of good judges to a good justice system and the author has developed what they used to call a potboiler...we've learned so much about life anmd modern life and the court system from this writer...and how people can corrupt a good system...like the peddlars and their toys...its not the system or anything else that's wrong...their vices would find their target in any system...tales of human nature and even children wont obscure the plots of evil people
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is just that! Amazing. It saves me money, and I would suggest this app to anyone. It works perfectly fine on my Kindle. And once the download is complete, the music is just as if I bought it though Amazon, iTunes, ect.

0891419063|5.0|Me and my family were shortly going to California and some of the family went to Hastings to quickly pick up a CD or book for the trip. I've wanted this book for a couple years and when I saw it, this would be the perfect thing to read while driving all the way from Idaho to Cali. I've seen the 5 star rating on Amazon and had high expectations for this book.<br /><br />All I have to say is, that this is one of the few times, where my expectations were extremely high and they were actually beaten. I found out this was more than just a book... Reading this, you truly get a sense of World War II in the Pacific. This War was messed up, this just wasn't some tough adventure, this was survival. The enemy they were fighting was an unpredictable enemy and ruthless enemy, that did not surrender to anyone. The Japanese soldiers would even jump into your fox-hole at night and stab you while asleep and shell you unforgivably. I learned the people who went over there are heroes. I have a deeper respect for those Marines who fought. Throughout Sledge's hellish life in War, you get to know him, you understand the pain and loss he has to go through and through these conditions he becomes a new desensitized man. This book brought a tear to my eye at times, made me laugh out loud and at times horrify and disgust me. The images that you create from the text you read are powerful. I'm reading 'China Marine' right now, which is the sequel, which is great as well. If you only read one book about World War II, this is the book you should read. A book that will be with you your entire life. This is a disturbing book, but that just makes it all much more memorable and true. A real eye opener for me. 5 stars.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I remember growing up watching this movie on my VHS tape on my VCR (yes, I am ashamed to admit, that is how old I am), and I still love this movie to this day. I gained a lot of respect for Disney after they released this movie because the heroine was brown haired and brown eyed, just like me. (I guess that's why they have different princesses now-a-days). This is simply a great movie for anyone of any age that transcends time!
0345803485|4.0|This book is light, mass market pornography. I did enjoy it its sexually adventuresome theme but the female lead character, Ana Steele was too naive to be believable. Christian Grey is  a bit of a cardboard cut out, too, but at least he rings true as a sexual dominant. As a cautionary tale of a young woman seduced by a man of high intellect, great financial means and off the wall sexual tastes, it works. As erotica and an easy, hot read, it also works very well, but as a really good read, it fails because it leaves far too many questions that would flesh out its characters unanswered.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I read this book primarily because reviewers praised Lauren Oliver's writing style.  I have to say that I was not disappointed.  This book is beautifully written, and is a solid story from beginning to end!
0345803485|1.0|The other reviews sum up my feelings. Most importantly, it was very poorly written with far too much repetition. I wanted to set the book on fire, Fahrenheit 451-style,  after reading for the hundreth time how Mr. Grey was \\"bothered\\" by the protagonist biting her lip. Somehow I made it to about page 250 and then settled on skimming the rest of the book. Missed nothing but awkward and far from realistic sexual encounters between an annoying, self-conscious brat and an indulgent business man with serious personal issues.<br /><br />How is this book a best seller? I am deeply disappointed in society. I hope to god my mom doesn't read this book.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|In Delirium (Book 1), I kindof felt like an outside observer.  Lena is just tasting what \\"life\\" is really about, and waking up to the brainwashed ideologies she has known for her whole life to be \\"right\\".  In Pandemonium (Book 2), we see her progress from being confused over being \\"human\\" or being cured, to being confused about how she fits into her new world.  I really appreciate the care taken by the author to allow us to carefully develop with her... as she finds out what a life of hardship really is in the Wilds and the underworld of a major city, as she discovers her strengths in darkness, as she discovers her weakness in love.  Just when she decides what her life will be, and thinks she has it all figured out, her world is shaken again.  I appreciate the care taken to show us how disposable individuals are treated both in cured society and in the Wilds and how different people fight for different reasons.<br /><br />Some reviews didn't like the Now and Then setup.  I actually like the setup of the book.  The choppiness of the storyline was not a distraction in my opinion.<br /><br />I will forgive the author for making this story into yet another love triangle with a confused teenage girl at the middle of it... hopefully this is not what Book 3 will be about!
B007LYB0PC|5.0|I will not rehash the musical aspects of this record (which are awesome), but wanted to say what a wonderfully executed record this is on vinyl.  It's great to see an artist who still supports the medium with a well mastered record, great graphics, a big lyrics sheet, and a digital download code.  Nothing beats listening to new music ON VINYL for the first time.  Well done, Mr. White!

I can't wait for E.L James to come out with more!

He is still to young to appreciate the story line, but anything that grabs his attention long enough for me to unload the dishwasher is well worth it.<br /><br /> If not purchasing for yourself I suggest pairing this movie with a [[ASIN:B00130G2ZS WubbaNub Infant Pacifier Penguin - Limited Edition]], with [[ASIN:B002C30SAA Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Penguin]], to make a great winter baby shower gift. Roll up a few soft blankets to cushion the backpack.

B0072GPQ72|5.0|War Horse is an excellent movie.  I saw it at the movies but watching it on my 52 inch TV in the comfort of my home was far better.  The sharpness and colors are far more brilliant on the TV than the movie screen...just my opinion.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Book was a good follow up to The Hunger Games.  Still having issues with the actual content of the story and thought it took a little longer for this story to grab me.  The Hunger Games was non-stop action from page one and this one didn't quite live up to the first.  Was still a quick read and a good \\"middle\\" book for a trilogy.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|The movie has good story, and lot's of action. It's kind of like Blade movies, the first one was focused on the action and story and the second one was mostly about action. To me honestly this movie is better than the second part of the Underworld, Kate still looks hot as always, and is kicking butts.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I guess it's hard to follow a book like the first one in this trilogy (The Hunger Games) but I thought Ms. Collins might be able to pull it off.  Boy was I disappointed.  Felt like there were senseless elements to the story and the ending left me wanting.  The book just ended with no real satisfaction for the reader. I get that the author was trying to educate youth about war and it's affects as well as the direction our society is taking (and how close we really are to this kind of existence), but there still could've been a better ending.  Maybe what I was looking for was more hope.  The first two books really give you that sense of hope and accomplishment while the last book is just dark, depressing and well, realistic.  Was really hoping for more not just for me, but for the young people also reading it.
B007SGM084|4.0|Such an amazing set! I have finished the second book and I am so sad it's almost over! I am absolutely in love with this set (and Christian). :)

Not to long ago I heard Sail and was like oh that's a cool song and then I was like I should hear the CD so I bought it and was extremely impressed by it, this band does everything right, I cannot find one bad song on this cd, but the last song is a little too long but still a good song. I got to see them live at Weenie Roast and wow, if you think this album is good, go see them live!! THEY ARE AMAZING LIVE, THEY ARE JUST SHEER ENERGY AND EXCITEMENT! I CANT WAIT TO SEE THEM LIVE AGAIN, BUT TILL THEN I WILL BE HAVING THIS CD ON REPEAT!!! AWESOME BAND CHECK THEM OUT NOW!!!!!
B00526ZKYS|3.0|If you are looking for an easy read  is Delirium is a nice choice. I understand the author was trying to set this book up for the rest of the trilogy but it was a little verbose and could have lost about 100 pages . The second of the trilogy is much more engaging.

B007FLHW3K|5.0|I have a Kickstarter version of these lights mounted to my front wheel - they make me visible from both left and right side approach - something none of my other lights do. My light is permanently mounted to my bike - hasn't been messed with in the 4+ months I've been using it. At night, the light is bright enough to give you good visibility all around your front tire.

0446401307|2.0|This a 'Harry Bosch' novel, generally a guarantee that it will be value for money.<br /><br />I picked it up and at first thought I'd got a large print edition as there seemed to be about 12 words to the page.  I read it and as I was doing so it seemed really lightweight because generally Connelly writes something that's not too throw away.  The further I got into it the more it felt like it was a short story that had been padded out.<br /><br />So, when I finished it there was no surprise to see at the back of my edition that it was originally a story that had been serialized for the New York Times Sunday Magazine and had been \\"re-visited\\" (padded out no less ) by the author and put out as a book.<br /><br />Tacky and very disappointing -  as for the story well, there's a murder and radioactive material is stolen and it turns out the the entire FBI has no idea, the entire Los Angeles Police Department has no idea -  Harry being the only one to figure it out.<br /><br />Connelly does this every now and again , writes some utter tripe and then redeems himself ,but this is poor, really poor.  (2007)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A delicious guilty pleasure!  Don't over think it-- just enjoy it. Sexy and romantic, intriguing and funny, this book is escapism at its best.

Now that I have completed (and thoroughly enjoyed) all three, I have this to say to the author...more please!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It is a film Marvel fans have anxiously waited to see since Nick Fury first pitched the Avengers Initiative to Tony Stark in the post-credits scene in 2008's \\"Iron Man.\\" Since then, we have been introduced to all the major players in four well-crafted films (\\"The Incredible Hulk,\\" \\"Iron Man 2,\\" \\"Thor,\\" and \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\") that each stand on their own as a well-crafted superhero films, but also serve to establish the larger Marvel universe that would come together in \\"The Avengers.\\" With writer-director Joss Whedon (\\"Serenity,\\" \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\") at the helm, there was no doubt that this would be a remarkable film. But I was not prepared for what I experienced: the greatest superhero film yet made!<br /><br />What really drives this film are the characters. I was pleasantly surprised by how the four main leads (Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, and Mark Ruffalo, replacing Ed Norton as Bruce Banner), having come off of lead roles in their own films, meshed very well together. We see the tension amongst them, as the differing egos come together for the first time, even as they try to stem the tide of a major threat. This really is an ensemble cast, and each actor does very well in their roles.<br /><br />The movie has incredible action sequences, and some exceptional visual effects work. But all of this would be for naught if the story failed to deliver. And the script, penned by Whedon and Zack Penn, delivers a story that is exciting, dramatic, humorous, and everything film-goers expect from an awesome film. And when put in the hands of a top-notch cast, you have the recipe for a superhero film unlike any other!<br /><br />If the film has any drawbacks, there is but one, and it has nothing to do with the film itself. If you are unfamiliar with the comic books from which the movie is based, or have not seen the five films leading up to it, then you might be a bit lost with everything. But for those who are diehard aficionados of the Marvel universe and films, this is the payoff we all wanted, and more. For those who enjoy the superhero genre, or are just lovers of great films, then I highly recommend \\"The Avengers,\\" the greatest superhero film of them all!<br /><br />Grade: A+dos of the Marvel universe and films, this is the payoff we all wanted, and more.

I have to say, I thought it was fine, maybe if you have watched another version and you are trying to detect a difference you might notice something, but I didn't notice a thing. Fantastic movie, and absolutely nothing wrong with the picture or sound quality in my opinion :)

B00004RFFI|4.0|This is a great Movie, but some downright bad editing.. for example: the flying cow scene, watch the road, one second there on a single lane dirt road between two ponds and when the camera angles inside the truck to catch the drama you can look out the drivers side mirror and see a double yellow line... AND THEN A CAR PASSES GOING THE OTHER WAY !!!  so yes, bad editing.. this is only one example, there are many more in this movie, still a great movie and alot of fun to watch, just alot of errors from a editing/production viewpoint.
B003R50FRI|5.0|Shantaram is one of the best novels I have ever read. While it is long (about 1,000 pages) and frequently harrowing it is so well written and uplifting that I found it hard to put it down. It is a story full of emotion and human philosophy - I would give it 6 stars if I could.<br /><br />The amazing thing is that the novel is almost auto-biographical. Roberts was born in Australia and became a drug addict after a failed marriage and loss of custody of his daughter. He was imprisoned for 19 years for a string of armed robberies performed to support his heroin addiction. He escaped from prison and fled to Mumbai where lived in the Mumbai slums for years and set up a clinic in the slums to help his neighbours. He became an addict again and worked for the Mumbai mafia. Eventually he was recaptured and finished his sentence in Australia and then returned to Mumbai.<br /><br />The story follows Roberts' life story pretty closely in fictional form. If you have been to Mumbai you will especially enjoy the beginning where the main character, Lindsay, is picked up by an Indian taxi tout thinking he would go to a luxury hotel - but Lindsay finishes up living in the slums with the taxi tout who becomes one of his best friends.<br /><br />Shantaram is the name given by his Indian friends, or Linbaba or Lin, the larger-than-life hero, which means \\"man of God's peace\\". This is what his Indian friends think of Lin.<br /><br />If you like a story with substance, philosophy and intense human emotions I am sure you will love this book. A book with nearly 400 five star ratings for the US version really speaks for itself.
0393088774|5.0|Paul Krugman has been cast in the unenviable role of economic Cassandra and, compounding his problems, he is a true and consistent liberal in a conservative society.  In the accurately but unappealingly titled \\"End this Depression Now\\", he summarizes his perspectives.  The salient virtues of the book are the simplicity of presentation, the logic of his arguments, the ability to anticipate and refute expected criticisms and the trenchant, compelling writing style.  \\"All indications are that the economy will remain weak for a very long time unless our policy makers change course,\\" he wrote in the introduction, \\"...my aim here is to bring pressure, by means of an informed public, to get that course changed and bring an end to this depression.\\" He remains an inveterate optimist as he believes someone in power is listening: so far, that does not appear to be the case.<br /><br />\\"End\\" does not delve deeply into the causes of the economic crisis, but adequate detail has been provided for understanding the genesis of the problem (deregulation, skewed policies enacted at the behest of the economic elite and others).  Instead, Krugman concentrates on solutions.  His main point is this:  the present US (and, for that matter, EU) economic crisis was almost inevitable and the methods for rectifying it are self-evident.  The Great Depression and how that problem was addressed successfully and not provides the requisite historical background.  That history suggests the currently fashionable (EU and US) program of  \\"austerity,\\" (draconian restrictions on government spending, address the budget deficit as the primary focus) is not only wrong, he argues, but it's compounding the problems.  While statistics indicate that the Great Recession is \\"over\\", it is beyond dispute that the recovery has been slow and it is functionally stalled...at least for the \\"99%\\". More than 24 million Americans remain unemployed or underemployed and the social/economic consequences of that fact are currently bad and will be devastating far into the future.  Governmental policies are at fault.<br /><br />The crux of the problem by Krugman's analysis is an enduring lack of \\"demand\\" generated by stagnant wages, lost opportunity, high unemployment, economic and social stratification and current policy:  it is not \\"high\\" taxes; it is not \\"big government\\"; it is not environmental or other regulation. The solution Krugman offers is application of the economic platform outlined first by John Maynard Keynes, who posited that government spending (infrastructure development, targeted support for key industries, etc) has an essential role in saving the \\"free market\\" from its own periodic and predictable excesses.. He writes: \\"Now is the time for the government to spend more, not less, until the private sector is ready to carry the economy forward again.\\"<br /><br />Although the book was just published, Krugman's prescient insights are already being validated.  A serious shortcoming of all authors I've read on this subject is the tacit assumption that the social and political status quo will somehow prevail.  Rather, given job prospects and loss of assets as experienced by a significant majority domestically and in the EU, an explosion with unforeseen (but probably serious) consequences is probably in the offing.  For example, in Europe, where severe austerity has been implemented, it has not only manifestly failed to revive economies, but the Sarkozy government and the Greek government have already fallen as a direct result of economic policy. Political extremism (especially the far Right) is on the rise:  for example, the unapologetically neo-Nazi \\"Golden Dawn\\" in Greece and the \\"Hungarian Guard\\"-Jobbik Party in Hungary.  The Euro zone is in peril (Greece appears to be on the verge of withdrawing).  The parallels with Depression-era politics and outcomes are obvious: \\"You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows\\", to quote Bob.<br /><br />Fortunately, perhaps,Krugman's book and his relentless pursuit of his socio-economic platform is attracting significant attention, some of it actually favorable.  In the current \\"Rolling Stone\\", editor Jann Wenner asked Obama if he read Krugman: the answer was \\"Yes, but...\\".  Krugman was also interviewed in that publication and an essay outlining the details of the book appears in the current \\"New York Review of Books\\".  A somewhat contrary line of argument (well worth considering) appears in the current issue of \\"Foreign Affairs\\" by Raghuram Rajan (\\"The True Lessons of the Recession: The West Can't Borrow and Spend Its Way to Recovery\\").  Still, Rajan's conclusion is similar to Krugman's: \\"The industrial countries have a choice. They can act as if all is well except that their consumers are in a funk and so what John Maynard Keynes called \\"animal spirits\\" must be revived through stimulus measures. Or they can treat the crisis as a wake-up call and move to fix all that has been papered over in the last few decades and thus put themselves in a better position to take advantage of coming opportunities.\\" Significant elements of the \\"fix\\" Rajan advocates (infrastructure improvement, educational reform, etc) are close to Krugman's prescriptions.<br /><br />So, Krugman, the Piper at the Gates of (Economic) Dawn might be heeded (doubtful) or he might again find himself in the role of Cassandra.  He also might be wrong, but that seems unlikely.  In any event, careful study of Krugman's writing is essential for informed discussion of the economy and the future of Western societies.Krugman's book and his relentless pursuit of his socio-economic platform is attracting significant attention, some of it actually favorable.

B000WC39ZY|2.0|It's Liza Minnelli's show.  DeNiro seems to be an afterthought.  They just don't click.  And he's sooooo effing rude and boorish throughout.  We tend to forget him as who should be rude and boorish to Liza Minnelli?<br /><br />Robert DeNiro is.  That's who.<br /><br />My main complaint of the film is the startling attempt to make Liza Minnelli look so much like Judy Garland.  Even the snow scene conjures up \\"St. Louis\\"-esque visions.  Liza dresses as Judy in \\"For Me And My Gal\\", \\"Meet Me In St. Louis\\", \\"The Clock\\", et cetera.  Granted, this is a 40's style musical and a 40's style wardrobe should be the order of the day.  But how much is too much?<br /><br />This is too much.<br /><br />Even her \\"Happy Endings\\" number is all too reminiscent of \\"Born In A Trunk\\".  In fact, the whole film reeks of \\"A Star Is Born\\", but without the elan.  And elan is so sorely what is needed here.<br /><br />Thankfully, the score is wonderful, and if you listen to the soundtrack without seeing the film, you'll know this.  (Later on, in her concerts, she would take the intro to \\"But The World Goes 'Round\\" in a decidely awful direction).  But here, looking like Garland in a recording studio, she nails it.  It's her best rendition of the song.  Ever.<br /><br />The title tune is performed in a nightclub owned by DeNiro but it may as well be \\"Judy At Carnegie Hall\\".  The effect is stunning and uncomfortable.  You almost long for Mama.<br /><br />Sidney Guillaroff, the hairdresser who did Garland's hair at MGM, supposedly did Liza's for this film as well.  And supposedly Liza had her mother's old dressing room.  So, while it isn't Liza's version of \\"Mama\\", it is still eerie nevertheless.<br /><br />Stick with the soundtrack.

B000NI8F5G|4.0|this film as a huge, splashy musical.  It's a wonderful musical, but I wouldn't call it the epitome of Hollywood musicals from the \\"heyday\\" of Hollywood.  For starters, the parade was already beginning to pass by musicals in favor of more realistic fare.  The tastes of film going audiences had begun to change and here is where the genius of the film reverberates.<br /><br />Twenty-two years before this film was made, SOUND had come to the movies, little by little, bit by bit.  And little by little, bit by bit, the tastes of the average moviegoer had begun to rethink itself and change.  And this is what the film is all about.  Forget the musical numbers for a moment.<br /><br />The transition from silent to sound WAS an interesting, history-making time in popular culture, from the grandest mogul to the biggest star. Stakes were high and everyone stood a chance to lose everything.  Or gain.  Careers were ruined when audiences heard a long standing favorite speak with THAT VOICE?????<br /><br />The best way to disguise \\"that voice\\" was in musical numbers.  For a few years, after 1929 or so, nearly every film had some scrap of a song sung by a lead (or leads) to gauge audiences reaction.  After all, just because a long standing favorite couldn't \\"speak\\", how could you turn your backs if they sang a plaintive love song?  They turned their backs on so many and the moguls sweated behind big desks.<br /><br />And \\"Singin' In The Rain\\" captures that.  People remember a gargantuan film, but it isn't, really.  In fact, with the exception of four numbers, \\"Good Morning\\", \\"Broadway Melody\\", \\"Make \\"em Laugh\\" and the title tune, what does anyone remember?  Debbie Reynolds is overly-chirpy (what the hell, it's her first really big role).  Donald O'Connor is funny in the \\"Make 'em Laugh\\" number, but otherwise just hanging around.  Gene Kelly is superb.  He strolls off the \\"Singin' In The Rain\\" set (read: number) as an homage to Ray Bolger's scarecrow in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\".  And JeanHagen is priceless.  She is as bratty and spoiled and unforgettable as Jean Harlow in \\"Dinner At Eight\\".<br /><br />I don't think that this is \\"the greatest musical\\" of all time, as so many others do.  Nor do I consider it the greatest musical to come out of the Arthur Freed Unit.<br /><br />But it's a helluva show, nevertheless.

B003Y5H5F6|4.0|So what if this movie is predictable? It is a fun ride. If anyone is looking for a cerebral movie, this isn't it. I was really hoping all these years that Selene would return and with a child. After being suspended in time for a few years she does. But where's the child? Some spoilers ahead. Aha! Enter the evil scientists'. They captured Selene and Michael, imprisoned them in cryo tanks and took their child to perform experiments on. They have waited impatiently until child reached menses age in order to harvest genetic material.  Over time she has \\"felt\\" a closeness to Selene so she releases her and Selene proceeds to wreak havoc and create mayhem. Her boy friend disappeared, she thinks he is dead. She doesn't know she has had a child just yet. Selene is REALLY ANGRY and REALLY MEAN. She has much greater powers now. She slays her way to the heart of the problem where she nearly meets her match in a monstrous monster of a Lycan. Evil scientist just happens to be Lycan and he and others are creating uber Lycans immune to silver. The battle rages on. Did I mention that Child is not a \\"child\\" but a hybrid, daughter of Selene and Michael? Child dislikes head Scientist intensely. She kicks adz as well as her mother, ridding the world of Evil Scientist quite handily. Listen for the double entendre after she does that.  Selene finds Michael while decimating security personnel and Lycans and she shoots a hole in the cryo chamber to set him free while she continues to rid the world of Lycans. The ending finds Selene and Eve(?) and a helpful vampire entering the room where Michael was imprisoned but just \\"that much\\" too late for he has disappeared yet again. They race to the roof to see a helicopter vanish in the night sky. This role belongs to Kate. Without her there would be no Underworld series. I am glad they are back. I am salivating for the fifth installment. A mother and daughter team. Oh boy oh boy oh boy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game so much; the only annoying part is when I cant get past a level. I don't reccomend skips; they don't give you the satisfaction of having solved a level.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I really like this game. It has great graphics and its a lot of fun for the most part. The only complaints I have is that everything gets so expensive that it takes a long time to earn enough to buy an animal and then each family member. I also lost a baby because I didn't return when it was ready which was very frustrating.  I'm a working Mom and cannot sit on my kindle all the time. Besides this... I really enjoy the game.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I saw it, twice!  i CAN'T WAIT TO OWN IT! When it came to the theater I saw it once with the wife and then again with the boys.  It loved th emovie just as much both times and laughed just as hard both times.  The simple fact that you have Joss Whedom (Buffy, Angel, Dollhouse, FireFly, Cabin in the Woods) at the helm and the chemistry between the actors, special affects that have set a new high bar and a story line that is just damned enjoyable made for a fantastic movie.  Even my wife, who thinks the super hero movies are all over rated, loved it and thought it was the best movie she had seen in a very long time.<br /><br />The best thing is that Whedon's style always comes through in the humor and the dialog, which in the Avengers was fanastic.  He even brought humor to the Hulk that was aboslutely side splitting funny.  One of my boys nearly rolled out of the movie theater seat laughing so hard!<br /><br />All I can say is go see it on the big screen in 3D, it was supremely enjoyable and well worth the money.
B000GCFO0S|4.0|I was a bit skeptical when I went to go see Silent Hill at the movie theaters when it was released years ago. Traditionally, video game movie adaptations have been huge failures. None quite were able to translate what made the game a classic onto film. Either because it was neutered by film makers (Super Mario Bros) or because the game just wasn't able to transition well to film (Tekken). But that kind of changed with Silent Hill. While some changes to the script were to be expected, the way that the film makers were able to keep most of the story elements in tact was pleasantly refreshing.<br /><br />And now that the film is on Blu-ray and keeps a lot of what you saw on the big screen in HD resolution for your home theater is quite remarkable. Every little detail, from the horrific death scenes to the detailed nightmarish walls come to life on your TV screen. This satisfying transition to home video makes Silent Hill one of the most complete and perfected adaptations from video game to film ever.

1609613937|1.0|I bought this book thinking is was going to be different.  Boy was I in for a rude awakening.  You can really sum this book up in a couple sentences.  Eat starch foods, nothing else.  No meat, eggs, dairy and fat is a BIG NO-NO.  This would be the most boring diet ever.  There is no way I would be able to adopt this way of such boring eating.  I like my beer and chips to much.  No wonder you lose weight, the food is so bland that you will not overeat at all.<br /><br />Anyway save your money, this book is not worth it.  Plain potatoes, plain rice, plain beans, plain plain plain. I think you get the drift.
0385344228|4.0|Although this novel provides the reader with an inside look at the criminal justice system from both a prosecution and defense perspective, it is, primarily, a story of two types of parental devotion. One parent is blindly devoted while the other takes a more realistic and, therefore, painful view of both their child and the resulting \\"responsibilities\\" which result.<br />Perhaps because I'm from Massachusetts, both the setting and the nuances idiosyncratic to the area were fascinating and highlighted the fact that US criminal laws are not consistent from state to state.<br />I found this novel to be an engaging and exciting read with subtle twists and turns which carry the reader through one family's ordeal.

B0058YPL66|5.0|I've watched this show since the pilot and fell in love with each new episode it had to offer. This show is so unbelievably unique in its own way and its fun to see what kind of new twists come up within it. My favorite episodes so far have been: Skin Deep, Heart of Darkness & Desperate Souls. Robert Carlyle is very very always on time with his acting. He brings Rumplestiltskin to live in this new magical out come of our favorite disney characters and many other fairytales that lurk within a vault. His performance is breath taking and truly remarkable. Everyone should watch this show because if your not then your missing out on a great show. This has an amazing cast: Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Jennifer Morrison, Lana Parrilla & of course Robert Carlyle. You will not be let down by the fantastic twist that the directors have been putting down here. Its a must see for fairytale lovers. You have my word that this show is very good to watch with all ages. Once Upon A Time, is truly remarkable.

1594203334|5.0|As soon as I heard about this book, I wanted to read it.  I am the mother of two young children, so I am right in the thick of the challenges presented by parenting.  What has consistently surprised me is that my philosophy seems to be rather different from that of a lot of parents and, in fact, the more I read the more I thought my approach seemed closer to the French side of the equation than to the American side--though I also have a lot of American tendencies.  What I really liked about this book was its sensitive portrayal of how both French parents and American parents love their children, but how their philosophies differ and how those differences might ultimately affect children.  I think it's important to note right off that Druckerman isn't saying that American parenting is terrible and that French parenting is perfect, but she does raise a lot of very cogent points.<br /><br />For example, there is a long discussion in the book about how French babies \\"do their night\\" (sleep through the night) long before American babies.  Now, of course this is something of a blanket statement as Druckerman is speaking primarily about middle and upper middle class Parisians, but she offers up some compelling anecdotal evidence and, in the tradition of her journalism background, she also provides some research to back those anecdotes up.  While American parents may be more prone to rushing immediately into the baby's room and picking the baby up, French parents tend to do what they call the \\"pause\\".  This is merely a way of waiting for a few minutes to ensure that the baby is actually awake and in need of something rather than risking disturbing the baby's very normal, very noisy sleep pattern.  Druckerman says French parents feel it's their duty to teach their children to sleep well.  I found this interesting because I did my own version of the pause with both of my kids, and both of them slept through the night by the time they were around 6-7 weeks old.  I've also reada great deal about sleep deprivation amongst American children.  As Druckerman illustrates, well-intentioned parents may actually be teaching their kids that they need a parent to soothe them in order for them to fall asleep, which can present problems down the line.<br /><br />I also was very interested in Druckerman's examination of the ways in which French parents interact with their kids versus the way American parents do this.  There is a lot of pressure in our society to be a super parent.  It seems I read more and more articles about how terribly overscheduled American kids are, and how stressful this is for them.  Maybe there is something to the idea that French parents allow their young ones to simply play and explore rather than going at them with the flash cards.  It's only natural for all parents to want to help provide their children a foundation for success later in life, but this book shows how we Americans may be going just a bit too overboard in this respect.<br /><br />Especially noteworthy are the passages that discuss France's social structure and how it benefits kids.  A huge part of the challenge of being a parent in the U.S. is a lack of social structure: there is no socialized medicine here, parents pay exorbitant fees for childcare (as I know from personal experience), and our investment in education is inferior to that of France, which provides state funded preschool for children beginning at age two.  Social welfare is a very taboo issue in the U.S. right now, but Druckerman shows how the French are investing in their children's futures in ways that provide them with an advantage that many American children don't enjoy.  I think the U.S. could really learn something from this.<br /><br />Yet, as I said, this is not necessarily a paean to France.  Druckerman is very up front about her ambivalence about living in France, and she exposes the inherent sexism that plagues France.  She claims that new mothers in the U.S. are given some leeway because there is the expectation they will be too busy caring for their children to attend to themselves, while there is a culture expectation in France that women will be back to their pre-baby bodies, perfectly dressed, and beautifully coiffed within weeks of having given birth.  She also addresses the discrepancy in pay between French men and women (a gap that is sadly even larger in France than in the U.S.).<br /><br />What I came away with from this book is the conviction that some sort of blend between the French and the American would be wonderful: a hybrid of the fairer pay for women in the U.S. with the subsidized daycare in France, ensuring that women can go back to work; the free preschool for French children combined with a more Americanized system of education, wherein teachers don't have such an authoritarian role in the classroom.  I would love to see this book become a topic of national conversation.  There is so much more we need to be doing in this country to support families and to provide better opportunities and outcomes for all children.
B003NS0O5M|5.0|I shudder to think that the fate of the entire earth could be in the hands of such damaged people. we are all damaged to a certain extent, but this lot is way, way, way beyond acceptability. Ianto should have been terminated at the end simply because he has shown that his own emotions are far more important than the lives of others. He fought for what he wanted to be, not what was. that is dangerous in even an average life, but to put a person in a position of power who is motivated by their sexual rage rather than reality is stupidity. those who can identify with this group are sad and beyond redemption.
B0037NB6QE|5.0|As an avid stitcher (knitting and crocheting), The Shop on Blossom Street easily caught my interest.  Having just finished the book, I am delighted to know that there are many books still to read in this series so that I might continue sharing time with the characters who have come to be as friends.<br /><br />The Shop on Blossom Street is an easy read . . . fluid and relaxing as a summer afternoon in a hammock, yet holding my interest long into the night, far past the time I should have turned off the light.  The characters are well defined and believable, as if they lived next door or down the street. And while a portion of the story line may be predictable, I found it comforting and satisfyingly so.  For me, the book offered a perfect balance of expected outcomes peppered with unexpected surprises.  When I have lost myself, completely, in it's pages - I know the book is a treasure to read.  This is true of The Shop on Blossom Street.<br /><br />A collection of colorful yarns and a stack of good books.  Who could ask for more?  Life is good.  And life is good on Blossom Street.  I can't wait to start the next book in this series!  I'm hooked!
B007JVJ3C4|5.0|I love comic books and even more, comic book films. Finally, a chance to see cool artwork and badass characters come to life. This movie is just that, bad-ass. The 1st Ghostrider sucked so bad, I cant fathom why so many prefer it to this one. The chemistry between Eva Mendez and Cage felt forced and awful, the effects sucked, and the only two good things about it are the occasional Cage \\"freak out, and Sam Elliot. Nicholas Cages earlier work shined and popped because of his over-the-top freak outs. Finally, we see this again here, he brings out the inner kookoo again and I love it! The special effects are 10 times better in this film. The comedy is less cheesy and more \\"comical\\". Idris Elba is an excellent touch. As much as I like Peter Fonda, Ciaran Hinds was freakier as the Devil(Roarke). This film had a budget of 57,000,000$ and took 2 years to make. That's funny, because its looks and sounds better in many ways than the 2007 version which cost 75,000,000$ and took 6 years to make. The \\"Crank\\" directors have a gritty quick-motion way of shooting. Its not meant to be compared to The Dark Knight, which unfortunately every hater seems to think is the holy grail of super hero movies. Yet, there have been many incarnations of Batman in the years of comics, and many of them were over the top and cheezy. I still love them. There IS NO comparison however, Batman isn't even the same UNIVERSE, DC and Marvel are very far apart. I LOVED this Ghostrider and had a BLAST watching it, its great popcorn fun. Haters will Hate. What do they expect, the source material comes from a 20 cent comic from 1973, its not Ben-Hur or Lord of the Rings.

I payed $23 dollars for this, for what I thought was going to be a placeholder until I felt as if I wanted a better pair. But when these arrived, I was shocked. They sound even better on my PC then my old Sharkoons. I could only find a few faults for the whole thing. The big one is the volume. This headphone can get really loud on the PC, but on my PS3, its seems a little lacking. Also, you have to buy some cables so it will work on the PS3. What I have are some RCA cables to 3.5mm that piggyback on the RCA Cables, then let let you plug in any 3.5mm. Also, the cable that is a little short when on my PS3, but a simple extension cable will fix that problem. All in all, you should just get these. They are great for the price.

0345803485|3.0|I loved the Twilight series, so when I began to read it I noticed MANY similarities.  I became hooked and kept reading, however there were two several differences. One: there were no vampires/werewolves (which was good, seeing as it's a different book). The second was the complete switch from abstinence to highly detailed sex. At this point I was so far through, I had to finish the series. I finished the series in a few days, but perhaps that's due to the fact I skipped about half of each book since I couldn't read the porn. I enjoyed the romance and the plot, but can't some things be left out? If the book had been much less descriptive on the S&M (or whatever it was), I would have enjoyed the book much more.

Unfortunately the love song sung by Sinead O'Connor cannot be purchased separately from the album.
0345803485|4.0|Having read all three of the Fifty Shades books, I am finally able to write a review.  The ground covered is not new, see Sweet Savage Love by Rosemary Rogers, written in the mid to late 1970's.  However, when women think about what we want in a man, don't we all think about super qualities, extreme wealth, extremely successful, great looks, able to sail, fly, soar, super smart, great sense of self, able to make us feel sexy all the time, maybe, not the S&M Stuff, but the other stuff is generally a must, plus he must be a troubled soul that only the girl can heal.  Reality does not enter into our dreams of a perfect love.  This book tries to cover many of those qualities in Christian Grey.  The story is good, but needs to spell checked and seriously edited.  It is unexpected, as we don't generally find this sexy type of book everyday.  That is probably why it is a hit, because of it's novelty.  The story is compelling, and does flow easily.  I read all three books in four days and would recommend Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy as a light, sexy read not to be taken seriously, just enjoyed.

Excellent arrangements, memorable melodies, and the vocal production (and production/mastering in general) is an improvement over Perfect Symmetry. I apologize, but it frustrates me to have the moving experience I had upon FIRST listen only to find that somehow people are displeased with the album. I suspect it has little to do with the album and much to do with the fact that fans are older than they were in 2004.<br /><br />PLEASE listen to Disconnected, Sovereign Light Cafe, The Starting Line and really every track after that (particularly Day Will Come). These are five-star worthy songs.
B001DF68MA|3.0|BEWARE AMAZON'S PACKAGING and CHECK YOUR ORDER IMMEDIATELY WHEN IT ARRIVES. The WeeRide LTD looks like it's pretty much perfect. We wish we had received it (which is what we ordered and paid for). The LTD comes with a deluxe safety harness and oversize buckle for maximum safety, which distinguishes it from the regular WeeRide. Instead, we got the regular WeeRide, and the shoulder straps are constantly slipping off of our toddler's shoulders (and we have them tightened). We only noticed that we didn't get what we ordered when we were looking at the WeeRide website recently and saw that our \\"LTD\\" was in fact not what we ordered. According to Amazon, it's too late now to exchange it. Needless to say, we're pretty disappointed that we paid an additional $35 for something we didn't get and feel a bit robbed. Clearly, someone wasn't fully awake in the packaging department at Amazon.

B006IGZWB2|5.0|I read the book and watched the movie, they are both great!!!! I lived through that era.  Being a transposed \\"Yankee\\" in rual Alabama, in the early to mid 50's, (actually all the way to the late 60's) reading the book was like reliving my own experiences.  And I actually met women, like the characters in the book, both Black and White!! Northerners have had their own kind of racial segragation, but the southerns were actually just like the book describes.  It is funny now, but at the time, it was a very, very, serious matter.  I read the book to see if it was anywhere close to the truth, and was extremely pleased that it was.....

0307951529|5.0|This is a great book. It is the book I read yesterday afternoon and again before going to sleep, which is when I usually read something entertaining or scary. Well, Chris' book is NOT scary, but I certainly was entertained as I enjoyed reading some rock-solid advice and personal stories of success and happiness which made me realize that \\"I can do this!\\" I believe this is a book about personal freedom, living in a way that is much more in tune with who I am, and then backing that up with somewhat of a blueprint / step-by-step plan to go for it and live that life. Woo-hoo, I say, Woo-Hoo!!
B007SGM084|1.0|Amazon notes the pricing is set by the publisher. This pricing for downloads being higher than the paper versions makes no sense for the purchasing public but all the business sense for the publisher and distributors of a hot series. My Kindle got me back into reading more current titles I had a hard time getting at the library. I tend to lose interest in reading current titles once I have heard about them in detail from less patient readers. If I have to wait for sensible pricing, then I may just as well wait for the free public library copy to be available if I am still interested at all by then.
0345803485|5.0|Loved these books!  I couldn't put them down!  I didn't want the story to end.  Think I'm going to have to start over and read them again!  Highly recommend these books.  Even got my family and friends to read them!

0307951529|5.0|I have been a fan of Chris's since devouring his last book \\"The art of non-conformity\\" a few years ago. That book broke down many mental and societal barriers we create in our minds. This novel provides a detailed blue print of how to break free from the \\"norm\\" of being locked into corporate america. The most salient point that stuck with me, was that in the current economic climate, it is now riskier to leave your income up to anybody else, eg whatever company you work for. You can be fired, downsized or outsourced at any given moment, and that is completely out of your control. By following something that you are passionate about and creating your own income from this passion, many examples are provided and extra even more detailed info at 100startup.com , you can re-define what success means to you.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you have an online business that you are trying to build, or are simply sick of being in an environment where your friends and co-workers are being fired around you, you are expected to pick up the slack until it is your turn to get your pink slip.
034552554X|3.0|Bought this for a plane trip. Worked great for that because I only got thru Part I.  This novel starts off with a bang-- tight writing, fascinating character with an interesting voice and intriguing premise...was really excited about this book for the first part.  Started worrying (and disengaging) as soon as Victoria started matchmaking with bouquets.  It felt cliched, silly, and totally out of keeping with the content and tone of what had come before.  As it turns out, unfortunately, that's what you get a whole lot more of as the novel progresses. When the plot's darkish and the writing taut and the characters complex, it's wonderful. When it gets sunnier (and when interesting challenges keep getting extremely tidily resolved and what would be obvious challenges in the real world not acknowledged at all) it gets boring and unsatisfying. I got thru the book out of obligation; the final taste in my mouth was of the Hallmark Channel's The Good Witch, which saddens me, because my initial taste was of Shirley Jackson's Merricat.  My rating reflects a 4-5 for the beginning of the book and a 1-2 for the middle and end.

0307951529|5.0|To start, I'm going to give a point of reference for this review. At 20 years old I was earning a mid 6 figure income working for an established oil & gas company. Usually I would finish all of my work in the first hour. I tried to do more but management didn't like it when people worked on solutions without first being told what to do. So I played games and slept in my office. Sounds awesome right? It was for a month or two. After the honeymoon phase is over, you start to notice that your ambition for life is fading. I used to be excited about work. That feeling disappeared more with each day. Then I had an epiphany. I began to realize (thanks in large part to Chris' blog) that I didn't have to accept the standard American life. So -- I started doing some web consulting on the side. Long story shorter - I quit the corporate gig, failed at starting a business, failed a lot more and then founded a profitable and growing creative agency. Now I get to work with and learn from some of the best founders in the tech industry. But more than anything else, I get to do what I love everyday. So -- just a heads up -- that's where this review is coming from.<br /><br />The first thing this book does is take the fear out of starting a business by showing you how truly simple it is. Chris removes the giant Gandalf guarded abyss that most wantrepreneurs (people who talk about starting a business) use as a crutch for never taking the first step. Chris shows the decision for what it really is. You aren't facing a an uncrossable canyon. It's only a line in the sand. And unlike the old west, you can always take a step back and say \\"at least I gave it a shot.\\" That's more than most can say.<br /><br />This book isn't filled with useless corporate buzzwords. What it is filled with is 50 case studies of normal people who make at least 50k a year via their business. One of the most interesting questions Chris asks is,\\"What do you do differently now that you work for yourself?\\" The answersvary drastically. Some took their business on the road and traveled the world. Something they could never do with their old job. Others used their new business to finance basic necessities so they could ingratiate themselves in their passions like charity work, painting or extreme running. Some chose to leave their 9-5 so that they could spend more time at home with their quickly growing kids. What each entrepreneur does after they take the first step is unique. But there's a common thread in every story. They're much happier now.<br /><br />I like to think that most people can teach themselves pretty much anything if they really want to learn it. Think about how fast you type -- you probably didn't spend much time formally training. Instead your brain recognized the function of the keyboard and as you interacted with the computer your brain began making a blueprint. Through trial and error it determined which finger should go to the \\"W\\" when you're typing \\"[...]\\" Your brain reverse engineered the process of typing subconsciously. Here's where I'm going with this -- if you focus on reverse engineering something consciously, results can be attained much quicker. Want proof? It may take Callaway 3 years to develop a new driver, but it only takes two weeks for a firm in China to create and market an exact (down to the millimeter and material) replica.<br /><br />Chris has reverse engineered the process of starting a profitable company. The bulk of this book consists of proven tactics -- tactics that have a dramatic effect on businesses bank accounts. Chris exposes the 20% of business tactics that founders use to produce 80% of revenue.<br />What more could you ask for?<br /><br />I'll share two of my favorites (hope you don't mind Chris):<br /><br />1: Market before Manufacturing: For $100 bucks you can validate your idea. You can have an advertisement designed and placed in front of thousands of people in your precise target market. In fact, you can display your ad in front of people who are actively searching for the type of product or service you're thinking about offering. Then you just run the ad and see how many people call or email you. You've just tested and either proved that demand exists or that no one wants what you're thinking about selling. For just $100.00 you can answer the question, \\"does anyone even want this?\\" Money well spent in my opinion.<br /><br />2: Generating Revenue:<br />Price your product or service in relation to the benefit it provides, not the cost of producing it. Chris tells the story of Gary Leff who helps busy people book their vacations for a flate rate of $250.00. Gary specializes in leveraging the customer's frequent flyer miles in order to receive the best deal. Customers not only save time by letting Gary book their vacation for them but also thousands of dollars on airfare and hotels. It's a win-win for the customer. But, what's really fascinating is that on average it only takes Gary 30 minutes to book each customer's vacation. That means Gary is earning $250.00 every thirty minutes. Not to point out the obvious, but that's $500.00 an hour. If Gary would have priced based on cost (his time) he might have just charged $15 to $50. But instead he priced on value and has been doing exceedingly well for himself.<br /><br />Above all this book is an investment. That's the real reason I wrote this review. For half the price of a decent meal at your favorite restaurant, you can get a proven blueprint for creating a profitable company. Every successful company started out much, much, much smaller than it is now. They all started as an idea in the mind of one single person. A person who decided to stop thinking about starting a business and instead -- started a business. Do yourself a favor and press \\"add to cart.\\" You won't regret it.

1401937268|4.0|I have a few of Doreen Virtue's oracle decks (and almost all of her books) and really enjoy working with them. I used to use my tarot cards often, but for the reasons Doreen made this deck, I didn't use them as often anymore. So I was very happy when I saw (and bought) her new Angel Tarot Cards.<br /><br />I opened my new deck, read the guidebook, cleansed the cards, and looked at all of the cards before using it. The artwork on the cards is very beautiful. However, some of the cards the symbolism or meaning of the card isn't really there so it is hard to give a reading by just looking at the cards.<br /><br />The cards are also rather thick so it made it hard for me to shuffle them. I had to break them up into two groups and then divide them to shuffle them fully. This makes for an unnatural feeling of using the cards, and I hope that in time they loosen up so I can actually shuffle them all at once.<br /><br />Overall, I really do enjoy the cards and will continue working with them when doing readings for myself and others. The only reason I can't give it a 5 star rating is for the reasons listed above. Other than that, I love them.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|What I love is the struggle of the main character to find out what she wants and what she need from a man.<br />I did not find intriguing the erotic tale itself, but the tension between the characters.<br />Unfortunately the author offers only the insight of the girl's perception. I would have be fun to have a glimpse of the  man's mind.<br />I read it in few days. It is kind of addictive like a soap opera...

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I succumbed to the hype and read this book, which will hit the big screen in the near future. I hoped it would get better... it didn't. The idea isn't bad, and the Mr. Grey character has potential but the Anastasia Steele character kills it with her inane internal chatter. The writing, itself, is atrocious, repetitive, childish and amateur. It is hard to believe an adult wrote it, even less believable that it is a best-seller. I would give it a minus rating but it's not possible.
B003O86FMW|5.0|okay, katniss has completed the hunger games and is on the winner district tour, which means she goes around talking to the districts about the dead tributes, meanwhile snow is on her case about the berry stunt she pulled in the games. the berry stunt made the capitol look bad. so she must pretend she did out of love for peeta, or she might lose everyone she loves. and then another horror acures, the quarter quell! she would have to go back to the hunger games! the quarter quell is were the winning tributes would have to fight eachother! some new people join the book, finnick, johanna, and a few others. good book.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Enter one of the most beguilling, transforming and metaphorical statements of life that the film industry has ever produced. The 'fall' has been anticipated by Milton.  It is about our fall from grace and redemption in terms of acceptance.  The 'battle' between Alexandria and Lee Pace is the revelation between real, stub your toes, polaroid consciousness and the just as real consciousness of the imagination.  Lee realizes this when he asks, \\" are you trying to save my soul?\\" and it is in Lee's power to let the rich, true and evocative consciousness of the imagination 'win', which he does. There are no better visuals which are sustained by the underlying metaphor which should resonate in all of our souls.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Once in a lifetime, something incredible comes along. One of those things is Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera. Loosely inspired by the French novel by Gaston Leroux, it follows the tragic story of a man forced by his deformity to dwell beneath the Paris Opera House, and the woman he loves.<br /><br />The Opera House has seen its share of misfortunes, so many in fact that the current manager has decided to retire - to New South Whales. He gladly turns over his many former responsibilities, including a diva in the form of Carlotta (Wendy Ferguson), her tag-along fellow performer and friend Piangi (Wynne Evans), and of course an Opera Ghost... one that demands Box Five be kept empty for his use, and also a salary of 1500 francs a month. When Carlotta refuses to go on after an upsetting backstage incident, the performance is turned over to the young and inexperienced Christine Daee (Sierra Boggess), whose voice catches the attention of a former childhood sweetheart, and the newest patron of the arts, Raoul de Chany (Hadley Fraser).<br /><br />What neither the new managers nor Raoul know is that the ballet dancer turned singer Christine is being trained in the musical arts by a mysterious man that lives beneath the Opera House. Known to her as the Angel of Music, to the managers as the Opera Ghost, and to the empirical ballet mistress Madame Giry (Liz Robertson) as the Phantom of the Opera, he will do anything in his power to see to it that Christine remains on stage, that she continues to pursue her education beneath his influence, and that Raoul will not win over her heart... even if it leads to his own destruction.<br /><br />The only true way to experience this magnificent musical is live, but this 25th anniversary production is the next best thing. Its incredible performances outshine the film's while still maintaining the integrity and structure of the stage production. Quibbles have been made over the cast but in my opinion the pairing up of Sierra Boggess, Ramin Karimloo, and Hadley Fraser is perfection. Ramin has the stage presence needed to convey the total control Erik (the Phantom) has over Christine. His delivery of certain lines is unique and there is such heart-wrenching agony in his final moments that I defy you not to be in tears. Sierra meanwhile is the finest Christine I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them. Her facial expressions, her innocent wonder, and her utter heartache are mesmerizing. Hadley meanwhile gives the un-empathetic (and at times downright foolish) Raoul a gravity and strength that well offsets his considerably more formidable co-characters.<br /><br />Veterans of the original production will notice some changes here and there - lyrics have been altered, and the infamous mannequin is missing - but none of it intrudes on the flow and in some instances strengthens it. The stage is limited in the sense that crashing the chandelier was not possible and much of the background is made up of enormous screens, but it's easy to become accustomed to them and there are times (particularly when the Phantom is sending notes) that it actually assists in the narrative style. On occasion, the camera sweeps across the stage behind the audience but for the most part we forget it is live (other than the well-deserved applause) until the end, when the original cast and four of the most famous Phantoms take the stage. That Michael Crawford does not sing is unfortunate... but that John Owen Jones, Anthony Warlow, Colm Wilkinson, and Sarah Brightman do is glorious.<br /><br />The costumes are lovely, and if you have never seen the production live it will be an eye-opening glimpse of the cleverness that goes into transitioning between scenes on stage (including costume changes!). If you have never experienced The Phantom of the Opera, or have never seen any performance of it other than the film, rent this, or better yet, buy it. It is truly the performance of a lifetime.oggess, Ramin Karimloo, and Hadley Fraser is perfection.

B000VI70WM|4.0|I became a Duran Duran fan in 1983 but that doesn't mean I'm stuck in the past or want the band to be stuck in the past. I think the reason for many of the negative reactions to this album was simply because they were stepping outside people's comfort zones. I feel this album is definitely in their top 5.  I find it easy to listen to all the way through.<br /><br />The album has a varied sound, a few songs with contemporary dance beats but also some of the most beautiful melodies they've ever written, like the nearly acoustic Box Full of Honey - a lovely, memorable tune that easily gets stuck in your head for all the right reasons including the deeply meaningful lyrics. Simon Le Bon's voice is top notch on this album, both in sound and in conveying emotions(which has always been a particular gift of his, I think.  Like his voice or not, he's always been great at conveying the right emotional tone for a song).  Give this album a chance without prejudice and I think many will find it's a much better album than it's given credit for.  Paul McCartney's RAM was derided as the \\"nadir of pop music\\" when it was released, simply because it was different and it was Paul. Now with the gift of time and hindsight, it's considered by many to be one of the top 3 \\"solo Beatles\\" albums, a real classic and it's upcoming Archive release is much anticipated.<br /><br />Maybe in 20 years Duran Duran's Red Carpet Massacre will get a similar critical and fan re-assessment but hopefully it will be much sooner. :)
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Sweet game. A tad on the easy side but not too much so. Love any sort of ghost/haunting story so it's pretty much exactly my cup of tea. Very responsive, intuitive searching. Only real complaint is how easy it is to access already solved chapters. Not a big deal though, hence the 5 stars. Kindle Fire.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Fans of [[ASIN:B003PIUC02 Spartacus: Blood and Sand]] and the prequel [[ASIN:B004HW7JMY Gods of the Arena]]: Draw near, that I may break words with you.<br /><br />Know this in advance: there are parts of this second season (or third, depending on how you're counting) of the Spartacus saga that _you will not like_.  But the gods do not favor such thoughts!  WE are for Spartacus: Vengeance, preferably on Blu-ray, which has had noticeably better picture and sound quality than the Starz broadcasts.  Bend ear, and I shall give good reasons to make purchase:<br /><br />- The story is on a par with, possibly even better than, Blood and Sand.  It's different - how could it be otherwise? - but more complex and on a much grander scale. The same goes for the setting. Spartacus has always featured impressive camera work and CGI, and this time around it is, at times, literally jaw-dropping and downright beautiful. Much of S:V looks and feels more like a movie than a TV series.<br /><br />- The cast outdoes itself yet again. Liam McIntyre takes a couple of episodes to get comfortable with the daunting job of filling Andy Whitfield's sandals, but by mid-season he's rocking Spartacus every bit as hard as Whitfield did.  Cynthia Addai-Robinson takes awhile to get into her role as Naevia (replacing Leslie-Ann Brandt,) but makes up for it and then some in the final episode. All the returnees own their characters in splendid fashion, even when those characters have dramatically changed (see below.)  It's very hard to pick a standout this time, but I'm going with Nick Tarabay. Yeah, Asher, who this time around is pushing his intelligence (he's smarter than he appears) and cunning (he's even more of a snake) to their limits in an attempt to gain real wealth and power.  Tarabay takes what was a relatively minor character in the other series and brings him to the forefront as a downright fascinating, and in a way even tragic, figure.  Where was he hiding this guy in S:B&S?<br /><br />- Lucy Lawless, who takes her character Lucretia on a horrific roller-coaster ride from wife and house-mistress (with a touch of the Borgia thrown in,) to mad prophetess, to a vengeful slave's plaything, to confidante-and-perhaps-assassin of a powerful family.  You'll be genuinely wondering whether she's crazy-like-a-fox, or just plain crazy, right up to the moment of the Stephen King-worthy climax in the final episode.<br /><br />- \\"Libertus\\".  Spartacus and his generals return to the arena in Capua one final time, and the result is the best episode of any of the three series up until this point.  This and the season finale are by themselves worth the price of the entire set.<br /><br />- \\"Wrath of the Gods\\".  I didn't think it was possible to top the finale of Blood and Sand.  They did it.<br /><br />- The bonus features are all worth watching, especially the \\"making of\\" episode 5 featurette.  For someone who still pictures the lights-camera-action Hollywood stereotype behind the scenes, watching 21st-century state-of-the-art \\"filming\\" with its complex battle choreography, robotic digital cameras and virtual sets is endlessly fascinating.<br /><br />To be sure, there are a few problems with S:V:<br /><br />- First and foremost: only ten episodes.  The whole blasted thing was over and done with inside of three months. And this is weird, because there is easily 13 episodes worth of story here. As others have noted, this means that a number of intriguing plot threads (e.g. Lucretia's rescue from the ludus massacre, and the Seppia / Seppius relationship) were just barely touched upon.  I assume they blew the budget on episodes 5 and 10, but still, ten episodes simply were not enough to tell this story as it should be told.<br /><br />- As with S:GotA, the story starts out slow, taking a couple of episodes to ramp up.  Clearly the producers' fault for spoiling us with S:B&S, which was solid from end to end. ;)<br /><br />- It's clear at this point that the producers are making a conscious effort to outdo themselves sex-and-violence-wise with each new season, and in S:V it's actually become a detriment to the show.  We now have the camera lingering on spilled intestines and increasingly-bizarre mutilations for no other reason than \\"Hey, look what our effects guys came up with THIS time!\\"  We also have numerous scenes set in a brothel that clearly exist only to (ahem) insert sex that they couldn't work into the storyline. (This season could have been subtitled \\"Meanwhile, back at the whorehouse...\\")  S:B&S proved that they can use the sex and gore intelligently to pump up an already good story.  So why go all gratuitous on us now?<br /><br />- Ten. Episodes.  At a higher price than most other series' 22-episode seasons.  (If history is any guide, however, the price will come down soon after release.)<br /><br />Sum of topic: Buy it, but wait until the price comes down somewhat.  Five stars, but just barely this time - the length, the price and what is now the almost overbearing sex and gore almost cost it that 5th.

B002VQ7PVS|4.0|I think I purchased this kindle ebook for $3.99 or less and had never heard of this author.  I was attracted by the book description, number of highly positive reader reviews, leading me to  read a sample before making my purchase.<br /><br />I was surprised (and pleased) by the quality of the writing, the building suspense, the well-drawn characters and the careful description of the time and place in which it was set.  I knew only a little about the role that novice and career British agents played in both Europe and, especially, in the U.S., as the British tried to get America into World War II.  This was not a popular position in the U.S. at the time.  Neither the American people nor the government wanted to be involved in a foreign war.  England desperately wanted and needed America to be fighting in Europe (and north Africa) against the Germans.  A large segment of the American population was pro-Germany and/or isolationist.  British agents were secretly embedded in the U.S. to feed the American media stories purportedly demonstrating the German's secret, allegedly planned attacks on the U.S - in the U.S. - and in the Atlantic.<br /><br />The reader is drawn into the dangerous and high stakes game the British are playing, without leaving their fingerprints on the effort.<br /><br />At the same time, we see the relationship between a recently recruited and hurriedly trained female agent, her professional and personal relationship with the group's spy master, as well as with her fellow British agents.  We follow her on some of her assignments.  The scope of the British operation in the U.S. was bigger than anything I'd ever read about and the agents' fear of discovery was palpable.  Europe needed the strength of U.S. assets and active involvement to win the war.<br /><br />The structure of the novel is alternating chapters from two perspectives: that  of a mother - the newly recruited, female British agent in her role as a spy in the U.S. during the WWII, and inher present life, living quietly and anonymously in rural England, and the life of her daughter - a single mother with her son, a small child, living  nearby in a small town nearby English countryside, as she supports herself by teaching English to non-English speaking business men.  For most of the book, it is unclear why she is a major character in the story.  She knows nothing about her mother's past, certainly nothing about her experience as a spy in WWII.<br /><br />The book held my attention and piqued my interest in why the daughter was a main character.  It turns out she's a player in bringing about the resolution of the story.  The timeline and structure of the book brings mother and daughter together for the denouement, in the present.  And, this is where, there is the only flaw from my point of view:  a revelation at the very end of the book, for which, I felt, the reader is unprepared and which doen't ring true or contribute to the story in and way that I could see.  I was unprepared for it and it seemed awkward and forced to me . . . the only false note in a wonderfully structured and written novel.  As I said, this was the ONLY flaw or quibble I had with this book.<br /><br />When I finished reading, I searched amazon for other books by this author (previously unknown to me) and found a slew of spy novels, dating back 2 decades or more, nearly all of which were book award and/or prize winners.  No wonder the writing was so good!  I'm crossing my fingers that some of those novels will show up in the \\"FREE\\" or \\"books for $3.99 or less\\" categories.  (hint, hint!)

B007J4T2G8|5.0|If I wouldn't have needed to go to work I would have read this book in one night. It was AMAZING. I couldn't put it down. Christian instantly draws you in. Gosh, if men were really like that. I hear everyone calling it \\"mommy porn\\" but honestly, I have read books that were more descriptive and graphic.I started the second book today and can't wait to finish it. I have a feeling I will be devistated when I am finished with the third book and there won't be anything to fill the void.

B002W5UVSM|3.0|I have no idea why I liked this book.  The main character was a dispicable cad, slob, and so on.  And yes, just as the title indicates, everybody around him were just plain stupid!  I guess I liked it because I am so glad I am smarter, and nicer, than everybody in the book.  I thoroughly enjoyed the setting in New Orleans, and, though it was set 50 years ago, I could easily envision places described in the book.
1401233384|5.0|I'm a huge Flash fan, so I decided to pick this graphic novel up. I enjoyed every bit of it. Other reviews have covered the premise of the story fairly well, so I'm not going to go into that. The art in the book is great! I was always a fan of Wally (thanks to the Justice League series) but I'm starting to be a way bigger Barry fan. I've read Flash: Rebirth, Flash: Death of Rogues, and now this. All great graphic novels, IMO. I'll definitely be picking up the hardcover of the new Justice League series by Geoff Johns and Jim Lee.

B002WJI65S|5.0|My five year old is a huge Mario Bros. fan, and this Goomba is a great addition to his collection!!  It is super cute and looks very much like the Goomba on the Mario Bros games, unlike some plush animals that don't look as close to how the character looks on TV.  It seems like a very durable stuffed animal, and has held up well to being played with pretty much non-stop.<br /><br />My only slight complaint is that the top part of the eyebrows aren't sewn down, and I can see how they may end up falling off over time.  Great product overall, though.  We are very pleased!!

B007Q2N0HA|5.0|As most have stated: the story is very similar to the 50 Shades trilogy, but don't let that turn you off. It's still a good read with a story of twisted passion and romance. Gideon and Eva's relationship is reminiscent of Christian and Ana's, so for me it has somewhat satisfied my craving and itching for E.L. James' next 50 Shades book. It's worth the $3-$4 you pay for the Kindle Edition.
0199560358|3.0|I endeavored to read Treasure Island as an entry point into a chronological approach to adventure stories, golden-age science fiction, and later speculative ventures.  It seems to me that this classic novel has done well to satisfy in that role, and I will also add that the Oxford World's Classics introduction, explanatory notes, and other supplements were useful, if unessential.<br /><br />That said, I am afraid there is little to recommend Treasure Island to the modern reader.  The story itself has been surpassed many times over, and the archaic maritime language is a double-edged sword of charm and impediment; the writing is fun and quotable for the same reasons that often render it a right chore to comprehend.  If one's sole purpose in selecting Stevenson's tale of the stalwart Hispaniola crew's quest for buried booty amid the treachery of Long John Silver upon Skeleton Island is merely to be entertained by a hardy lads' romp, it must be said that many superior (and less frustrating) options have become available since it was published in 1883.  You and I are simply too removed from this work by time to enjoy it properly.<br /><br />However, I am ultimately glad that I read Treasure Island.  Its historical value is clear both as a genre pioneer and as the origin for so many well-known pirate tropes, and, although it can be difficult in the telling, to be sure, the tale is not an unpleasant one.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|When I got an invitation from my seller to go online and review this book I did not know what to write. I was confused.  I kept asking myself, what can I say about it? Finally, I discovered the source of this confusion. -  There is nothing to review.<br />Don't get me wrong. I bought all three books, and read them in a record time. But this is not a good novel where you will find a life story or a confession told in a pen. It is a typical romance whose setting, characters, problems (if there are any) and idea of love as a road to happiness, fits into a pattern. Only difference this time is that main character has a bit of a different taste but, the unconditional love of our heroine will save him and show him the way to light.<br />I do have to complement our author for brilliant compiling different stories into one. She used her knowledge, education, experience (if I am correct she worked many years in publishing) and that little talent she has, put everything together in one whole - and got a bestseller. And that is fine. Worse authors then she write books, and we buy them. After I finished the book, I went back to classics, and read Tess D'Urberville and found so many elements, expressions, verbs (oblige for example) that are present in \\"Fifty shades of gray\\". Christian is a copy of Alec, while Ana is using Tess's example to save herself?!  Yes, the best description of this book - would be - original plagiarism.<br />So, really there is nothing to review. It is a nice, brainwashing, reality- escaping book, which can help you to relax after a long day at work or a bad conference at your child's school.<br />However, I really keep wondering, what is it that makes this book a bestseller, a huge hit, because again, it is just an expensive romance (usually this type of book is not more $6). ABC13 had at least three  reports about this author!<br />Is it possible that we are falling in love with twisted characters like Christian? Is it possible that recipe for a successful book is not good writing skills, but some black - purple pictures of unbalanced young man in a need of control and abuse? Are we that desperate that we are obsessing about mentally unstable handsome businessman and poor student girl who is accepting this twisted relationship / contract with some billionaire?<br />Well, at least now we know who is to blame for Rihanna going back to Chris. She probably read this book and figured that, after all, the pain does not matter, if that is what it takes to make your man happy!<br />So, enjoy your reading!
0307951529|5.0|Chris's book has inspired me to get on track for creating a business where I can do what I love and combine it with what people want. That is one of the key messages of the book. It is very step by step and has lots of good exercises to get your ideas flowing while also helping you to avoid some of the critical mistakes people make. He also uses some of his own life experiences ( traveling to 170+ countries while still running a business)  Above all else the case studies of people that have done it already is the most inspiring.

0307951529|5.0|If Chris Guillebeau's previous book, The Art of Non-Conformity is the \\"why,\\" The $100 Startup is the \\"how,\\" a blueprint to help anyone big on dreams but short on cash create a new future through entrepreneurship. In today's economy, the book's core message--the money and skills you currently have are all you need to help others and earn a good income for yourself--is more relevant than ever before.<br /><br />I enjoyed The $100 Startup. It's a good reference for anyone thinking of starting a business on a shoestring. Although I've stumbled across a small percentage of the information offered in the book via other sources in the past, Chris presents the material in a concise, easily-referenced volume. The amount of new information presented and Chris's engaging manner of telling the stories of other entrepreneurs kept me reading and left me satisfied when I reached the end.<br /><br />Not all of the businesses in the book were started for under $100--something Chris readily acknowledges. He points out that the median startup cost was actually $125. However, the point of the title remains the same--that with a little resourcefulness, it's possible to grow a thriving business with relatively little money.<br /><br />Keep in mind that what worked for the business owners profiled in the book may not work for you--you'll need to adapt the strategies and methods presented to fit your own situation.<br /><br />Chapter 2 (\\"Give Them the Fish\\") was my favorite chapter because it helped me think differently about providing value. I found the Fish Stories Appendix helpful in further illustrating the points presented in the chapter.<br /><br />Chris did a great job of driving home his points by including relevant stories of successful microbusiness owners. I enjoyed the variety of businesses represented, though I wish there had been room to go into more detail with some of the stories. For anyone who wants to explore further, though, Chris helpfully lists all of the businesses profiled throughout The $100 Startup. I also look forward to exploring the companion website to the book.<br /><br />Overall, Chris has done a nice job of organizing entrepreneurs' stories and helpful advice into a handy reference that can conveniently be kept on a bookshelf or e-reader. The 39-Step Product Launch Checklist (not just for online products) is worth the price of the book alone, in my opinion. The $100 Startup is a resource worth turning to not just during startup, but over the life of any small business.<br /><br />(Disclosure: I received a review copy of The $100 Startup.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book has everything! It has action, but also has serious &#34;government&#34; issues. A great read.If you haven't read it, do it. It is like a mix between &#34;THE HUNGER GAMES&#34; and &#34;MOCKINGJAY&#34;.
086571701X|5.0|Received book on time. For someone that was trying to get a basic knowledge of aquaponics this book does the job.  Very informative with great diagrams and pics and references to internet sites.  I recommend.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book needs to be read by every student from grades 7-12.  It shows the worst results of bullying, exclusion, and negative human interaction.  Our children have been immersed in these anti bullying programs since they were small children, but very rarely is there any talk about the worst case scenario, suicide.  I read a quote from the author online somewhere that stated: \\"Some people, primarily adults, would rather there be no books dealing with controversial subjects, even if those books help start a dialogue between teens and adults.  Thankfully, I've heard from a lot of parents, teachers, and librarians who are using this book for that exact reason.\\"  This is a perfect quote to describe this book. It will strike up conversation, and hopefully an increased motivation to fight against the horrible effects of bullying in our schools.
0307951529|5.0|Chris absolutely knocked it out of the park with this book. As a career coach and writer, I help people build a career around their passion. This book is the best new tool I've seen this year, if not longer. I'm sending it to all my top clients. The case studies and the step by step guides and tools simply scream possibility. It shifts the thinking from \\"how could I possibly do this?\\" to \\"how could I possibly not?\\". That change in psychology is what makes all the difference.<br /><br />The world owes Chris a lot for the time he spent in building this for all of us- and to the hundreds of inspiring case studies that go with it. It makes building a career around your passion all that much more possible.<br /><br />Hat's off to an excellent and enabling resource!

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This is a great easy read. The last book slowed down the story though because I guess the rebellion has cut the \\"lovey dovey\\" portion of what's been going on on book 1&2 which made interesting for me - still working on the 3rd book but it's still interesting.
B0015DROBO|4.0|i am still reading the book.  It started out very slow. Hope it picks up. At this point I can't really give an accurate review of the book. I finished the book and the ending was surprizing.  Had I not read it on the Kindle I probably would not have bought the paperbook.

0307951529|5.0|I've been following Chris's work since 2009. His goal of \\"visiting every country in the world\\" was what originally intrigued my interest for his blog. As I got to know more about his work, he became my inspiration in life and work as well.<br /><br />There comes a challenge of writing a review of this book: I'm obviously biased. But I wanted my review to be helpful to someone trying to decide whether or not to buy this book, so I asked myself; Would I recommend this book to a friend of mine who just quit her 14-year-career at a government job? She is stay-at-home-mom to her 3 girls for now, but she has aspirations of creating something meaningful and make money when she is ready.<br /><br />The answer to this question is an enthusiastic \\"YES!\\". However, I wouldn't recommend her to read from the start to finish (did I mention she has three kids?) I'd suggest her to first read the chapter 10 \\"Show Me The Money\\" and 14 \\"But What If I fail?\\", and then go back to the beginning. As someone mentioned in his review, it can be a bit overwhelming if you are just started thinking about \\"what about....?\\"  In my opinion, those two chapters are critical in deciding whether or not you want to actually make the change. The money chapter begins with an inspirational story about homeless-turned-almost millionaire Naomi, and on to how \\"business needs to make money\\". Chris also discusses the actual start-up costs of some of his case studies (it would have been even better what each of the cost listed was for). It talks about ideas of how to get capital if you have to rely on something other than your savings. For a stay-at-home-mom who is thinking about starting up her own business, in many cases the first person she needs to persuade is her partner. In that sense, seeing that it can be done with much less money than most people think is encouraging and helpful. Chapter 14 addresses what those successful business owners are afraid of. Also, it has this section called \\"The Moment They Knew\\", which I liked a lot. By reading this chapter, you can start thinking whether you actually have what it takes to make it happen.<br /><br />For a business owner myself (consulting business catered for people in cross-cultural marriage/relationship), I took tons of notes as the ideas kept coming. I am excited to put them in action as soon as I put this up!
B0002S94OS|5.0|ASHES OF THE WAKE is another great album by LAMB OF GOD!!!!!

B005LAIH3G|4.0|As one of the internet's resident scribes on all things movie, I'll not be the first - nor certainly the last - to lambast the treatment JOHN CARTER received at the box office.  The short version of this sad history is that JOHN CARTER was the perfect popcorn flick that deserved better - better from fans, better from the studio who made the film, and (far, far) better from the critical community that mostly drubbed it a `disaster' for all the wrong reasons - and, hopefully, it will get better at some point because, arguably, there's no better inspiration for science fiction and fantasy than Edgar Rice Burroughs' 1917 novel that started the craze.<br /><br />Others have already gone to great lengths to dissect precisely how badly conceived was Walt Disney's marketing scheme for the picture, but, to be honest, I think the failings of the film to garner the success it deserved from the box office goes much deeper.  How do you take a book titled \\"A Princess of Mars\\" and, then, make a film that goes through so many name changes that it ends up with something as simple as JOHN CARTER?  Not even JOHN CARTER OF MARS, as it was briefly called by some executive who, at least, realized it might be worthwhile to reference Burroughs' original material?  I think a strong case could be made - and probably will be made in some astute article some day by a film scholar - that the property was put in the hands of folks who didn't quite know what to do with it.  Is it STAR WARS?  Is it CONAN, THE BARBARIAN?  Is it STAR TREK?<br /><br />In short, JOHN CARTER was based on the best example of pulp fiction available to all of mankind.  Burroughs' original classic served as an inspiration to not only the best writers in the science fiction & fantasy field, but it led folks like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg to want to make movies in their respective universes.  Burroughs' prose has even been cited as an inspiration to Carl Sagan and even astronaut Terrence Wilcutt.  While the question will remain for ages why the film wasn't as successful as it deserved to be, it stands to reason that the original creation will continue to inspire countless folks in the years ahead.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch does an admirable job bringing the principle character of Carter to life on the silver screen, and the lovely Lynn Collins steals every young boy's heart as the princess herself, Dejah Thoris.  The film was heavily supported by special effects, as many of the inhabitants of Mars had to be mastered with CGI.  Willem Dafoe was the most noticeable voice talent as Tars Tarkas, while James Purefoy performed respectably as Kantos Kan.  The effects were all top-notch - though a handful of sequences appeared a bit too elementary for my tastes - and they were integrated fairly seamlessly with the live action.<br /><br />While much could be made about the ineffective marketing by Disney's usually stellar advertising staff, I tend to think that the confusion over the property itself - just who is this John Carter character? - really killed any momentum the picture could've achieved.  In fact, the film never tracked all the well in the lead-up to its release, and if that doesn't indicate some fault on the part of the advertisers then I don't know who to blame.  Clearly, Burroughs' creation has an audience.  Disney never quite tapped into it, and that's probably because no one involved in drafting a marketing plan was even familiar with the franchise.  Instead, they relied on the picture - which dabbled liberally in the adventures on Barsoom (aka Mars) - and they were undone as a consequence.<br /><br />Having read most of the first novel, I can say that the story that made it to the silver screen is a respectful adaptation, but it strayed from the source material like any adaption does.  There was so much more to these various tribes and cultures in the book that may've made for a greater plot - not to mention the depth of characters that were reduced to general devices instead of fully fleshed creations - and, audience attention span being what it is, I can understand why some folks may've struggled a bit to grasp it all.  The central good-versus-evil story could've used a bit more beefing up, but, at the end of the day, I can't help but wonder how much of it seemed a bit too much like `fluff' for kids (not that there's anything wrong with that!).<br /><br />Lastly, I thought the pacing of the film suffered a bit in the middle third of the picture.  There's a fair amount of set-up that occupies the first third, and, where most second acts build on the drama and mystery of these introductions, JOHN CARTER sort of struggled and groped around a bit to find the story it wanted to tell.  The third act is, mostly, a traditional adventure picture, and it works very well on that level ... but the uneven presentation of that second act may've helped stifle strong word-of-mouth from audience members mostly unfamiliar with the material.  I can remember thinking that, after I saw the film, the story as presented might worked better had it been expanded to either two or three films; the end result of this would've been to give storytellers more space to work with fleshing out the people, places, and history of Barsoom - much in the same way Peter Jackson did with THE LORD OF THE RINGS films - but, alas, it wasn't meant to be.<br /><br />With as much as Disney spent on JOHN CARTER, it'll always remain a bit of a mystery as to why the finished product wasn't as successful as it could've been.  I think we'll be debating it for the ages, but, in the meantime, there's absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying the film as is: a rip-roaring return to old school entertainment ... where men are men ... dogs are, well, big dogs ... and there's a princess and a bunch of rather obvious villains thrown into the mix.  While it only hints at the magic from the original STAR WARS trilogy, JOHN CARTER will hopefully continue to be discovered and rediscovered in the generations yet to experience it.<br /><br />STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.nstead of fully fleshed creations - and, audience attention span being what it is, I can understand why some folks may've struggled a bit to grasp it all.

To get more games you have to earn a lot more coins by either continuously playing the games or liking random things on facebook, or even writing a review like I am doing right now! Id get it if I were you!
B007PS0X0W|5.0|Great movie!  Very disappointing that we have to wait for yet another release of this adventure!  Definitely worth the watch but prepare to be wanting more!  hehe
B0054JZC6E|3.0|when you first get into the app there are no instructions however.. the games are pretty simple. it is also difficult to really improve your score so it makes you play the games over and over to get points.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I really like this cover. Put in on the first day of purchasing Kindle Fire. It protects the edges, while not adding much bulk or weight. It loses a star because thin film that covers the plastic part is peeling a little on the corners. But it's minor and isn't very apparent.
1609613937|2.0|I was so excited when I saw this book, I ordered it the day it came out!  Since I love carbs I thought this would be a great fit for me, but the diet is very unrealistic in a working family with kids and would be really hard to follow as a \\"life style\\".  I was very disappointed with this purchase, but I am confident if  you eat only the things they say to eat...you would definitely be skinny, VERY skinny!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is very useful and intuitive tool for getting ideas down on the run. Very helpful for navigating information between platforms. Brings data to where you are.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the highlight option that lets you highlight important verses and the life plans. The life plans help you be subjective to what your currently working on in your life at your own pace. I especially am in love with the audible option the reads the chapters, it helps you absorb the words of the Bible in a different way outside of church. I feel it allows me to reconnect with God's word my own way.
B007712XAU|1.0|I was so disappointed when I realized that the final episode for the second season was not included in this collection.  I think that Amazon should recompense us for being ripped off or provide us with a copy of the final episode for free.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|Nice range. I pick up way more networks with this than with other usb wireless adapters. I bought a really long mini-usb to usb cord to go with it.
0790729393|4.0|Yes, things all fall together very neatly here. And, yes, it's somewhat improbable that anything like this courtroom revenge flick could ever happen in real life. It's based on a novel, allegedly based on a true story that was kind of debunked when the film came out in 97. Still, there is some great acting here, the script is solid, and the action is good enough to keep you watching for 148 minutes on both sides of one DVD.

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|This was my favorite book out of the trilogy. I love how much Christian changed for Anna and the way EL James went back to honeymoon scenes was so awesome! I could re-read this book a million times! I even downloaded these in audiobook so I can listen to them on my ipod! I so hope she continues their story someday! :)
B007K3JCAE|3.0|This isn't really a review , more of a comment . I loved the film at the movies and like almost all the films i love i want a physical copy . Yep , i'm one of those old types . So couldn't care less about the UV blurb and most of the time couldn't give two hoots about a digital copy . I also own a Blu Ray that plays both B.R and DVD , which i bought for the B.R. quality but to be able to play the DVD's i already have and enjoy . So how about having a single Blu Ray copy of this , and so many other films ,  instead of all the extraneous BS i appear to have to buy as well ?<br /><br />Interestingly , a couple of days after i wrote this , lo and behold it appears on Amazon that a single Blu Ray version will be available on June 12th . Strange that this info isn't released when the multiple and more expensive version is first released ? And you can keep your UV \\"copy\\" as well .
B005N0PJJO|5.0|I love all 3 of the Fifty Shades books! This one dove deeper into their relationship and you can see how Christian starts changing to make Anna happy. I've re-read it already. I really love the story of their relationship even with all the sex parts in it. It's like an adult Twilight for me. :-)

B0072GPQNG|2.0|Wow, where to start?  This movie fails on so many levels.  Just finished watching this dreadful piece of cinema with my 12 year old.  We both read the book, and neither of us saw the play.  Suffice it to say that although the book is a bit melodramatic, it is far more believable and touching  than this wreck of a movie.  As usual, Spielberg's bigotry towards the German people seeps through and I can't help but wonder if part of the change in storyline from book to movie was driven by his unwillingness to show Germans in a positive light.  The acting is adequate, but I have to say that none of the actors ever had me convinced of their love for the title animal.  It is surprising that the director who gave us some of the most moving combat footage ever in a movie in Saving Private Ryan, seemed far less capable in communicating the terror and horror associated with trench warfare.  Cinematically the movie is shot very well, but the story deviations, lack of great acting and failure to live up to what I think most expected of this movie leaves it with 2 stars in my book.

Again I was struck by the humanity of the man.  I also reflected on the time that I read \\"WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE\\" as a second grader in the early 1970s.  Far from frightening me, I was THRILLED and AMAZED by the story and would've loved to have joined Max and his newfound friends in that world just beyond his bedroom.  Thank you, Mr. Sendak for putting me back in touch with my 7-year old self.

B0053O89JM|3.0|CAUTION: THIS MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER. TREAD EXTREMELY CAREFULLY IF YOU NEVER SAW A COMMERCIAL, READ AN ARTICLE OR SAW ANY PRESS ABOUT THE FINAL SEASON OF THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. YOU MAY RETURN TO READING.<br /><br />The formula to this show started to wear extremely thin in the seventh season, but they energized it with the romance between House and Cuddy. The bravura episode when Cuddy was potentially dying (because everyone close to House HAS to be near-death at one point so that he can help them) that Hugh Laurie himself directed was probably the best episode this show's ever had. Sadly, just a few episodes later, he crashed his car through Cuddy's dining room and started this season in prison. Honestly, this whole final season would have been much more daring and interesting if House had to stay in prison.<br /><br />Alas, Fox didn't think that was too good of an idea because, if time teaches anything in regards to television, you HAVE to stay formulaic and predictable.<br /><br />Aside from the addition of Odette Annable and Charlene Yi as the beautiful wealthy-but-feels-bad-about-it and quirky-yet-plain-jane doctors respectively, there is literally no new ground to cover. The team gets an unusual case that somehow ends up playing as a metaphorical subplot to the episode; House plays mind games with the team; the cure is magically discovered with 6 minutes left in the episode.<br /><br />However, the show still remains somewhat interesting because the ensemble plays it well. Hugh Laurie, though, is starting to look tired of this character and that sometimes comes across.<br /><br />The best but possibly also the worst thing about this final season is the friendship between House and Wilson. Robert Sean Leonard always works, but they might have gone too far this time. Near the end of the season, it's discovered that Wilson has cancer. The next couple of episodes deal with that news and a possible cure. This brings them closer, but will Wilson survive?<br /><br />This is the kind of hack plotting that I would expect from ER or GREY'S ANATOMY, but the Ratings Gods demand that you CANNOT FOOL WITH FORMULA. It worked for big ratings for those shows. Why not here, especially since this season had its lowest ratings yet?<br /><br />That should tell Fox something: You can't beat a dead horse (or House... UCWIDT?), so you should start running something with more life. Not that they should have just axed the show, but they could have really played with this season and made it interesting and compelling instead of trite, rote, and dull.<br /><br />It's also a conundrum when you've got a series finale where the one person in the world who House cares about is perhaps dying or dead. This does NOT feel like something that this entire show has been building up to, especially when it happens so late in the season.<br /><br />But this entire season has been a miscalculation of potentially epic proportions, and I would only recommend watching to die-hard fans of this show, which I doubt there are many left.survive?<br /><br />This is the kind of hack plotting that I would expect from ER or GREY'S ANATOMY, but the Ratings Gods demand that you CANNOT FOOL WITH FORMULA.

B007Q2N0HA|5.0|A real page turner, I read the entire book in one sitting, I couldn't put it down. I was so impressed with the writing style, the storyline was great, my only regret was the repetitive running away to return, but all in all a great read!  This was my first Sylvia Day book, but it certainly won't be my last.  I am looking for recommendations from other readers on similar books, this author and book stand out where others have failed.  It was a steamy, fun read.  Enjoy!
B007IE4DSG|4.0|George Harrison Early Takes Volume 1 is a little treasure chest of demos and outtakes.  My only complaint: not enough tracks on the CD.  A long career like George's can accumulate hundreds of demos, unfinished songs, instrumental jams, and other related audio.  I guess there will be a volume 2, but I think that both volumes could have been double CD sets packed with interesting outtakes.<br /><br />Just listen to \\"All Things Must Pass\\".  A great outtake.  The CD was over all too soon.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This processor is simply fantastic for its price tag. I bought it to run a dedicated Linux box for daily tasks and it runs it without breaking a sweat. I haven't gamed on this processor but from what I read, you can easily overclock this processor to 3.8-4ghz and you will get great gaming performance out of it.<br /><br />The performance you get for ~$120 is amazing. Intel doesn't have any quads within this price range for the amount of performance you receive.<br /><br />Only con I can think of is like what others have said, the heatsink/fan it comes with is noisy. It will keep it cool if you don't overclock, but its loouudd. Pick up an Cooler Master 212 Evo or something if you want quietness and overclock ability.<br /><br />If your wondering whether you should get a bulldozer 4xxx series or this, just pick up this processor. The 4xxx series isn't a real quad core, its a dual core with AMD's equivalent of HT.

0441013597|5.0|How does one begin to write an original and interesting review of Dune?<br /><br />Appearing in print first in installments between December 1963 and May 1965, this is the audacious novel that forever nailed shut the coffin on pulp-style science fiction and cheesy space-operas.  This does not mean that Dune is literature in the way that The Great Gatsby, say, is literature - Herbert's writing would remain generally plot-driven rather than more favorably style-conscious for another decade - but it does mean that in Dune science fiction attained a legitimacy it had never known before.  The genre could no longer be so readily dismissed with a condescending wave of the hand.  Author Frank Herbert successfully mated together a number of disparate elements which resulted in a compelling future-fiction which, as of 2012, still remains unequalled in scale and scope.<br /><br />A substantial part of the achievement of Dune is the awesome success it achieves as a standard in world building.  It is for this reason that it has been so often incongruently compared to The Lord of the Rings, a fantasy epic with which Dune otherwise has next to nothing in common.  Jacques tells us that \\"all the world's a stage\\" in As You Like It, and Herbert seems to have taken the line as a literal challenge.  In reading Dune we feel the physical weight of an entire planet beneath the feet of our heroes and villains:  it's all there, the geography, the meteorology, the astronomy, the ecology, and all the myriad chemical and biological and physical cycles turning, turning, turning some more under the sun and pair of moons glowing in the clear desert night sky.  Herbert creates the masterful illusion of having imagined it all, and we readers are merely transient visitors.  The planet Arrakis, also called Dune, we feel to be an intensively real planet, whole, massive, subtle and intense.  That's the first part of the unprecedented greatness of this book.<br /><br />But though it's set in a future many generations removed from our own, when humanity has settled on hundreds and hundreds of planets spread throughout the galaxy and Earth is a distant, all but forgotten dream, the more important secret that keeps old readers coming back to the novel again and again, and new readers in high school encountering it for the first time and instantly falling under its spell, snapping the bait hook, line and sinker, is not a new trick or gizmo at all, but the oldest trick in the literary spell book.  In Dune Herbert very deliberately and very explicitly set out to create an epic hero, following all the rules for doing so that were well known even before Homer wrote down the Odyssey, or Anonymous wrote down Beowulf.  We are utterly captivated by the story of Paul Atreides because we have to be:  it's written into our DNA to be bewitched by this kind of epic hero.  Herbert's poured out a trail of sugar, and like helpless ants we march along in line, follow the leader, unknowing and uncaring where our fantasies and dreams of wish-fulfillment are leading us.<br /><br />Which is not to disparage Frank Herbert.  In Dune he is a master story-teller.<br /><br />All of Dune - indeed, all of the Dune series - is predicated on one single particular which we must simply accept without question, and that is that humanity has rejected technology whensoever possible.  Whether this underlying premise is rational or reasonable is never questioned.  Take away this underlying proposition and Herbert's entire Duniverse collapses into a pile of rubble and dust.  Reasonable and rational or no, all the drama of Dune can ultimately be traced back to this one fact.<br /><br />I've mentioned that Paul is our unassailable champion because he must be:  this is the nature of our response to the mythic hero.  Likewise many of Herbert's other characters also perfectly fit their mythic roles.  We loath the villains by reflex as we must, never stopping to ask whether they are really just straw men Herberthas created to be destroyed.  Probably the most truly interesting and original characters are Paul's mother, Jessica, and the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood to which she belongs.  Now here are some startling characters, with an intellectual astuteness encountered nowhere else in science fiction, or in mainstream fiction, for that matter.<br /><br />Shall I, in this non-review review, mention the spice?<br /><br />The spice melange is fundamental to the story, its need arising directly out of the restriction on technology.  If computers can't guide humanity across the gaping chasms of spacetime separating distant solar systems from each other, then somehow human minds must do so.  The spice melange is the requisite McGuffin, a drug which allows interstellar pilots to navigate through higher orders of spacetime.  Oh, by coincidence it's also the drug which transforms our hero, Paul Atreides, into a superhuman messiah-figure.  How happy Frank Herbert must have been the day when these disparate pieces began falling into place!<br /><br />Dune is one of the truly great science fiction novels of the middle of the 20th Century.  It has its flaws, but I lack the space to discuss them here; nevertheless, it doesn't get too much better than this.  As I consider myself a student of Frank Herbert, both the author and the man, I've come over the years to value Dune as a window into Herbert's mind and soul, and to appreciate it more in that way than for the joy it affords strictly reading it as a novel.  But if you are considering reading Dune for the first time and so you decided to check out a few reviews first, I can only envy you your innocence, and for the journey you are about to take.

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Sucks!  Wont log on to Face Book.  Glad I didnt pay for it.  Will have to stick with iPhone version.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the entire trilogy, each book was just as fastinating as the last.  I have recommended it to all my friends.  I think I'll read them over.  I'm sure I missed something besides its so hot.
0345803507|3.0|Warmer, less depressing.  Repetetive prose still a problem.  How many times is the reader subjected to \\"Holy Crap\\", \\"smoldering grey eyes\\"  (can't figure out how to visualize those, how many times must these two reassure each other per page?  I wouldn't have kept reading but was interested in the storylines.  Found myself skimming the sex scenes to get on with the story.  People in this trilogy are easily shocked and do a lot of \\"gaping\\" at each other.<br />The email exchanges were amusing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The addition of 50 Shades of Freed wasn't what I expected.  I love books where you don't think something is that important and you find out later that you totally missed it.  Very fun reading.
0345803485|2.0|Very thin plot.  I could barely force myself to keep reading.  Repetitive prose.  Underlying storyline is interesting, but sparse.  How many times can grey eyes burn, smolder and how many times can a person gape at another?  Characters in this trilogy are easily shocked, and gape at each other all through the book.  If you want to concentrate only on sex and forget the story, it could be bearable.<br />These characters need to reassure each other of love hourly.<br />Book 2 is slightly more upbeat, Book 3 .. the first half is dull as mud.  Very difficult to find the thin thread of actual story line.<br />Hard to believe a woman who started out a virgin wouldn't need more recovery time before the \\"next steps\\".<br />This woman must have some connections for her soft porn to make it to NY Times best sellers.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard this book was going viral and thought I'd read the first book.  I couldn't put it down, I don't normally read that many books, but found myself riveted on what was going to happen next.  I highly recommend this book.  After I reading the first one, I ordered and read the 2nd and 3rd and they were just as interesting.
0345803485|3.0|I was in B&N the other day, and saw this book displayed everywhere so I wanted to see what I was missing out on. I read a lot of reviews on this site and was a little cynical going in, I'll admit.<br /><br /> But that being said, whoever said that the author attempts to write in an  American voice, but it is filled with British terminology is absolutely correct. Im sorry--i could not get over that. It really bothered me. I find myself constantly thinking, \\"What? Americans dont talk like that.\\" For example, There was one point in the point where Grey says something about \\"hiding\\" and I thought, what is that? A BDSM term Ive never heard of (not that I know them all, lol) ....i had to google it only to find out it mean \\"spanking.\\" The book is filled with so much British terminology that it would have made more sense to make a character or two British.<br /><br />Second, Christian Grey's character should be much older- I would expect this behavior from a older, more mature man--maybe late 30's or 40's..but a 27 year old? Too young.<br /><br />Third, the constant \\"Oh mys, Holy this and that...etc\\" are so annoying. They completely take away from the moments. I dont remember being this immature at 18..much less 21. Give me a break.<br /><br />Fourth, I live in CA--and have never been to the pacific northwest but Oregon and Washington are two different states...Ana lived in Vancouver, WA first and moved to Seattle, WA--so why is there one scene where Christian says, \\"I have to take Ana back to Portland?\\" Did i miss something? Some one (who has been there or lives there) please help me understand this. I honestly could have just missed something here...<br /><br />Fifth, The email conversations. Some were a little funny, i will admit--it just dragged on too long.<br /><br /> I dont want to spoil the book any more than I have if I did--(for anyone who hasnt read it) in terms of the plot but to those of you who have read it, the last thing that Christian does to  Ana --does anyone believe that scene is really possible? After the first or second time, I would have said the safe word and left. She stayed until it was over? I didnt understand this. I thought this scene was ridiculous.<br /><br />There were other issues that I had that I wont mention here because I dont want to ruin the book for those of you who have not read it but I will say this--this book needed editing in a big way. I wish the author would have actually worked with American people who could have recommended she use words that Americans actually use--and a word of advice--if you are going to write good erotica, please dont say \\"Down there.\\" Read some before you attempt to write it.<br /><br />I did recently purchase the second book. I am interested to see if it gets better with time and I do want to know what happens next.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I have the Kindle app on my Samsung Charge.  Before the most recent update, it worked perfectly.  Now, it is AWFUL!  I cannot get the app to remember the place in the book I am reading.  Sometimes it even opens up a completely different book instead of the one I was reading.  I use the sync feature all the time, but it won't sync.  The menus are constantly opening and closing all on their own.  I HATE this new update!  I have loved the Kindle up until now.  PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game is cute and a great way to kill time. you can purchase coins and such with real money but you don't have to.  it takes a bit longer to advance if you dont but it is still fun and cute.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I heard about this book on the Dr. Drew Show from a panel of women and I was quite interested to read it.  I was not dissapointed I could not put it down something from the first chapter about Christian and Anna just drew me in and yes I have to admit it was the sex, but also something other than that.  I finally figured it out in book three.  Great read all three books!!!

B0055S348W|2.0|Originally I liked this app and would have rated it a 4. It works, but updated perms want access to my browser history, to modify my contacts, and to modify my calendar items? Why would a printer app need to do that? Going to stick with the old version and see if these concerns get addressed in future updates. If not, may delete the app from my device and continue advising friends and family against this app.
B001OGTT0Q|4.0|I wasn't sure I would still like this 'blast from the past', but I found it was not dated and still very fresh.  First, I really like the sound of acoustic guitars.  There are some electrics in the recording, but the acoustics really add to a unique strumming, organic sound.  Then, I like the vocal harmonies.  They are reminiscent of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.  One singer really sounds like Young.  Next, the use of a variety of percussion instruments that I can't even name.  The plucked rattling one on 'Monkey Jaw' is chilling.  Also, the songs often break into a different tempo or texture, and then back again.  This adds variety and interest in their music.  And finally, I must comment on the sound mixing.  The blending of all these elements that I have mentioned is exceptional, and you can hear each part with great bass and clear treble.  A truly original and unique style and sound.
B001FB4W16|5.0|Love the kitsch I got hooked on this entire series right away. The cliff hanger endings kill me though. I will have the intent of limiting myself to one episode and end up watching four, loosing my afternoon to it. This serious probably conveys the best example of character development. I go from loving characters to hating them to loving them again...except Pam...she has been consistent in being my idol.

031261246X|5.0|I work in the technology industry so for entertainment I often seek alternate genres. The fact that Mark Russinovich wrote this book caught my attention as I use his sysinternal tools in my day to day activities and have read his other technical reference material.<br /><br />I was definitely not disappointed. From the first page I was totally engrossed in the story. The pace is quick enough to ensure you will want to finish the book in one sitting but the writing style takes the time to develop the characters of the two protagonists as well as the villains and bystanders in the story. In my opinion I could find no fault in the plot, character development, writing style etc. (I am no literary critic but I have read more than my fair share of literature)<br /><br />Being technical literate I can vouch for the authenticity of the technology used. Although this is a work of fiction the reality sends an icy chill down my spine as the book's premise is quite feasible with current technology out there.<br /><br />I am really looking forward to Mark's next book and can safely recommend you get this one and pre-order the next at the same time.
1451629184|5.0|Reading this book was very hard as missing and exploited children are the ultimate terror for parents. But to understand the thoughts and actions of Jaycee gave me a surprising understanding of our natural mechanics for survival. For a child to keep her sanity as Jaycee did was truly a miracle. The agony of a little girl having had to go through 18 years of living a life with a pervert madman never knowing what would happen next, then adapting and coming out of it so strong and with her positive attitude toward the future was nothing short of amazing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have to admit, I only picked up this book out of curiosity to see if it was any better as a published piece than it was as Twilight fanfiction Master of the Universe.<br /><br />I was completely appalled that not only was it not better, but that it hadn't been edited at ALL besides a quick find/replace of the names Edward and Bella to Christian and Anastasia etc.(Steele? Grey? REALLY?? Let's hope Ana doesn't hyphenate her name) Were the editors asleep? Or were they just so greedy to get this out on the market after splitting the story into 3 books for maximum exploitation of the fans of this Twific that they didn't care?<br /><br />The writing is atrocious. The Britishisms drove me mad. The supposed naivitee of the *heroine* absurd. The sex wasn't even very good, and I feel that those who find the book hot have never read good erotica - or any type of erotica for that matter. I felt as if the main character was bi-polar at best, schizophrenic at worst. The *hero* (I am LOATH to use that term for a character such as Christian *coughEdwardcough*) was a complete creep. I simply cannot believe any woman would want a man like this in their life. Oh wait, sorry, he's a HOT BILLIONAIRE!!! OH MY!!! HOLY CRAP! DOUBLE CRAP! TRIPLE CRAP!! FLUSH FLUSH FLUSH (the only flushing I'd like to do is with this book, down the toilet) I sincerely doubt Ana *coughBellacough* would have succumbed to this psycho's whims had he been some ordinary joe blow making minimum wage. Likely she would have had him arrested for harrassment.<br /><br />I spent about half of the book fast fowarding through one boring sex scene after another trying to find some PLOT that didn't consist of Anabella arguing with herself back and forth and being generally annoying. Needless to say I gave up the search at about 70% complete before I deleted this thing off my kindle.<br /><br />If you're not an avid reader, or you've never read any books with overt sexual scenes you'll probably like this book. If not, saveyour money.

B003Y5H5EW|1.0|This was the worse Underworld ever made. It was so predictable, the acting even for Kate Beckinsale could not save this movie.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Love it! Need the update for Swiftkey 3 tho. But other than that this keyboard is the best! Better than all the other ones that's for sure!
B004289ZW0|3.0|I bought this as an iPad companion and to supply GPS information for the ForeFlight app.  I normally fly between FL200 and FL270 so GPS signal should not be a problem.  Based on the reception icon on the device it appears to receive and track GPS signals quickly and without loss -- if the GPS indicator is to be believed.  However, the bluetooth function seems a bit problematic.  Passing the GPS signal to the iPad is less than certain as bluetooth appears to be connected but ForeFlight (and other GPS enabled apps) do not always show as having received positional data.  Cycling the on/off on the GPS will fix this for a while but the signal will again be lost and not reaquired on the various apps.  Since more than one app shows the problem I am inclined to believe the problem is with the GPS or the bluetooth interface.<br /><br />The lack of consistent reliability is a major con.<br /><br />Pro: light, portable, long battery life<br /><br />Con: inconsistent interface with iPad<br /><br />I would like to be able to write my name on it, needs a space for a label.
B007IFZU5A|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the best metal albums of 2012.  A bit of background - I was (and am) a huge fan of Gothic when it was released (yes, that dates me).  I kept up with Paradise Lost through Draconian Times and then lost interest.  I have some of the later stuff, it is good, but doesn't capture my attention.  Then the Vallenfyre side project was released, which is fantastic, so I had to check this out.<br /><br />From my perspective, this may be the best Paradise Lost album.  Ignoring comparisons to past work (different folks hear different parallels), the key with Tragic Idol is that the songwriting is brilliant.  Song after song, the riffs and melodic structures are fantastic.  The vocal work complements the guitar work perfectly - heavy when it needs to be heavy, lighter when it needs to be.  The result is one of the most well-crafted metal albums I have heard in recent years.<br /><br />A bit of an update to my review. . .thinking about this album a bit more, I figured out why I like it so much.  Much of the song writing is very reminiscent to the structures (though not necessarily the exact sound) of Gothic and Shades of God.  Effectively, the rhythm guitar lays down a \\"crunch\\" with the lead playing a clean melody line over the top.  This is basically the approach on classic songs like Shattered (Gothic), Rapture (Gothic), As I die (Shades of God), and also used for Vallenfrye (though with a much heavier sound there).  But indeed, I have been weighing this against their back-catalogue and it really is one of if not the best - lots of great hooks with some of the catchiest work at the end of the album.
B002GSXKN8|3.0|I got this at a bargain bin price of $10 (not on Amazon) and it shows. The transfers are weak and there is little in the way of special features. Still, a cheap way to own all four of the original Batman movies, though only the first two (and possibly, possibly, the third) are worth watching.<br /><br />Darkhorse86
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game! It is different from the word games I usually play, and my brain is loving this. Challenging, but not too difficult. Does a nice job of gradually increasing the difficulty level. Well worth the purchase!
B007NYODBS|2.0|This movie is an hour and a half of fighting that is just frustrating to watch.  I did not like it.
B007R4ZNWW|5.0|One of the most compelling film I've ever seen. Not for everybody but a stunning work. I was mesmerized throughout the film. Now I'm exhausted. \\"Dragon Tatoo\\" people may find this exceptional as I did. If you can deal with sub-titles....don't miss this. Extraordinary. Whew! It's such a remarkable story line....do NOT stop early on...you'll miss a great film!
B007SGM084|5.0|I do not care that the trilogy cost $29.99.  I originally downloaded the audio book of the first one and the I was hooked after 5 chapter in and had to buy the trilogy for my kindle.  It was just too much to just listen to it, I needed to be able to feel everything about the story myself as I read it and enjoyed Anastasia and Christians relationship.  You did an excellent job and I loved the meet 50 Shades at the end, it ended way too soon.  I sure hope you something else up your sleeve close to this!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this was the best game ever because all of the games are really fun and it get addicting easy 6hhhhhhgggg
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Enjoyed the book. Been lifting for many more years than the author yet agree with everything he says. Particulary the guidance on rep range. In the era of boot camp style training one has to be focused on why they are training-to be super fit (and typically thin as a result) or to look bulkier and muscular? The guidance in the book on rep range speaks to this. You want to be big? Go heavy and keep your reps low.
B00007K02F|2.0|Wow - this was the blandest version of Jane Eyre I have ever seen. After watching Jane Eyre with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson this was a complete and total let down.<br /><br />Let's start with the performances.  William Hurt was just so awful - his portrayal was downright creepy.  The scene where he is declaring his love for Jane he is sitting down not even bothering to look at her. I could barely stand to watch him with his head down and his eyes looking up - he looked so grotesque.  No passion, no power - Frankenstein could have brought more fire to the role.<br /><br />Charlotte Gainsborough couldn't be bothered to put any inflection into her voice- no passion - no emotion - nothing.  She was - sorry there is no other word but - \\"blah\\" to accurately describe her.  Jane is all about passion but Charlotte's performance lacked anything that remotely resembled emotion.  You don't get so much as a smirk on her face at any given time.<br /><br />I didn't even like the two of them as a couple - I saw no discernable electricity or chemistry or fire probably because they were both decided to play their parts so flat and lifeless.<br /><br />To top it all off they took some liberties with the plot probably in the interest of brevity.  I can handle this but their choices to do this were odd.  For instance: they cut out one sister of St John (not sure why - she wouldn't have taken up any extra time) Jane arrives back at Gateshead for a 2nd time???  She first meets St John at Gateshead?  All of it untrue and perplexing - why change these things?<br /><br />Don't watch this version - save yourself some time - you'll never get those 112 minutes back.
0739368435|5.0|I'll be brief.  This is one of the best audiobooks I've ever heard.  I loaded a copy into my iTunes library earlier this year, and enjoyed it so much that I bought a second copy (CDs) to share.  I typically spend my commuting time listening to new audiobooks, but after only a few months since enjoying this one (and with several new audiobooks in cue), realized today that I what I really wanted to hear was this one again (and so I am).  It is one of books that can be enjoyed again and again.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Murder mystery. Very engaging. Reels you in in the beginning. Drags a little in the middle but ends with some unexpected turn of events. Definitely recommend it.
B00005JMXX|3.0|OK, so this movie has received mixed reviews, for good reason.  Roland Emmerich is not a scientist, he's a filmmaker known for big-budget CGI special-effects.  So if you're willing to suspend disbelief on the actual science described in the movie, and if dialog that's full of cliches is not a stumbling block for you, you'll probably enjoy this movie.<br /><br />What I liked:  Some found the beginning of this movie, as the environmental disasters slowly build to a crisis, tedious.  I thought they helped build the suspense and lent some credibility.  Special effects were cool-- my favorite was the Russian ship frozen in place on the streets of NYC.  Lots of suspense.  I enjoyed the scenes of teens being cooped up in NY Public Library, burning rare books to stay warm.  And, although I'm not a Greenpeace nut, I found some of the environmental scenarios thought-provoking (would global warming really cause LA to be destroyed by tornadoes?).<br /><br />What I didn't like:  A lot of the science, if taken literally, was a stretch at best.  If some of these changes ever happened, it would probably be over hundreds of years.  IF they happened.  The movie's somewhat alarmist bias was pretty obvious.  And some of the plot elements you have to take with a huge grain of salt (First, the famous scientist finally convinces the skeptical govt. that the world is actually ending.  THEN, they all think it's OK to let the only guy who knows what's going on trundle off in the blizzard, on a wild-goose chase, cut off from communications while he's trying to find his son in frozen NYC?  Probably not.)<br /><br />But if you can overlook these breaks from reality, the movie itself, and the over-the-top disaster scenes it depicts are pretty entertaining, at least I thought so.  (Spoiler alert) If we did all have to go south to Mexico, as sort of a reverse wave of illegal immigration, I wonder if Mexico would actually let us in?
1569242739|5.0|I keep buying this book for vegan women and it pays off in spades.  You'd never know that the cupcakes were vegan except that the vegans that made them will tell you without fail.  The cupcakes never have that health-food mouth feel.  My favorites include the margarita ones, apple cider ones, and carrot cake ones (go light on the frosting, they're moist enough without it).  There aren't many exotic ingredients needed for the recipes, either, so you won't find yourself dropping half your paycheck and driving an hour to the local co-op to pick up a vegan replacement for eggs/butter/etc.
B007IQX9ZW|2.0|My boyfriend and I purchased this movie thinking it would be cute or funny, at least good since Charlize Theron is in it. I wish I would have known this was a dark comedy, if you could call it a comedy. Don't waste your time on it as the plot is slow and the ending leaves you dissatisfied.
0439023491|5.0|Wow, I was blown away by this 2nd installment to \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy. I felt it was as good as the first book, if not better! I was on the edge of my seat through this whole book and it truly delves deeper to show you just how twisted the capitol is and just how determined they are to bring Katniss down.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to everyone. My oldest daughters have read this, they are 18 and 12. Now I am not saying all 12 year old should read this. My daughter is far more advanced in reading and all other areas, so she grasps these books and I would not shelter her from reading them, however, I am a little worried with \\"Mockingjay\\", that one is incredibly violent.<br /><br />There are a plethora of new characters introduced and I loved reading seeing Katniss and Peeta's relationship take on a deeper meaning.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Loved this game until I got pretty far in the game and my timers reset. I downloaded the game hoping that my experience would not be like the others but unfortunately it was. Not a happy camper. Please fix so s<br />I can start playing again.
0439023513|4.0|This being the last book in the series, I did enjoy it up until the end. It felt like it started with a lion's roar but ended with a mouse squeak, so to speak.<br /><br />I never before have experienced a series that captivated me that was so brutal with a strong female lead character.<br /><br />SPOILERS :<br /><br />Now while I was hoping Katniss would end up with Gale, I knew the writer's direction and really, to me I am not upset that Katniss ended up with Peeta, if she didn't, I would have been utterly angry. I am just surprised with this whole build up, that it just leaves Katniss alone in District 12, everyone basically has abandoned her, with the exception of Greasy Sae and Buttercup. Where the hell was Gale? I thought the friendship and loyalty Suzanne Collins had built between Katniss and Gale, that he would be nowhere to be found in the end. No update in him in the Epilogue either. Someone said Gale is/was selfish, but that I find hard to believe when their friendship was built up the way it was. (Finnick I could see being this way, but never Gale)<br /><br />I know people were upset with Katniss's indifference to Peeta after he was rescued and to me, it totally made sense to me. Being as she is not the gushy lovey dovey type and really, what do you do when the person who loves you, just by the sheer memory of you, they want to kill you? It seemed completely plausible why Katniss would stay away, but she would get updates in his condition, but she wrote him off. She is not a clingy type person.<br /><br />Now, I read someone's review about people expecting a \\"fairy tale ending\\" with this series. I honestly do not think anyone who read these books would think these would end that way. When reading these books, I, at least never expected that. I truly love an ending that creates conversation, makes you think and question the writers direction.<br /><br />And I understand Katniss being in a total depression when she goes home to District 12. She has basically lost EVERYTHING that has meant anything to her. Prim, Peeta, her father.... She had to see a lot of friends die and let's not forget she has been through \\"The Hunger Games\\", not once, but twice. Even the strongest character has a breaking point.y lost EVERYTHING that has meant anything to her. Prim, Peeta, her father.... She had to see a lot of friends die and let's not forget she has been through \\"The Hunger Games\\", not once, but twice. Even the strongest character has a breaking point.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I got this book right after it was released. Cassy came with her friend and author Holly Black to our school for a signing. I never heard of either author but bought their books to give them a try. After reading I'm glad I did!<br /><br />City of Bones is original with highly likeable characters and plenty of humor. Cassy did a wonderul job of writing this story that will leave you wanting more. With six books in the series, five released so far, none are disappointing.<br /><br />The story follows Clary as she discovers who she really is and learns about all the secrets her mother kept from her. Plunged into a world of Shadow Hunters, Clary must face the many secrets that were once blocked from her mind with magic. As the secrets unfolds, and with the help of her new love interest Jace, a jealous Alec, and beautiful Isabelle, Clary will fight to uncover the truth in a world full of vampires, werewolves, fairies, and demons, to find where she really belongs.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a story full of magic, romance, fantasy, and a ton of originality. A beautiful read from an author who knows her stuff.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|People who give this trilogy 1 Star, particularly for the third book, are doing so for the wrong reasons.  If you are giving the third book 1 Star, you already know about the writing, the plot, the sex, etc.  Why did you bother reading the third book, then?  And if you want great writing, read the classics.  Books are very special to me and the ones I enjoy most are the ones where my emotions are totally engaged.  This Trilogy is one of those where my emotions were engaged from page 1 to the end.  It is also one of the best love stories ever written with (spoiler) an incredibly strong heroine.  My favorite literary heroine of all time is Dagny Taggart from Atlas Shrugged and Anastasia Steele is now my second favorite heroine. Get over yourselves, 1 Star reviewers, when you complain of bad writing, price of the book, and other non-essential reasons for reading and enjoying books in the first place.
B00125WAWS|5.0|An absolutely wonderful movie that kept my attention the whole time.  Usually, I am taking consistent breaks but I could not move.

B002ZG9846|5.0|This movie is a definite must see!  Comic books meet normal kids who wanna be superheroes and villains.  Don't judge how good a movie is by it's cover or what actors are in it.  This movie is insanely awesome and actually has a great storyline to it.  I doubt the second one will be as good as this one because the actors in this one aren't returning for the sequel, but who knows.  Like I said before, don't judge until after watching it.

1607053551|4.0|This book is about the technical aspects of designing fabric, not about design itself. I was very disappointed when the author brushed off the importance of art/design classes. Sure, anyone can follow the instructions to put a pattern into repeat but the book falls short in not discussing design in any real depth. That said, the technical aspects are well researched and clearly presented. Aspiring fabric designers should buy it AND books on design.
B003ZSISGM|5.0|This story is absolutly amazing .. hard to put down and not an easy , mindless read at all ! I only wish that I had realized that it was part of series .. but read them all , just not in sequence. Would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a deep , well written plot !

B004LWZW9C|3.0|NEW YEAR'S EVE falls into that class of films best labelled 'cute'.  Lots of stories, most of little consequence, an attempt to pull everything together with the premise that new Year's Eve gives everyone a chance to make things different in the following year (the New Year's Resolution carried to the extreme), some funny jokes pushed over the edge toward silly, and a script full of holes.  But the bouncing around from micro story to micro story works OK because it gives the actors involved a chance to come on set for a day or two of work and leave unstressed and financially healthy.  Katherine Fugate wrote the stewed ingredient stories for Garry Marshall to stir, and the list of actors involved is staggering: Michelle Pfeiffer, Zac Efron,  Robert De Niro, Halle Berry, Cary Elwes, Jessica Biel, Seth Meyers , Sarah Paulson, Til Schweiger, Carla Gugino, Katherine Heigl, Jon Bon Jovi, Sof&iacute;a Vergara, Ashton Kutcher, Lea Michele, Sarah Jessica Parker, Abigail Breslin, Josh Duhamel, Larry Miller, Penny Marshall, Cherry Jones, Hilary Swank, Ludacris, Hector Elizondo, Ryan Seacrest, Matthew Broderick, John Lithgow and more.<br /><br />This is a razzle dazzle movie with some good moments, improbable though they mostly are, and a nice mindless evening to enjoy popcorn.  Enter with low expectations and take it for what it is - entertainment. Grady Harp, May12
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The beginong is okay, the actions starts early in the story, but it's just too much.  Too much of a good thing gets boring.  The relationship, or whatever it is, is all about a chauvinist with commitment issues.  Did not get to finish it, lost all interest midway thru.
0345803485|5.0|I must say that I dont typically read this kind of book.  I picked up the 1st one just to read something \\"different\\" and see what the hype about it was. Now we all know that this book has sex in it. DUH its a romance book.  Get over it people, we all have it. If you dont want to read it then don't but dont make other people not read it.  I am currently half way thru the second book.  I am a mom, wife and i work full time.  I can not wait to get home to read this book at night.  I read the first one in like 2 days.  It does use a lot of foul language and is very explicit when it come to the \\"love making\\" but it is a good book where you get lost in it.  I hope the author continues to write more, Im actually hating the fact that I am getting ready to start the 3rd book and after that, it will be over and I wont have anymore to read.  So try it, if you dont like it then let someone else read it.  If you dont want other people to know that you are reading it, don't tell them.  I personally had that feeling but everyone keeps saying the same thing about the sex and the language. just get over it! thank you and have fun reading.

B007PS0X0W|3.0|I finished watching Underworld Awakening and found myself unimpressed.<br /><br />The story for this movie just wasn't that good, and I would consider it the worst of the series so far. Kate Beckinsale carries the movie, but only because she is very beautiful. That by itself helps to improve or cover up the other areas of the movie that are lacking. Some reviews say they finished this movie wanting more. I finished this movie saying is this it?<br /><br />Kate has done a good job playing her part in all the movies, and they are lucky they have someone like her to make up for the poor story that she was given. I wish she would come to my house and bite me, but the movie itself was just mediocre. Good enough to rent one and never look at it again.
0375703764|5.0|Sometimes I like to read mind-bending fiction. Sometimes I prefer more pedantic deep-dives into themes and ideas. This book delivers an experience that alternates between the two. Johnny Truant gives a frenzied stream-of-consciousness flow, while Zampano writes precise and elegant explorations. Sure the story of a crazy house and its inhabitants draws you in, but by the time you reach the end it is the process of reading, and the form of the writing that is exciting. The climactic part of the novel is not what \\"happens\\" in the \\"story\\", but rather how you get to participate. So definitely buy it, scribble up the margins with the dark hallways of your mind, and pass it along!

There are not many options for a background change but there is an option to customize your background (I haven't tried this yet). There are a pretty good amount of options as far as changing the card backs. I like the \\"deal\\" options. You can have a random deal, a winning deal, and you can replay a deal. All in all I'd say this is a great game to pass the time away.

However Listen to the narration of Criminal Mind's star Joe Mantegna preforming this book unabridged on audio and you will hear a deeper  insights you wont get from the movie nor the personal  reading of the classic novel.<br /><br />Many years ago, Brilliance audio has a multi-cast voiced version of the Godfather book. This solo-voiced version is more superior that older radio drama version. Mantegna bring a heart and soul to this story, as familiar you are with the Godfather saga. He brings you a new prospective in his retelling of the classic<br /><br />Lately, I have heard  Samuel Jackson doing narration of A Rage in Harlem and Anne Hathaway doing Alice In Wonderland (Both from AUDUIBLE). They seem good pieces of audio work. However Mantegna's  narration of the classic Godfather novel brings a rawness combined intensity  of the Mafia experience. He does not slick it over with heavier \\"Italian\\" accents. He makes the character's hop off the page and into our ears.<br /><br />If you do not remember read this book or have ever watched the film, this novel beginning  tells the story of Vito, the elder Mafia  Godfather on his Daughter's wedding day. Mantegna opted a calmer style  in a More gentle voice for the character of Vito. This is  similar how Brando would slowly mumble the character's lines  in the film. However  this is the audio  storytelling and not an mimicking another actor style. Mantegna's  vocal shading of Vito tends to color the other characters around  the Don...highlighting the story with the character surround and encircling Vito.<br /><br />His character of Micheal vocally changes through this audio piece from a Naive beginning as the youngest son who wishes to be an outsider to his family's business to his father's replacement as Don. The transformation on audio is amazing verbal storytelling. The vocal immature character of Micheal in the beginning of the novel  to maturity into a tougher version of himself  is like watching  a child grow up in front of you. It is a total gift of audio talent in Mantegna's skilled verbal hands.<br /><br />Fifteen CD disks (eighteen hours) is a long time to be vested with a classic novel.

However, this is the second edition, new from the Oxford University Press.  Completely up to date, it incorporates the changes that have occurred in the momentous fourteen years since the first edition made its first very well received appearance.<br /><br />The author, Geraint Thomas, points out that one of the more startling developments over this time period is the vast increase in the volume of case law now available to the practitioners partly due to new technology.<br /><br />It is worth noting that within this volume of some 900 pages, there is an eighty-two page table of cases alone and 10 pages of statutes and statutory instruments!<br /><br />And it's also partly due, for example, to the proliferation of pension scheme trusts and other specialist legal products and services which are often trust related. And, as Thomas says, `there is now more raw material to select from, synthesize and explain,' as well as the fact that `doctrines and principles of the law of powers have been given a new lease of life'.<br /><br />This new edition reflects the fact that the constant and continuing changes in the law that have taken place in this complex area.<br /><br />It does appear that some topics that were once of great significance have become less so, while others, formerly of less significance, have become more so now- such is the way with the topic!  Also, certain ancient principles have been revived and applied to modern circumstances and conditions.<br /><br />Some chapters in this volume are therefore entirely new, says the author, while others have been amended in some manner, all of which reflects the primary aim of this edition which is to update the original one.<br /><br />The result is a formidable, very readable and lucid work of scholarship which, in our view, is easy to use.  There's a useful index at the back and a detailed table of contents which guides you logically through the subject matter.<br /><br />Chapter 1, for example introduces both the definitions and classifications dealt with in the book, including a very interesting examination of the concept of `power' in its diverse forms.  Subsequent chapters deal with such areas as the creation of powers... the certainty of objects... the exercise of powers... the excessive execution of a power... the fraudulent exercise of a power... the judicial view of the exercise of powers... and of course much more besides.<br /><br />This is to cite only a few examples of what is contained in this richly resourced work.  As the first edition has been cited regularly in the courts of England and Wales as well as the major Commonwealth jurisdictions, we have no doubt that -- if you're a practitioner in this field -- that you should add this long awaited second edition to your library.been amended in some manner, all of which reflects the primary aim of this edition which is to update the original one.<br /><br />The result is a formidable, very readable and lucid work of scholarship which, in our view, is easy to use.

This completely updated guide from Jordans covers to the full spectrum of situations, challenges and problems you're likely to encounter on a day to day basis.<br /><br />First published in 2000 and regularly updated since then, the guide is forever topical and logically laid out in six parts to include:  procedural guides... elements of offences... statutes... statutory instruments... practice directions... and codes of practice and guidelines.<br /><br />Part I, for example, is divided into eighteen sections from A to R -- from cautions and penalty notices, commencement of proceedings and legal advice and representation to enforcement, civil applications and appeals.  Also note the sections on sentencing guidelines for the Magistrates' Court and the definitive guideline for sentencing in the youth courts.<br /><br />In the words of the author, Alessandro Roveri, this latest edition `carries the most recent available version of the guidelines applicable to Magistrates' Courts (so as to include sentencing offences of assault, burglary and drugs)'.<br /><br />Indeed, all significant legislative and case-law developments are contained therein, including the full text of the latest version of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2011 with commentary.  In addition -- and essential for practitioners in the light of the `Stop Delaying Justice!' initiative -- the relevant parts of the Criminal Case Management Framework are covered and interspersed within the Criminal Procedure Rules.<br /><br />This is a useful, thorough and eminently readable work of reference which offers within its almost three-thousand pages, a range of extensive research resources, including tables of statutes, cases and statutory instruments, plus tables of practice directions, abbreviations and PACE practice directions.

Subsequent sections deal in turn with the acquisition agreement, post-completion issues and special situations, namely buy-outs and technology businesses.  Part VI presents thirteen useful precedents which of course must be modified to individual situations and circumstances.<br /><br />This latest edition certainly contains a wealth of new material, including the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 and Finance Bill 2011, (together with relevant legislation)... and much more besides.<br /><br />For your further research, there are extensive tables of statutes, statutory instruments and cases - and there's also a table of EC material.

HERE IS A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This popularly received book, now published in its fifth edition by Jordans, is widely regarded as the definitive guide for practitioners dealing with claims against local authorities.  If you're a lawyer dealing with general common law and public sector claims, or a local authority or insurance industry professional, you need this book.<br /><br />Writing in the Foreword to this edition, Sir Roger Carnwarth, Lord Justice of Appeal/ Senior President of Tribunals - refers to this important book as `a valuable source of reference for judges, practitioners and students.'<br /><br />The grand total of claims launched against local authorities continues to increase apace, partly because of the intrinsic nature of authorities as providers of public services such as road and pavement maintenance and repair, education, the welfare of children, the imposition and enforcement of planning controls, and more.<br /><br />Most claims are based on the law of tort, which is the major concern of this book, against the background, of course, of what is known as `the compensation culture.'<br /><br />If you're sensible enough to own a copy of this book in a previous edition, you really do need this latest one which has been completely revised and updated to take account of a long list of recent developments, of which the following are only a few examples, and include:  the latest cases on general duties owed by local authorities... the development in the law relating to child abuse claims, particularly limitation... the Human Rights Act 1998 in failure to educate claims... Court of Appeal cases dealing with the duty to maintain and statutory defence under specific sections of the Highways Act 1980... and Liability for trees including Bowen v National Trust.<br /><br />Researched and written by a team of expert barristers and solicitors, the book contains the necessary resources for your further research, including tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, and European materials.

Also covered in the title are the New Court Guides, incorporating the latest versions of the Admiralty and Commercial Courts Guide, and the Patents Count Court Guide.<br /><br />Particularly useful for the general civil litigator, especially in the county court, `Civil Court Practice' also contains over 60 procedural guides, each of which leads you through the key applications to the court and cross-refers you to the relevant CPR Rule, Practice Direction, or Statute.<br /><br />This useful and easily navigable -- as well as affordable -- volume also provides within its more than three-thousand pages, a range of extensive resources for your further research, including tables of statutes, cases and statutory instruments (referenced to page numbers rather than sometimes confusing paragraph numbers), plus a detailed and very useful index at the back.<br /><br />A notable added bonus for busy practices is Section 8, which contains directories to the Higher Courts and the County Courts.

But however defined, towage, in the words of the author, `arises from a contract concluded between the tug and the tow.  `The contract of towage is merely a species of contract,' he confirms... `based on principles identical to any legal contract.' You are referred, naturally, to `Chitty on Contracts' for further clarification!<br /><br />If you're a practitioner swamped by the intricacies of, say, drafting offshore industry contracts, this meticulously researched and logically structured volume will be your most authoritative and reliable source of information, interpretation and advice on the subject.<br />There are ample resources therein for your further research, including tables of cases, legislation...rules and conventions...statutory instruments...and international conventions, rules and legislation. There's also a table of forms and conditions. As a work of reference, the book is easy to use by virtue of its detailed and precisely organised table of contents and useful index at the back.<br /><br />The appendices -- all nineteen of them - constitute an invaluable source of reference, containing as they do, all the UK standard conditions for towage and other services, plus towage forms and much, much more. To cite just one example, the Towhire 2008 (Daily Rate) stipulates that:<br /><br />`The Tug's Daily Rate of Hire shall be payable in advance...all hire due hereunder shall be fully and irrevocably earned and non-returnable on a daily basis.'<br /><br />Would that all terms of payment were as straightforward!<br /><br />For all shipping law practitioners as well as others professionally involved in shipping, the third edition of this volume is timely and certainly unrivalled in terms of its value and authority.

Since then, many developments have occurred within the system of criminal appeals, most of which are complex yet precise and certainly a challenge for the criminal practitioner.  The purpose of this invaluable book is, therefore, to assist the individual practitioner to meet this challenge.  The result is a comprehensive guide to the entire appellate system, which explains the different routes of appeal and the procedures involved, together with detailed analyses of important issues.<br /><br />This is only the second edition since the publication of the first over eleven years ago, during which time much has changed. The most significant developments have been the implementation of the Human Rights Act, and advances in forensic science which have provided additional grounds for appeal. Editor Paul Taylor's stated aim has been to set out `both the procedural rules and substantive grounds of challenge in the major areas in which an appeal or view of a criminal case is likely to occur'.<br /><br />Divided into seventeen chapters, the book covers the full spectrum of appeals, starting with the chapter on `Appeal and Review of Magistrates and Certain Crown Court Decisions: Choosing the Appropriate Procedure'.  (Certainly, it's the detailed guides to procedure, including flowcharts, which is one of the most useful aspects of this book.) Subsequent chapters cover such areas as the grounds of appeal against sentence... the powers of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division)... and the chapters on the Criminal Cases Review Commission and appeals to the Supreme Court.<br /><br />This thorough and copiously footnoted work of reference contains over 100 pages comprising tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, civil procedure rules and criminal procedure rules; plus -- tables of European legislation, international treaties and convention, practice directions and notes.  There are fifteen appendices and a detailed index at the back.<br /><br />We particularly like the editor's quote from a Times article by Cyril Connolly:  `The test of a country's justice is not the blunders which are sometimes made, but the zeal with which they are put right'.  It would be entirely fair to say that this book constitutes inspiring and incontrovertible proof of that zeal.

B006SV2LWA|4.0|No horror movie has ever truly frightened me.    I've jumped frequently and been tense at one moment or another, but the most vicious ghoul or hideous monster has ever struck lasting fear because deep down, everything being thrown on the screen is pure make-believe. It wasn't until the smallest attacker presented itself that the paranoia stayed with me as I left the theater.    From Steven Sonderbergh, the Oscar-winning director of Traffic, Contagion is a frightful drama in a tangible way that is much too easy to relate to. Instead of relying on frightening characters and using extravagant effects, the doomsday film involves the audience, allowing it to surpass that which is typical of its drama.    The concept of a supervirus with no known cure is not altogether unfamiliar. Everyone remembers the recent H1N1 scare that prompted widespread fear and a consequent rushed vaccination. Contagion asks the question, \\"What if an infection were as severe and widespread as feared?\\"    Rather than give a concrete answer, the empty shell of characters go through the life of the new disease, starting on day two. The steps that are taken do not necessarily show what would happen or even what might happen, but the story does cast a light on the political, social, economic and logistic problems that come with a virus epidemic.    Just as Traffic was a look into the drug trade and the stories of people involved, either directly or indirectly, Contagion is a glance at humanity and the assumptions and interactions that surround public health.    While watching, I found myself angry at those who doubted the severity of the situation. I scoffed at the many who disregarded the correct procedures to limit exposure. Yet, during the H1N1 scare I found myself sick in bed for two days after ignoring the suggestion of vaccination.    The movie can be slow at times but is driven well by an outstanding score by Cliff Martinez. While still sticking to his trademark of strong guitar riffs and heavy percussion, Martinez takes a note from 2010's Oscar winning score for The Social Network and fills the movie with electronic melodies and fast moving overlays that add another layer of tension to already stressful situations.    Where the lead characters played by Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne and Jude Law were primarily flat and empty, the plot was dense and filled with interest. Several different layers existed within each aspect of the virus' progression. Even now, I'm just beginning to realize the huge significance of some of the smallest scenes or pieces of dialogue.    During the movie, I found myself fully conscious of every time I went to scratch my nose or rub my eyes and found myself wondering who had sat in this seat before me. Suddenly, the world of germs wasn't just something to be feared.    After an ending that makes the on-screen situation all too possible, the next big scare won't be so easy to dismiss.

B003IPC5SO|5.0|Big Kylie fan here from the states. By Far, this is the best album that Kylie has done in Kylie's 25 year career span. I agree with Kylie about Kylie's record label, Parlophone Records, did not do there best in promoting this wonderful album. Of course, here in the states, Kylie is ever talked about in the media, mainly because the Billboard Top 200 and radio DJ's don't know good music. I have purchased every album from Kylie and granted not every album is as good as this one, but overall Kylie has made good pop music. So about this album, just about every song is good. My favorite songs in order is \\"Illusion\\", \\"All The Lovers\\" (#1 Croatia), \\"Looking For An Angel\\", \\"Cupid Boy\\", \\"Aphrodite\\" (#6 Belgium), \\"Closer\\", \\"Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)\\" (#36 Belgium), \\"Get Outta My Way\\" (#5 Belgium), \\"Can't Beat The Feeling\\", \\"Everything Is Beautiful\\", and \\"Better Than Today\\" (#32 UK). Yes, just about every song is my favorite, and that is why this is my favorite Kylie album. Kylie has announced for a new album next year in 2013, so I can't wait for it's release!
B0059XTUVI|3.0|There is no question that Meryl Streep is a truly great actress. Her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher was masterful and the movie is worth seeing for her performance alone. Although the movie shows some earlier parts of her life through flash backs, I would have liked to see more about her time in office. There's a little about her as she's growing up and just getting into politics but not nearly enough scenes showing her as Prime Minister which I think would have been fascinating. Too much time, in my opinion, was spent on the part of her life that is the least interesting - the onset of her dementia from Alzheimers. Jim Broadbent was fantastic as usual and the rest of the supporting cast did an excellent job.<br />In spite of what I personally would have preferred to see, I still recommend seeing the movie.
0345803485|5.0|This book is amazing! It kept me wanting more. Hot, Steamy,Sexy, who would have thought BDSM could be described that way. Keep your husbands close ladies! You wont want them to far away ;)
B0079R8KXG|2.0|I love my new Kindle Fire and had been trying to decide which cover to get. When the Vine program offered up the Marware Vibe Case Cover I was looking forward to getting it. Unfortunately, the quality of the cover did not meet expectations. I am the type of person that will pay for quality items and use them for many years. I buy items that look great and tend to last a long time. The Marware Vibe Case Cover in red is an inexpensive, synthetic cover that looks cheap, feels cheap and has an odor to it.<br /><br />The case I received had a dent in the middle. The black stitching on the cover was uneven. The case had a cheap feel to it. And it had an odor. This is not a case I would recommend or put on my Kindle. It may provide protection, but it's appearance takes away from my Kindle. I will be looking for a different cover.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I haven't finished it yet, but it is a good read.  It is very exciting and easy to read.  I am enjoying reading it and can hardly wait to finish it so I can start the next book.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|With so many versions of the Cinderella fairy tale floating around out there in the literary world, I was hesitant to read this one.  Would it be the same old story all over again?  Well, yes there's an evil stepmother.  Yes, there are stepsisters.  Of course, there's a prince.  Naturally, she's a cyborg..... wait.  What?<br /><br />From there, dear reader, the story turns on its end.  This Cinderella is a strong, go get 'em type, with no need for a fairy godmother!  She jumps into the palace intrigue with little hesitation, willing to sacrifice herself to cure the plague, save her stepsister, and defeat the enemy.<br /><br />As Cinderella is about a young woman growing stronger and breaking free from her old life as well as meeting her Mr. Right in an incurably romantic way, I was disappointed in the relationship between Cinder and Prince Kai.  Yes, everyone was dying and the enemies were trying to take over, but any story worth its salt must make time for romance!  Ah well, maybe in the sequels.<br /><br />Cinder is an engaging and entertaining story.  Young girls who enjoy some science fiction should particularly enjoy it.  However, it also can capture the imagination of us older young girls, too!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have no time for a review this book deserves because I am in such a rush to read anything else by Hugh Howey, now that I have discovered him.  Thanks to Mr. Howey for the best book/s I have enjoyed in a very long time.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|I was lucky enough to get this movie<br />as one of my Amazon Vine reviews.<br />Now, I'm faced with reviewing<br />what I can only call:<br />\\"The Wicked Witch is dead\\"...?<br />They make a lot about her \\"The Baroness\\"<br />having dementia in her old age.<br />I can only be ashamed of a liberal<br />community that would rejoice at her<br />medical problems in old age.<br />Good acting can't make up for bad biography?
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a very handy ap, similar to GotomyPC. Yes, it's not heavy on features, but for a free ap, it's Wonderful and more than adequate.  I control. 2 pcs with my Kindle!
B007Z9RAX4|2.0|When I first saw the previews for this movie, I really thought it would be good.  Within 10 minutes of watching it I wanted to stop it and never watch it again.  I am deeply disappointed in this movie.  I love action movies, but this one reeked of a b-rated movie.  The fight scenes were awesome, but there was something definitely missing in this movie.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I think its a great game. it passes the time and occupies me while the hubby is watching sports. all in all its great....
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I find it unbelievable that this is on the best-seller list, almost as unbelievable as the \\"ALWAYS perfectly satifying\\" sexual escapes the two shared. This is very possibly THE WORST book I've ever read.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|awesome. game my cousin's had it and I thought I would never get it now they have it thank you Kendall people. BUY This!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Very useful app, I highly recommend it. You can use dropbox and you  save your files. I really like it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Nice way to pass the time.  Relaxing, but still requires some thought.<br />Good game for me and my older children.
B006G2124E|5.0|It will be another ten years before a movie so brilliantly cast, directed and acted will come along.<br /><br />If it doesn't move you to tears, you are not human.  The truth does that...
B0080CL0HM|4.0|I actually enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I was going too. I wish I could place it at Four and a half stars. I have watched many period pieces and all of Robert Pattinson movies and I believe that the movie was well written and the acting not just from Robert Pattinson, but Uma Thurman and Christina Ricci as well was great. If you are a Twilight Fan then first know that Robert Pattinson's character is nothing like Edward Cullen. I have to say that is one of the reasons I enjoyed the movie so much, and I say that as a die hard Twilight fan. The movie was true to the way things were back then as well as true to the book. I would recommend watching it, as someone who was not positively sure about it at first know there are no regrets here about my decision to watch the movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to admit I am a sci-fi junkie, and this series had everything I could want. Conspiracy,  explosions, apocalyptic theme,  and a love story that did not overpower the action! The psychology of the varied and individualized characters was intricate and believable, and the plot had just the right amount of twists and turns to keep me interested. The best part of all is that the situation that led to silo life makes you think a little harder about our society today. I cannot wait for more Wool; I will definitely be purchasing more from Hugh Howey in the meantime!
B003L77GG0|5.0|Love the show, so I loved the product.  You would have to watch all 10 seasons in order to really appreciate and understand the show.
B00008XFAF|1.0|This Company Sucks!! Do not Buy, We got stuck with a Region 2 DVD who Knew about DVD's not playing in certain regions. What a Load of BS. Pauly......
B007V2UGPE|5.0|when I played it for the first time I was confused but its simple easy and awesome and I still think the graphics are awesommmmmme
B000UE29SW|4.0|These types of books are not my cup of tea, however my wife loves them.  She found it uplifting and comforting.  If the wife is happy, then I'm happy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game to waste time with!! If you just want to relax or play on a flight or that long ride in the car.
B007PS0X0W|1.0|This movie was painful to sit through! I honestly went into it thinking, \\"I'm up for watching something mindless\\". It was worse than that. The plot was boring, as well as the action. There weren't even any characters that I liked or cared about. Just stay away from this one!
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|RIGHT ON THE MONEY. Political thriller without being preachy or over the top in divergence.  Good cinematography , believable characters and doesn't (once again my pet peeve) absolutely does not jerk the camera around. It needs no gimmicks . What are you waiting for a medal. Start the movie already . Free instant video for prime members. Go get the bastards......
B003HKN52A|5.0|This DVD is a great one to watch if you are an Elvis fan.  It shows Elvis and his \\"guys\\" out on tour, and what they went through, as well as the great Elvis music.  I highly recommend this video to anyone that wants to see what Elvis was all about when he toured.
B00029LNHS|5.0|A classic! I only have a few CDs in my collection since going to the iPod and this is one CD I still enjoy listening to while driving.
B0059XTUXQ|2.0|A failed attempt to combine a misguided ghost allegory with the powerful story of one of the most important women in the long and fabled history of Great Britain. Were it not for the brilliant performance of Meryl Streep, the film would not be worth watching. As it is, it is not worth watching unless you want to study Streep's inspired acting job in this otherwise epic disappointment.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it keeps me busy recommend it for anyone. hope you like it too. its allot like games on facebook. Nice to have some of the same stuff on kindle.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|No orientation to the game and then you sit there wish you could start frresh once you finally know how to play.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Two different sharpening options for the straight blade: one for coarse work and one to get a really fine edge, plus it comes with an extra tool to sharpen the serrated part of the blade.  Works really well and at a great price.
0765326353|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has done an excellent job. After 20 years of reading the Fantasy genre, this is easily one of my favorite books and I hope the series continues to be as good - as we all know that epic series can take a nose dive halfway through...<br /><br />I've listened to the audiobook as well and Michael and Kate are by far the most enjoyable narrators, they are very good at what they do. They also narrate the Wheel of Time series and do a stand up job, to the point where I now look for audiobooks by them rather than searching for new books by a favorite author. I hope they continue to do the Stormlight Archive. As far as the audiobook content itself, it is pretty standard, although the clips are set at 4-10 minutes which is kind of annoying since I rip everything to an MP3.  Total of about 475 tracks and the CDs aren't in the Info databases.  Not a big deal, just kind of annoying.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I have read the other two in the trilogy and so of course had to find out how it all ended.  This for me wasn't the best out of the three books, but I still enjoyed it and of course felt so invested in the characters that I just had to know how it all ended.  I have really enjoyed the trilogy as a whole and glad I decided to read them - they ended up being quite addictive!  Yes, apart from the repetitive phrases which I learned to forgive over time...  Great entertainment that had me gripped during many a chapter and awake until the early hours.
0345803485|3.0|I didn't give it a 1 because although I agree with what most reviewers who left a 1 said the book does have some redeeming qualities.Originally based from Twilight (badly written as well)and originally titled (Master of The Universe)I had no intention of reading it.When you add that to the fact that it was also fan fiction (I have read better) and that it's Erotica I just don't see Edward and Bella in that way (thanks to Stephanie Meyers).You end up with a book that was originally free on a forum and then removed and reposted for free on the Authors Website.<br /><br />Keep all of that in mind and you may just enjoy the story.It won't win any prizes amongst our better read reviewers.Christian Grey reminds me more of Damon from The Vampire Diaries (show) rather then Edward (Twilight)..Once again we are left with a female character who is so one dimensional (Bella/Elena) that you wonder why some Authors and how some writers can get published or keep their jobs..I'm sure a smarter and better editor could have helped the author out.The person you will fall in love with is Christian and not because he's portrayed as the most gorgeous walking human specimen on earth.It's his troubled history from a child into the man he is today and the man he becomes after meeting Ana.<br /><br />When you read the book read between the lines and put yourself in his shoes completely and maybe just maybe you will understand why he is the way he is.Ana poor Ana the Author gave her character no depth and no reason for her attitude toward herself.I understand why she does and acts the way she does because she is consumed by Christian and in love.<br /><br />SPOILER:The one thing besides the redundance and the lack of the depth to Ana's character in this book is that Ana became pregnant so soon afterward.I personally think that her and Christian should have had several years together.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing nothing is better so many games at once i love love love love love love this game Kuhn yeah
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Granted, more could have been done with the character and the action sequences here, but this film FEELS like a story of great man, a great time, and great deeds, now all forgotten. Framed as it is, within the discovery of his remains, it helps anchor the story to the present and to the future, by reminding us of our past, and there was once pure heroism, and sacrifice.<br /><br />God bless Captain America!
B007G5O3K0|5.0|Wow, what a great album !<br />I believe we start hearing the real Morten here, very much influenced by A-Ha and what he did with Pal and Magne, but more and more creating his own style. This album feels more personal than A-Ha, and this reflects in his live performance.<br />I went to see him at his Brussels concert yesterday, and was pleasantly surprised. Still the same voice but much more involved, showing Morten and not just the singer of A-Ha. A great show ! A-Ha was great, and I almost didn't go to Morten's show, afraid of being dissapointed, but thank God I did...<br />The album itself sounds a bit like Foot of the Mountain, but more personal and sometimes even more sounding like early A-Ha. My favourites are Lightning, Keep the Sun away, Just believe it, and the title track.<br />I must admit I like it even better than some A-Ha albums !
B006J420T0|5.0|This can be overclocked pretty easily (at least with the asrock board I'm using) but is fast enough that it isn't terribly necessary.  My case really isn't up to the heat generated when going above about 3.2GHz as it's in a mini-itx setup with a single case fan, but with a better CPU fan and case, I imagine 3.4GHz or so is no problem.  The video can also be easily overclocked quite a bit beyond the default speed.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|Wow--that's a great price for that level of detail. Right out of the delivery box I was taking shots with some very satisfying results
B0035G0U2O|5.0|This moive has it all: complete world destruction, amateur acting, iffy special effects and lousy plot. And it entertains from start to end.  You laugh all the way through it. I was on my seat with animated suspense, laughing at its silliness, corny lines and two bit cliches.  Its up there with the great cheese of apocalypse movies: Deep Impact, The End of Tomorrow and The Divide.  What's even greater about this movie is that it did not attempt to explain the mystic dribble of the Mayan hypothesis.  What a pile of crap that theory is.  I laughed the loudest when Danny Glover overacted his main line with too much emotionality to the leaders of all nations: \\"Its the end of the world.\\" It just had to be said.<br /><br />Just a side note: apocalypse films are magnets for the amateur.  Don't really understand why viewers still expect class acting in them, but then again, maybe someday someone will produce an apocalypse flick that can be classified as real cinema.  Maybe they still have hope. 2012 certainly isn't one.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much. Learned that people appearing to be Extroverts can actually be Introverts. I felt more comfortable with my personality traits in a \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" world!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best on line Bible Ive used. Lots of helps; support; notes; reminders and great audio version. Five stars from this user.
B0057URWSQ|5.0|I absolutely love Suits. After watching the pilot episode I was hooked. I watched all 12 episodes within a day! And I have re-watched all of them as well. Why is this show so good? Well, I love the premise. It is a lawyer show and it is very interesting to see all of the different cases they get. I love the two lead characters Harvey and Mike. Separately they are both very intelligent and funny guys, but together they really shine. They play off each other really well and have some really witty dialogue. Mike has an eidetic memory so he is really useful in remembering small bits of information and he manages to save the day a lot. Harvey has a lot of confidence in his abilities and at times can come across as arrogant, but he really steals the show when he is onscreen. He exudes this amazing amount of charm and utter coolness. The main reason I love this show so much is because of this unlikely duo of Harvey and Mike. They have a budding friendship going on and also a sort of mentor relationship. I highly recommend watching this show, it is definitely worth your time and money.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are pretty fun.  Some are difficult to control but others are really good.  The ads are annoying but I can deal with it. I like unlocking more games - and its free so no complaints.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I have come late to the Supernaturla fan base, but Im so glad later is better than never. This is by far the best tv series I have ever watched. There is drama, comedy, family, friendship, monsters, ass-kicking, seduction, Blue Steel ;) & more!! Plus, the cast is GORGEOUS!!!!! What else can a girl ask for! Plus, the gag reel alone is worth the buy. I would recommend it to anyone.
1439102732|5.0|I have yet to read a Jodi Picoult book that I have not enjoyed. Sing You Home was not as good as some of her other books, but still a wonderful read.<br /><br />Picoult is not afraid of writing about some touchy subjects and this book hits some controversial topics square in the face. If you are easily offended by religious topics or reproductive topics, stay away from this book.<br /><br />I'm afraid of writing too much without spoilers so I won't say more.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I enjoyed this book. It opened my eyes to a few things, and made me think.<br /><br />I recommend this book.
