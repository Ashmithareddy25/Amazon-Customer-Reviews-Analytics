0802473156|5.0|This Item took forever to get to me but being deployed has it's way of making Snail Mail really really slow.  Since I have taken it out of the package I haven't put it down.  I keep going back through this book and hilighting and marking things I want to remember and things I want to try.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|well, it can be beaten, but not by many other free chess apps.  Nice display, good range of difficulties, and the ability to continue a game at a later time.  very solid app.
B009XTF8JM|5.0|One of the best &#34;posession&#34; movies ever made. Well acted and written and plenty of suspense and shocks, though not terrible gory. Highly reccomend!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I  am very pleased with this app. and would recommend it to all my friends. I think it's very very good.
125000098X|5.0|VERY HARD TO PUT THIS STORY DOWN...NOW I HAVE THE FRUSTRATION OF HAVING TO WAIT FOR BOOK 4!  HURRY UP!
081186510X|5.0|Cool book with some great pics by the author who clearly had the blessing of the band to photog they're every waking moment on and off stage.  Intimate potraits by a fan and family member of this long-running crew.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|...although a little predictable with moments wondering, \\"what part of this is plausible, even in their world?\\"  I did truly enjoy the effort to bring the reader some understanding of the mental anguish one experiences due to war, and its everlasting effects.  Enjoyed the trilogy and would recommend all the books within.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|The game play is just that, SLICK. From the graphics to the music to the puzzles. The game is tons of fun. The kids like it too!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This is a dumb movie.  I have always been a Bruce Willis Die Hard fan.  But this has a weak plot, bad acting, and is boring.  I blame the writers and the producers.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|fun game, matching dungeon crawler upgrades and pixelated has a great Atari feel. would recommend for kids or adults. Awesome
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|This game is fun to play when you don't have nothing to do. And it is good for little kids to play cause they can see the colors ,when they light up.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Impress with the way the story goes and how the character of Ana evolves. I could not stop reading it, once I got to half of the book I was buying the rest of the saga. Read it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Slow start like the first book, not knowing in which direction things are headed but once the action starts .... your hooked.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|The Emperor's Soul is a novella that takes place in the same world as Brandon Sanderson's debut novel, Elantris. It focuses on a master criminal named Wan ShaiLu who's found herself on death row unless she can fulfill a forbidden task appointed to her.<br /><br />===<br /><br />Book Description:<br /><br />When Shai is caught replacing the Moon Scepter with her nearly flawless forgery, she must bargain for her life. An assassin has left the Emperor Ashravan without consciousness, a circumstance concealed only by the death of his wife. If the emperor does not emerge after his hundred-day mourning period, the rule of the Heritage Faction will be forfeit and the empire will fall into chaos.<br /><br />Shai is given an impossible task: to create--to Forge--a new soul for the emperor in less than one hundred days. But her soul-Forgery is considered an abomination by her captors. She is confined to a tiny, dirty chamber, guarded by a man who hates her, spied upon by politicians, and trapped behind a door sealed in her own blood. Shai's only possible ally is the emperor's most loyal councillor, Gaotona, who struggles to understand her true talent.<br /><br />Time is running out for Shai. Forging, while deducing the motivations of her captors, she needs a perfect plan to escape...<br /><br />[Book Description End]<br /><br />===<br /><br />Sanderson introduces a new magic system in this story, called Forging. It has to do with the carving of \\"soulstamps,\\" which can rewrite an object's history. The entire process is very hard to explain, and in the novella itself Sanderson explains it over a decent amount of time. While Forging is very hard to do successfully, if someone with the right skill works for enough time--usually over years--they can Forge something as ridiculous as a human soul.<br /><br />Shai is forced to Forge the soul of the most well-known man in the entire Rose Empire in only one hundred days, which is virtually impossible. Thankfully, her captors don't knowthe slightest thing about Forging, so over this amount of time she can plan her escape without the others knowing what she's up to. The Emperor's Soul is about what transpires during those one hundred days.<br /><br />The narrative of the book is almost entirely from the point of view of Shai, allowing the reader to get to know her and sympathize with who she is. Though the world may not approve, there's a reason she does what she does. As always, Sanderson delivers with his amazingly well-crafted world and characters. During Shai's captivity, she begins to develop a fondness of the arbiter Gaotona, some of her guards, and even the emperor himself. An emotional aspect of the story is that even if Shai truly can Forge the emperor's soul in such a short time, he won't actually be the emperor that once was. He'd just be a copy, no matter how real that copy was.<br /><br />In the end, The Emperor's Soul by Brandon Sanderson is a fantastic read. For a short tale, it's very well-developed and makes the reader feel at home in the fictional world. If you can spare a few dollars, I very highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I finde it very good becase every month subway surfers have a difarent place was very good idea for the game
1847879071|5.0|I believe a new edition has been released, so check for that one first.  I found this book extremely helpful for both understanding how to properly apply statistical tests in your research, and for negotiating SPSS.  Great for both novice and advanced users of SPSS
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like this game, but I am waiting for update 0.7.0 it would be nice if you put it in
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This series is like the walking dead mixed with aliens. I love the characters and plot of this entire series. Steven Spielberg succeeds once again with this great show.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I think this game is great but the space is limited and you don't have as much stuff to build with as you do in the pc and xbox version
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazon if you don't hurry and get the update out a lot of people are going to be angry including me!!!!!!!!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|It is really nice because u just click the app and it tells u how much battery u have left. It also tells u how long your kindle will say on.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|We found the film falling flat and short of expectations. Does not live upto expectations with a weak plot and predictable events.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game I have it on my iPhone and I was waiting for it to come out on the Amazon app store
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|At this point the book's been out a couple of days so I am naming names here - you've been warned:)<br /><br />Okay, so with all the mystery and marketing hype I was truly afraid to read this book, but it was really really good.<br /><br />Rescued after seven long years in mental hell, Sahara with her broken Silence (which was actually never too whole in the first place) follows her heart and accepts Kaleb so completely that it was easy to believe that the Psy who never had anyone else care for him learned of loyalty from their early friendship and managed against all odds to love to the extent that he would destroy (or preserve) the world at her behest.  I loved the awakening to physical passion between the pair and learning what both of these broken individuals went through in the past and seeing how they finally make each other whole.<br /><br />Also done very well this time around was the background plot with the Psy world on the brink of change. Normally, that part of the story always feels sort of thin to me, but with Kaleb in the thick of damage control and Pure Psy racking up the body count, plus the new direction of the world in the finale, the background plot was action packed and interesting.  I only had one nit in that one individual was dealt with far too easily for the magnitude of his role.<br /><br />So Heart of Obsidian was a great addition to the series, which tied off the original story arc, gave some cameo time to a few familiar faces (while hopefully setting up some future leads) and delivered an ice melting romance for the ultra powerful Kaleb with the woman I truly believed was his perfect match.
B00COMLLX2|4.0|Overall, I've really enjoyed this game.  The graphics are quite nice but the game experiences occasional drag/lag.<br /><br />I'm not familiar with is game and figuring out what to do and where to hit is taking time.  Still, I've no intention of dumping it anytime soon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Totally like this app. Would love my own horse .this way I can learn about being a horse owner.Love playing this
B0036JU6CY|5.0|Sexy,Asian pop  star Rain was wonderful in this movie. This movie had wonderful fighting scenes and great special affects, if you loved the late Bruce Lee, Brandon Lee, you will enjoy watching Ninja  Assassin.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It is great for travel. It is easy to set up every time you want to use it. Check it out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This games develops creativity, sense of physics, and turns a group of normally wild kids into a well behaved team, playing together.  Miracle worker. Thanks Minecraft creators!
B003XVYLDU|3.0|I guess I am just not a student of the &#34;classics&#34;.  I read just a few pages - maybe 20 in my Kindle - and decided I would go to my waiting MP-5 Thriller.  Mr. Vonnegut doesn't need my approval or applause as he is a well respected and talented author.  I am sure I have shortchanged only myself but my entertainment is mine alone.  I am sure most of the readers will find this book hard to put down - it was just not my thing.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Super fun and funny really entertains while developing the story well acting is superb enjoyed and never bored rent this film
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|this app is a nice blend of graphics, music &amp; strategy. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys these kinds of games. It is a nice compliment to the world the movie introduced us all to. I suggest you try it for yourself.
0399162097|5.0|Rosemary Cooke, the narrator of this extraordinary book, follows her father's dictum of beginning her story in the middle, then branching out from there.  As a result, her stories about her nuclear family center around her parents and two siblings in conventional form.  It is not until the reader is almost 1/3 in that she reveals that Fern, the sister she has been raised with from infancy to the age of 5, was actually a chimpanzee, that her farmhouse home was actually a research center continually filled with \\"grad students\\" and funded by the University of Indiana.  By putting this in a review, I am not issuing spoilers because this fact is present on the book cover, in publicity material, and in other reviews.<br /><br />Fowler intended Rosemary's story be presented in such a way that the reader would envision the mystery of Fern's disappearance from their lives as child abduction.  But also Rosemary remarks several times that she does not want to be defined by the fact that she was \\"raised with a chimpanzee.\\"  How the family copes with this separation is truly wrenching.  It tears them apart in ways they never could have envisioned, rendering all the research up to that point inconsequential.  The department of science really missed the boat, since that would have provided the groundbreaking material they could have used to create a truly original piece of research.  Of course, the family could not have been apprised of that fact, since the interwoven threads of love included Fern.  This is a highly addictive book with remarkable character development.  Highly recommended.
B000V39KDO|5.0|300 is a very accurate account of the famous 300 Spartans and their King. Saw the movie when it 1st came out only once been looking for it since until I saw it on Amazon. Thanks Amazon. Again the movie is perfect.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have really enjoyed this game.  It is not your typical repetitive hidden object game.  The story line can play out for a LONG time.  If you are patient you can get to a high level without buying anything in the store.  I have played this game every day since I downloaded it and I still love it like it's brand new.  I have had some issues with force closing or I'd have given it 5 stars.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It's pretty good though I wish they could of done better like a notice so you can charge it if you can't not see the battery power
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game has pretty good graffics and even though things take a long time to build I'm rating this five stars because they are realistic amounts of time.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|I am new at technology and not sure how to use this app. Maybe as I get a little further along I will get to know what I am doing.
193700788X|5.0|Thank you Charlene Harris for a great ride!  I've loved all these books.  Bless your heart for being able to keep Sookie fun, flawed, kind, sympathetic and interesting all the way to the end. I'm gonna miss this gal.

B009NX61JY|5.0|I love Barbara Streisand and she is great as always, good movie for lifting spirits. She is the caterpillar that blossoms into a butterfly.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Ok I thought it wasn't going to be fun but it turns out kid safe and fun I would recommend this to anyone.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|A great movie that proves that it will happen only when it's meant to happen, not before. Girl meets guy, times are not right for love, boy and girl don't see each other for many years but then fate brings them together again. Great movie and a must watch if you are someone who wants to believe in love everlasting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book keeps you into.  Never want to put the book down.  I hope there will be more of Christian and Ana.

B00AW8UK0K|2.0|No new information in this book. Another fad diet bound to screw your metabolism perhaps. Who knows. Good food and movement works well enough.
B00AEFYQE2|5.0|Love story with a No-strings attached twist, very funny movie, can watch over and over again. Again very funny movie
B00BW6SOIQ|1.0|I was hoping this movie would be a much better than it was. I didnt feel the least bit excited about the movie. It was slow and so bizarre t was difficult to stay focused.

B0067AC5KA|4.0|For the first time ever, i have read a book after seeing the movie(s) - admittedly at the suggestion of my sister-in-law.  Actually, i first saw the US movie, loved it, then bought the extended version of the Swedish movie trilogy on DVD from Amazon.  Comparing the differences is incredible fun.  In truth, i might not have bought the 'book', but i had just bought a Kindle paper-white and I was anxious to try it out on something.<br /><br />It is a great reading experience, though the graphic of the family tree in book one was simply not legible on the Kindle.
0143114085|5.0|The novel is more than a page turner, because it keeps you on the edge of your seat or wherever you are sitting to read it.
B00CWV8X04|5.0|This movie revels in the unexpected twist.  Should you figure it out early, please let me know how you did it.  Great characterizations, excellent writing, inspired direction, intelligently acted. Enjoy!
0142421715|5.0|This book is worth reading and adding to any library.  It is a little more mature for young readers, but high school students would love it.
6305428042|5.0|Here comes Halloween, presented as one of the funniest and best.  Hard working Bette Midler does a fabulous job, with Sarah and Kathy playing perfect cohorts.  The story is based on local folklore, with lots of fun and singing, and plenty of Halloween fun without Chucky , Jason, chainsaws, or Jurassic Park to scare the kids. They will definitely enjoy the talking cat.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Both my husband and I love this game. I'm terrible at video games,  but I really enjoy this one. Its hard to believe such a great ap is free. Thanks for the awesome game.
B0014YVC6W|5.0|We used to have this movie on video.  When I came across it on dvd I bought it.  My children loved it when they were small, and my grandsons have discovered they love it too.  It is lively, funny, and has just the right amount of unpredictability.  Sort of a precursor to Wall-e, also a delightful movie.  It's a very fun adventure with real people, and what happens and how it turns out is a hoot.  Buy and enjoy!!!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|A really fun and entertaining book that moves at a lightening pace and yet has enough detail to keep the reader engaged.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This was good.  Unexpectedly, good.  Nice performances by the cast make an interesting (twisty) story even better.  At first I thought it was just going to be an indictment of our crooked broken medical system, but it turns into something more.
B008JJM88Q|2.0|I got this game for free and had no problems running it....after I read the extensive permission requirements. Holy crap, I had to agree to everything short of a blood test and proof of my parent's marriage to get it!  And once I complete this review I'm gonna remove this bad boy!!  As far as games go it was Ok.  But it does have a glitch.  If you stump the genie you are encouraged to enter you character's name in the box but once you type in the name there is no &quot;enter&quot; prompt or button. My advice is to pass over this one.  There's gotta be a reason for all those permissions they require...!!!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Having a ball playing this game. Hard enough to be a challenge but easy enough to actually solve the levels.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Great to play in the car while stuck in traffic....or on the road for a long trip.  Very soothing and calming!
B007MDB71O|4.0|I like the genre.  I like the story.  It's entertaining.  I'm not one to pick apart the plot.  Considering the story was was originally written around 1912, it's quite good!
B001DTTG16|2.0|It's true what they say....you can never go back....and this includes watching (and enjoying) movies like this one from the 80's.

B00APJLEGA|5.0|My kids loved this show. I was worried the monster theme might be scary. It isn't, just very cute sweet characters
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|This was different from a lot of what's been out lately, which was a very pleasant surprise. As for the ending, I think that's just going to be a matter of opinion. I personally thought it was a daring thing to do, although I thought it was a little over-long. Still, I would definitely recommend this to friends.

0061438294|4.0|.....kind of puts a little shade like he's \\"not so clear\\" on things, when he refers back to evolution and his ancestors being apes. Too bad.<br />Otherwise, it's interesting information and fun to watch people. Good info to keep under your hat when you want to understand peoples' unconscious signals and the truth behind what they're saying.<br />Hide the bananas around him, though. I believe God when He said He created man. Genesis 1:25 NLT \\"After God made all sorts of animals.. Gen 1:26: \\"Then God said Let us make people in Our image, to be like Ourselves..\\"

B00CFA222M|4.0|Nicholas Hoult has been knocking my socks off, as an actor, since I saw him on episode one of \\"Skins\\".  He's so good, and the biggest reason I watched JACK THE GIANT SLAYER - a not-so-modern modern take on the well-known fairy tale \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\".  The film opens with Jack as a young boy, where through his father's tales we learn the legend behind the great giants that live far above the earth, and how one day a giant beanstalk enabled them to come down and almost destroy the land ... until a wise-thinking king found a way to forge a crown that kept the giants under his control so he could send them home.<br /><br />Cut to Jack at 18 (I think).  Orphaned, he now lives with his farmer uncle and works the small plot of land they live on.  But things aren't going well, and Uncle sends Jack to town to sell their one and only horse to buy the materials needed to repair their roof before the rains come.  In town, Jack finds himself taking on ruffians to save a beautiful young woman - Princess Isabelle, the king's daughter, no less - but is having trouble selling the horse until a monk offers him a handful of beans as collateral, telling Jack to come by the monastery later for his payment.  The film, after this, follows form as just one bean that Jack loses track of grows into a monstrous beanstalk - and when Isabelle is trapped in it, Jack insinuates himself into the search party the king sends out to rescue her (which includes a couple of really bad guys with  more than rescue on their minds).<br /><br />Even with all the CGI - which I normally hate in abundance like this - the film is fun, entertaining, and provides just enough twists to the original fairy tale while staying very true to it at the same time.  Hoult is great, Eleanor Tomlinson as Isabelle suitably tough yet vulnerable, and both Ewan McGregor (heading the rescue team) and Stanley Tucci (big-time bad guy, here) all make the film one that grabs your attention even as the tension and action both escalate.  A pretty fun, even family friendly movie that travels no real new ground but somehow still manages to feel fresh.calate.

B00A6X9Z8E|4.0|This Kelly Clarkson CD called \\"Greatest Hits-Chapter One\\" (released in Nov'12), is a great compilation CD. However, it could have been an extraordinary compilation CD!! It is missing 5 Hits!! Granted, they aren't Kelly's biggest hits, they are hits/great songs!! This CD is 63:45 in length (63 minutes & 45 seconds). However, a CD can fit 80 minutes worth of music. It's yet another case of the record companies screwing consumers of hits on compilation CD's!! The record company could have easily included at least 4 of the 5 missing hits had they chose to!! They couldn't fit all 5 of the missing hits on this CD because that would add up to 81:57, which is almost 2 minutes over the 80 minute maximum.<br /><br />The 5 missing hits in chronological order are:<br /><br />1. Low (2003) - From the CD: \\"Thankful\\"<br />2. The Trouble with Love is (2004) - From the CD: \\"Thankful\\"<br />3. I Do Not Hook Up (2009) - From the CD: \\"All I Ever Wanted\\"<br />4. All I Ever Wanted (2010) - From the CD: \\"All I Ever Wanted\\"<br />5. Dark Side (2012) - From the CD: \\"Stronger\\"<br /><br />So if you want to complete your Kelly Clarkson hits collection, you'll have to buy all 5 songs from the Amazon mp3 store or iTunes (or buy the actual CD's these songs are on) and then your Kelly Clarkson compilation of hits will include ALL Hits in \\"Chapter One\\" of Kelly's amazing career!!<br /><br />I hope this was a helpful review.<br /><br />Thank you.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Alright let's start with the fact that this has now gone from three books to five. Lame. I love Gideon as much as the next girl. That said I feel like my love of Gideon is being exploited. Here's why. The book at 34% was nothing but Eva recanting over and over how hot Gideon is. Male perfection you say? Check.<br />Picture of male virility? Check. Golden skin? Got it. If you eliminate all the swooning she does over him, and by swooning I mean it's almost fan worship, the book would be 50% less book. Ergo, you could wrap everything up in this book. Nothing really happens until about 40% into it. Once it really starts to cook it ends. I'm done. I felt cheated. These cliffhanger books with delay after delay before the next that goes from a trilogy to a nine part series is done for me.
B008JJM88Q|2.0|Works like the original but it no longer shows you the details of the questions and answers as it use to do.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|of all the games I play on my kindle I really enjoy playing this one. Ferris is my next best
B00AO2TREY|5.0|The album is great. I really enjoyed the first listen through of the album.  The accompanying DVD is awesome.  I totally want to see them live now.  They definitely need and deserve some air play in the US.  They are one of my favorite new alternative/electronic bands.
B00CW665VI|4.0|I really feel conflicted about this book. On the one hand, I really enjoyed myself while I read this... on the other, I wasn't a huge fan of the writing style.<br /><br />Why do I say that? Well, it's so different to the usual... which may not be a bad thing... but I found it so distracting. Okay, let me explain this a little better:<br /><br />So Drew is telling us 'first hand' about his story... okay, and it's a good story. But Nothing special really, the usual playboy meets nice girl and since meeting her he finds himself changing his playboy ways.<br /><br />Buuutttt...<br /><br />Only about 15% - 20% of the book is about the development of the plot. The rest? Ramblings, flashbacks, explanations and such... it's so different that I can't really decide if it's good different or bad different.<br /><br />Look... I'm not saying it's not a good book, because essentially it's a really great read. It's funny, light and just all-round entertaining. But all those add-on's really just distract you from the matter at hand. One minute you are reading about Drew's relationship and the development of their tale, the next you are told - 'hold-up'- let's backtrack... or something similar.<br /><br />All this really does is break your reading mojo. It definitely broke mine. I was into it and then I was reading something which seemed almost out of context and then after a few pages you are back to the story, then you get back into it and suddenly it stops again... and so it continues.<br /><br />Anyway, so Drew's a player and he's proud to be. He's good at his job, the best according to him... he's confident, sexy, cocky and exudes all the usual playboy traits. One night he meets Kate and although his attraction to her at first is all playboy-like, it soon develops into something more and it's bye-bye bad boy, hello Kate fixation.<br /><br />So... really you'll have to read this to make sure if it's for you. I can't tell you yes or no. Because I don't even know if it's a yes or no read. Just go into it knowing that it's written in a context that's pretty distracting... but it's still fun to read. There are no exciting moments though. I never once felt drawn into this book. It merely felt like a book I just enjoyed, but didn't love.<br /><br />It's just easy and therefore if you are looking for a lighthearted book with some humor, then I'd say Tangled is for you. If you are looking for heartfelt deep-rooted romance... then no, this is not it.no read. Just go into it knowing that it's written in a context that's pretty distracting... but it's still fun to read. There are no exciting moments though. I never once felt drawn into this book.

B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|the next best thing. don't think twice, just get it. you won't be able to put it down until you're done with it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book, I would recommend it for everyone! A+++++++++++++  Do yourself a favor and don't miss this one.  Get it today!
B00BMUVUZG|1.0|Really, really boring. I was waiting till the end in vain hope that the book will redeem itself. But to no avail. Boring.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|I really can't write a truthful review on this one, I brought as gift and gave to my daughter.  She has stated, however, that it has been<br />a great help to her and has alleviated some of her fears of giving birth.  She recommends it to new mothers.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Just reread the Camel Club. I had forgotten the origin of the series and the depth of the character development. Really enjoyed the read. It was like reconnecting with old friends.
B001H4NXCK|2.0|Re-make of old series, small twists, so-so acting. Not their best effort. A Movie better suited for the Lifetime channel, on a Monday.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I use google chrome on my computer at home, didnt really think about getting a different search bar for te kindle, works the same, it's ok.
034580404X|5.0|Better than described online. I bought the books for a present for my best friend and when they arrived they were still in the package! Great surprise.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This has been a great game for me and my hubby to play. I like the amount of replay-ability and the fact that you can try to up your highest score.
0345529057|5.0|Love the series and now I love the books. Must have for avid readers or series watchers. Good buy, yeah!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I got this because it was free, so I was pleasantly surprised.  Don't have to do the steps on my Fire to find out exactly how much juice I have left
0345472322|5.0|This book is insightful, inspiring, and very educational. If you want to understand the way your and everybody else's minds operate, this is a very good book to read. Easy read too.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|What a great read, i could not put it down! very well written.  i can't wait for the next one!  Thank you for clearing my head from my day to day mayhem.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|This app is like any other battery life app exept when it shows you how mucb time you have left its completly off
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very good plot development, it's books like this that actually make it difficult to finish bc you as the reader have been so immersed in each character's life that you feel like you know their personalities better than your own.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I recommend this Bible app, it has lots of different translations, it's is very easy to use, I love it!!!
B000007MVU|4.0|The Fab Four's debut album by Ringo Starr, Sentimental Journey on Apple label vinyl is an album of old standards which he recorded for his mom.<br />These are all backed by the Geoerge Martin Orchestra.<br />Several names helped arrange the songs, Maurice Gibb, Quincy Jones, Paul McCartney, Klaus Voorman, Elmer Bernstein, and Geoerge Martin himself.<br />Ringo might just be the first rock star to do an album of standards, of course the late Harry Nilsson (an old mate of Ringo), and Rod Stewart would be more famous doing these kind of albums.<br />While not as good as \\"Ringo\\" or \\"Goodnight Vienna\\", this is a pretty darn good record.<br />He would next do an album of all country and western music, called Beaucoups of Blues, also a pretty good album.<br />Ringo had 4 great albums in a row, 5 including is first greatest hits called, Blast From Yor Past (which sadly had no tracks from this album), the rest of his albums have been pretty much mediocre, with the exception of Time Takes Time and his live LPs with his All Starr Band.<br /><br />track listing:<br /><br />side A:<br /><br />Sentimental Journey<br />Night And Day<br />Whispering Grass<br />Bye Bye Blackbird<br />I'm A Fool To Care<br />Star Dust<br /><br />side b:<br /><br />Blue, Turning Grey Over You<br />Love Is A Many Spelendored Thing<br />Dream<br />You Always Hurt The One You Love<br />Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?<br />Let The Rest of the World Go By
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Kids watched it many times.  Even the parents appeared to like it.  It does have some sad moments for small children so be aware of that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.It is so cool. I would recommend. this game to everybody if I could. LOVE IT! AWESOME!!
0545265355|5.0|I did not expect the Hunger Games to be the page turner that it turned out to be......both thought provoking and enjoyable.
0345803507|5.0|If you want to get your wife revved up, then buy her the whole set. During and still after reading these books she has been rocking my world!!!!!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As a man of few words I will only say that this book gave me permission to be who I am. It took the pressures away and validated my approach to interacting with individuals and groups.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to friends.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Easy to read. Fun and engaging characters. Usual twist of events typical for Kinsella. Enjoyed this book. Would recommend to all.
B00275EHJG|5.0|the toy story is super great........This one when to the top with the story, all the old toys come to alive. very touching story.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Kept me coming back again and again. The game has a great plot and the hidden object scenes were good
B005S9ELY4|5.0|for a true story was very good.  all of the actors di an excellent job.  Would refer others to this movie
B008KP6ENE|4.0|This game reminds me of Little Big Planet for PS3. Instead of it being a sock boy it's a paper boy Lol.<br /><br />PRO's:<br />- Nice Graphics<br />- Smooth Gameplay<br />- Great for kids<br />- Easy to play.<br />- Addicting.<br /><br />CON's:<br />- Controls could be better (Not to bad)<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This is a great game for people of all ages. Just like Little Big Planet for PS3 it is fun and addicting. Hope you guys enjoy.
031286504X|5.0|If you are expecting anything like the movie, then don't. The similarities to the movie stop after the name of the book and the name of the main character, Robert Neville. This book is great although not chilling or scary, but it brings the reader to another world in which the whole world has turned into a vampiric race. Most of the novel takes place in Neville's home and I would recommend this book to anyone that can read. 5/5
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The book has a very unexpected and touching story! You never know someone's past, deep, painful secrets could be hidden.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the greatest game ever I'm 15 its is a very relaxing to play. if you have kids they will not get off your device. I love this game they should add online to play with people around the world and allow you to login if u have a minecraft account if u don't u have a minecraft account just play as a guest
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I like this case very much. It protects my kindle fire and the orange color is nice, not too bright.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining even to me . I've never played little big planet but if it's as good as this then great job.
193700788X|5.0|I'm soooo sorry this was the last book, but, I understand why,  Perfect way to end and anxious to read the follow-up.  Thank-you, P.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome this game is pretty cool it is a time consumer for when you are bored and it is fun while you are playing
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|It really just needed to end. The overwhelming similarities to Shades were boring. It was horrible.  Most of this book was filled with sex scenes and not even creative ones.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft is much and I was wondering how to get the update on my kindle<br />Fire HD tablet because I want some lava buckets
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Enjoyed this series when it was on TV and have enjoyed watching it again. Haven't finished it all but enjoying it.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Best game ever I love it if I was you I would get it it is that fun so get the game now
B0093QHWLC|5.0|This movie was very suspenseful, tricky, and heartbreaking. It is a movie worth seeing a few times. I liked the authentic feel of Penn as he portrayed a father desperate to find his daughter's killer.
1452110581|4.0|Whether or not you're a cat lover, you will be able to appreciate the silly, succinct feline-ness (is that a word?) of \\"I Could Pee on This\\". Each poem is written from the perspective of a cat, interspersed with an assortment of cute cat photos in full color. Only a person who has been owned by a succession of cats could have written about their habits so thoroughly. The 112 page book is small, about 4\\"x6\\", and printed on heavy, glossy paper. Since it is written in first voice, as spoken by a cat, of course the language is simple. The simplicity is enhanced by the typewriter-style font. It is a quick read, and quite charming, though not really as hilarious as I had expected when reading the jacket. One of my favorites is on page 30:<br /><br />SERIOUSLY<br /><br />Seriously?<br />Seriously?!<br />SERIOUSLY?!<br />If I took YOU to the doctor<br />I would make damn sure<br />You came back with both of them<br />Down there<br />Now if you'll excuse me<br />I'm going to look forlornly out a window<br />For like eighteen years<br />Eighteen looooooooong years<br />Seriously?<br /><br />This book would make a cute gift for a cat lover, or someone considering adopting a cat.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This series entertains all ages.  Heartily recommend to everyone.  The writing and casting are suburb.  Funny and interesting with terrific acting.
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|Highly recommended in this format.  Ron Howard directs and Tom Hanks stars in one of the best movies made about the US space program and the miracles it worked in the 60's an 70's.  Ad Luna, Ad Ares, Ad Astra!
B008XFJEE2|1.0|what a selfish man who treats women absolutely like a possession.  It took the woman too long to figure that out, too!
B003K15IF8|5.0|When I try to tell others what this book is about it comes across as a very boring book. But Williams's storytelling is nothing short of brilliant. You identify with the main character right away and don't want to leave this book until the very end. Loved it!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|scissors for a carpenter. knife for a chef.<br /><br />Just get one for any housewife and her response will do the talking(with thanks).
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is a fun and very entertaining game that is surprisingly accurate. A great way to pass the time whether you are playing alone or in a group. This is one game you should have in your collection.
B008PHN6F6|5.0|i have seen this movie more than 20 times and every time i see it i feel sad for the people who lost their lives. i bought this movie for my kid. they had been to the museum where they saw few things from titanic and so wanted to show them the movie so that could understand some of the things that they heard from the museum. i love this movie very much and you never feel bored watching it.
B00B4YAQ5A|5.0|Been a fan of Saxon for over 30 years and can't believe they are still going as strong as they are.  Wish they got to tour in the USA more.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This book has some bad words, like four letter words, but it is needed to make sense. It is a good romance, but is very descriptive in the love making scenes.
0425263924|4.0|I did like the book finished it the first day.  I wanted to see what would happen next. Guess I have to wait for book 4 of the series
1905492073|5.0|It was every thing that the reviews said and then some!  Most every chapter enlightened me on some point.  This is coming from a diver that has been diving for 26 years of which the last 14 (yrs) I have been strictly DIR & Hogarthian, though I have made some changes required for Wrecks and tecknological advancement.  Halcyon (Jablonsky & Irving) should read this review, maybe they will move on, instead of their desire for profit...come on guys, your dry suit is not worth a breath of air as a back-up, and so on ...!<br /><br />Louis Pellon<br />Madrid, Spain
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Great cast, creative story lines, riveting scenes.I am hooked on it. I watch it in &#34;marathon mode&#34; whenever I have time.
B008AT9XOC|5.0|I am so glad that I found this movie. It is a lot of fun. Rick Moranis is really great in this.  thank you.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|This game will pull you in. After you complete one screen, you get pulled into the next one. I can be a little stressful sometimes because of the timing involved in the game, however, once you get the pattern after you crash several times, it's very entertaining. Good for when you are waiting in an airport.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|For all of the Glee Seasons I bought.  Thanks, now I can see this one from the beginning also. Thank you.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|While I am among the many that are disappointed that this was not the last installment of Gideon, I have to give credit to Silvia. It was very well written and gave even more insight to our complicated Gideon. It was nice to take this journey with them even if I must anxiously wait for the next installment. I can't fully say if I will purchase the next two books if they are $10, so I am torn there. I think it's unfair to not provide some insight to the 3rd book not being the end while charging a premium amount for the book. Regardless, it was a great story.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I've been a Bob Marley for a lonnng time...this movie had so many new bits of footage that I've never seen before, the interviews really connected to the times, the man and his music. Loved it all!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day is a genius! These are the best books I've ever read &I can't wait for more! I've read this book twice and still love it more each time! Thank you Sylvia Day for creating characters we LOVE!
1401937519|5.0|I loved listening (I also bought the audio book) and then reading this amazing story.  I found it uplifting and it tuned me into what is really important in life.  I found this book expansive and reminding me of spiritual freedom.  If you are into personal and spiritual growth, then I think you will love this book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia sucks you in again and leaves you counting the days for book #4.  While I'm aching for the story to progress there are so many great twists and turns. Well done my dear, well done!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This product is amazing and so easy to use! It looks like files on a computer which helps a lot.
B0012HRJEA|4.0|The some of the bazaar aspects of the film allow the romance and tragedy to sneak up on you. It creates a fresh telling of a old story without rewriting the script.  I think Shakespeare would approve.<br />Not appropriate for you children.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game becuse folw free keeps your mind at work and you have to make all the lines match. That is why l like this game.
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|Pretty ok game I guess. It would be nice if there was a way to earn  coins or something to get hints instead of real money.  Other than that I like it.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Everyone should see this film. It's frightening the way our food is produced. Very eye opening and has changed the way I shop and feed my family.
B002S45V32|1.0|Not my cup of tea. Might be funny or whatever to those who were teens IN THAT era, but not to me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|All the complaints about ads are absurd; how else do you think free apps stay free? A single tap on the screen gets rid of any ad. This is simply the best app available for Klondike solitaire.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Great western, made in the spaghetti style like the Clint Eastwood movies. It would be nice to have more westerns like this
B000FBJFSC|5.0|What a tragic story. This was so well written. I was really invested in this book. It is amazing what people can persevere and come through in life. This is a story about a family that was so dirt poor from Ireland that they were constantly hungry and scrounging for food. I highly recommend this read.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Kathy Reichs' books are all very good - interesting, intertaining & a good read.  I have enjoyed all of her books - wish there were more.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully written -always with an air of mystery. This book was hard to put down.  I did get a little lost and wished, like Shogun, there had been a list of characters to refer to as jumped around in time and location.  I will definitely read Hosseini's other two books.
0312611692|5.0|This is the most impressive book in the past 60 years on explaining developments in the Old World in the past 14,000 years, in both east and west. It should launch a new era in research in this field. I strongly recommend it to anthropologists, historians, archaeologists, political scientists, and other social scientists.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|I really enjoyed this version of Anna Karenina. It took a bit to understand that the stage is used as an introduction to a new chapter( Scene). I have read the book multiple times so the film was easy for me to follow.  If you haven't read it you may indeed be a bit confused or even lost. Read it, then watch.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Even when the story line was good, I wanted to be the last in the series... Now is just dragging...
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|After Black gives way to blue, I didn't know what to expect from this cd. I have to say, I really enjoy it. It has that classic AIC harmonies, haunting lyrics, and classic jerry riffs. The last half of the cd took awhile to grow on me, but overall, I love the cd! The song \\"Phantom Limb\\" is unreal! Give this cd a try.
B002YDSWJC|5.0|A great movie about a truly important historical event in our cultural history. It says so much about who we were/are.
B000069AUI|4.0|Bought it for my son. But I enjoy it too. The titles on the cd cover and the song-titles doesn't match, though.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I can't wait to read the rest of the series.  I literally didn't want to put this down (even had to take it to work with me and read on break).
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Now that I am a retiree, I have been enjoying finding books, movies, and TV series I never had time for while working.  Just recently finished watching The Tudors and have now delved into the BBC series, Dr. Who.  I think it's marvelous fun and have gotten to Season 5 so far.  I wouldn't have watched it this far if it didn't always engage me with characters and situations that have me often on the edge of my seat.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Just like all the other Harry Bosch novels- Great, I' reading everything I can find from Michael Connelly, never disappoints
B00992CF6W|3.0|I have my minecraft on the kindle fire but it crashes all the time and it takes forever to update. even a week after the update it still hasn't worked on the kindle. it Sufis.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is so damn funny, the scientific part so detailed and correct, though - such an amazing mix - I already recommended to friends because it´s just hilarous.<br />God, I laughed so hard sometimes, I had tears in my eyes. Thanks for some great hours while reading it,
B009GXHOW4|4.0|it works fine and it is so worth the money and it needs to go on apple products also. it lets you spawn animals and get things on the pocket edition that you can &quot;only&quot; get on the computer.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I only have played the game on the console and was getting curios about the Chief and his background story when I came across this book.<br />I have to say, this book is a must read if you loved the game and if you did not play it, read it anyways!<br />It´s a fantastic Sci-Fi story, well written, packed with action.
0786882212|4.0|Very interesting to read along with the movie. Helps a little with the \\"translation\\". Interesting to read the \\"deleted\\" scripted scenes as well as they tend to help tie the story together a little more.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|it works like it always has done in the past, nothing is 100% safe but its easy install and keeps you somewhat safe
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I have read a few Sherlock Holmes books before. I enjoyed this, because the books were all in one. A very good collection of stories.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I keep playing everyday or so, still its kind of confusing what to do and where to go the jury is still out on this one.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I've loved this series up to about midway through this third book.  I agree will many of the already disappointed comments in that this one dragged on.  I kept waiting for something to happen-some major event thinking this was the conclusion.  Ms. Day disappoints for sure.  I'm not sure I'm up to paying so much for another one of her books in this series as I already feel robbed!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|It did not download to kindle fire, I was very disappointed and I tried to search for help from Fireproof Games and from Amazon but no one could tell me why it did not download. it should not be on Amazon to purchase if you cannot download it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Love how cool it is now I don't have to go though all of my settings to see my battery.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I am on my second time around the circle after completion...can't help it. I noticed more new things do come along.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|great item
B005S9EJ14|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen. I love British films and TV shows, and Judi Dench is one of my favorite actresses, so I knew I would love it even without seeing it. After seeing it, I gave it five stars! The DVD was reasonably priced, was shipped in a timely manner, and arrived unscathed. It is a wonderful addition to my DVD collection.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|great item
B009ZM76J2|4.0|A great movie, though heart-wrenching. The true story of what happened to aborigines and their half-caste children is well worth watching.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|great item
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I did not need ANOTHER show to watch but Downtown Abbey has given me no choice... I can't stop! So good!
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|Very good read, especially at this time in my life. Change is good! And Hard!! Gives you a different perspective on how to grasp it and hold it
B00BIVN82M|4.0|As usual Buble is very entertaining. I like the mix of new on old on this album. Doesn't at all disappoint.
B0035G0U2O|2.0|I'm a lover of all things John Cusack and I am ga-ga for 'apocalyptic' movies. It only made sense that although this movie had some lackluster moments I really enjoyed it overall. All good things must come to and....but must that ending be an epic, fiery failure? What is happening in the ending is irrelevant and therefore there is no need for me to risk giving anything away (riiiiiight). The important thing to know is that the final line is something to the effect of, &#34;I'm not afraid anymore, no more pull-ups.&#34;<br /><br />Really? The ending to this grandiose, action-packed, majority of EVERY LIVING THING on Earth dying movie is a comment on potty training? That was some magic mushroom script writing if you ask me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 provided so many unexpected changes that I almost couldn't handle it! Very entertaining! I'm completely hooked and can't wait for season4!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my gynecologist.  It gave very helpful ideas on weight loss. It also had a lot of genetic development of agricultures of which I was completely unaware.
B00CBLQCO4|3.0|Not up to LeCarre's usual..<br />A disapointment  from my point if view.<br />Maybe next one will be better(I hope so)
B009R659L8|5.0|As usual, the author gives a brilliantly written book with twists and turns around every corner. I have always been a fan of Mary Higgins Clark and will continue to read anything she writes.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I fell in love with Mad Men after watching all seasons on Netflix. I wanted to share the show with my mom and wanted to just let her watch the first season to decide if she likes it or not. The price was so affordable! If she doesn't like it then I won't feel bad about spending a bunch of money because I didn't! Arrived quickly!
0823015033|5.0|I've been reading art books and following examples in them since I was born, and none have ever been written so concisely or passionately.  Katherine talks to you like an average person, not an art professor and makes terms and ideas easy to understand and follow. I always thought I had a good grasp on polymer clay; she made it better!  I'm very impressed with the exacting detail she goes in to.  A must read for any polymer clay artist!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Oh so very good the saga continues. I just love this series and cannot wait for the next book to come out. So hot and sexy.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|1. Four star.****<br />2. I loved it. I did not have any dislikes. All of it was a likeness.<br />3. The person that made the movie.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Another great story from Ken.  Almost impossible to put down.  I can't wait for the next book in the series.
B002LHRM2E|5.0|Excellent complimentary book to his other book &#34;The Goal&#34;. Also very insightful and helps understand how to apply TOC (Theory of Constraints) to Project Management.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game, but when will the update 0.7.0 be out, ive waited 2 months for it it ca,e out on the 5th, its now the 7th ugggggg!!!!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This is a movie that lingers in the imagination and makes you think.<br />It is easier to initially follow than the book because of editing  and character development.
B0090P0O70|5.0|This was one of the best literary purchases I've ever made. I had read the more usual edition of the book years ago and loved it but this version was spectacular.<br /><br />Its tragic and terrifying and so very sad. I read it and was so angry at the cruelty of humanity, at the ego and vanity and weakness of Victor.<br /><br />Frankenstein is a formative text for modern horror and sci-fi and it is a must read. I think this is the superior edition, also.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun game with lots to do. Every month there is a new change of scenery and now to can even get outfits for 2 of your characters. I would rate this game 10/10 and 5*****
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|The second story is as wonderful and touching as the first. Ally is very talented and I cannot wait to read Reached. This is definitely worth everything to the people that are sensible enough to read it, it is unique and brilliant. Simply outstanding. Good job Condie.
B003SI6C4O|5.0|Once again, this actor and some great writing made for an engrossing and intriguing movie - worth it!  Loved the twists woven throughout...
B003O86FMW|4.0|Recommend to everyone, it's a great book. Try reading it sometimes. Big turn of events!! Hope you like it! It's great
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Works well, I like knowing how much battery I have left on my devices and this is easy to use and accurate.
B000KIPT30|3.0|Nice simple amp. The amp only has so much power with impedance. Higher impedance cans will struggle, and the amplification will not be staggering. Sony tends to set impedance at 24, which is balanced for home and portable audio. Though I haven't tested this, I trust that headsets with lower impedance will seem loud and possibly distort. Adapters for 1/4 inch headphone sockets sends you to Radio Shack for that. Build is simple and intuitive. Since it only operates with a 12v AC adapter and not batteries, you will be locked into the nearest socket. Amplification doesn't seem to suffer from noise artifacts.
0061714402|5.0|Wow, what a book!  I read it in about 4 sittings.  Be forewarned:  once you start reading, you can't put it down!  I loved Megadeth as a teenager but hadn't listened to them for about 20+ years.  I started reading this book and reminiscing only to realize just what awesome music Mustaine put out.  The book itself is candidly honest and you really get a feel for Dave Mustaine, the man (not just musician).  He is forthright, honest and bad-ass.  He also shows a soft side of himself when talking about this wife and kids.  He is a likeable guy and I truly respect his candor.  I have read other bio's about Slash, Duff, etc. but this one beats them all.  I can't recommend it enough!
B00D56GJCE|5.0|Just watch episodes one & two. It's hard to look away after that. Tatiana Maslany - the central character, or should I say characters - is truly riveting. I don't remember the last time I've seen an actress OWN her part the way this young actress does. She's also surrounded by a very strong supporting cast - Felix, the gay foster brother (brilliant!), Mrs. \\"S\\" the no-nonsense foster mother, the ex-boyfriend (\\"Vic the Dick\\"), the suspicious ex-work-partner (Art), and all the \\"others\\", whoever they are, or turn out to be.<br /><br />Gritty production values and arresting extras:a not-to-be-missed rendition of \\"These Boots are Made for Walking\\" in German, yet, in Episode two, entice you to continue watching.<br /><br />Episode 10, the finale of Season One, wrapped up last Saturday. I waited to write a review until now just in case this engrossing tale went all 'formula stupid' (a la Downton Abbey this year) to see if the writers could maintain the taught suspense they managed to establish in the first two episodes. Yes, they did. The show is picked up for next Sping, so it's worth your time investment, since there's more on the way.<br /><br />Don't blink or let your attention wander, these shows are thick with references to issues that will become important later on. I watched almost all of them twice. I could not take my eyes off Maslany, deftly navigate this 'tilt o wheel' of a story.<br /><br />Don't miss this this one. I think it will end up being a classic.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Watched Skyfall and was disappointed. We had watched Ghost Protocol and have to say was much better. I loved Casino Royal so was expecting better action in Skyfall.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Heard about the movie and wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  It was engaging and delivered emotion.  I would recommend it for a medium thinking read with few characters which made it easy to follow.  You were routing for them!!!
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|After watching the MI franchises thought this would be good. Maybe another lead actor would have been better. Cruise isn't the right fit.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Different every week with constant underlying tones. Many strong characters with new ones often added. I especially enjoy the form's private detective.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|After waiting so long for the 3rd book in this series to come out I was extremely disappointed with the final product. Not only was the ending  incredibly stupid, with the writer even poking fun at you about it, but it left you feeling abandoned with so many unanswered questions. Even the sex scenes were better in the previous novels. Very frustrating and a big let down.
B008Y6RYDS|5.0|I liked the movie for the lesson it should teach us all.<br />I think I have watched it for the last time, because of the violence and stupidity of the characters outside of the lead actors.<br />Everyone should see this movie at least once.
B001NKI60W|5.0|You can't help but want to sing along to this movie. Meryl Streep gives her usual great performance. The plot is light, the ends tied up neatly. One of the best feel good movies of all time.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|If you are looking for comedy please skip! This is not a comedy! Sad and depressing movie, fell asleep. Knocked-Up fans might find this umm BORING
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was surprised at how easily this book caught my attention. I don't like action oriented books usually but these characters are so like enjoyable. Definitely recommend it!
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|This book is alright, Im not real impressed with this book. It helps you to learn how to stay healthy.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|This one made me want to read more of her books.  Now if I could just get my husband to read it.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|What I have read I like it. Its a very practical book, that I really do like I just have to read more to enjoy it more.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love that I can play when I'm not connected to the internet. It's simple to play yet fun. You get goals to complete but if you don't want to.... no problem.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Ethan Hawke does an awesome job in this role. The sound effects and music really make for a creepy suspenseful movie.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|A great card that can hold/store lots and lots of pictures. Will probably store a lot more than the average person  shoots, camera wise.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The story of Eva and Gideon has been captivating.  Eva is a strong, independent character with fire and personality.  Gideon's love and passion is fierce. Intricate relationships and supporting characters with drama at every turn, oh the drama!! My favorite story ever!!
B0053KWDES|5.0|This is an awesome piece of device!! It really brings to life and adds great base/sound to any already decent headphones. With this device, there's absolutely no need to go out and spend hundreds of $$$$ on a set of Beats etc. as again, this will give you all that you are seeking.
B00009APK1|1.0|This was supposed to be a new DVD and although it appeared to be new, it was defective--warped, scratched, skips in the movie, and blurred images. After playing for a few minutes we tried to eject it but it was so warped it would not eject and ruined the player. I simply can't recommend buying from Big Box Bargains! It was certainly no bargain and no asset to Amazon!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Very easy to use. The equipment is safe and it is easy to store.<br />I feel safe in carring my equipment from place to place. It stores the equipment very well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have 3 reasons to think that this game is worth the 7$:it is sort of like real life.2,You can build anything out of anything.3,Lots of animals to hunt.Therefore it is worth 7$
B007GE2H3G|4.0|keeps you interested and anything Speelberg does is great. Story line kept you interested. Good movie for everyone to watch.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|I saw this film on TV and liked it so well, I decided to buy a copy of it. It is very interesting.
B00CRW2066|5.0|I have listened to this album 4 times straight through and it is getting better every time.  The lyrics are amazing, and stick with you.
1451683405|3.0|Book reads well and, reading several books on philosophy at the moment, has helped me define some concepts I'd had in mind.  By Popper's definition, this isn't science.  His primary idea is along the lines of \\"can G-d create a rock so large he/she can't lift it?\\"  That is, you can't prove his idea wrong.  It is self-defining and being not falsifiable, it's not science.  And in that respect, like most liberals, he seems quite self-impressed with his own theory, to the extent that reality must reflect same, rather than the other way around.<br /><br />A problem:  Free will is not defined.  What would a free will decision look like?  If it is free will which is being attacked, then perhaps it should be defined and falsified, rather than his theory being irrefutable because of its logical construction.<br /><br />He does not show an understanding of religion.  He states that in religion, \\"free will supports the notion of sin.\\"  This is exactly backwards.  It is \\"sin\\" otherwise known as satan:  in Hebrew:  enticer...that aspect which allows us the potential for choosing good versus bad results, which provides for free will.<br /><br />He speaks like a partisan and not a scientist.  Conservatives do not believe in personal responsibility as an end in itself, but because they feel that it results in the best outcome for society as a whole.  Also, I've never met a successful person, in any field, who didn't credit luck.  But it is not luck, per se, which causes success.  Certain people prepare (preparation is key to free will) to use luck to help achieve success.  And of course, any student of history knows that those who are unlucky and unable have been cared for by private  charitable organizations, yes, even religious and conservative ones.  And, there are plenty who have experienced bad luck, who have been able to use the experience to achieve success...almost any athlete will qualify in this regard, almost any stock market trader or investor or inventor..etc.<br /><br/>Of course, because he doesn't define free-will, but defines all decisions as essentially illusory free will decisions, if you accept his ideas, you can refute everything above.  This isn't to say that people do not GENERALLY rely on habit and heuristics, as humans, to get around making a free will decision about everything they do.  Most of what we do is instinctual.  But that doesn't mean that everything is.  It may be that a true free will decision requires days or months of preparation.  But that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.<br /><br />I just had to write this.  :)
B00992CF6W|1.0|My son a got Kindle and my daughter a Nexus. Minecraft updated version came to effect on Thursday, the updated version was downloaded in my daughter's Nexus immediately, in my Son's Kindle.... not happening.... since Thursday my son is in tears because he love to play together with my daughter ; and for me , as a mom, is delightful to see both of them playing together and spending time creating \\"stuff\\". Amazon: I'm not a Happy customer at this time.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Scary, a bit gory, but more of a psychological thriller. It's entertaining to watch Hannibal manipulate all the powerful people around him, but still believe in therapy, talking to his own psychiatrist. Get to know the man before the monster beneath sheds his skin.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I liked this alarm clock app. It was easy to set up and I liked the different options. The selection of clock faces was kinda co. I would recommend this app.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|While most films don't hold my attention for more than 30 minutes this one got me for its entirety.  This is a compelling story that won't disappoint.  To think this family survived - all of them - is a testament to the miracle of life.  The young man who plays Lucas should have received an oscar - really, his performance is remarkable.  Fantastic movie, fantastic story, unbelievable.  Fact truely is stranger than fiction.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Definitely can't complain about getting this for the free app of the day.  Does its job and I like how it breaks down which app or function is using the most juice.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is a must have for LeMiz fans. Next to being there in person for the show.<br /><br />Will have to get the Blue ray version!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|After watching \\"Cloud Atlas\\" I have come to the conclusion that the only reason why it isn't regarded as \\"the movie of the decade,\\" is because the world is not ready for it.<br /><br />That's it.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|What a wonderful family movie! So many of life's lessons - leaves one much to think about and ponder. Luv the photography and the story was so real. A keeper for generations.
B004742Y68|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid and still do! A classic supernatural tale that deals with family sticking together and the love they have for one another.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Haughty hub. John Jimi. He n. Juan. The b yes November tiny I cut brother gives ghost in this country has to offer you can get it right away and a lot to moo
B00BEXB18M|5.0|There are 11 songs on this CD album, and all but one rock hard. There has to be at least one ballad per album... :) Anyway, this is a good buy for all Megadeth fans, I enjoyed it greatly.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Beautiful music, progressively challenging puzzles, and cool story line. Highly addictive too. I've played other Quell games and they are all great.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|I love these 2 movies. This one is exciting, funny, and shows the awesome chemistry between the lead actors. I hope there's a 3rd.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book was very rubbish and I wouldn't recommend it to other people under the age of 99. It was crap in other words.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Quite possibly the worst film I've seen in some time.  I had to turn it off.  I had very high hopes for this as the concept is fantastic.  Rather poor execution and storytelling.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I like this app very much very relaxing the sounds are excelent y recomend it it is well worth the $2.99
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|I hear the cries of our heroes and get it. There will never be another peace sells album. Never another master of puppets. Never another rain in blood. We all have moods especially as we grow up. Ever watch a movie and thought it stunk then watched it later in a different mood and loved it? You have to embrace where your heart is at that time and run with it. This is where Megadeth was at this time.  There is a lot of heart and feel in this album. I hear emotion in the guitar and that is really what its all about. Dave put a little rock and roll in it. Cool! Guess what? I get to enjoy this as well as peace sells. Win Win for me cause I get it!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|A little difficult for a 2-3 year old. Probably will be a bit more used when she is older altho I to have a difficult time with this one
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|Well I wanted to like this movie but I hate it when they make up \\"languages\\" and pretend plots.  This has no redeeming characteristics that would cause me to recommend it under any circumstances.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Perfect for a little one especially if she/he is familiar with Nemo. We use this on long road trips for entertainment
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|I love Alice in chains. Dirt I think is one of the best metal and hard rock albums of all time. That being said love the new line up and singer. Still miss layne though. Black gives away to blue was a great come back album so I was expecting alot from this release. It's sort of a mixture of dirt and jars of flies. There's some heavy stuff and acoustic stuff that might be on jars of flies and sap. But some of the songs start sounding the same which sort of kills the flow if the album. Still a great release by one of my favorite bands. But all the time they spend on it I thought it would have better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS IS GETTING TO COLLECT ALL THE CHARACTERS AND HOVERBOARDS. ANOTHER COOL PART. IS IT IS FREE AND VERY WORTH IT. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND DOWNLOADING THIS GAME
B000O77SRC|5.0|What can you say about the best action movie ever made in my opinion. I read something that Arnorie and Sylvester Stallone turn down this role. I heard it was suppose to be a sequel to Arnold's 85 movie commando. But it's a great movie it pretty much made Bruce Willis that and moonlighting. Amazing action and suspense and acting. Just a great action movie and great movie one of my faves!
B006HGXGWU|5.0|I loved this show I had waited so long to have it available and was not the least bit disappointed a must buy for anyone
B00BEXB18M|4.0|The last four or five megadeth albums have been great, I love the line up now. It seems like Dave mixes countdown to extinction and youthnasia melodies with the heaviness of rust in piece and peace sells who's buying? That being said super collider counties in that style while going into a more creative vibe, and still keeping the megadeth edge. Some of the best and modern megadeth riffs yet. With Dave from disturbed on some songs which is cool! There's always some metal on their albums but on this one bringing a little straight up rock into the megadeth mold. All over great megadeth album. Can't wait to hear what comes next.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is cool because it updates pretty fast but you know 1.7.1 is coming out&iexcl;!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&rsquo;cool but needs redefine and pistons and gold needs to stay longer
B000002KE2|5.0|Is a shame they never play any of these songs on the radio, but who listens to the radio anyway! Amazing guitar riffs and song writing. I heard while they were recording they were just getting high drunk and in and out of the hot tub while recording songs so its got that relaxed vibe about it. They were getting to there creative peak with the next few releases. Just a over all amazing black sabbath album. If you paranoid you will love vol 4.
B009K916ZK|5.0|I purchased this to connect my Macbook Pro to the TV / Projector. This connects through the small mini display port on your mac through a VGA cable.<br />Arrived in perfect condition. Works well. The display on TV is very crisp. No problems.<br />It was available on Amazon for a much lower price than apple website which was a plus.<br />Will definitely recommend buying from Amazon.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Dream theater is know for having long songs and a diversity in their music. But I read they got of your with megadeth, and fear factory and that heaviness may a impression on them and wanted to come back and record a straight up heavy metal record. Some of the heaviest and awesome dream theater songs ever. Johns riffs are some of his best and creative and catchy. Mikes drumming as always forget about. A must have for any metal head or dream theater fan!
B00992CF6W|3.0|you can do a lot but I don't know how to update because is this new update witch is v0.7.1 and I cant figure out how to update
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|In this day and age, where every band sounds the same and no originality. Volbeat is a breath of fresh air. Having a thrash metal punch with a johnny cash vocal melodies, and through in some social distortion vibe. Very original sound which each release getting better and better. Adding the catchiness of heaven and hell with edge of their older release adding to a new original style with a creative edge coming across really well.
B007Z9QTVI|5.0|Sean Connery at his best from beginning to end.  Didn't want it to end.<br />I will watch anything he stars in.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This has been my favorite musical movie.  Brings me back to my teenage years.  Now I can watch it and even dance to it!!  It is a long film, but well worth the time to watch it.  Enjoy!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|No words can describe in full how tasteful and brilliant this show is.  Mads Mikkelsen plays the part to perfection.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|In the short amount of time since downloading You-Tube on my kindle fire, I have already enjoyed the many entertaining videos it has to offer. There is so much variety and a world of information at my fingertips. It ceases to amaze me how I never tire of the funny, serious, and even heartfelt clips I view on my You-Tube app. Thank you You-Tube for the great entertainment and knowledge you have to offer!<br />  Penny Morford
B00992CF6W|5.0|love this game so much when I play it on my computer I pull the computer close to me and I feel like I'm steve
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|its super cool and super awsome and its already 3d movie  i like lot  the hobbit movie awsome n cool!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I have read this novel several times.  The author has explored all details of the story to make it seem like reality.
B00B4804KS|5.0|its awsome and scare super and super cool and super awsome and scarey in 3d movie i like it mush!
B00821OX98|5.0|When this came out I wasn't intrested. All it took was a  boring after noon , my kindle and I got hooked. The story line is believeable. The acting is well done.<br />There is sadness and triumph. Growing knowledge of the enemy leads to more clues of why the aliens came.and and lets us know we are not alone.The history professor , Noah Wyle, gives that touch of humanity even though he can shoot'em up with the best of them. But most of all you get a feeling of hope.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved the two other books but this book was fluff and then we have purchase two more books. Sylvia I expected better. I feel like we are being taken advantage of. You could have taken out some of the sex and the I constant I love you and provided us with answers. I hated that the father and mother slept together, Gideon lost some of his edge, and the reporter was a waste of time. what was up with all the attention paid to Megumi. Ugh getting annoyed writing the review.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The genius of Lincoln has never been more fully realized, without the usual sentimentality--and the dangers of vilifying compromise are on display.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I like it. Good graphics. Easy to understand and play. It isn't Aion or WoW but it is pretty good for what it is.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|Salo terrifies me. It is too real a film to engage in suspension of disbelief, because disbelief is here not a result of fantasy, but of tangibility. As a film, it should be set against Pasolini's Trilogy of Life. It works best as the conclusion to these, however disappointing that may be. Like the Greek cycles-- three tragedies followed by a comedy-- but inverted, Pasolini's best works amplify and mystify whatever word it is we use to say &#34;people.&#34; As commentary on manipulation and exploitation, whatever exploitation Pasolini may be accused of gets fogged, and the art, ontologically, does not represent, but IS us in our being-there. It is a hard film because it is an honest film, the best &#34;horrible&#34; there is because there is still beauty in it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Much easier to see than on phone header. Glad to see this useful app advertised on book blast! Will tell my friends.
B00992CF6W|5.0|who can find the end portel because I can't seem to find it I have searched the whole place and can't find it<br />.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The only bad thing about it is that I have to wait a week or more for the update after it comes out. My brother plays on an iPad and he got the update the day after it came out. Don't try to call customer service about because they are useless and give excuse after excuse. I hope someone from Amazon reads this and makes it quicker to get the update.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Perfect quality! Nice cover. Perfect packaging. I loved the movie! Excellent ending! I'm ready for the last two Breaking Dawn!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just truly amazing! This book grabs u the moment u start reading it! I couldn't put it down neither will u
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I can't get enough of this series! I finished Season 2 in a week. Definitely try this out, it will captivate you.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So glad I could download to kindle and not have to go looking for my books. This book was great very interesting. Trust me you read the first one you have to get the other two.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This is the most extraordinary movie about what happend to the jewish I've ever seen. very interesting and impressive excellent presentation of the genocide.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander did an excellent job of describing what happened to him.  It was an ethereal  experience that I was so enthralled by his explanation of reaching the after-life.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I saw the  movie first and loved it.  Watched it twice in the same weekend.  But I really wanted to read the book.  I highly recommend the movie.  The book was slow and really quite depressing.  You still love Charlie but the movie gave Sam and Patrick so much more personality.  I think the book gave more focus to Bob than to Sam and Patrick.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun my cousin showed it to me before Christmas 2012. When I first played I knew I would be addictive and I am now. I would really recommend this game it's so much fun.I love how it's a world tour. I hope you get to experience the fun I do with subway surfers
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|This season was brilliant and creative with amazing acting, plot development and had wonderful actors. This is one of our favorite television shows.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Wish they could stream faster, I hate having to wait for the next season.<br />This, like a lot of British shows, is fantastic and I love every episode.<br />Keep bringing it back.
B009EE1GC4|4.0|I would love to be a resident of the marigold hotel.  Very true to life abt. family and senior relationships.
B001NZEHMS|5.0|Still their best album. Cant go wrong with this one. Should be considered a classic. Such a diverse collection of sounds.  Before their time.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I found Lark Rise to Candleford Season 1 quite enjoyable. There is a bit of history involved as well as the political struggles of the time. At times I wondered if the author included some &#34;current&#34; situations for interest instead of sticking with the actual time period events. The character building was well done.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Like it ,somewhat challenging wouldn't recommend for anyone under 10 or 11. Should be able to get hints without having to be charged but just my opinion.....
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Another well written novel by Michael Connelly. It grabs you and holds you to the end. Great character in Harry Bosch. Well worth the time and money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers a lot because you get to go on train's And pick your own character's cool guys like tagbot and ninga
B0014VQGX4|5.0|My neice says he plays with it all the time.  A life saver as we are so far away, and don't get to see him.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Baldacci has moved through several character and heroes as he has matured as a writer.  Each time he switched gears I expect a let down.  However, it hasn't happened yet.  He has a wonderful imagination and each new iteration is as exciting as the last.  The twists and turns in this book were easy to follow and particularly unpredictable.  I look forward to his next novel whether it features Will Robie or not.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I LOVE THE IDEA OF KNOWING  visually that I am getting best results from battery.ITS SIMPLE TO INSTALL..super tool, New user.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|I am a big fan of Michael Connelly, and I expected more from this book.  It appears he had a mortgage payment due, so he threw three short story together and got them published.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|one of the top best shows ever be sure to start with season one and go up you will get hooked
B000I3UAJ0|5.0|Out of all the Star Trek movies featuring the TOS actors, this one certainly isn't the worst.  Not the best one either, but I like this movie for it's TOS feel and the directing and visuals of that time period are appealing to me. Nostalgia I'm sure, but I like it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|A very action packed game with great grafics and great gameplay. Playing as iron man was a very exhilarating experience.
B000S58428|5.0|Although I have really enjoyed their last two albums, &#34;A Rush of Blood ...&#34; is where Coldplay hit their musical peak in their most cohesive album.  At this point, coldplay sounded like they could approach the pantheon of arena bands like U2 and radiohead.  And while they never quite reached those heights (in my opinion), the comparison was justified here.  Songs like &#34;The Scientist&#34; and &#34;Warning Sign&#34; perfectly express heartbreak without tipping into the sappy territory (i.e. &#34;Fix You&#34;) that they will muddle into later on.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|i love the crossfire novels. the love affair between gideon and eva makes my heart melt. we should all be so lucky to know this kind of love
B00BP3DPJY|4.0|Don't have any history with Phosphorescent, but loved this album.  Great balance of both electronic and alternative rock sounds.  The songs don't sound like anything I've heard before, but were instantly catchy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the update on my phone but I want it on my kindle fire when is the update this game is so fun but there is a lot more in the update please when?!?!?
B009ERK1T0|5.0|This album is absolutely worth every penny. I started listening to Deftones here and there but never really got much into them until I heard this album. Now going back listening to other Deftones music I enjoy almost all of their songs. I guess it's because I listen to this CD so much that they have grew on me and now are one of my favorite bands. Get this CD and you will love, if not like, every track.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|If you like epics with multiple styorylines that take forever to come to conclusions than this is for you. I am a bit too impatient for this genre.

0375851569|4.0|I don't love all the Dr. Seuss books, but it's the only thing my husband will read to our daughter.  We like the individual books, so we can juggle them and her at the same time.  Nice hard covers.  Just as you'd expect...
B002BPRZU0|5.0|Excellent blues! The more I listen the better I like it! Bonamassa just gets better and better! Incredible musicians that play with him also. Deluxe is the word!
B000HZD168|5.0|I watched TWK again before I went out and watched Into Darkness.  Ricardo Montalban bring such subtle intensity to the role, it's hard not to root for him!  I love this film, it stands out as my favorite Star Trek film of all time, and probably always will.
B009Y6X65C|5.0|Joe keeps cranking out the great blues. Incredible musician and song writer. Great blues. Not a bad song on the album.
B004KPHQR6|4.0|Watched with my wife.  There were cliches, but the film was well done and for the most part well acted.  My wife thinks Nancy Allen could have done a better job.

B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Typical Lady A, loved it! Teased us on the radio with Downtown and finally it was available! Wish they would produce another real fast!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Elementary is like an updated version of Monk, which ironically always reminded me of Sherlock. I love everything about Elementary...the well thought out crimes, the humor, Sherlock's eccentricities, all of it. I didn't miss even one episode all season. Jonny Lee Miller just rocks and Lucy Liu is the perfect new Watson.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|I think that the book was a nice book and downloaded some of the other books are all of them because I'm not sure.I have always liked your books and I read dog days in my second grade class and it took me a long time but I still loved it and I will read on my kindle in a few days or so.A lot of people read the book dog days in my second grade class and some of them or one of them read it a bunch of times!

B005IQZB14|4.0|I enjoyed every page. I laughed and cried, was awed and amazed by her life and trip on the pct.  it made me even consider taking a trip like this of my own
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I cannot believe how bad this book is. There was nothing resolved from the previous book, and now there are even more unanswered questions that the reader is left hanging with. The author barely touched on anything that we have all been waiting to hear about. Why didn't we get any interaction between Eva and Mrs. Vidal until the last chapter? Why haven't you told us anything more about the case with Nathan besides just teasing us with more unanswered questions and twists with the Russian Mafia? Seriously? You bring up the Russian Mafia and then barely talk about it for the remainder of the book? What happened with Dr. Lucas? We get some kinda sorta reference to him in the LAST chapter. What's this mystery with Megumi? Why don't you tell us why she's important to this story? And what the hell kind of wedding was that? Isn't this supposed to be an epic once in a lifetime love? Where was the proposal? That's just the tip of the iceberg. There is so much wrong with this book. I am very disappointed with this. The book is too short and seems unfinished. yes I understand there's another book int he series but this book still should've had a stronger storyline and some kind of ending.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My family loves this game!! The only problem is we can't update on our kindle. It has updated on our other electronics. Please please update on the kindle!!!
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|It is a classic!<br />I have never read a book from an animal's point of view, so well described that it is most believable.
B004UXUUJE|5.0|This is an incredibly engaging story and the presence of  Kristin Scott Thomas who is always a pleasure to watch.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Specific,detailed, very helpful for a newcomer in this field. The screen shots made it easy to follow the text. Thanks.
B000FBJF7I|5.0|A great sequel to the no.1 ladies detective agency. I laughed and enjoyed this book immensely. I highly recommend it for a great fiction.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Hands down one of the best movies I've ever seen. The cinematography was gorgeous, the story was fantastic and the acting was great. The movie could be hard to watch at times; I remember thinking I wanted to turn it off but I needed to know what happened. The movie really pulls you in - its a great adventure a must see movie!!! I can't imagine anyone would be disappointed with this great movie!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I loved this musical in the theater and am enjoying it on Amazon Unbox as well.  My husband doesn't get into musicals but I am enjoying watching it.again.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game is ok. Difficult to win prizes that gain you extra tokens. If you play daily, you use tokens quickly.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Um where to start?? Well as much as my fingers itched to read this book, they were not in a hurry to turn the page. It seemed like most of the book was about Eva and Gideon getting back on track which is good but it seemed they were beating around the bush. They both kept stuff from each other. Gideon being the control freak that he is was always saying sorry. Don't get me wrong I liked it and will be reading the next book.<br /><br />I also have to say Cary I love you but keep your ish in your pants brother LOL!! OMG it can't be his no way, but then again maybe it can be. I am praying it isn't. I like Trey better than Tahitian!! Dear lord have mercy on Cary if it is his......<br /><br />When will Corrine be out the picture? don't she get that Gideon wants Eva and only Eva? I mean your heart broken but your married get the hell over him geesh!!<br /><br />That being said I don't want to give to much away but I do have to say HOW YOU GONNA END THE BOOK THE WAY YOU DID???? I yelled that out and my husband was like what the hell are you talking about LOL!!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This was the first believable &#34;movie-monster&#34; I ever saw.  Both the monster and the plot must have been exceedingly scary back in the 50's.  I will purchase this one for my &#34;Century&#34; collection.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|This was not a bad movie, however I am extremely great full I rented this and not payed 12 bucks to see this at the movies. Buy the time things started to get some what good the movie was over, their was not a hole lot to this movie just a lot of action and killing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book! This is the first book that has ever made me cry, and I must say that it has left a mark on me.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|awesome ,love the story and the characters , sexual overones restrict young viewers....but works into the story and isnt graphic.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I think this game is very fun definitely for a free game. I think it's enjoyable. I JUST got it so I'm not completely sure about it yet, but my brother got it for his kindle and I thought it looked like fun so I got it too.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I enjoyed this as much as the other two before it.  Can't wait to read Number 4 and find out which son remains or will we?
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I'm not gonna say it was a horrible book but damn, for 3 books at 10 bucks a pop.....in isn't that good. Screw the conclusion, I'll be damned if I spend another 10 bucks.  I've read better books for free.  Miss Day, this book had great sex with a lot of fluff.  You could've stopped it here.  You should feel dirty for taking advantage of your readers and fans.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I love Serenity because it is the only show that demonstrates what uncontrolled government is.. dominating, tyrannical, controlling and dangerous.  I love it that 'serenity' is a ship of freedom that stands against government control.  Probably why the show was cancelled because it has a huge following to this day.
B0063IH60K|5.0|So awesome!!!!!!! This is a very very very good app. You should DEFINITELY get it. You won't regret it. It is fun!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it because it has easy access at church, even without wi-fi.<br />I love it because I love the Word of God.<br />I love it because it has so many versions to read.<br />Yes, I would recommend it to anyone.<br />And, I especially love it because it was free.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|To me, no book will come close to the Kite Runner.  It has to be difficult to write when your first book was so spectacular.  &#34; And The Mountains Echoes&#34; is a good book, it touches on family, friends and relationships at a time and place we are not familiar with.  I enjoyed it, with one exception.  It jumped around a lot.  It went from mid 1900s to today with little or no warning.  there were times I had to turn back a page or two to see if I missed something before I caught on to the jumping around..
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|One of the best games out there. Very well made and worth every penny. Keeps me busy during my bathrooms breaks.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I anxiously awaited the release of this new book by Hosseini.  I thought his other 2 books were excellent, and I was sure this was going to be another very wonderful book, full of intrigue and culture and thoroughly interesting.  I was very disappointed.  It's almost like there were too many stories interwoven into each other.  I thought the end would really tie things together, but it was a big letdown - it was also boring, and I found myself browsing the pages and flipping through them quickly, rather than reading with interest.<br /><br />If you want to read this book, wait and get it used.  It is not worth the price.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|My wife loved this Mothers Day gift the type of songs she loves by a great artist I scored many points
B0026QC0TA|4.0|Readers of John Grisham's book will find this film rather less of a thriller and more of a courtroom drama, albeit with a curious flat feel to it. The story is that of a legal action on behalf of a teenage boy denied coverage for an expensive bone marrow transplant by his family's medical insurer. Changes to the plotline to accommodate the story to the demands of film drama have removed the unique feature of the book – a largely successful attempt to make the details of legal civil procedure interesting. Francis Coppola is a very innovative yet conventional director (you could credit him with authorship of several current movie clichés) and his storylines develop according to convention. Thus the love affair, which is completely extraneous to the main storyline in the book, is pumped up, and the fascinating battle of wits between the lawyers played down. As in the book, Rudy is the tyro David up against the experienced Goliath, Drummond, but Rudy's inexperience is played up to the point that you wonder how he got this far. The trial judge, who in the book is extremely helpful to Rudy, is replaced in the film by a sympathetic but much more impartial figure. In Hollywood conventional courtroom drama, His Honor or Her Honor doesn't take sides.<br /><br />That said, there is much to enjoy. Danny de Vito, playing Deck the paralegal (or `paralawyer' as Rudy names him) who can't seem to pass the bar exam, is just brilliant. His Deck is a disheveled, unimpressive little guy who is nonetheless good at what he does, `rainmaking' or finding new business. His strengths are his intelligence, his energy and his lack of pride; he is quite happy to chase ambulances and give cops backhanders for information. His ethics are simple: fight for your client, don't steal and try not to lie. While the Deck of the book verges on the grotesque, De Vito makes him less of an oddball and hence more sympathetic. Matt Damon as Rudy is wetter behind the ears and not such a quick learner as theRudy of the book, but every so often he connects and we understand how he feels. Mickey Rourke is a bit too elegant as Bruiser, Rudy's erstwhile mentor, (who wears cufflinks on a tropical beach?) but it's also an enjoyable performance. Although the script tones down his role, John Voight is nastily urbane as superlawyer Drummond.<br /><br />Once again we have a courtroom drama filmed in a grand but gloomy courtroom, in fact the lighting people seem to have been absent. We hardly get a glimpse of the face of one important minor character, Cliff the wife-beater, (Andrew Shue) yet there is no apparent reason for this. The way some of the scenes were strung together, and started and finished were vaguely familiar, and half way through it hit me - ` The Godfather', where scenes just seem to begin and end without any particular reason.<br /><br />One thing the film does almost as well as the book is send the message (sorry Mr Goldwyn) that America needs to do something about its medical insurance system, if the present chaotic mess can be so described. The court system, while not perfect, comes out of it a bit better (David is able to beat Goliath fair and square) but as for lawyers…well, let's just say things would be a lot better if they stuck to Deck's minimal ethics. The story also might explain why John Grisham (who has a walk-on role as a lawyer at an al fresco deposition) gave up the law to write books, thus bringing pleasure to millions instead of (hopefully) winning retribution for a few.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I had been waiting for this book since February and now that I have read I'm upset. The book is so not finished and I'm beyond disappointed at this is how it ends. Until I found out it was quintet series too excited.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I do like Patterson, Sanford, Cussler, etc but this just happened along and it is a downright pleasure. it is written well and has a neat patina to it not common to this genre. very very well written and a pleasure to read.
0765348780|5.0|Guys, you got to keep in mind that is only the begining of a 10 books series. What happened next is more than words can describe. This is a good read, but only with the second book do you really begin to understand how much of a genius erikson really is.<br /><br />Never have i read something so amazing and epic, and yes, i have read song of ice and fire as well.<br /><br />Just give it a try. For me this book was the beginning of the greatest craziest adventure of my life as a book reader.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B000SZH8LQ|3.0|I can't sing or play any musical instruments. So anyone who can, especially as well as Corinne Baily Rae, has my admiration. Love listening to her sing!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This story is funny, sad, uplifting, and entertaining. The characters are real, multi-faceted, and believable. I'd recommend this to anyone who reads fiction.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun but you have to download alot and it gets really annoying but overall it's a really cool game and its hard to get 95000 coins to me because I don't have the coin double so if it was me I would get it I think it's only 99cents<br />  Miss Howard h.a.g.s.  love the game
1595141979|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />The Strigoi attacks aren't the only thing complicating roses life, she also has to deal with the impeding trial of victor. As her feeling for Dimitri simmer on the surface rose has to learn how to cope with taking care of a guardian she can't feel, none other than Christian himself.<br /><br />I liked this book even more than the last two. The relationships of the characters come together more and I loved all of the arguments. I was sad about mason but was surprised about how that turned out. As for rose and Dimitri, I just love them together and this book certainly did a good job of showing how much tension they had between them resulting from their feelings. I have to say I was completely thrown by the ending though and I can't wait to get started on the fourth book!
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Predictable, acting was so so. It was entertaining though. Cute story line. A good flick for pregnant women to watch.
1416914285|2.0|2.5 stars<br /><br />In the first book of the Mortal Instrument series Clary is astounded to find she can see things other people can't. With the help of Jace and the rest of the Shadow hunters Clary has to discover her past to protect everyone's future.<br /><br />From first reading the Internal Devices prequel series I really expected more from this one. It might be that the Victorian era was more sophisticated than the modern era but I found the writing style in City of Bones to be immature and weak. I was completely surprised by the characters that I found lacking in well-roundedness and knowledge, unlike I found from Internal Devices. I will strive to continue on with the series just to see what happens and I am interested in watching the movie but I was seriously expecting a lot more out of this series that what I am getting.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|i bought this cd because my granddaughter love justin and then after i played it in the car i loved it too!
1416914293|2.0|The second installment of the Mortal Instrument series continues on with the journey of Clary. Now that her mom is in a coma, Simon is a rat, and Valentine is on the loose everything is one step away from horrible.<br /><br />Everything is quite expected, there were no twists and turns in the plot whatsoever. Just as in the first book I found the writing to be exceedingly immature and hard to get through. In this installment the overabundant use of stereotypes really got to me for some reason. If I don't like the characters I just can't like the book.
0810994739|5.0|I bought this book for my granddaughter,whos 9 and she loves it,now my grandson is starting to read it! Thanks
0062059963|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />As America's journey continues in the selection not becoming one of the elite the competition gets harder. She starts to doubt herself and the people are her but striving past that is something a queen needs to be able to do and America will finally decide if she wants to do just that.<br /><br />This book was just as great as the first one. I did have a very hard time liking Maxon throughout it but I saw reason in the end. I loved America's spirit but I do have to say that some of her decisions happened to be pretty rash, although I can't honestly say I wouldn't have done the same things given her situation. Loved the ending and can't wait for it to continue!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I am giving this book 2.5 stars. The writing was pure garbage but the relationship between Ana and Christian was very good. I know that is a contradiction, and I really cannot articulate what I mean.  It took four attempts to finally finish this book and I am so glad I did.<br /><br />The vocabulary was terrible and she used the word HOLY way more than a person who was not praying should have been allowed to. Some of the scenes were totally unbelievable and inconsistent. Like when she was describing a sex scene where she could feel the warmth of his seed spilling into her. Ummmmm.....how? He was wearing a condom. Did it have a hole in it? That was just one of many.<br /><br />She talks about her \\"inner goddess\\" like she really means her \\"inner ho\\" or \\"inner<br />vixen,\\" but seeing as though she was a virgin, had only been missed twice, and had done absolutely nothing, how could she have possibly had an \\"inner anything?\\"<br /><br />Suffice it to say that I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It seems as though I am the only one within my circle of girlfriends who feel this way because they all loved it.  Now I am faced with trying to decide whether or not I am going to read the second book because of how this one ended. Sigh...
B00BN3ECTS|3.0|I've read all of Nicholas Sparks books and seen all his movies. Message in a Bottle has been my favorite for years. This was okay..it was a better book than movie. Julianne Hough was good.
B00C7JFIRC|4.0|I know people are complaining but in reality if you have a 3d tv why would you want the 2d version of the movie if the whole purpose of 3d is to watch movies in 3d and if you don't have 3d then get the 2d version and I'm not 100% sure but I think you could still play 3d movie on a 2d tv or player you just won't get the 3d effect. I'm getting the  blu ray and digital copy one because I don't have 3d and I don't care much for the DVD.

B002NXOQF2|5.0|It was an amaziing read. Did not realize that it was about a group of rabbits. Once you begin reading it, you become engrossed In the story. The story is very difficult to put down once you start reading it. Once I started it, I had a hard time putting it down and would highly recommend it to anyone of any age who hasn't read it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|But this game is very well thought out and addicting. You got practically every \\"character\\" from the original Star Wars in this game.<br /><br />sure I am barely at the Death Star and ran out of battery power but its still fun. Han Solo shoots, Luke uses his lightsaber, 3Po explodes. Its fun. You get to fly thru space, and you have gravity wells. Wow.<br /><br />I know there are tons of reviews on this game but I just had to have my say. Definitely worth 3 bucks. Even bought the Xbox Version of the original game.<br /><br />The people that are saying you have to purchase more are playing the wrong app or not reading it correctly. I am up to level 50 now and have not had to pay any more than 3.00 for this app. NOWHERE did it tell me I had to pay extra.<br /><br />SURE you can buy ADDONS for this game just like any console game out there as well as you can buy unlocks to help you \\"cheat\\" but this game should not cost you extra.<br /><br />give you an example. If you want the BOBA FETT missions you have tow choices you can find the 5 rocket packs hidden in the game and get them for free or you can purchase an unlock code to get them faster.<br /><br />OR you can buy some power ups instead of having to actually work for them.<br /><br />SURE when I could not beat a level it showed my a shopping cart to advance to the next level, but I didnt buy it. I just replayed the level again til I won.<br /><br />And no offense its only 3 buck. you normally pay SIXTY dollars for a video game.

B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Way better than Revolution!!! Good story line that keeps you on the edge of your seat with characters that you end up caring about.
0425263924|2.0|This is my first review, even though I have read thousands of books. I always appreciate the reviews since they help guide me on whether to purchase a book or not. I was really excited for this book. I am frustrated with the author. I agree with many other people who reviewed this book poorly because I feel like the author stretched a good story so thin that she ruined it. This volume in the series spends a large portion of the time developing other characters that we truly don't care about.<br /><br />Eva is turning out to be one of the least likable protagonists I have ever read about. She had potential to be strong and for her character to grow. I don't like that Eva is apparently not capable of being loyal...the whole thing with her sexual attraction to Brett and his voice...just makes Eva less respectable. As the story progressed, I started to see the parallel between Eva and her mother...Eva is just like her mother! If that is what the author was going for, well done. Like mother, like daughter. Eva is so annoying and honestly, boring. Gideon is what keeps the book even somewhat interesting. Gideon's character is much more likeable, and at this point I am rooting for some other girl to come along and steal him away from Eva. I'd like to see Eva as crushed as she carries on about inside her inner dialogue. Maybe I am just frustrated that the author clearly decided this was a money making series and took the plot to places that stole the opportunity for this series to be an amazing Trilogy.<br /><br />I am sure if you are a fan, you will read the book regardless of bad reviews. I did too. I am not going to be reading book four or five though. Sylvia Day lost a fan.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I fell in love with this game immediately.  It makes me concentrate and move quickly.  I love being able to rotate the cube in any way that I want to.  The cubes get smaller on each level, too - another challenge for senior eyes!

B0051E9JNE|5.0|Good movie - very much enjoyed the story and acting... interesting premise for characters to float into the future - not sure what drove the &#34;Gathering&#34; so that did leave a question but maybe I missed the early setup.... overall, fun to watch.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I purchased this to complete my die hard collection but was disappointed.  It comes with some good action scenes as always but part 4 was much better than this one.  In short=not worth the money to buy it.

B00006G8HX|5.0|If you are a Star Trek buff this is must own along with the rest of the movies to this series.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|this is an old show but one that is fun.  I especially love the music and ellen greene has a terrific voice.  the story is off beat but clever and the color of this dvd is so clear and adds to the plant.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is a great set to own.  Gives you all eight of the Harry Potter movies in one case.  Nice and compact.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I haven't purchased a CD in years, but I love CDs; the physical aspect, the little booklet that comes in the front sleeve, the fact that you don't lose it if your computer crashes. Soon after I first heard Macklemore I knew I needed to buy the album.<br /><br />I'm not sure what exactly it is that makes me appreciate Macklemore as an artist so much. I fell in love with Thrift Shop the first time I heard it on the radio, it was different; catchy, clever, and a bit funny. Several of Macklemore's songs can be described this way, but most have a more somber undertone.<br /><br />He's got something to say. His message is relevant, interesting, relatable. He's amazing and deserves all the respect he's got and then some. Macklemore & Ryan Lewis doing this as an independent duo says it all. The almost flawless rating on amazon says even more.<br /><br />Macklemore is on fire. He's here to stay and I can't wait for the follow up.

B00ATP24NW|5.0|This is a hard CD to find in stores, and it was a requested Birthday Gift. It was exactly what she expected  and even though you can download to IPOD This CD was requested for Car use, So I was happy to find this  for my daughter!
B000083C49|5.0|If you are a Star Trek buff this is a must have along with the rest of the movies to this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is neat application.  My Kids and I enjoy the challenging courses and changing scenery.  It would be interesting to have access to buy the extra powers and earn more characters.
B0000AUHOH|5.0|If you are a Star Trek buff this is a must own along with the rest of the movies in this series.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Downloaded the series. Started watching with episode 1 and watched 2-3 episodes a night.  Acting is fantastic and story lines are realistic.  I am hooked!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the audio portion of the NLT.  The narrator is excellent and articulate.  It is a very inspiring way to experience God's Word.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Had to hear/see Hugh Jackman again - boy did they cheat him out of an Oscar!!  Movie is great - it overcame hatred of the book from studying it in high school!!

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I can not find adequate words to describe my feelings<br />about this story of those who gave their lives for us &<br />for Marcus who survived.<br /><br />Read this book - maybe more than once - & don't ever<br />forget these brave men or their story - we owe them<br />so much.<br /><br />I have purchased this book three times - hardcover<br />that got lost among the many borrowers; the paperback<br />that I gave away & then regretted that I had; and, now a<br />permanent copy for me - its on my Kindle!  I will re-read<br />this story again because it not only breaks my heart,<br />it gives me inspiration and makes me proud that I live<br />in a country that produces such wonderful men as those<br />described in this story.<br /><br />Thank you Marcus for sharing your story - it could not have<br />been easy to recall those terrifying moments & the days after.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|I WISH WE HAD MORE AMERICANS WHO WOULD GO OUT ON SUCH A LIMB AND BE SO PERSISTENT IN GETTING SUCH THINGS DONE.  (I KNOW THERE ARE SOME BUT I DO NOT HEAR ABOUT THEM AS I HAVE ROSS PEROT).  I WAS A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN HE WAS A FRESHMAN IN THE JUNIOR COLLEGE ON THE SAME CAMPUS IN TEXARKANA, TEXAS, AND I AM VERY PROUD OF HIM AND SO MANY OF THE THINGS HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED.  THIS BOOK WAS ALL THE MORE EXCITING BECAUSE OF BEING ABOUT REAL PEOPLE -- TRUE AMERICANS.  IT IS IN MY KINDLE, BUT NOW I WISH I HAD ORDERED THE HARD-BACK BECAUSE IT'S A KEEPER.  JEAN SHIPP ABERNATHY
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|It is a gift for my daughter and she is very happy with this Monster High story. Very interesting and funny.
0762439009|3.0|You will love this movie, and I can highly recommend it. Worth having. A true fan should not pass up the opportunity to have a product so. Product fully recommended.
B000067QMD|5.0|These discs are great for using Avent bottles to store breastmilk (which I loved) but also great for sealing off bottles while on the go (Breast milk, water, formula, juice any liquid)
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved the climax, but ended to soon!!! Needed more of the story. Hope next book doesn't take 9 months to get.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen this year. Would love to watch it again and again! Great performance by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawerence.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Got to know many new things, inventors of 20th century and as well the corporate dictatorship. He is truly genious.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Me and my kids love this game. Wehave so much fun playing it. It is coolto build and watch the game pretty much play itself.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very interesting. Hard to put down. Was expecting less but got more. A second book would be great. I highly recommend it
B00COGXX7A|2.0|Because \\"The Notebook\\" was such a great movie, I keep trying every new Nicholas Sparks adaptation...but I continue to be disappointed. This movie had subplots with no development and the main story line was fairly unbelievable. The acting wasn't too bad but the chemistry between Josh Duhamel and Julianne Hough was more of a brother/sister one...which made the love scenes unbelievable and creepy. The best parts of the movie were any scenes with little Mimi Kirkland- what a great little actress. Overall- the okay acting and beautiful scenery could not make up for the weak plot.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|This rockumentary was a cool and in-depth history of Sound City, Dave Grohl is the man! Also, a lot of great bands are featured.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I felt it was more a documentary and wasn't prepared for it.  Day-Lewis gave a great portrayal of Lincoln, the man and I enjoyed his interpretation.  The movie was very informative, but a little too factual.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|While I don't agree with overwhelming \\"one-star\\" rates that the book has gotten, I am thankful for them.  I'm a huge Gideon fan!  More of a Gideon fan than a Christian fan, and if I hadn't seen how disappointed people were with the ending of the book, I think I would have been disappointed, too. But having read so many people disappointed with the ending, I was pleasantly surprised with this book.  Yes, it was over before I would have liked (i think I finished it in less than 5 hours), but it is still a great book, and I can't wait for the other two.  I was sad to think this was the final installment of the Crossfire series, but I' m sad all over again now knowing that there are *only* two more to go.<br /><br />Everything that I hated about the distance between Gideon and Eva was made up for in this book.  I also loved that we got to see Eva developing other relationships with girlfriends.  Given all the rumors about the books being optioned for a series, I think these new insights will be perfect (and necessary) to make this into a great series!  The little stories developing about the supporting characters (Cary/Trey/Tatiana, Mark & Steve, Megumi, Eva's parents, the Girouxs, Ireland & the rest of the Vidals, and even to some extent Brett), are a nice break from the intensity that is Eva and Gideon.  Don't get me wrong... I love their chemistry and passion, but after awhile, their intimate moments can start to blur together and become monotonous.  The other stories don't detract from Eva and Gideon! There is still plenty to their story!! PLENTY! And its just a hot as ever.<br /><br />I can't wait to see where their journey leads, and I'm sure the wait is going to be torturous!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I enjoy this.  Something I love is the scraps between the good wife and her not-so-good mother-in-law!  Really good interaction.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Don't play games much and have not had a chance to play this one at all..  Should be fun when I can find the time.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This product was very helpfull at tellong me how i utilize my kindle fire hd battery. I can compleaty recommend this product. Its a must have for every kindle owner.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I can only reiterate the general consensus. This is not what I wanted. This is not what I had imagined the entire time I have been reading these books. I am just perplexed as to how C. H. could have written these characters in such a way as to make you love them and then turn around and change them into someone else entirely. If sam was meant to be the great love of sookies life then why do I think he is such a milktoast weakling? I honestly felt rather repelled by the thought of him with sookie like she was committing some sort of incest. The way she built up the love affair with Eric was artful and intricate, spanning books.  So by the time they were actually together one felt as though you were experiencing a victory.  His shadowy side did not diminish his character but only seemed to illustrate the good points better. He seemed more human and three dimensional for his faults, growing and maturing with them. To give such life to a character without purpose is mind bogling to me. Yet there it is - all that time, years and books and adventures and she killed him with less aplomb then a pac man game. I say killed because the life was sucked out of the character just as violently and suddenly as any death in the book. Then to just throw sam into a role he has never had and it is unimaginable he should have. I read the book and it is still unimaginable.Eric got years and multiple novels and sam was thrust upon us at the last twenty pages. It felt less a revelation then a smarmy one night stand. The only thing that would make any of this reasonable is if charlaine harris had an accident and the publishers covered it up and got some idiot ghost writer who had never read the series beyond the jackets to write the last three novels. Other then that I just don't see how the books could have done such an unexplained, pointless 360 with only the weak explanation that the cluvial dor made them into different people. That is putting it mildly. I love a good series and I am mournful of the way this one was not ended so much as murdered. Everything that made the characters who they were seemed to have changed. I honestly wish I would have stopped several books ago.
B000V658EQ|4.0|This song takes me back down memory lane. Thinking about how the grown ups  enjoyed this song, and even though I didn't understand it I enjoyed it also.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|good game to pass your time.  it is also a good game for children to pass the time in a car or appointment.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I was so happy to be able to see it immediately. I am a trekkie from way back, actually like TNG best, but the casting was great. I loved all of it! the music kept right on track with the original, fantastic  special effects.
B005OYKHSM|3.0|This movie was okay but most of it was unreal and would put it in the category as a &#34;man&#34; movie.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|In This Moment is a great example of femetal, not as heavy as Arch Enemy or The Agonist but they fill their niche nicely.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I expected more for the final book in this series. The author resorted to a pale imitation of the creativity shown in the first book.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I like the book and the adventurousness and motivation level of the main character which indeed is necessary to self -actulize one's goals and objectives. It was an interesting reading
B009NY43NY|4.0|Liked this book, but sad series is over. Not surprised how it all ended but feel like it could have kept goings a few more books : )
B003IEJZUG|5.0|It was indeed a very interesting book full of adventurous episodes . The writers imagination though some times was far fetched and unrealistic. it was a good reading I liked it
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Really easy and enjoyable book. Have recommended it to several people and quoted it often. Great book for encouraging women.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft Pocket Edition, and I have it for Kindle and iPod, but I would like to know when the update if coming. It is already out for iPod. Thank You!
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|A good read, typical late Le Carré.  And that's also the problem.  His later books just don't have the sheer magic of Smiley, Drummer Girl or Night Manager.  This one was initially all over the place, then when it settled down there just wasn't enough time left to give the characters much depth, and on several occasions I felt I was reading about the ghosts of earlier people.<br />And yet, I will definitely read his next, and am looking forward to it. He still has an inimitable style and his dialogues are superb.  He did say that this book needed to be written for the next one to make sense, and I'm intrigued.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|After waiting for months I couldn't wait to dig in and find out how it all ends!! After all, it was a trilogy!!! Nope, not now!!! This left me with more questions and seriously too much plot line to digest!  The story is going too far off the original path adding new characters to make it worth the money spent on this book or future books. I loved the start and where things were heading but now it is too far fetched and too much like 50 Shades!! Where I was looking for something similar, I wanted different as well. Now after waiting for this book I feel like it is being drug out past the point of no return.<br /><br />I doubt that it will ever be \\"over\\" and the questions be answered without leaving something necessary being addressed and I really don't want to wait year's to learn a couple months worth of a story line.<br /><br />If Cross is a billionaire and money isn't his motives, then maybe the author should take that advice and find a resolution to the story and then have the reader fall in love again with her stories. Start a new series about all the other characters and their lives?? But finish up with this one first!!
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Even my kids refused to watch this. I watched it our of sheer boredom on my computer and regret it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I think this is the most amazing app ever.  For one reason, if you are charging it kindle and want to know how much time you have before it dies, it tells u.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Is that it ends! I could read Cornwell everyday and never get tired. The story is compeling and hard to put down.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34; and it is great to be able to watch all the episodes WITHOUT commercials!
0312945973|4.0|The book is very well written and exciting, what I've read of it. This was recommended by a friend who loved it - and if I get back to it (I have quite a backlog of books), I probably will love it.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Made me cry a couple of times and I laughed plenty. Kept my interest in spite of a predictable ending.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It really helps knowing how much time before you device dies... X.x  In general its very useful and its a life saver...
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I absolutely loved Season 1 of Smash. The stage numbers were such fun; I thought I was at Broadway again.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Always enjoyed watching movies like this. The setting of the movie could have been a little more modern as magic has been around for centuries.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Wasn't too sure about the series when it started. I waited 5 seasons Before I watched the pilot. I'm hooked! Finished 4 seasons in two weeks!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love it, I use it daily to check what the weather is going to be so I can dress accordinly.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Can't get enough! Love this show! Takes me out of my own reality for awhile! Look forward to more of Jax
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I understand a lot of people think it's not true to the Star Trek story.  It's true entertainment pure and simple and anyone who won't watch it for that purpose is missing out!  Very well done!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|We used to watch the Columbo series when it was on TV, and really loved the character Peter Falk played.  Now we have all of the episodes and can watch them without interruptions from commercials.  They were set in an era without cell phones or computers in everybody's possession, so it's interesting to watch how life was then.  It's also interesting to look at the way people dressed and wore their hair back then--so very retro.
B004SVM7BW|3.0|Have a Kindle Fire for a couple of months now.  Confusing mess, if you ask me.  A friend &#34;installed&#34; this PDF reader and I don't know even if I need it.  It's just another part of what seems to be a mistake, getting a Kindle.
1595828753|5.0|My daughter loves this series. I recommend them and she wants the next one as soon as it becomes available in July.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have the minecraft update on my other devices but on my kindle fire HD it doesn't!! PLEASE GIVE US  UPDATE for kindle
B006Y5H74W|3.0|Season 1 was Fairly good in that It gave us insight into the making of a broadway show. Music wAs good but the performers were outstanding. As long as they were singing it held our interest but the melodrama behind the scenes became tiresome and trite.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The update is out for Apple devices but not Kindle fires<br />But minecraft is still the best game ever I like it
B00992CF6W|3.0|I have the game but when I updated it, it didn't update. Its still .6.1. Amazon won't let me update it a second time
B008JJM88Q|5.0|You won't be able to stop playing this app! The genie was right probably 95% of the time. This app is for any age and gender! Thanks for the fun!
B00992CF6W|4.0|needs an upgrade but otherwise its good<br />the upgrade should have water and spwaners. its already happened on the apple.version of the game. its unfair how the kindle gts the upgrades wayyyy later.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|And the surfing shots are amazing!  Living just north of Mavericks I have never been so it was fun to see the beginning of the phenomenon.  And then there's Gerard Butler. Yum..
B00B4804KS|5.0|I was skeptical about the 3D conversion process. It was flawless. I saw it in the theater during its original release as a younger man. I remember renting it on VHS tape years later. I was surprised at how much of the plot I had forgotten. The special effects were state of the art in 1993 and they still are today. You will feel you are inside of the Park as you view the herds rushing past you. A pleasure to see again and again.
B000FC11A6|5.0|Just finished The Baroque Trilogy, and could not wait to reread Crypto, read some dozen years ago. I had forgotten what a delight that was for me. Now I want to reread the Trilogy! Stephenson 's accomplishment is on a level with O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it but it needs 0.7.0 like Apple and android... please get update out Amazon, please! Mine craft is awesome , needs 0.7.0
B00COMLLX2|5.0|This is a good game. I would recommend it to anyone who likes pinball. I just wish I had the real table in my home and could play it on the real table. Lots of fun.
B006P0FD4W|5.0|This is the best Paranormal Activity yet! More jumps for the buck.  The first two started kinda slow, but this was great.  Can't wait for number 4.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|The only reason I rate it as OKAY is because you hace to use online social pages to play the full game. I'm not a big fan of online social pages. Just a personal preference. So I'm not playing the game.
B003Q6D25K|4.0|This has more surprise scares than the first paranormal activity.  You are regressing from the first--this movie takes place prior to the first.  I like that this is shot with &#34;security cameras&#34;.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|way easier and quicker to use that I had expected.<br />I'll never need to bring paper to a seminar again!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book inevitably changed my life. You see things from this perspective that mentally intrigues you with ease. And as I read this beautifully written masterpiece, an imprint has been made upon my moral and ethical values. I am a 16 year old aspiring writer who now understands what it takes to be a remembered author. You have to not just be able to  write to your readers,you must make them believe. The ungodly intelligent meteors that occurred through out the novel, the life lessons of death and the never ending love. The unbelievable idea of eggs only being discriminated as breakfast foods. This book will forever be my favourite piece of literature. Thank you for changing my life forever.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I totally loved it ! So very well made, and so much great scenery of Jamaica! You felt the very soul of Bob Marley through so much of his music included. And, what great interviews by Bunny Wailer and others. Showing it to all my family, who are from Jamaica.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish there was an update like thereis for ipods on my kindle fire<br />I like this game a lot besides that
B00BB22GQM|4.0|For me, one of the reasons I bought Vampire Weekend in the first place is they remind me of the Talking Heads. Now, I may be the only one who feels that way (maybe the only one here that knows who the Talking Heads are!) There is something about them that's very much like Talking Heads world music side, and also something very much like Paul Simon's \\"Graceland\\". I like world music, and I hear it embedded in Vampire Weekend's music the same.<br /><br />I don't feel the sentiments that other fans feel here. I think \\"Modern Vampires Of The City\\" is not far from their first two works. I don't feel the band has drastically changed their sound. I don't feel they've matured. I don't feel this is a darker album. I don't get any of it.<br /><br />I like \\"Modern Vampires Of The City\\" the same as I like their first two albums. Strong melodies, solid musicianship, well crafted and produced albums. \\"Modern Vampires Of The City\\" is no \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\", no \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", no \\"Achtung, Baby\\", no \\"Automatic For The People\\" and certainly no \\"Graceland\\" or \\"Remain In Light\\". I consider Vampire Weekend to still be a hybrid band trying to find their own voice when it's very hard to be original and fresh.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are the fast ones--\\"Unbelievers\\", \\"Diane Young\\", \\"Finger Back\\" and \\"Worship You\\". In fact, \\"Worship You\\" totally sounds like Talking Heads' \\"Thank You For Sending Me An Angel\\" from their 1978 album \\"More Songs About Buildings And Food\\". Just without the fast paced vocals.<br /><br />I also enjoyed \\"Obvious Bicycle\\", \\"Step\\", \\"Everlasting Arms\\" and \\"Ya Hey\\", which are nearly as strong and infectious as my top four.<br /><br />The other four songs are why I subtract one full star. \\"Don't Lie\\", \\"Hannah Hunt\\", \\"Hudson\\" and \\"Young Lion\\" are not up to par with the rest of the album. They need to stay away from this musical direction in the future. These songs do not really enhance the album, though they do bring a little texture.<br /><br />Still, this isn't enough to bring the album down. I am always trying to be objective when listening to music rather than blindly worshipful or negatively chastising. If an album is five stars I will give it five stars, and if it's terrible, I won't hesitate to give it one star. \\"Modern Vampires Of The City\\" is the same as their previous two albums--four stars. None of them have earned landmark classic status, and none of them have been remarkably weak. They're all very good albums, all worth buying and listening to repeatedly. If you haven't listened to this band, you really should. If you have listened, and you don't know your pop music history, you should now go buy and listen to Paul Simon, Talking Heads/David Byrne, Johnny Clegg/Johnny Clegg & Savuka/Juluka, Peter Gabriel, The Clash, The Cure, Siouxsie & The Banshees, The Creatures, Fleetwood Mac (Fleetwood Mack (1975), Rumours (1977), Tusk (1979)) to name but a few.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Modern Vampires Of The City\\" compares with Vampire Weekend's previous works:<br /><br />2008 Vampire Weekend: Four Stars<br />2010 Contra: Four Stars<br />2013 Modern Vampires Of The City: Four Stars't enough to bring the album down.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is great a fun way to check the weather in season is so helpful Now I can predict days when I would have allergy problems. This App was on the kindle but It was not annoying. No tech issues. It is like watching the weather report. Thanks for a fantastic app!!!!
2035834252|1.0|I chose this edition because I have many Larousse classics, but upon delivery I discovered that this only one volume, most of the book is to aid in reading the text.
B0064BWDRW|3.0|not his best work.<br />He seems to have become tired writing this series. That's ok, but not the best way to end.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was a wonderful surprise.  I read it as one of my book club choices.  The book is compelling non-fiction, and while the central theme is scientific in nature, the real \\"meat\\" of the story is the personal lives of the Lacks family.  In a nutshell, Henrietta Lacks dies of cancer and her cells were used for cancer studies.  These cells took on a life of their own and are the most successful cells in history.  Due to these cells, many scientific breakthroughs were made, as well as millions of dollars for the pharmaceutical industry.  Henrietta was a poor, black woman who died at 30.  Her family lived in poverty and the stories of their tragic lives are told as well.  The book raises moral questions such as \\"how is it that their mother's cells were so important and lucrative, when her children and their children couldn't even afford health insurance?\\"  It is also shocking that so many of us (myself included) knew nothing about her cells or her life, confirming the fact that cells removed from a body are simply considered \\"matter\\".  This is a story that will have you shaking your head at the system while being moved by this human story behind the medicinal breakthroughs.<br />Diana Young #1 Amazon best-selling author www.financialfitnessbooks.com

I love this because I can save up my gold and eventually buy a dragon I want. In past games I played,  u had to pay for ur gold or whatever with actual money,  which I dont want to do. I also like how u can have neighbors without getting on Facebook or Twitter because I don't have Facebook or Twitter.
B0095P33IW|5.0|We so enjoyed watching this with two of our grand kids that spent the night in our RV with us.

B002RXHW6S|3.0|Our 22 month old loves it and it is hard to keep him out of it. Only issue is we are on our third one because of seam separating in the door area where the base joins to the bounce mat. Amazon has replaced every one of them with no issue with over night shipping (5 stars to Amazon).
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I started losing interest in the second book but thought everything that was missing would be concluded in the third book. I was wrong!! The story was repetitive, boring, predictable and a waist of my time and money. At this point, I don't care what happens to the main characters and will NOT be purchasing book 456789 or whatever. I'm done with \\"All my Drama\\"
B00881PTRC|1.0|I purchased Ultimate Hangman for my kids.  It is too difficult for children.  Even I had trouble figuring out the phrases.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|while the story line is a bit querky, the progression and incouragement are great.  the puzzles themselves are addicting.  a great mental exericse.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|I am not very good at air hockey, but even I can sometimes win on easy mode.  For those who are good at air hockey they have 3 levels of play so it can be challenging for anyone.
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|cool design. steering and aiming are different from another game so a little frustrating to control nevertheless a good little game.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is addictive!  The only thing I do not like about it is that you only have 6 restaurants and then have to pay more to be able to use the other 6 restaurants.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This is one the best games I've ever played on my tablet... Only one gripe is the the directional control every now and then don't respond to my command... Often resulting in game fatality. I love this game though...well done.
7885255921|4.0|This is a Chinese bootleg but still the best that you're find in the US. The dvds are in a nice wooden box but the dvds themselves are in a gatefold sleeve.
B007GE2H3G|3.0|It may be fun for children but I found it boring.  The animation was cool but after about 30 minutes I had had enough.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|I found this game boring, I only played it once. The person I was thinking of, was  never guessed. After thirty tries, I stopped and deleted off of my kindle.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It's easy to use and I love it! It also tells u how how time is remaining too.  And to top it of, it gives the temperature!<br /><br />P.s. I'm in sixth grade.
B008QLXSG8|5.0|....and I'm glad I re-read it, viewing it through more mature eyes. Camus was a great thinker and an important force in literature. I found it completely enjoyable. I need to read more of his work.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I can't put this one down! I've been playing it non stop for weeks. It's a lot of fun keeping your base going and expanding your army!
B0018PH3L0|1.0|When I tried to play this DVD , the following came on my screen..\\"this cannot be played in your region\\". After considerable difficulty, I was able to contact your agent by phone. He told me that I should return the DVD to yourselves which I did promptly then I would be forwarded a DVD that would play in my region. But no, all I received was a refund. After all the years I have been a customer of amazon I am very dissapointed by your service. And I am still waiting for a copy (DVD) that actually plays in my region. If I receive a copy I would willingly pay for it.  Peter Houghton. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE forward a copy of Lonesome Dove which I will willingly pay for !!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. It's challenging enough to make it fun but easy enough to make you want to play forever.
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|From start of book you kinda knew what was going to happen. Don't think Bill or Erik were given enough chapter time and sort of forgotten. Sad!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It's challenging enough to make it fun but easy enough to make you want to play forever.
B005QBBCMI|5.0|this has been around for a while and i enjoy seeing it again.  both stars do a heck of a job acting.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Leveling up this game is so much fun! You can earn enough coins just by playing well so there is no reason to spend any money.
B000FA5STS|5.0|This book is very exciting to read. Once you start to read it you will keep going because it keeps your interest up to the maximum.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I like this one! It's a little hard and you have to play a lot to earn enough to level up your character.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was looking forward to reading this, I have to say I was really disappointed! What a loser of a book! I will not preorder the next one. I will wait for reviews and price decrease!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Poop ice and a half years of a half the past few weeks ago I was  JOHlug318 to the past year and a great job of a great eat tree
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really enjoyed the book it just wasn't long enough ....when is the next one coming out!!!! I need answers to all that was left hanging
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Flawless performances -- Jennifer Lawrence, Robert DeNiro at their best.  Bradley Cooper was excellent, too, but was overshadowed by his co-stars.  It's also a fairly credible, light-hearted look at mental illness -- the best since One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Received in Excellent condition and on time, an Excellent film to watch (for some people) from start to finish a 5 out of 5 mega
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Supposedly a true story -- and anything was possible under those horrific circumstances -- but it's really stretches one's credulity.  But it was very well-told, excellent acting, especially by the oldest son and definitely worth watching.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I think the game is really cool it can be for little kids and big people .but I don't like that u have yo use real money. So ya I love the game .
0312370830|3.0|Have not finished this particular book yet but am enjoying it. I shall be finishing this up very soon I think.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was extremely disappointed in this book. Talk about no story and a little too much SEX. I really enjoyed the first two books but this one has no story line and ends abruptly. Definitely unhappy with this book.
B001F63D66|4.0|Emile Hirsch is wonderful here as a John Hughes character. Elisha Cuthbert is breathtaking and delightful. But the picture is stolen by Timothy Olyphant of Justified, who is quite hysterical.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|Great to be able to get whatever I want when I want it ---SO much to choose from! I'll find it useful when I teach.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I thought this was great because it tells me exact time of how long my battery will last. Now I don't have to really think of if I can have fun on games during a car ride or if I need to bring a real book with instead of my kindle fire.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself a rational reader. I am not an ardent fan of any particular romance in Sookie's life. I have always liked Eric, but I also liked Alcide, and Bill, and Sam. i read thus book because I am an ardent fan of Sookie and this series.<br /><br />I will be honest, the last few of these books have felt a little bit... compulsory. It has been obvious for some time that Charlaine was cranking these out to meet the demands of her publisher and, maybe even line her own pockets (although I try not to think that cynically). On one of her most recent blog posts, she even defended this book against all of the backlash by saying that it hadn't hurt book sales. Humph. If that isn't a sign of her no longer caring about the characters in these books, I don't know what is. But what else can we expect from a series that has a new boom come out in May every single year? It was bound to get a bit tired and contrived.<br /><br />And tired and contrived are the best words I can think of to sum up Dead Ever After. Did I hate it? No, but I didn't love it, or really even thoroughly enjoy it like I have with the others, even the more lackluster ones. I still read it, even devoured it, but with no joy, like eating a bland meal at a really expensive restaurant. I sooooo wanted to love it, I just couldn't get there.<br /><br />What I liked about it:<br />-Sookie. I just love her. I relish all of the tid bits if her life, even stories of her doing the dishes. I thank Charlaine for giving us all a character we can identify with and root for so emphatically.<br />-Sam. I have always liked him.<br />-Tying up the loose ends. I was hoping Sookie could live Happily Ever After, and I think based on all of the complications of her life and world, this book did deliver that.<br />-Return of past characters, I appreciated getting to spend some time with Mr, Cataliades, Amelia and Bob, Barry, Tara, and many others I had come to know.<br /><br />What I didn'tlike about it:<br />-Eric. For a character who had absorbed so much of Sookie's time and attention, his farewell was  rushed and abrupt. I thought the premise and emotions involved were decent, just wish it would have had a bit more buildup, and a bit more consequence.<br />-The plot. The motivations of the villains in this book were just flat out silly. I expected more than that. After all that Sookie has been through, being framed for murder seems like an inconvenience akin to a flat tire. This is the FINALE! Being slapped in the face with how much Sookie hates jail is a patronizing way to convince us of the severity of her predicament. All of the third person POV to explain the actions of the villains is telling. The plot is so ridiculous and trivial that it could never have been convincingly told from Sookie's POV. Charlaine should have known at that point that it was time to reevaluate the story. Perhaps she had a deadline.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me most is how poorly the Sam ending played out. I had suspected that Sookie would end up with Sam for about the last 4 or 5 books. Since I love Eric but am not obsessed, I saw the logic in this. Sookie could lead a normal life, have children, and obviously really cared about Sam. I was even excited about how this would play out, since it was obvious from the beginning of this book that it was going to. Then I found myself about three quarters of the way through the book, and nothing had happened in the development of their relationship. I thought to myself, &#34;We'll crud, there is no way that this is going to be satisfying.&#34; Charlaine didn't give it enough room to be. It was scrunched into the very end of the book, and even if I could forgive the scrunching, there was no excitement! No payoff! Their first kiss gave me only the most tiny of shivers. It was just so sad. It could have been built up. Their tension has always been there, Sam has always had a crush on her, he has always been on Sookie's back burner. There was so much to work with! Instead we got, Sam: &#34;Well, since I died, I have realized I have always dated bitches. And I respect you, so I guess we should date.&#34; Sookie: &#34;Hmm, I just broke up with somebody I have been obsessed with for like nine books, but I guess you are right. Obviously since I brought you back from the dead, I love you deep down, although this has been explored in the clumsiest, most superficial way and its almost like the author forgot about it about halfway through this book, so no one will get any satisfaction from our hookup. Oh well.&#34;<br /><br />In a nutshell, Charlaine spent all of this book on the lame plot. She should have been spending it on Sookie's relationships. There was no way the ending was going to make everybody happy. That's ok. But it should at least have felt climactic, worthy of the final book of the series. It felt like she just gave up.<br /><br />Charlaine opens this book by saying that she knew she couldn't make everybody happy, but she went with the ending she had in mind all along. That should have been everybody's big fat hint that this book wasn't going to be great. Charlaine didn't even like it, that much is obvious, since the book apologizes for itself on the first page.<br /><br />This book earned three stars from me because I love the series so much. As long as I didn't hate this book, I was ok. And I didn't hate it. But I sure do understand why so many people did. And that makes me pretty sad.
B008Y73940|5.0|It was a good story, great acting, really enjoyed it. Would recomend it to anyone who likes a good detective story
0525953728|5.0|This narrative of the life and the work of the navy seals is scary, awe inspiring and sad.  The world owes them so much!!!!!!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Actually we did not even watch the whole thing. Jumped from one totally different story to another, very confusing, just<br />could not get into it.  Although it had many good stars...just could'nt hold our interest
B00992CF6W|5.0|why cant we get the update. it should have:emrold spowinig eggs and cake. and the real nether wold and the n portle
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|We loved it.  All the great Cher songs we grew up with..and Cher was at her best!  Losts of clips from the past with her<br />and Sony.  Great concert would recomend it to anyone who is a Cher fan!
B0026IUXO2|4.0|I love Cate Blanchett. I love the history of the Elizabethan Period which gave rise to some of the most famous people in history.... i.e. Shakespeare, Sir Walter Raleigh.<br /><br />I agree with the fact others have said. If you are looking for historical accuracy from this movie I would only expect about 60% to be accurate. They pretty much condensed the years of Elizabeth's life from 1554 to 1565 into two and half hours of film. They also confused the fact that her father Henry the 8th created the modern Church of England. I give them full marks for accuracy on the costuming and set design. If you are just looking for a entertaining historical drama \\"BASED\\" on true events then you have the movie for you.
0425263924|1.0|I waited for months for this book!  No plot - boring.  Ending was so disappointing.  I hope the next one will be worth my time!
B004742Y68|4.0|Great movie for its time, it definitely set the stage for what we now watch today. It is the founding father of ask paranormal movies
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I waited months on end of this book only to be left hanging, had no idea that was coming.  I was reading and then it was over, with no finish<br />no resolution, so disappointing.  I may even skip the next 2 books, I agree with a previous review, she brought way too many other characters in that we the readers, just didn't CARE about.  It was a big waste of time really.  Very surprised and for sure too much a 50 shades rip off.  At least E.L. James knew what she was doing with her characters and it didn't have to \\"reach\\" to extend the story.  Huge disappointment very annoyed and turned off now, I am to the point I don't even care what happens next.
B005BZQS1E|1.0|I’m sorry to say that but it’s true.  It was horrible.  What were they doing? There’s some real talent there and they totally threw it away.  Don’t bother, really!
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Well written and very important view of today's food issues.  Disgusting reminder of the stench and habitat destruction caused by big hog farms -- put me off barbecue forever!
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|I felt there was some really good character portrayals and the story is compelling, of course (as well as true).  I don’t own a tv so I was not aware of the how gruesome one part would be, I knew the storyline and what happened.  I just didn’t think it would be that graphic.  I was not scared to watch the movie, but I admit I did look away when he started doing what he does to free himself.  I don’t want to give it away, someone out there may not be aware yet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun game I would highly recommend it. my daughter likes to play the game too! The horses are so cute!
0307476073|5.0|I am not a hiker, and I don't like adventure stories, but Cheryl captivated me with her story of survival on so many levels.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|this captured the mood of the novel better then the movie ,the young and in some cases little known artist, such as coco, lana del ray emile sonde  and the xx bought much to the table. also the jazz vibe was authentic and strong, in time, when the artist on this sound track , gain the fame they deserve this sound track will be a classic
B0085YOD1A|5.0|The Best Feature Is That You Can Have The Remaining Battery Power Status Show In The Notification BaR So That You Can Check It Without Even Unlocking Your Phone.
0470913029|4.0|Very consise. There was a lot of defending of the theory of why this diet works. There was a lot of technical information. Then there was very good information on how to use this diet.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|When there is nothing to do you can play this because it's fun and is a long game play of fun.
B003QSPTAY|5.0|I have always loved this movie and was excited to share it with my kids.  My kids, on the other hand, were not excited and thought that this old movie looked a little boring, they were wrong!  We all loved it and got a bunch of laughs out of it.
B0091X1FVA|5.0|I think since it is based on a true story that did a great job of making it a comedy / drama type movie. They got the best actors to play the parts as well. I watch it about once a week. It's a great movie that won't give you nightmares if a little violence or blood makes you dream at night. I laugh all though the movie. It's  must have movie of you are interested in mob movies.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|This was an interesting film with the usual amount of black humour. Personally I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and Tom Cruise's acting, which seems to be improving with age. Tom is not taking himself so seriously.<br />I highly recommend this film and know that you will find something in it to enjoy.
B004LROUW2|4.0|This one fascinated me even more than the other Murakami novels I've read. The subtly different world in which the characters gradually begin living is just enough like the ordinary differences in peoples' perceptions to be plausibly disturbing. I would give it five, but the ending, although pleasing in some ways, was a little too simplistic for my taste.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was so disappointed with this book which re capped book 1&2 way to much and gave not much new. If stretching a story is going to ruin it then it's not a good idea to to it. Less is sometimes more
B00B5A9FOG|4.0|I found this season very interesting; although not as great a previous seasons.  I've been watching Season 5 (The last season this program will be on, I believe); and am waiting for a great ending.  I will certainly be purchasing this last season soon.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|When you sit down to watch a film, you're essentially investing your time with the expectation of entertainment or fulfillment. There's no ending. I mean, sure it does end. But there's NO ending. It really depends on what you're into. If you like senseless movies, or suspense that goes nowhere, you'll love it. But if you like movies that eventually get to the point, this is not for you. This film goes nowhere. And it takes 2 hours to take you there. I felt so strongly about the low quality of this movie, that I'm up at midnight writing a review. Take that into consideration.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best drama's ever to be shown on television.  Excellent writing, acting, costumes and more. I highly recommend this series.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A lovely warm and amusing tale of love and romance and the trials of being a little bit different. Very intelligent.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The tablet version of the Weather Channel is pure weather. No silly frivolous stuff, just the weather info a person needs, where you are, on demand. I like it better than the PC version, and a LOT better than the TV channel (weather on the eights? Really?).
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Get this game for ur child be I am a teacher for Kindergarten  and I let one student play  on it and every kid what's to play.it
1594202842|4.0|I just want to be clear that i did not read this book.  I am giving the book a 4-star rating as at the time I am writing this, the book has an overall rating of about 3.5 stars.  But, I did want to point others to a recent article on the Tiger Mom method - something that most of us already knew:<br /><br />[...]
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I stumbled onto this product accidentally and I'm sure glad I did.<br /><br />I have a Magic Mouse that I use when I travel and even before I had the mouse, I had other mice that required batteried and it was always a pain to worry about when the batteries went dead.  You are not always near a store when you batteries go dead.<br /><br />Thankfully, this is no longer a problem.<br /><br />I read the initial reviews and saw the videos demonstrating the issues of it fitting snuggly into the Magic Mouse.  Perhaps those issues existed with the first/earlier versions, but I bought 3 and they all fit no problem and haven't fallen out.<br /><br />I definitely recommend!
0446554995|1.0|Well, I think this review can be brief.<br /><br />You need to dig one grave for the book.  Make it a deep one to prevent anyone from digging it up.<br /><br />You will probably want to dig a second grave for yourself, if you actually purchased this mass of words that masquerades as a book.<br /><br />Plot?  Forget it ... a series of increasingly stupid ideas strung together.<br /><br />Your time could be better spent reading the ingredients on a box of cereal.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Don't know what this is...probably something my ex-boyfriend placed on my Kindle and then it was deleted. I do not see this on my Kindle any longer.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing. Words can barely describe how unbelievably talented Suzanne Collins is. This book has a great story to it and an awesome twist ending. You won't be able to put it down
B004EIZCPM|5.0|I purchased the digital download of this movie.  Based on the reviews and the fact that I love Emma Stone, I bought the movie rather than rented it.  Picture and sound quality is great on this download.<br /><br />The movie itself was very entertaining.  Quickly paced, witty, cute.  Everything ties together lovely at the end and it definitely made me smile.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I absolutly love this game! I played it on a friends opossum and the very first thing I did when I got home look for it on my kindle fire and they didn't have it!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My daughter really likes this game.  I paid the extra money and upgraded so that the extra features would be unlocked.  It's fun for them to be able to wash the girl's hair, do spa treatments on her face, put on make-up, and pick from many different dresses, shoes and accessories.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  I keep to the basics but I do pretty good keeping up with other players.  I do enjoy this one.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I am not surprised that this book has gotten as many bad reviews as good. To think that the author turned a trilogy into a longer series is crazy. This story could've def been wrapped up by book 3. No need for  4 or 5 books. And at a $10 price tag? No thank you. That being said, the relationship between gideon and eva is steamy as usual. Lots of plot twists in this book. Most of them really unnecessary to draw out the story line and stretch it way too thin in my opinion. I gave book 1 and 2 five stars. This one gets a 3.5
B009O2XY12|3.0|After thinking it's an easy game, you do have to think how and where they fall. I play it everyday for fun.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Sharp Objects is A Thrilling, well written novel that keeps you enthralled to the ending, to the macabre, unsuspected twist.
B00AXVIBKW|4.0|Typical Bad Religion disc, which is good because that's what I was hoping for.  This is a little heavier than &#34;Dissent of Man&#34; and has a few more catchy tunes.  I really like the &#34;Past is Dead&#34;, and several of the songs on here made it on my workout mix.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Remember when you were a kid and were carried away by stories.  Prepare to have that feeling all over again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Got this my 7 year old.  All his friends now have it and they all love it.  I love that they use their imagination to build.  Great game!
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Breathtaking! Watch in 3D will leave you awe as the music started, all animals moving towards the pride land, which I can’t explain in words, it feels like you were there. The main menu is great! Love it very much. Nothing to dislike about this Blu-ray release, maybe Scar for being evil. This is a must household product to be kept for entire generation to come.
B00BSBUZT6|2.0|This documentary was very well done.  However, it was done by the band themselves so I suspect it's filled with half truths, cover-ups, and lies.  I can get past all of that.  I understand that Don & Glenn want to be seen as Saints of rock-n-roll.  What I can't get past is the promise of a live concert from 1977.  That was not a concert, that was 45 mins. from a 90 min. concert.  We should have been told that it was excerpts from a live concert in 1977.  Because of the fact that part 2 is only an hour long and the \\"concert\\" was only 44 mins. long there was no need for this to be a 3 disc set.  It would have easily fit on two discs.  When I bought this it was $32.  I paid for that 3rd disc.  We shouldn't be forced to pay for things that are considered a bonus.  I was extremely disappointed that there were only excerpts from the 1977 concert.  Time and time again I'm amazed by the greed of this band.
B004WE01YA|5.0|Full star for best storyline and characters that you really care for, seeing in 3D is beyond believing. the movie opening is spectacular. Feels like a popup book. The depths are amazing. The only disadvantage is it doesn’t last too long compare 3D done in The Lion King. Otherwise, 3D could have been better. One great thing for this Blu-ray diamond edition it includes tons of bonus feature. Beauty and The Beast Diamond Edition is a complete set & must have for all Disney fans all ages.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Awesome series. Everyone talking about Season 3 so we have to get caught up. If you like medieval period stories similar to Bravehart you will love this series. There is lots of graphic violence and nudity (graphic sex scenes) but of your ok with that then this is the series for you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Oh my gosh. I love this app. I use it every day. I am so addicted it's just crazy. It's got so many great ideas of projects I can do with my family.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Wonderful. Cumberbatch and Freeman are amazing! Be prepared to watch every episode back to back and then cry when it's over and wait for Season 3 like the rest of us.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app it is really fun to play this game . When I start I can't stop . I wish I was in this game because I am cool like them in the game[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
0345803507|5.0|great ending to a trilogy that should have been one long book, but okay.  bottomline, they're just so much fun to read!<br /><br />this is not great literature. it is VERY bad in many terribly repititious ways I will not document as others have over and over again.<br /><br />But are these books brilliant?  Yes, I think they are.  First time out the woman created literary potato chips - only they're not fattening but they do have some bite.<br /><br />I liked the story. it's a sexy grown up fairytale about a rich prince with a sad story and sort of silly and vapid but brave and true virgin princess.  Both are pure of heart.  The moral of the story is \\"true love will prevail.  Having a few gazillion doesn't hurt either\\".<br /><br />As I said in my other reviews - the sex had some relatively accurate kink and power exchange and it's carefully detailed with no dangerous swinging from the rafters moments.  all scenarios were thought out and the author did her research - either first hand or got it from someone who knows.<br /><br />I found the story fun. it was sexy, but mostly fun. I think secretly it's not about kink or \\"fifty shade\\" but about a very a compelling love relationship with a lot of sex thrown in. neither of them are looking for love, but they find it big time.  and they go ga ga over each other.  Lots of arguing, lots of makeup sex.  I thought it was great!  PLUS they get married!  OKAY!<br /><br />In sum, I enjoyed it and I think I loved it but I'm not prepared to admit that publicly, at this tiem.  for the life of me, I still don't know why I liked it so much except that it was sexy and sweet and fun.  I hope she writes a sequel.  I am damned to hell for stupid people, aren't I?
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really loved this book and I hope to be able to read to whole series.  Thank you for putting this on the free list.  This was well written and funny
0671449028|4.0|why are babies so resistant to nighttime sleep?  hopefully this will help in some small way.  cute story that babies love.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it was an amazing tale on how one brave young man, with the help of an older wise man, found his way to colors and feelings and freedom. He found his way to the Elsewhere he so badly longed to find and I loved the way you got to decide what happens then.
B00CFQMVLS|5.0|I have seen them all but this really tops the one involving Washington DC. Ya gotta buy it...but do not watch it right before bedtime.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Did exactly what I wanted it to do and preserved my dad's World War II slides for the grandchildren to appreciate.
B006EURGNE|5.0|My wife has a hard time reading little words , so this book was just what, she needed , if wife's happy my I'm happy
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Excellent photography and effects.....the rest is not really memorable. I think they used the best scenes in the trailer....Should have waited until it was released on TNT or something....yawnfest.<br />I watched a week ago, maybe, and to tell you the truth I can't remember what went on...really. That boring.
B0018BF1MC|5.0|Although there are probably not many available copies of this LP left , if you choose to buy it you should know that the LP's come in clear plastic sleeves which tend to stick to the vinyl records.  Not only do the plastic sleeves leave residue on the vinyl record surface, it is next to impossible to remove.  And yes, I can hear it (however slightly) when I play the records. My LP's now live in paper sleeves, the original plastic sleeves were trashed long ago.  It does not discourage me from playing the vinyl.<br />That said, the 5-disc package (3LP's, 2CD's) is beautiful and includes a poster.  The CD is packaged in book form with lyrics and credits in old english font.<br />As for the music, it is different for Priest, but I have found it to be good as background music for when I'm reading. So, I've found myself listening to it way more than I anticipated that I would.
B005CRQ2IU|4.0|It was a bit depressing but the book is fantastic. Id recommend this to everyone.<br /><br />&#34;I need more words for the requirement&#34; &#34;SO More Words&#34;
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I have really been looking forward to the last book in the trilogy. it was a good story, but I hate these kind of endings.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Omg I could not put these books down.  I have read them several times.  I hope EL James comes out with more books
B005PK57IK|4.0|Good story line and characters portrayed well. Many TV shows have weak plots and the acting is not very good. This show draws you in.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I marathoned episodes every night for four days staying up to two in the morning and being exhausted the next day at work because I had to see it. And bought the second season immediately aftet! The music performances were so good. I really enjoyed the actors. So sad to hear it might be canceled.
B00APKIN1I|1.0|Had to jump in just to mention that while \\"Master Dave\\" is a pop music king who can (and does) do whatever he wants with whomever he wants because he has cultural popularity clout & the money to entice; he's long since gotten tired to me with his \\"safe music route\\" schtick. Nothing ventured equates consistent stagnancy in my book, which is simplistic and disinteresting.<br /><br />The third Foo Fighters album proved that he was more into slick production and radio play than deep content (the latter tends to traditionally polarize the bulk of audiences, unfortunately; Choruses of \\"I don't get it.\\"/\\"It's... weird.\\" abound.)<br /><br />This is just another of his Probot-esque mash-up projects that, while having immense potential if not tethered to his pop-flavored shackles, falls flat due to a lack of true chemistry and innovation. When will these high profile artists realize that you can't simply dump other high profile names into a melting-pot project, stir for five minutes, and expect greatness? Maybe it was all done just for fun and not meant to be anything but an experiment for them all, but it just sounds far too pasteurized for me to take seriously.<br /><br />Dave should ease up on the endless celeb-stew albums and stick to his own thing; With his track record I predict (with dismay) that he will likely push a Nirvana \\"reunion\\" within the next decade, with himself as vocalist of course. That's just the kind of dude he seems to be: The self-aware cash-cow with his mind on the money versus the music.<br /><br />I'm done with Dave!
B000FA675C|4.0|Well written book that kept you r attention from beginning to the end.  I love Dan's way of writing and the way he describes everything that is going on in such detail it is simplistic to envision and understand.
0920668372|5.0|This book is adorable.  Maybe a tiny bit creepy (lol), but sweet, none the less.  My daughter likes to bring this too me to read to her along with others for nap time.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I bought this because I have every single NKOTB album.  This one is just as awesome as the rest!  They are just like a great wine...only get better with age.  =)
B0050DZN4K|2.0|Two big issues: on the Kindle Fire I can not comment on blogs, nor can I open blogs in a browser from Feedly. These are HUGE flaws. If those two things could be fixed it would be 5 stars.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Excellent  waiting for next one<br />Although the ending left you hanging to soon to  end the book  when did the next one
B006GWO5NE|2.0|this is not what i expected.  thought i was getting a standard kindel power/charger cord.<br />i received a. micro and standard usb cable,  tried to charge ithe kindel via the lab top, didn't work.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is the best that I have purchased on the Kindle Fire HD.  It is not for immature children that may think that the character on the game shows appropriate behavior but for adults, it is incomparable among other games on a tablet.  I have beaten the game twice and still play it while I poop.  Good stuff.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest is great!  I use it to share things and save pics that I like and the recipies are great!
1932100660|4.0|Not your average persons reading material. Somewhat difficult to retain. But informative if you can digest information.  Recommend for deep thinkers. Not for the casual reader.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent puzzler with attractive story line and environment.  I for one will be eagerly awaiting next and will have no qualms recommending this game to friends.
B005PK57NU|5.0|There is everything to like about The Good Wife.  The plots are believable and the characters are delivered with excitement.  The events of the law are occasionally stretched but each episode is only 45 minutes long and often 3 or 4 suspenseful stories are told.  Fabulus series - 5 Stars!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|The film is a little hard to watch at certain points, but still comes out a great good vs evil movie with plenty of style.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Another excellent version. Puzzles range from simple to mind numbing and the sound track is awesome. Well worth the mere pittance they ask.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|23 years ago I picked up a book entitled &#34;Eye of the World.&#34; Today, I read the last pages the series. In between the first book and last I have gone from High School to near 40. Thank you for the journey Robert Jordan.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is the best series I have ever watched. I love the characters and especially that time period. Looking forward to season 4.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is so fun. I love it. This game is very ADICTIVE. I would definitely recommend this game. From ages 3 to 93 this game is awesome.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|This book evokes all emotions; scary, sad, happy and mad. Can be suspenseful and ultimately a story of one's journey through death and experience of heaven.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A fun game. Seen others  playing with such intensity just had to try it. Im not a gamer so this keeps me real busy. I recommend it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well written and thought provoking.  The background of Dr. Alexander's life, the progress of the disease and the experiences of Dr. Alexander during his seven day coma make a very interesting read.  Dr. Alexander uses his expertise in neuroscience to examine his Near Death Experience.  This analysis makes what occurred very hard to dismiss as a mere figment of a sick brain.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Complex, dark, compelling.  GRRM continues his epic with style.  Some of his detailed descriptions do not directly move the plot forward but help to flesh out the world and cultures in which the story unfolds.  This sense of the background helps make the actions of the characters more understandable.  Like the background weave of a tapestry makes the primary pattern stand out more boldly.  I look forward to the next twists and turns of this epic story.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Lots of hidden object searches. Screen went blank except for HO's. Kind of strange.  Very entertaining .A bit easy. Would recommend for newbies.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|well folks im up to a 4 on this album i listened to this thing in my sleep twice last night once when i woke up again on my way to town today  and then the dang thing clicked i can enjoy the 1st 6 songs and think its really good,i still think that this album lacks the jerry tight solos but i think it gains in  a harder hitting sean kinneys drums that i have never heard before in songs and when it counts and kinney was mostly a finnesse drummer.  and there are more  infectious grooves coming out of mike inezs bass more than ever and strong sounding. it in a way reminds me in a way of dokkens new album broken bones came out i did not like it but after 10 listens i loved it dons voice is a little weak but with a little tuning and polishing its quite a jump start and new concepts can work  i guess sometimes change is good i can actually now see pieces of the old aic a little at a time in each song more and more every listen, but anyway 1. hollow is the best on here hard and gloomy typical aic. 2.pretty done the vocals are more reminding of the late layne staley 3. stone another hard dark riffer i think is the 2nd best on this recording 4. voices is a mellower but good tune that reminds me of degradation trip give it a name,5. the title song reminds me of classic aic the killer is me and lying season, 6.and lab monkey is good and will rereview this song and the other 6 when i check them out in my sleep tonight and the next day who knows maybe album of the year!! stay tuned!!
B0026QC0TA|5.0|Insurance companies are still doing this and getting away with it.. nice to see a film that shows the real life situation many people have to deal with
B002MFULQO|5.0|great movie, great cast- keeps you on the edge of your seat.. brings up points that have been debated for decades
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I think this is a pretty cool app for kids of any age.It is fun and it gives the kids a chance to get into something different.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game, went from Tokyo to California! This game is a fun filling and has wonderful background. Thank you, again!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I would like it more if the game had tips and tricks to learn.But overall I like this game.Plus it should have more and new characters to get because on my other tablet I have all the  characters.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I thought it was going to be a biography of his life, instead it was like watching C-SPAN. The authentic historical setting was interesting for awhile but I quickly lost interest.
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|If you love historical romance, Georgette Heyer is a must.  Venetia is one of her later books and very well written.
B003ELMR9E|5.0|Amazing front cover, and great video quality (better than the European edition). Enjoy this wonderful thriller and his super photography with the best edition out there.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The first part of the book was good, I read when I had time....the second half I literally could not stop!  Read it all night!  I'm gonna be tired tomorrow...
B004FHCH96|5.0|Like Following, this new improved edition of Memento features the remastered version supervised by Chris Nolan. A perfect and vibrant video quality that shadows the previous one. Plus new interviews to the director.<br />Must have.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|A movie hasn't made me laugh out loud in a while. Thanks for the comic relief!<br />There are dark moments that reflect some smart thinking behind a comic movie. So be prepared for that.<br />God bless Albert Brooks for participating in this project. He was very funny!
1419703692|4.0|A beautiful compendium for the production of the trilogy. Lots of trivia, details and tales. Amazing pictures behind the scenes and from the movies, and final words from the man himself (Christopher Nolan) and sir Michael Caine.<br />A must have for fans of this saga.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This novel reminds of the warm, humorous stories on BBC television like Ballykissangel, Lark Rise to Candleford,  and  Doc Martin. Very enjoyable.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|A little rough around the edges.  The music was great as usual.<br /><br />If you have not seen the musical yet it will be enjoyable.
B000GRTQXY|4.0|Nothing really Objective To say, I'm An Oldies Person And Like Mostly Music Generated In The Fifties And Sixties End.
B005HEPIDS|3.0|I enjoyed the last season but I didn't like the ending that much and some of the episodes just sort of seemed to have no purpose at all in the grand scheme of things all things considered.  I think though that the series was best in the first five seasons.
B001EN71HC|5.0|I love these movies. They are a must have! Very shagadelic baby! These are classics! Mike Myers is hilarious. Groovy!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was encouraged to watch this by a friend and so glad I have.  The characters are well defined and draw you back with each episode.  I will definitely continue to follow the saga.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and owned it on vhs and dvd. now I have it on blu-ray and it is still awesome.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Great fantasy novel with unexpected twists. Martin as always keeps one on their toes.  I am just dying for the next book to come out.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This novel was a great read. I started it and finished within a flight from US to Europe. It was definitely full of intriguing scenes, the characters weren't the type you necessarily wanted to identify with but in the end did. Loved the interlaced referenced to classic novels. Also, saw the movie and was shocked at how much substance was missing. Must read!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great fantasy novel with unexpected twists. Martin as always keeps one on their toes.  I am just dying for the next book to come out.
B000VSYDRM|2.0|Gave the movie two star for the very good photography. The rest is rather forgettable. Jean Baptiste just needed a good bubble bath, a comb, and a shave....I kept watching (like an idiot) hoping that the whole thing would have a point...no dice. Save your time and skip this one.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great fantasy novel with unexpected twists. Martin as always keeps one on their toes.  I am just dying for the next book to come out.
B0099114WO|5.0|This movie is for all married or unmarried couples.  Everyone will see a bit or alot of themselves. I would watch it with your mate, not with another couple because of it's going to make you both see some of yourselves.<br />Tommy and Meryl are fantastic together and so ordinary. It was a perfect match for this movie.  You will squirm, laugh, maybe even cry.  It will get your emotions going and at one point or another you will see yourself or someone you know or have known.<br />Enjoy!!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great fantasy novel with unexpected twists. Martin as always keeps one on their toes.  I am just dying for the next book to come out.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Bought this as a gift for a Star Wars fan and he was really happy to get it.  It wasn't available locally at the time I found it here.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I live in Kenya and am from TRENTON!  This book is wonderful and so real.  I have read all her books and she just gets better and better.
0143119680|5.0|It pulled me right in, and held my interest all the way! I'm on to read the 2nd book now!
B0068THAGY|5.0|I loved it all the way around. I think it is one of the best movies ever. I wish he makes a sequel to this movie.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|I went with a friend to see the movie as she had read the books, and I am glad I did! Afterwards I have since read the entire series of books.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this app. best out of the angry birds series. I totally would reccomend this app to everyone. get it.
0316069353|5.0|I really enjoy the Lincoln Lawyer series, and this book fits in with the rest! I am looking forward to the next book!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This reader is SO much better than Google's - Try it - you won't ever look for another RSS reader again.
B005P9SLES|5.0|This is my favorite series on TV, and having it on Blu-Ray is only fitting for me. I am worried about the move to Friday for Season 4, but it still number one in my book!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This series is particularly interesting look at the norms of the time period of WWI. The relationships of the wealthy and those serving them are fascinating. Can get a bit like a soap opera at times but the acting and the character development carries the storyline.
B001CTDH76|5.0|This was a gift for someone, and they were extremely happy with it. So that is all I needed to know to five it five stars!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|PBS has done it again.  What a fantastic series period.  A cast of well known actors make it the best series yet.  Can't wait for season #4.
1451627289|5.0|As crazy as it sounds for someone who reads as much as I do, this was my first Stephen King novel but it certainly won't be my last!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I always viewed Lincoln as a great man.  I never realized what a politician he was.  This book gives an insight into what you really have to do to become and stay president.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Spoilers ahead! I have invested a lot of time in reading Gideon and Eva's story, which wasn't difficult because I loved the first two books. All of the characters, not just Gideon and Eva, were so full of life and it was very easy to get into the story. Book number two left a lot of questions and loose ends I had hoped to see wrapped up in this book...but it appears the author is going to try and drag this out as long as possible and over as many books as she can squeeze out - which is understandable in a sense, as it means bigger royalties for her and a bigger profit for her publisher. This book dropped some bombs and then ended abruptly with a promise from the author that their story isn't finished yet. So now after months of waiting painfully for Entwined, we get to wait even longer just to have everything wrapped up. It literally pissed me off when I turned the last page to see the author's note. I don't know if I'll buy book four, I might just make up my own ending...because I really couldn't stand to read another book only to have it end so abruptly and on such a cliffhanger as this one and then have to deal with all the unanswered questions for another year. It's completely unsatisfying as a reader. What's up with the Russian mob angle? How will that pan out? Why was there more than one bracelet? Where the hell is Megumi? Will Gideon's mom ever come around from being such a cold bitch and admit to her mistakes? Will Dr. Lucas ever be held accountable? What's going to happen to Corrine? Is the baby Cary's? What's Tatiana going to do? Why is Monica so obsessed with being married to rich men although she's independently wealthy on her own? Will Stanton find out she cheated? What's going to happen with her and victor? Why can't Eva just stay away from Brett? Will the sex tape be released? These are only a FEW of the questions I'm dealing with this time around.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|The only reason I not givin it a 5 rating  is  because you don't get check points. So pretty  much you  have to keep  playing  the same area  every time you die.  Beside that  I'd a very  cool game.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A journey through time and space exploring so many emotions and senses. One of the most creative books I've read in ages.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|Must have sci-fi read. Read Ubik,  slaughter house 5, 2001, Dune, Verne, Clarke and Assimov. If you have not developed a sense of awe of the universe by then, rethink why you bother to get out of bed everyday. Go back to kindergarten, you missed the point of it all.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Her writing style is straight forward, and I am consistently smiling during different parts of the story.  There are some slow parts, but nothing that takes away from the overall importance of the book.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved the book as well as the whole series. I Wish it was not the last book in the series
B000FA675C|5.0|GREAT SELLER. It is as described and quality is outstanding and Fast Shipping.<br />cheapest price anywhere else in the market.
B002WSASIC|4.0|Maybe a little slow but shows in a nice way how people that we trust and people that we reject can change role. Interesting movie about racism.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Loved it because I love historical fiction. Great for book review with our group. Characters are down to earth and easy to follow.
B000IHL51S|2.0|Not into Rambo type movies.  However!  (I am proud to say) Flew US Mail in the Rambo Jet!  100WM a 1964 Aero Commander 1121.  Good memories... had to get the movie.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|A nice app for the little one's who enjoy playing &#34;grown ups&#34;.  Fun and entertaining and works well on the Kindle.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have to say at first I was afraid to read this, cause of the reviews, however I soon realized that people were mad she was coming out with another bk and some that gave a bad review didn't even read it. SORRY but that is just wrong in so many ways.<br /><br />Because of the reviews, I decided I would download the book to the kindle and got the paper back, just because I am not a mean person, and I won't judge someone for writing. My 22 yr old daughter writes and no matter what anyone says, I wouldn't want her judge before her book is read. I am still in awe that people are really like this.<br /><br />Now, to the book, I loved it just as much as I did the first 2. I am so happy that another book will be coming out. I don't know about others, but I hate when my books end. The only advice to Silva is the kindle price is a little much, but the book wonderful. SILVA DAY thank you for another GREAT book. All of my friends agree, we loved it. thank you
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This movie killed John McClane as we know and love him.  I am a big Die Hard fan and would recommend against watching this.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Suspenseful and interesting! Has action!!! SUCH A SHOCKING ENDING. I'm a guy that hates these, but this was awesome! I absolutely adored it.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great job on creating this game. I love all the weapons, spells and so much more. I recommend that you buy this game now.
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|Starting and ending with Durga is brilliant - hence Samsara. Taking us through red rock cut by water in the desert millennia ago, to the rivers and waterfalls of today and the aftermath of the tsunami that devastated Indonesia is genius.<br />Ron's films should be on/in the curriculum of every educational institution on the planet. Show it, discuss it, show it again – discuss it again & repeat. Get it?
B005PK57IK|5.0|I am so hooked on this show. The storyline is so good and the writing is fantastic. I stay in awe of the depth of the stories from a legal standpoint and feel totally involved in the character's lives. Excellent all the way around!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I recently got this for my new smartphone and it works great.  It picks up right where I left off on my Kindle tablet.  I haven't had any issues with it.  It's a must-have app for people who do a lot of reading.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|The show is fantastic - the actors are great and the plot is so climatic! You never know what the plot is going to be or where the show is going to go. The actors portray their characters well.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|It's a great album, just that simple. If you are thinking about getting it, just do it. I think it is a great price as well.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I LOVE this game. I haven't beat it yet. I lay in bed every night and play this game. Very addicting.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|My mindset about this book was that it would be like hunger games meets Harry potter but with much less characters. That was not the case. The book lacked depth especially when it came to the so called challenges. I left like the love between the two characters was very one dimensional. Our of the entire book there was one love Sen if you would even call it that. Had high hopes but not for me!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have played subway surfers for like 2 1/2 years. I have loved this game. This game is a stimulating and addicting game. I love it. I definitely recommend this game.
B008602KQI|4.0|I liked this movie, but i liked the book more.  It needed more character development and back story.  I wouldn't mind another 30-45 minutes if that was included.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Love the graphics and the info displayed in general both on the task bar icon and the widget - would like some better info when there is an exclamation point showing.  Cause, that could be anything from &#34;it is raining&#34; to &#34;you are in a storm area&#34;
B0031RAOWI|5.0|I was talked into watching the first one, but loved it and had to buy my own copy.  Especially loved the deleted scene of their call to there Mom in Ireland.  Should never have been left out.  Saints #1 is hard to beat, but #2 is still enjoyable enough to watch multiple times.
B004LWZWGA|1.0|We really do love the Batman movies but I must say this one was a big disappointment. The reviews sounded great, but for us it was just bad. We shut it off half way through due to total boredom.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is hilarious.<br />The shipping was super quick.<br />The packaging was great, no lose dvds rolling around.<br />Got plenty of laughs from the movie itself.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Goonies is a classic. It is one of those movies that has a completely different meaning every time I have watched it from the age of 6 or 7 to now at 33 with my 6 year old son. Must see, fun to watch.
B00785P2QC|3.0|you either need to be able to do certain things without energy or energy needs to regenerate faster. I'm tired of waiting to do anything. Expanding could cost a little less to, and permits..... you've got to be kidding me.....
193700788X|1.0|I have not even finished reading this \\"book\\", but I totally agree with the other reviewers....this last book is some foolishness! As I'm sitting here reading it I just keep repeating \\"WTH?! WTH?!\\"<br /><br />This book is just so poorly written and written in a style that doesn't even really resemble the other books, that I must agree with one of the other reviewers and question if this book was written by a ghost writer.<br /><br />I am not only disappointed that this book will represent the end of the Sookie Stackhouse novels, but I am also offended that the author wrote and presented this bullcrap to her loyal fans....even having the nerve to justify this crap of a book in her dedication.<br /><br />She has definitely lost me as a fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept me glued to the pages and anticipating the next event in the story. Ms Collins has a gift for fantasy that holds you to the end of the story.
B003SI6C4O|5.0|Denzel never disappoints, Seen this movie almost a dozen times and still riveted to the action. I recommend this movie
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Sean Penn is amazing as usual, and so Ryan gosling. The acting is great, the set/props are great and the story is very entertaining. I loved this movie!
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This was one the best books I've read in a long time - extremely well written. The author is an artist with words! The story covers multiple generations, it is mysterious and romantic. After I finished the book, I went back and re-read a lot of it because of the twists and turns in the story. It was fun to read, hard to put down and it had a great ending.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a good show, its very worth the time it takes to watch it. Clear your calendar. Very Good.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have to agree with a lot of the negative reviews on this book which is what keeps me from giving a 5 star rating.  It was definitely a lot slower than the first two. I am hoping that it was a necessary book that will tie books 1 and 2 together with 4 and 5.  I do like how we got to spend a lot of alone time with Gideon and Eva and watch their relationship really blossom into a trustworthy one.  I like how they are both more confident with each other than in the previous books.  I am not crazy about so much focus on Corinne and I don't know how I feel about Cary's storyline twist.  I guess we will have to see where that one goes before I can really judge it.  I am hooked on what came of Megumi in the end and am looking forward to finding out more about her.  I think if there would have been a little bit more plot than it would have gotten a 5 star from me, but I still enjoyed it and am looking forward to the next two.

B004H8GLXQ|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale is the kind of book that will ruin your life.<br /><br />Fangirls and fanboys all know what I mean. It will ruin your life, but you'll love every second of it, and you won't regret it at all. I knew it from the first page--this book sucked me in from the very beginning until I was neck-deep in cold water in the bathtub, yawning and turning into a prune, whispering to myself five more pages as my mother wondered why I was still washing myself at 11:30 at night. I just knew it, right away, that this was a story worth reading.<br /><br />Margaret Lea is our narrator, a woman whose life has been one long love affair with books. She works at her father's antique book shop and spends all of her life reading and soaking in all of the words she can get. She is especially interested in stories about siblings, and she has written a short piece that could qualify her as an amateur biographer. Margaret also has a secret--she is one half of a set of twins and her sister died at birth, leaving her with the permanent cold feeling of constant loneliness.<br /><br />One day, Margaret receives a letter from Miss Vida Winters, a celebrated and successful novelist who has written fifty-seven novels in fifty-seven years and may or may not have outsold the Bible in terms of book sales. Winters is also quite an eccentric--she is famous for giving out many different stories about her life and childhood, so nobody knows who she really is. She is heading towards the end of her life and contacts Margaret, asking her to come and write her biography for her.<br /><br />I won't give too much away, but Vida Winters' story is heartbreaking and frightening and nothing like the cozy, warm family tales were are so used to in fiction. We're always given three types of stories--the happy one that ends in tragedy, and the tragic one that ends with hope, or a mix of the two. Her story is none of the above--it just makes you hurt. She tells Margaret about twin girls named Adeline and Emmeline, about a housekeeper and a gardener, about a brother and sister who were so deeply ill in the mind that their lives amounted to dirt and seclusion.<br /><br />And along the way, Margaret combs records and old towns in search of the truth about who Vida Winters really is.<br /><br />First of all, this novel gifted me three of the most amazing characters I have ever read in a fiction book: Vida Winter, Margaret Lea, and Hester Barrow (a more minor character, but one whose story reduced me to tears). They are interesting. They are mysterious. They have their own stories and none of them are love stories (well, for the most part). They all made me cry. And I fell in love with them.<br /><br />This book warmed me up inside and had me reading from dawn 'til dusk, drinking cup after cup of coffee, wondering how such a great mystery could possibly end. Just like everyone else had said, The Thirteenth Tale is a book for bibliophiles. Setterfield knows that readers take in the feel of books, the smell of them, the fine print and color of the cover, and she knows we hoard them like candy and consume them in the same manner. I think most of the people who read this can put themselves in Margaret's shoes--her curiosity, her skepticism, her faith in words.<br /><br />I love this book. I will, without a doubt, be reading it again and again.<br /><br />Prepare yourself for this one--I have nothing but good things to say about it, but it will break your heart.

B00005NC66|1.0|This is one film I missed during my favorite cinematic era--European films of the 60s--so I was excited that TCM was showing it last night on an otherwise dull TV night. Oh dear. Viewed today, this thing comes across as just one more badly made movie. The famous jump cuts were more like skip cuts; I felt like I was watching a bad copy from which bits had been censored. The famous long scene in Patricia's apartment was boring beyond belief--the result of filmmakers too lazy to bother with a script. Jean Seberg's character was well done, except that it's hard to believe she would be out on the street in jeans and t-shirt hawking the Herald Tribune one day, and the next day be all gussied up to interview a best-selling writer at the airport. A stunning moment of that interview is when Patricia asks the author what his great ambition in life is, and he says that it's to become immortal and then die. We then have a close-up of Patricia's face which now becomes for the viewer Jean Seberg's face with an unforgettable expression, when we think of her suicide. Art and life at this moment intersect most startlingly. I also find what Patricia does at the end of the film to be wonderfully believable and realistic--none of this Bonnie & Clyde stuff for her; she's going to save her own skin. But overall, what the other one-star reviews have said applies. In the final analysis, it's a stinker.
B008Q00BOQ|3.0|it was okay, the storyline was a little over the top.  Sction was good.  I would watach this movie again
B005HEFB6M|4.0|I have always been a Star Trek Fan.  When Star Trek Enterprise first started I was only able to watch a few eposides.  I have just recently completed season 1 using Amazon Prime Streaming Videos.  It is interesting to see how the Star Trek Series began.  The cast does well together.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I'm rather at sea about how to read RSS feeds. I have a very useful setup for technical feeds at work. I run NewzCrawler on my second monitor. For each feed of hundreds I have told it how often to refresh the feed and whether or not I want to see that feed's unread items in a little single-item dohickey that floats in the foreground and changes about every minute. As I'm working I watch the dohickey and in the main app window either mark the feed as read or process an interesting item. After several hours it runs out of unread items in the specified feeds. This model doesn't work on an Android tablet. So for my non-technical feeds on a tablet I keep trying things.<br /><br />Feedly does seem to have plumbing to support having tens or hundreds of feeds that are read in quite different ways - some of them you read individual messages almost in real time, others you read rarely and you read all accumulated messages at one time. Feedly has the \\"must-read\\" flag for the former. One of the primary benefits of Google read was the plumbing - bringing all your feeds into one space and giving you folders and whatnot to Organized them. Feedly is sorta doing the same thing.<br /><br />The Feedly UI is everywhere crisp and fast. I prefer text over pictures and Feedly lets me have that. My most common action with a feed item is to \\"share\\" it - to others via email or to myself via Instapaper or Evernote or my task manager (My Life Organized). Feedly makes this extremely convenient.<br /><br />I guess what I think I'd like is some facility like the rules in Gmail that would have Feedly call items to my attention or mark items as read according to attributes of the items. I suppose one step back from that would be saved searches as in Evernote. In essence what I did with NewzCrawler was to distill hundreds of feeds into one tailored feed. I didn't have to think at all about retrieving feeds or items, they were presented to me as a single list of items that I could react to. I don't see that preprocessor facility in Feedly, and honestly it may not belong in this user and usage space.<br /><br />Thinking out loud, trying things out. Feedly looks pretty good right now.ee that preprocessor facility in Feedly, and honestly it may not belong in this user and usage space.<br /><br />Thinking out loud, trying things out.

0446572985|3.0|After reading some of the reviews on this site, I expected to be disappointed in the ending. I wasn't. I was disappointed in the whole book.<br />Baldacci keeps throwing stuff at the reader. But it never gels. And I still do not know who \\"The Innocent\\" is.

B00AYHKOZU|5.0|I love David Bowie and this is classic! Great songs and the sequence is fascinating. The artwork is gorgeous, they just don't make music like this anymore. The cost of the vinyl version is a little more then I would like to spend but it is well worth it if you LISTEN to vinyl. Also includes a copy of the CD. The vinyl version seems warmer to me then the HD Ttracks 96 Khz version that is also available but you have t have the system to do it justice.. Give it a try, it you are a Bowie fan then you will love it!

B009NY43NY|2.0|I did not have an preconceived notion on how Sookie should end, but this ending was the worst.  But totally my opinion, I just cant believe this whole time she was ment to be with who Ms Harris wrote.  I think that is what ruined it for me personally.  I do feel like this book was a bit forced as well.  It seemed as if Ms Harris is tired of this cast of characters.  I am glad she is glad its over.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I really enjoyed the book city of bones . There was action and a little bit of romance . It kept me on the edge of my seat . I really hope lots of people read and like this book as much as I do . I can't wait for the movie to come out . Thank you Cassandra Clare for making this wonderful book .
B005LAII44|3.0|This is supposed to be an all-out action entertainer. A sequel to the first G.I.Joe movie which was awful, boring, senseless and disappointing. This Retaliation is barely watchable.<br /><br />The only reason anyone would watch this movie is because it stars Dwayne The Rock Johnson. That is the only reason I watched it from start to end. The Rock's screen presence is incredible. He puts up the show and everything else bad about the movie doesn't matter.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is in a cameo as the first G.I.Joe. It is completely unmemorable role with zero witty lines.<br /><br />Everyone else is forgettable. No personality, no character, no fun.<br /><br />The explosions are all nice. The big guns are great. But it fails as an action movie.<br /><br />More importantly it fails to match the military movie standards set by franchises such as Bourne Identity and James Bond. Even the 60s and 70s Bond movies are better written and made than this G.I.Joe movie.<br /><br />Watch it if you are The Rock's fan. I enjoyed his part in the movie.
B00CVCHJ6I|5.0|As good as any DT music. Have been playing it non stop!  Was excited to see a new release and I was not disappointed!
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Whenever a classic movie or character is renewed for a new generation, we hear jeers. The old fans of the movie scream bloody murder. They don't want a re-imagination. Would you reboot The Godfather they say. Would you reboot The Game of Death they say.<br /><br />But is it really the same thing rebooting Star Trek, Star Wars, Jason X, Aliens, etc.<br /><br />So relax, ignore all the bad rumours and reviews about this remake. As a standalone movie, it is a great movie. No need nor purpose to compare it to the original movie which was great in itself. Compared to the Karate Kid sequels, this reboot is much better and desirable.<br /><br />Jackie Chan shines in this movie. Typically any Jackie Chan movie has him all energised and frenetic and fast and funny. Here he plays the role as it should be. He plays a depressed man who has lost his wife and child and has resigned himself to a fate of anonymity and servitude as a repairman.<br /><br />He plays the role like a veteran actor that he is.<br /><br />Jaden Smith also shines as the new Karate Kid though the movie is about Kung Fu and set in China. Jaden is a good child actor and he executes his differing roles in first half and second half really well. The chemistry between Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith is brilliant and they must have been friends during the film's shooting.<br /><br />The other child actors are also very talented. The training of the kid is inspiring and original. The climax is honorable.<br /><br />It is a fun movie for all ages and definitely original storyline and presentation.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was so inspiring, innocent and raw,classic, edgy, and so brutally honest,I can't even begin to explain how much of a connection I felt with him. It's just such a staple, this book should be taught in school. I also love how realistic it is, and it doesn't hold back, just totally raw and in your face about the realities of going through high school.
0399162097|5.0|While there is a twist that is not so secret, my recommendation is to read the book before you've read too much about it. Let the storytelling take you on a journey. Because it's a journey worth taking. Discover, along with Rosemary, how our earliest experiences mark us, even those we can't or won't remember.<br /><br />Rosemary Cooke goes to UC Davis, both to remove herself from the influence of her broken family, and to try and reconnect with the brother she has lost, and through him, the sister she has also lost. The tone is wry and funny, the story starts with action and continues apace. I couldn't put it down, wanting to learn more and more as it went along. It also requires us to face some tough choices. How are families created and broken? Who is responsible and where does that responsibility end?<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a book to be read and read again; to have your eyes opened more than once.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is very hard to talk about this book without giving away the story. I was very surprised with Christians needs and wants.  I knew about these types of relationships, but the degree of depravity surprised me, a lot.  I am now starting Book Three, so that should give you some indication of how much I like this story.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|The story was well written,  but as another reader said the vocabulary of the characters is unrealistic to typical teens...even teens who are battling cancer. In fact, I don't know many adults who accurately use some of the words found in this novel. This bothered me because while it showed off the author's expansive articulation, it failed to be true to what real young adults would say and how they would really communicate. I am all about realistic fiction! Nevertheless, the plot was beautifully orchestrated despite the known variable: spoiler alert: the kid with cancer dies. Green is able to manipulate that  constant into a pretty interesting story.
B005SEZCVK|5.0|MY HUSBAND WATCHED THIS SERIES & WAS SO HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO SHARE IT WITH ME.  I REALLY LIKE THE ACTOR, NATHAN FILLION (I THINK THAT'S HOW TO SPELL HIS LAST NAME).

B00CKZ9BS0|1.0|I purchased this because I was not happy with the quality of the free edition and thought this one would be better.  I was completely mistaken.<br /><br />This edition is full typographical errors.  Whatever program that was used to convert this to a Kindle book failed miserably and there was absolutely no editing.  It is also an older translation so it is not the easiest translation to read. Save your money and get the free Kindle edition or buy a hard copy.

I told one person on here who bought the BestBuy CD I am talking about,\\"Hope you didn't spend the $20.+ for this cd with extra tracks as I just bought it now on the BestBuy website for $13.99+tax. Don't get duped people, I love Amazon just like you all but I can't imagine spending double the money for the same cd.\\" So, before you spend a little less here, try looking at the BestBuy CD off BestBuy.com & possible pay a tad bit more but get 14 songs instead of 11 plus a cool 3d case to boot!!

B008220DIC|2.0|I have liked or loved all of Paul Thomas Anderson's movies up until this one.  Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, Magnolia, Punch Drunk Love, and There Will Be Blood were all great.  This one, however, just didn't do it for me at all.  The acting is the only thing that saves this from a one-star rating.  The pacing was horrendously slow and it lacked the witty dialogue and humor of Anderson's previous films.  Kevin Smith, an over-rated, one-note director, once trashed \\"Magnolia\\" for being boring and pretentious. This, coming from the director of Mallrats, Clerks 2, Jersey Girl, and Cop Out.  I figured Smith just didn't get it and was jealous of Anderson.  Had he made those same comments for this movie he would have hit the nail on the head.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This a great game! I find myself playing every day and trying to get all of the goals met. Lots and lots of fun
0525952926|2.0|Let me say first that I enjoyed the first book in the trilogy immensely. Characters were well developed and interesting. The history behind the various characters was well researched and applied in just the right amounts. A lot of time and effort went into Fall of Giants..<br /><br />Not the case with Winter of he World. Instead of a well crafted novel, this definitely impressed me as being a rush job to meet a publishers deadline. Shallow characters, too many convenient solutions to situations, and rather weak story lines.  Where Fall of Giants was entirely plausible, Winter left me shaking my head in disbelief.  I would have been far happier had Follett cut down on the number of characters and developed the remainder and their stories more fully.

B000B589JI|5.0|It holds enough fuel for a full refill, should you ever get that low on fuel. And if your a Zippo owner like me, I make sure I fill up. For me, no leaks. As for the dangle stuff attached, much could be improved : (
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I think they could have gotten really clever with this. But sadly they didn't. I mean 70 gems for rarity I can understand since she loves gems and all but 90 for RD doesn't make sense. I think it would have been clever if for the main characters you have to earn them with different stuff. Like do so many flying games for RD, gems fir rarity, Money for AJ and so on. But as it is they for the most part just want your money. So if you love mlp get it. But be warned it will take forever to win it. Plus you need to gather friends and if your like me and don't know many bronys it will be that much troublesome.
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|Decent watch. Felt very much like a western, which I appreciated. In the end it delivered and I was entertained.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I listened to this CD  for 2 weeks straight, no lie. It's very Fall Out Boy lyrics, just a little more pop punk than before.
B005LAIIQC|1.0|The advertisement said I would receive a double disk set: one blue ray disk and one DVD disk. I got the blue ray cover with one blue ray disk and no DVD ( just one disk) . The cover printing said it contained a double set. that is what I saw in your ad and that is what I thought I was purchasing.
B003KRGCTI|4.0|this movie is about a future after nuclear disaster and fallout which affects the entire earth. it was interesting to see the director's image of what such a future might be like.
B0051OZ564|5.0|It is an awesome movie I love the way the movie was made and the storyline was a great one as well
B006BDHAX0|2.0|This is addictive and I don't get things done as I play it too much.  Then when I did beat all the levels the status said I did not have them all done.  Also the game quit frequently.  It did not respond to the touches I made on the matches.  Then I had to quit and come back to it later.  Frustrating!
B001DTPZNY|4.0|Well.......it's better than the second film.<br />Loved the score by John Williams.<br />A big thrill seeing Karen Allen again (easily my favorite of all the Indy women); she looks fabulous.<br />And.  Uh.  Well.  It could have been worse.  My first objection came with the killing of the guards at Area 51.  Done off screen, how old fashion (a notch below hearing the gunshot, clutching one's chest, and falling over, no blood).  It seemed a cowardly route to go, killing without the fuss or muss.  But killing just the same, so what's the point in hiding it?  Then there's a squad of KGB that manages to infiltrate the US......on a communist visa no doubt.  Better dead than red!  The flying fridge was problematic, the landing(s) alone would have killed him, fridges are not padded on the inside.  (This isn't even the first fridge refuge I've seen in a movie!)  The five minute conspiracy crap went nowhere fast, why was it included then dismissed so quickly?  I laughed when the aptly named Mutt was introduced as a Brando wannabe, looking more like a five year old playing dress up.  I can't be the only one who thought LaBeouf looked silly.<br /><br />If you turn off your brain, watch the movie at a slant, eh, it could be worse.  As a whatever-happened-to reverie, the sentiment did get to me.  Loved the ending after all the Sci-fi nonsense left the planet.  Honestly.  Two giants in the Sci-fi business and this is what they came up with, skulls that look like rejects from the Alien props department.  We can't use these, maybe George and Steven can.  Waste not want not!<br />Cartoony quality aside, there was enough mandatory action/adventure present to make it serviceable.  If you just take it as a quest, it's not that bad.<br /><br />Wile E. Coyote called; he wants his cliff jumping car returned forthwith.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|Only half-way through the book, but as a woman (and a mother) who's been in the workforce for over 30 years, I can relate to so many of the stories the author shares of her struggles to successfully maintain a marriage, family and career while navigating through gender-based obstacles. To all of you young women coming up through the ranks -- this is a very worthwhile read. ``Sit at the table,'' and be confident that what you bring there is of value and worth sharing.

GET THIS APP you won't regret it, i promise!
B000IZXR20|4.0|Jeepers Creepers is a straight-forward horror movie with a more intimate feel than the typical Jason/Michael unstoppable supernatural monster antagonist chasing around teens trope. It focuses on a brother and sister who have the unfortunate luck of crossing the path of the bad guy, who is convincingly frightening. The siblings do their share of dumb things to get all of the mayhem kicked off and proceed to partake in a tense cat and mouse game with what appears to be an unstoppable force of nature. The movie is fun, tense, and handled well enough to never become insulting and the ending is particularly surprising. See, Jeepers Creepers actually builds the siblings' characters up enough that you kind of care about what happens to them. They are not just the proverbial meat market of cliche weekend camper killer bait.  So, at the end, you are invested in what happens to the two of them, which is a factor that is missing from a lot of other films in the genre.
0345529057|5.0|Normally I read non fiction / autobiographies / history. To pick up a novel ( actually 4 of them!) is exciting and fun! The books came as promised and I am very happy. I already started reading and since I have seen the HBO series from the beginning, the book feels like a terrific filler of great background information that I can apply to my whole GoT experience!
B00C8RFRNI|5.0|This movie is compressed version of multiple terrorist events over the span of almost 10 years some of which is based on first hand accounts. Some parts are thrown in \\"For Your Consideration\\" to add fictional drama. As if the real life parts aren't dramatic enough. By the end of the movie, the main character, Call Sign: Maya aka Killer had been working for \\"the Company\\" for over 12 years in gathering information on the World's Most Wanted terrorist.<br /><br />Warning: This movie contains violence and \\"Adult Language\\".<br /><br />Many thanks to my friend for giving me a copy of this movie. To anyone who has already read [[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]], you will be clued into who the main character of this movie is in relationship to that book. If you don't catch it first, it will be made clear as the story unfolds.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|Pathetic writing with dull warmed-over acting. Don't bother watching now if you feel you must see it.  Wait for it free on Netflix so you won't be so pissed having spent good money AND your valuable time on this crap.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|Great book. Followed the movie pretty accurately, going into even more depth. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B00AG297GK|1.0|I thought some of this movie was funny but for the most part, I didn't like it.  It didn't hold my attention for long.  My bf thought it was hilarious.  I'm glad it was free on Amazon Prime.  if I had to pay to watch this movie, I would have been upset!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It's nice to see the local area information I love the guys that I watch and trusted a lot from Asheville's channel weather  when they were here...

B000VHXD7O|4.0|Great movie. This movie informed me of the Navajo culture and its contribution to WWII. Go see it. It's worth it.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Great app! Makes math homework much easier, and is so simple and quick. Perfect and would not change a thing.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|Maybe it's the beautiful scenery or the beautiful clothes or even the beautiful people, but I have watched this movie 4 times and never get tired of it. The story line is only okay, but I do love the haunting music of &#34;What'll I do&#34;.  And I'm sure I will watch it again.

B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is a great game. You can build new worlds, make amazing murals out of blocks and try to survive monsters at night. It is a great game to show your creativity. However, my one problem is that the kindle minecraft updates come out later then the ipad or ipod minecraft. I am eagerly awaiting the 7.0 update which my sister(who has an ipod) got last week. Overall, I think that minecraft is a great game that requires kids to use their creativity rather than being a mindless video game.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Like the game but wish it had full mode,,, it's interesting and wants you to keep going and searching for more worlds
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Read a lot of reviews saying they didn't like the fact that there is going to be another book , I say bring it on!! Loved all the drama can't wait to see what else unfolds how many other skeletons rear their ugly head.. True love will prevail!!

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Okay, I just finished this book and was expecting a crappy book after reading the reviews!  I do not believe that this book deserved the poor ratings it got!  Most of the complaints that it ended poorly!  I don't think it did!  I can't wait to read more of Gideon and Eva!  I feel like I'm going to get the whole story and not a rushed version of it!  The only part that I truly hate, is having to wait for the next book!!  Please hurry with the next book!!!

B00005J9PB|4.0|I JUST DISCOVERED THE HARD WAY THAAT ONE MUSST LOOK VERY CLOSELY WHILE BUYING DVD'S OR RISK GETTING A DVD NOT MADEE TO WORK IN THE USA..I PURCHASED TANK GIRL BECAUSE IT IS A COOL CULT FILM BUT DIDN'T SEE THE NOTICE THAT IT WOULDN'T WORK IN THE USA (SO WHY IS IT BEING SOLD IN THE USA). IT WASN'T TILL I GOT IT HOME AND TRIED PLAYING IT DID I DISCOVER WHAT WAS GOING ON. DESPITE THE SELLER GGIVING ME I FULL REFUND OF $7.93 I STILL HAD TO PAY HIS $3.99 SHIPPING CHARGE AND THE RETURN SHIPPING CHARGENWHICH TOTALED MORE THAN THE MOVIE.. MY POINT IS WWHY ARE THESE OUT OF COUNTRY DVDD BEING SOLD IN THE USA AMAZON.COM ? I THINK THE NOTICE SSHOULD BE CLEARLY MARKED IN THE TITLE OR A SEPERATE WEBPAGE TELLS YOU THAT THIS IS A OUT OF COUNTRY DVD  BEFORE YOU PAY FOR IT SO YOU ARE MADE AWARE THAT IT WON'T WORK OVER HERE.. FELT ABUSED
B004GYY714|5.0|I got this app for my Kindle a couple months ago, and I LOVE it! Tons of listening options, and if you pick a particular type of music, it also gives you tons of suggestions for similar stations. Love it!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Easy way to catch up on walking dead. bought dvd's season 1 and 2. then streamed season 3. Would rather have a hard copy, but I wanted to catch up and the program is addictive.
B009NY43NY|1.0|As another reviewer put it DEA is DOA. The only reason this book wasn't a DNF (did not finish) for me was that I really wanted to mark the series off my list so I wouldn't be reminded of it. Serious problems in this book. I know it's the author's story to tell, but the book had more problems then me just not liking the way it went. (1) In book #13 characterization is pretty well set so WTF was with the majority of characters acting completely OUT OF CHARACTER just to fit this way to end the story?! (2) Whereas in the previous books we've learned to put up with all the day to day activities that have NO relation to the plot, but seriously did we need two different pages of her detailing the spam e-mail she got?! (3) Fairies banned (4) Wolves banned (too scared to come around (5) Vampires banned What's left? (6) A cozy mystery that is solved by the paranormals randomly showing up to TELL the clue they saw or to use their supernatural power to act as a plot crutch.  I got this book from the library. I am so glad I didn't pay for it. I am also so glad I never have to read this author again.

B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game.  It is challenging, but with so many possibilities to get through a level and such funny little creatures I never got too bored or frustrated.  I plan to go back through to finish getting all the crowns and can hardly wait for the promised new levels.  My husband is also addicted and he usually shies away from puzzle games because they frustrate him too much.  Instead I hear him chuckling at the puddings' funny expressions.  Fellow D&D enthusiasts will understand why he calls the big puddings gibbering mouthers.
1781162646|5.0|Made me feel like I was 12 years old again and reading one of my favorite summer juvenile mystery books (i.e. Hardy Boys, Three Investigators). Stephen King hits a home run with this one with a light mystery that has just a little of the horror that makes the book an enjoyable read.  Having worked in a Theme Park years ago (in the Haunted Mansion, no less) the story really appealed to me and brought back great memories. Even though he treats the featured park more like a carnival as opposed to an amusement park  he paints a believable setting for a great mystery that is just scary enough, but not over the top horror that he uses to a degree that has turned me off in the past (i.e. Duma Key, Bag of Bones).  This is Stephen King at his best when he relies on storytelling to carry the book just like he did in the Colorado Kid, the Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, and the stories from Different Seasons. . All of the characters are well developed and I found myself caring about the protagonist in the final confrontation. The only thing that was a negative for me was his continuous assault on religion and guns with a secondary character that does not really figure into storyline, but what can you expect from an unapologetic dyed in the wool liberal.  With the exception of some sexual encounters, I would say that the book would be fine for young teens. I read the book in one night and enjoyed every page. Thanks for the summer treat, Mr. King
1401917186|5.0|Hi There,<br /><br />Doreen Vitrue, is a God send for having the courage of discovering this phenomena. By also exploring its implications for those of an open minded inclusive spirituality. Some may scoff thinking this is more &#34;wishy washy&#34; New Age hippy nonsense. However those of us who believe in reincarnation coupled by the mysterious &#34;Will of the Creator&#34; this is a topic of introspection. Doreen, herself explains she is still mapping the various classifications with hybrid groupings that are yet undiscovered. She credits her Son in aiding her with some of the work in discovering new groupings of souls.<br /><br />My only criticism isn't with the book itself. It's with the size of the book, which it was small coming in at 185 pages for the text itself. However this is a 2nd edition copy where she states she's added additional material from her workshops on the topic.<br /><br />For myself under her categories as stated in the books. I come in as a: Mystic Angel, slash Knights Paladin with Fairy Elemental.

B00B7Y0206|1.0|I just got this app and I was really excited about it cause I love youtube. But when I opened it, it wouldn't open and this letter thing popped up and asked if I wanted to send the letter. the letter went on and on about how it didn't work. I do not reccomend this app to kindle fire users. But it might just be my kindle problem.
B00005M1Y2|5.0|Great product, fast service. I love the movie, and love the character, and love watching the DVD with my daughters.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|this was one of the scariest and shocking films I've seen in a long time, and I love scary movies, not a good one to watch by yourself at night lol
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Outstanding present.  Our great grandson loved it.  Others adults at the party who's kids had received Bruder trucks commented very favorably about the quality and durability of Bruder toys.  If you have a child that is bulding a fleet of trucks, this is a welcome addition.  Also, we opted to go with high impact plastic from Bruder because the truck will be used outdoors - metal trucks from other brands such as Tonka tend to rust when used outdoors.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Smart and moving, without sap.  All the elements of a great love story and insightful too. I'm very glad I read this book.
B0050OMJIW|5.0|Excellent.  One must accept that it is satire and parody.  The use of language is exceptionally good.  I would recommend this to any sophisticated reader.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love the gameplay. Although some complain about losing all your data, you need to link the game to Facebook so that your park is saved with your account.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Best series ever! Acting is great, scenery beautiful, overall a fascinating recount of a very interesting time period. Glad I became a fan!
B002C949KE|2.0|This book suffers from the typical poor reasoning of many non-fiction these days. He presents experiments to justify his ideas and then talks about his ideas affect the broader economic policy picture. The problem is that his experiments often don't justify the points he is trying to make, and he often overstates the effect of his points on the broader economic picture.<br /><br />It's not all bad, or I would have given it one star. Some of his experiments aren't bad, some of his discussion of the boarder economic picture is interesting. But even when you agree with his experiments, you really have to wonder if his standard sample of MIT undergraduates is really representative of the economic behavior of the rest of the country.<br /><br />In the end, I would say 80% of this book is not worth reading. For the full review, check out becomingwellread dot com.
B000HF6XKO|2.0|Too hard to follow...timeline was confusing...skipped back and forth among many locations. It was difficult to tell where the scenes took place at times. I expected more from such a solid cast...
B007PF7MGS|5.0|Dr John McDougall must be the Dean of doctors who actually prescribe life style changes for life style diseases.<br />&#34;The Starch Solution&#34; pares the solid science down to the core, and shows you the way to a healthy body and, in a very real sense, a healthy planet. All you need to do is switch to a starch orientated diet.<br />The beauty of the book is in the ease of understanding. I'm a longtime vegan and reader of books on nutrition. Dr. Colin Campbell's &#34;The China Study&#34;, Dr. Neal Barnard's and Dr. Joel Fuhrman's  books grace my book shelves, but if you're looking for a condensed summary of the science with an easy to follow guide to a life changing diet, than this is the book for you.<br />Although I'm definitely a fan of reading the science behind these diets, I'd say the real strength of this book is the meal planning and the ease of following it. You won't go hungry on this, and whatever your dietary goals are, you'll meet tham with this book.<br />Essential reading for anyone interested in their health and the well being of animals and the planet.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A beautifully written biograpghy of  an outstanding  personality.  I highly recommend tris book.  Ir shows  the  hidden aspects of  starting and running a company, I ended tris book being a wiser and therefore moré understanding human being.

B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|This movie was not as advertised; 4 stars. It was so predictable as to have no drama, even though the subject was certainly dramatic and it was, I think, a true story.  Its the kind of movie I might watch when there is nothing else on one of the zillion cable channels that was any better, I would not have had to pay for it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|wow. if I had a nickel for every time I said that to a book, I would be rich. I can not wait until the next book comes!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is a great show and I can't wait to watch season 3 and am certainly looking forward to season 4 in January.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|The reason is because the other charger for the charging stiled charging my.

Amazon told me to get this one and it works perfect now
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Finally got around to watching this series. Too bad it did not last longer. Looking forward to watching through the remaining episodes.
B000J10ER4|1.0|The disc isn't read by any dvd player that i've tried.  Get a different company if you can.  The movie I've seen before and I loved it, so I was dissapointed that it didn't work.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Wow really? One of the worst book I've ever read! What a rip off. Simply taken advantage of. Sylvia Day needs her ego brought down because she is obviously too full of herself.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I would definitely recommend this game. I enjoyed the brain challenging puzzles. The game overall kept me engaged and forced me to really think about the riddles and such. Once you get an understanding of how things work it gets somewhat easier but still challenging. It was a bit short for my taste. I wish it had a bit more story plot and maybe cut scenes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have to admit that I face difficulties while playing. However it is enjoyable and my common pass time. I highly recommend this to others in search of a hobby.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really like weather.com and this app is basically just an extension of that. It is easy to use and user friendly. The only problem I have with this app is that when I use the 36 hour forecast the temperature is displayed in Celsius instead of Farenheit. I do not know why it is that way, I have is set to F, but none the less in that view it is always in C. Other than that though I love the app.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I like to read about what is interesting in other countries.  It seems that we in the USA are always interested in what is happening in Great Britain, and to see their view of us!  Thanks!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Cutting edge during the time it was made - pioneered the special effects we take for granted these days.<br />Episodes written by some big names in Sci-Fi business.<br /><br />Great character development and caste.<br /><br />Only the orig Twilight Zone is comparable.
B006T4NQNO|5.0|This saved my camera from breakage.  I was disappointed like the others when I received a plastic adapter instead of the aluminum.  This fits great and allows an easy switch of filters.  I always keep it on the camera with a UV filter. My camera fell 5 feet onto a tile floor, lens first; the UV filter exploded and the adapter ring broke & snapped off.  They took the entire blow from the fall, if it was metal, most of the shock would have been taken by the camera lens.  I don't have any damage to the camera.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I got this book about a week ago and it has helped more then I would ever expect and it didn't cost me a fortune. It explains how to eat the right amount of calories, fat, carbs, fiber and protein based on what your trying to accomplish wether it be losing weight to building mass with examples on what you should be eating of each. It helps with problems you might be having if your gaining too much weight or not losing any based on what your trying to do, like cut carbs or eat more. He breaks down what all the nutrition you see on food labels does and suggests what to eat and what to avoid. I'm not really into reading what percent of carbs, protein, fat etc.. are on labels but that is were a lot of people run into problems and don't see results. I thought I was eating the correct stuff but didn't see any results from my hard work of training. I started be eating based on one of Mikes examples and was eating more then before and losing weight, its all in when you eat and how much of each protein, carb, fat etc.. you should be eating. This book will also save you a lot of wasted time doing your workouts longer then necessary, it can cut workout times while giving better results. I use to do cardio for way longer then I needed to with no results and after reading this book I can now do cardio and lift weights in the same amount of time while getting the results I'm looking for. In the book Mike gives you workout to fit anyones schedule wether it be 3 or 5 days a week you have time for. The book gives you the best exercises to do to get the best results but if you want to change it you can still see results just not as quickly. I would recommend this book to any beginner looking to get help with there diet or build muscle. If you want to have more time in the day to do other things besides sitting in the gym yourself a favor and get this book you will be amazed at how much it helps get you on track. Mike also doesn't push to use supplements but rather get everything youneed to succeed with food you can get at store and it doesn't have to be from a health food store. If you need a protein bar or supplement for whatever reason he has some suggestions but only if you really need to. Mike is also there if you need to ask him a question about any problem or suggestion he might have about what can help you succeed with your goals. I'm sure I forgot to mention something and if I think of anything that would help I will update. Thanks Mike for all your help and responding when I run into any problems.
B0036UMM84|5.0|I loved &#34;A Star is Born&#34; when I was growing up and I still love it today. Barbra Streisand is a great producer. She and Kris were prefect for the rolls. Yes I cried! So! I'm not ashamed to admit it. You watch it and see if you don't cry : )

B002U5HKZ6|2.0|Mr. Roberts has a great way of writing: easy to follow dialogues, challenging, apt vocabulary, and vivid imagery. The storyline itself, based on the author's life, is full of brutal violence and vulgarities, peppered with philosophical, albeit somewhat esoteric chapter outros, which felt like they were meant to soften the nature of the criminal activities the main character was involved in. A plethora of characters, detailed cultural descriptions, and interweaving plot lines make for a lengthy reading commitment.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I thought there was only going to be 3 books in the series, not that I'm complaining, but Sylvia has other plans. The ending was very abrupt and left me more pissed than anxious for the next book.<br />I've enjoyed 1-3, as much as I have the Grey series-don't let me down Sylvia, kelp writing!

B00CW665VI|5.0|I adored this book. It is told in the male POV and truly had me laughing out loud. I routed for him the whole time. Even when he was being a little too honest. It was a great read, a great laugh, and a great romance. A very refreshing way to tell the story altogether.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This type of shoddy, pathetic excuse for a book, is what happens when authors and publishing companies get greedy.  I would be willing to bet that the reason the release date was pushed back was because, this series was supposed to be a trilogy, but the author figured with how well the book was doing, why not screw people out of some more money.  All she had to do was keep her word and finish the series and she would have had a huge fan base for all other works that she did, but she saw the dollar signs and decided that that was more important than making the fans happy.  If I could get my money back on all of the books I have read, I would.  Unfortunately, I am out that money but I learned a valuable lesson.  I learned that if you cannot trust the author's word, then wait for the whole series to be out to read it; if you can wait for the whole series to be released to read it, then it more likely isn't worth it.  It is sad to see another author lose a majority of her fan base because of their love for money, then again, with how popular the books were/are, I am not surprised that it happened.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A good third book in this pulsating love story.  I love Sylvia's books and this one does not disappoint.  She ties up some loose ends and dangles some more ends to lead us into Book 4.  I'm already looking forward to Gideon and Eva finding their way to a happily-ever-after!

B009JZTOG8|5.0|There isn't much worth watching on TV these days.  That is why we no longer have cable and have chosen Netflix and Amazon instead.<br /><br />When we came across Once Upon a Time Season 1, at the suggestion of a family member, we couldn't wait to watch it.  As soon as we finished it we were searching for Season 2 and found it on Amazon.<br /><br />This is a family friendly show with a twist on the classic Fairy Tales.  We watch it with our, almost, 9 year old son.  He loves it and has no problem following it.<br /><br />It may not be suitable for the very young, but when you compare it to what's currently out there you can't go wrong.  We hope more shows will be made for family viewing.

0399159347|4.0|I can visualize Liane Moriarty \\"drawing\\" a complex framework interlacing three perspectives when she created this plot.  Based on fate and the whimsy of her characters, she crafts a sophisticated soap opera without insulting the reader.<br /><br />Her main characters are forthright and far from stupid.  Set in Australia, indicating a major difference between Sydney and Melbourne, Moriarty's story is fun and has a Big Reveal.  I will not give the denouement away in this review.<br /><br />Cecilia, Tess and Rachel have distinct personalities and the author has their lives crisscross to justify her plot and the title of the book. An envelope lost amidst tax records, ultra-organized Cecilia discovers THE secret,  \\"For my wife, Cecilia Fitzpatrick To be opened only in the event of my death.\\"<br /><br />Connecting the lives of these complex women is what makes the story successful and interesting.  Their personalities are extremes:  Tess is thrown a life-changing obstacle when her husband tells her he has fallen in love with Tess' best friend, Felicity, who happens to be her cousin and business partner!<br /><br />Cecilia is the successful Tupperware salesperson who really earns a good living and is married to John-Paul and has three daughters.  She dotes on the daughters; she is friendly to everyone and can start and end a conversation with even the most troubled souls, an example is Rachel. She is a smooth operator, hence her success with Tupperware.  However, she is thrown for a loop when she discovers the letter and her husband panics via a long-distance call from Chicago. He returns from his trip three days earlier which shocks Cecilia and opens the reader's mind to something slanderous or life-altering. The title of the book becomes more powerful.<br /><br />Rachel's daughter was murdered as a teen-ager and would now be older than Cecilia.  Moriarty portrays her as a severely angry and bitter widow.  She resents anyone who has a solid family life and is obsessed with Janie, her murdered daughter.  The identity of the murderer remains unsolved.  Her only solace is her grandson, Jacob, but he is now moving to New York with her son and her ambitious daughter-in-law, Lauren, whom she resents.<br /><br />And then there's Tess, the smart, shy, young mother of Liam, who upon hearing about her husband Will's love for Felicity packs up and moves to live with her mother.  What I found most hilarious is Will and Felicity's expressions of guilt and their insistence that they had not made love, as if that justifies their disloyalty!<br /><br />The novel is about fate and Moriarty explores betrayal, forgiveness and one's conscience.  The novel went on a bit too long for me and became somewhat tedious.  However, the female characters stand tall with the complex views of redemption and punishment.h Janie, her murdered daughter.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Seriously?!  I pre-ordered this book in October 2012, waited and waited and waited, only to be left hanging?!  Call me silly, but when I was in school, they taught us that the word \\"trilogy\\" meant \\"three.\\"  When did a trilogy become 4 or 5?  When I was 65% through the book and saw that issues weren't really being resolved from the first two books, I didn't worry.  When I got to 80% of it and saw that NEW [flimsy, I might add] issues were beginning, I started to get worried.  When I made it to 100% and saw that there is not one, but possibly TWO, more books coming, I started screaming obscenities.  I spent $9.99 on this book!  Get it together, Penguin Publishing!  I can see spending $2.99 on a never-ending series, but come on!!!  Fifty Shades reached a resolution in three books, why can't this?!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Looks easy but u have to really think ahead for this game. Wish u could change sounds on it.<br />Jwarden003@nc.rr.com
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I was disappointed that I didn't get to see this one in theaters. However, watching it on my laptop brought the same intensity that I was hoping for. This movie was a true thriller. Many of the fight/chase scenes lasted for ten fifteen minutes and truly evoked that 'on-edge' feeling that you get when you almost feel that you are in the movie yourself. When Bond gets hit, you grimace; When he goes for some ridiculous stunt, you clench your fists and scoot to the edge of your seat; and when the scene finally comes to an end, you let out a sigh and feel your heartbeat slowly return to normal.<br />I would definitely recommend this one to other Bond fans. If you're like me and you're always up for a good action thriller, this one is sure to please.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Amazing writing, impressively detailed costuming and sets. One of the Best Series I have ever watched. I will be sorry when it ends. It is hard to imagine someone will create another series that can match GoT exceptional quality.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|I give New Girl 5 stars for its arc from Season 1 into Season 2. Season 1 introduces you to 5 fantastic characters that peak your interest and keep you coming back for more. Zooey Deschanel brings charm and adorableness to her role as Jess, but the show as a whole revolves around the hilarious situations she gets into with her three guys roommates - making this a show that shouldn't be judged just because it has the word &#34;girl&#34; in the title!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Reading a percentage figure is definitely better and one can make a more precise calculation as to when recharging will be necessary.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I give Season 1 of New Girl 5 stars because of its arc into Season 2. However, the second half of Season 2 becomes a force to be reckoned with due to a dynamic change within the show, excellent acting, and a VERY well written plot line. The wit and humor found in New Girl can be enjoyed by everyone - don't let the &#34;girl&#34; scare you away guys.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Actual reviewer rating: 3-1/2 Stars<br /><br />If you want scenes with a lot of hidden objects, then you might be disappointed because that is not the premise of this game.  You hunt for objects that are needed to reveal easy-to-medium difficulty puzzles.<br /><br />Great or excellent?  No.<br />Relaxing and enjoyable?  Yes.<br /><br />You can not ask for much better at a price point of $1.25.  You could could spend that on a candy bar and it is gone in 5 minutes, while this game lasted roughly 3 - 4 hours.<br /><br />The story is there, but not very in-depth.  The graphics do not stink, but they are not over-the-top.  Point recognition is slightly lagged, but no where disruptive to game play as other reviewers have cried about.  I encountered zero glitches as some other reviewers reported.  I think that most people with complaints of game functionality actually have problems with their tablets.<br /><br />If you get this one I hope you enjoy your time as I did.

0786939532|4.0|Wonderful character!! Delves DEEP into Drow society. Sets up perfectly for the next book. Some of the spots in this book are a little tedious. But knowing it's basically setting up for the rest of the series allows you to give it a little wiggle room. And Salvatore is nice and sums up 30 years of Drizzt's life. All things considered, this book is required reading for fans of Fantasy. And definitely for people wanting to start this series. Start here!!

B008673ZAQ|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book. How did we go from 3 books to 5 all of a sudden? And why write this part of it? The author dragged s*** out like crazy and like many others I began to skip over the sex scenes. I mean really? Who has sex like that? And that much? Its unrealistic. And if youre sex life is that crazy then maybe less is more and delayed gratification is the way to go. Also, revisit and revise? lol 50 shades steal.  The author really had something going with this Nathan murder and it died down really quickly. I'm debating on not reading the next two. Just doesn't keep me interested.

B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|TDPDH is not what I'm willing to call a &#34;bad album.&#34; It has the harmonizing vocals that roll and whale with the guitars, a sound that we've all come to expect with Alice in Chains through the years. That distinct sound is well in place, and anyone familiar with their work will immediately recognize who it is. But there is something missing, something that I only now realized on the third listening of the album. There doesn't seem to be an ounce of anger lingering in this album.<br /><br />Now I hate to sound like someone who can only enjoy music that is produced from unhappy rockers, but at no point do the vocals cut loose. Sure, pitch goes up and down and has some variety through the songs. But it almost seems that so much focus was put on getting the sound just right that all of the rawness that made Alice in Chains so great has been completely wiped out. Please don't take me as an upset AIC fan. I enjoyed Black Gives Way to Blue. Of course I love their older work and would love to have more, but I realize that this is a different band and I'm okay with that. There is just a certain amount of soul that isn't found here, and it's an absence that I felt through the entire album.<br /><br />I enjoy the album to an extent. I'm not trying to pan them on this one. All I can say is that I find this one to be less impressive than Black Gives Way to Blue. You can make your own opinions from there on whether or not you should give it a purchase.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have been looking forward, counting down the day to Sylvia Day's debut novel Crossfire series no#3. And i was so disappointed with it. I finished the book in 2 days, with each minute hoping that something great and exciting will come up and move me the way book 1 and 2 had. The story had dragged on and on, which eventually got me frustrated. I now understand why this book only has an average of 3 stars. And needless to say, i don't think book 4 and 5 is necessary. It seems to me the author only wants to make a few more bucks from the series. I am not sure i will be reading book 4 or even 5. Just like some of the reviews said, we could be Done with You! And if i do read book 4, i hope i will find Gideon leave Eva. She is not worth it but made him more damage than he already is.

While certainly no expert now, I have gained a tremendous appreciation, reverence and awe for these fantastic birds.  The authors are certainly driven and this drive has without a doubt, paid off.  The story of these birds and what it took to learn even more about them is mind boggling.  Natural color on these birds makes any man made color pale in comparison.  Definitely worth your while.  Another very strong case for taking care of our wondrous earth and all its varied creatures and habitats.  Thank goodness for places like New Guinea and for people like the authors.  We all win with this book.
B0053O89KG|5.0|My wife and I love this show. One of the best on TV and there aren't many of them. This is what we watch when we don't want to wade through the other manure on the tube. Professional seller, quick service at a great price!
B001UG56ES|5.0|This movie is great and unique.  Its a great take on a drama/love story set in a rough and frightful Australian outback.  The cinematography is great
000744902X|5.0|I got this Field Guide for a Birding trek to the UK, & have found it to be extremely informational, well-illustrated, lively text, & very well researched!  This is a classic & very enduring practically.  Dr. JBW, USA
B009G78EE2|5.0|I have bought very few albums that were solid all the way through. This is one of them. When I first bought it I listened to the heist all the way through while at work at least once a day for a month. I would recommend you consider the deluxe extended version which includes several other tracks.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Super easy to use! It's just like the calculator I used in grade school!! I recommend this app, it's fun!
B005DOL0R0|4.0|I got this along with a kindle paperwhite and it fits pretty well. I had seen reviews complaining about how the cases for the paperwhite were heavy or awkward. So I decided to go with a travel sleeve instead. This was the most reasonably priced while still being good quality.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Although the camera work is sometimes rather amateurish, this is a must watch if you care about our planet.  The havoc wreaked on the people of Wyoming (and other places) is unimaginable and downright disgusting.  It's got me investigating solar heating for my home.
B008CX2A2I|4.0|Does the job it has to do. My apartment is not bis so the coverage is good. Saves me from having to connect the pc to the receiver by wire.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Addicting game! Worth the time to play. I love the constant income feature. Excellent game overall. Good for all ages.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love it.  i like how it has all the different types of birds and all of the levels. love
B009MYARIK|3.0|I LOVE most of Sphie Kinsella's books. This one was far from her best, but it had its moments. If you like her other books then you will probably enjoy this one as well.
B00821OX98|5.0|I had not watched this before,, now I hooked,, great acting and special effects are awesome. So glad Season 2 is on Prime.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Has lots of features, and now a calculator is one more thing I don't need to keep around or find.  Great free app.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have loved every Sookie Stackhouse book; Charlaine Harris stayed true to Sookie through them all.  I don't want to include any spoilers, but it really did end the way it should.  Not the way I wanted it to, but with choices made that were pure Sookie.  Thank you Charlaine Harris for many hours of wonderful reading.
B008133MDK|4.0|Just keeps getting better can't wait for the third season to see what Will be next,the shows just how<br /> Talented the Twitter are.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book is lacking a story.  Very disappointed I was looking forward to a great story.  Not sure i will buy the next book on its first day out.  I will wait to read the reviews.  This was an expensive ebook, clearly money not well spent.
B00499QUK2|4.0|Love the actors, they bring the characters to life. Love the way the story line's almost follow the books keeps one guessing what will happen next .
B0043JDUNS|5.0|It was easy to purchase online and use on our blue-ray player.  I will use Amazon's online videos in the future.  It's affordable, and the streaming quality was great.  As for the movie itself, I enjoyed it.  I only see a few movies a year, and I'm glad that this was one of them.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a really fun game. It's for all ages! I recommend this for everyone and it is free. The instructions are really simple and the graphics are awesome for a free game like this. I did not expect that.
B00BMT9C84|3.0|they have great chemistry as mother and son. it was worth a watch. now only five more words left to write
B005TBN3EU|2.0|maybe because i had high expectations and this movie didnt live up to them. Hangover 2 had its funny moments. But, it just doesnt compare to Hangover 1. It also came with a digital copy. However, I had to sign up to Ultra Violet and Flixter to obtain the digital copy.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Started out good story ended up with to much blood, too much cursing. Could have made the wolves more realistic and not as &#34;demon&#34; wolves.
B000WQW988|5.0|The DVD is well worth owning even if you already have the CD.  You get to see the whole concert not just what made the CD.  Great price too!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Very good reboot of the Batman character. Based in part in Frank Miller's Year One series of the beginning of Batman. Easily one of the best Batnan movies to date.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Fun puzzle game. Quite addictive. Not too hard, not too easy. It's very different to cut the rope, less of timing challanges, more about puzzle solving.
B005KCTQSK|5.0|I love listening to her so much I got this CD for the extra tracks. So worth it. She<br />has such a pretty voice.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Dont get me wrong the book was hot but thats about all that stayed true to their relationship. Gideon, my sexy powerful man was wayy too much in the beginning of book,he was soo cheesy, and since when would eva not consider marrying him-its rushed really, you need to develope yourself first? Most of this book's storyline coulda happened in book 2, and then the end of the last book where he confessed is what would've saved this one. you've had a yr to write this :p Boo!
B00542USJW|4.0|I watched this movie when I was a little girl and now showed it to my nephews and they loved it!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Combined with a search on the web for Lincoln movie vs truth, you get a really great look into the politics and personalities of the day. It's not a riveting thriller - we know how the story turns out - but it's still good story telling. Is this how Lincoln really was? Who can say...but the acting is terrific and I can imagine my view of Lincoln the man will be much affected by Lincoln the movie.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|the gratics are amazing and you have great control over the airplane and the raidar is as acuret as a missile lock.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Good story line but one of the harder games.<br />I hope the next one is a bit longer.<br />I enjoy the G5 adventures.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is the best game in the world. It is really addicting and once you are on you can not stop playing it. I would totally recommend this game to anybody who loves games.

B00BTYP6QE|1.0|this app was very disappointing to me. The first four levels are fairly easy. But level 5 appears to be impossible unless you spend real money.if you are not prepared to shell out cash, don't bother to download this.
