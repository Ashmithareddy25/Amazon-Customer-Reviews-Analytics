B005HSG3TC|4.0|I bought a Timbuk2 case for my Kindle so it would have complete protection when I carried it, but I also wanted a cover on it for when I was using it just to help prevent scratches and dirt build-up. I picked the Marware Lightweight cover so my Kindle could still fit inside the Timbuk2 case with the cover on. It is a tight fit but it works. The Marware cover is exactly what I hoped for. The Kindle fits very snugly inside, and I enjoy using the elastic band to open & close it securely. It has openings on the edges as needed for speakers and charger plug-in. These openings do allow dust to gather there, which is another reason I'm glad to have the Timbuk2 case. I think this slim cover is as close as you can get to the lovely feel of a \\"naked\\" Kindle in your hands while still providing some protection.<br /><br />My only complaints are that the soft inside of the front cover is a real lint-collector. I also find it difficult to stand up but once I have it in the right spot it stays up well. I do wish it could stand up vertically as well, but not enough to make me buy a different case. This case is getting heavy use from me and holding up well so far. If the slimmest of covers is what you're after, you will be pleased.
B0063GORYU|5.0|addictive and fun. one of my &quot;go to&quot; apps on kindle fire. very user friendly; advertiments are easily skipped and are not bothersome, in fact, the advertisements are for other free mobilityware games which are also quiet.entertaining. I prefer this to regular old solitaire. certainly worth getting this game.
1451648537|5.0|I thought this book provided great insight into a prodigiously gifted and deeply flawed individual. He did things that perhaps no one else could, but he wouln't be fun to have as a boss. I thought the book was well written and entertaining.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|'Mahjong Artifacts' is in the format of a traditional Mahjong pc game with a twist.  As the Challenge progresses, the # of tiles increases, and the tile designs change. IT could be confusing but I find it a challenge to discover which tiles can be paired, which tiles the 'power' tiles work with.  I highly reccommend this to older kids and adults with an eye for details helps.
B002BWP49C|4.0|If you're a true Twilighter and have watched the series from the beginning, this movie does NOT disappoint. It's been very satisfying to watch the characters develop and grow over the series and Kristen Stewart's performance was the most impressive in Breaking Dawn Part I. The CGI effects were equally as impressive and made you believe in what you saw. This movie showed the most emotional pain from both Edward and Jacob and you can definitely commiserate. This was the first time I actually teared up from watching their raw emotions pour out from the weight of what they had experienced. The internal, muffled monologues of the wolves was a bit confusing and hard to differentiate at times, but then it was true to the wolves in general. They all have to hear each other thoughts and that must be, at times, confusing and loud. If I had one negative comment about the movie it was the choice of songs in certain scenes. Every now and then the music chosen didn't quite fit the calmer energy of those scenes. The music could be a bit too \\"up beat\\" and energized in places. The flow of the movie was well done and the over all attention to detail was appreciated. The ending was perfect, as expected, and leaving you hungry for more....Breaking Dawn Part II, coming this fall.
0812992792|2.0|After reading the review hype of Johnson's book I was very keen to get my hands on this book. The potential of fascinating material of covering life and love in an enigmatic North Korea seemed endless but I am now well past my criteria of 30 pages for a book to captivate me ... and I am anything but close to being captivated.  Need to persevere but methinks the end result is going to be abandoning the book as a lost cause.
B0078N2MTE|4.0|I've wanted to see this little indie film since in came out in 2011.<br />For the most part I would call it a success.<br />Your enjoyment of the movie will really depend on a multitude of factors.<br />Do you like slow burner movies?<br />Because this one is SLOOOOOOOOW.<br />Not much really happens during the first hour or so.<br />I don't want to give anything away story wise.<br />But the whole thing is about a middle America family man who starts hallucinating about a coming storm (apocalypse) of sorts.<br />Is he sane or is he going mad?<br />I loved the special FX of the storms and the birds.<br />The acting was superb.<br />The pacing as I said was incredible slow and may turn off many viewers.<br />The only reason I'm knocking off one star is because of the ending.<br />....SPOILER...........<br />This would have been the perfect movie where the ending should have been left open to speculation.<br />Instead it all wraps up into a neat little box with everything explained.<br />Still....a good movie worth checking out.
B00001QEE5|3.0|well the product arrived on time and in good condition, however it was not quite what I remembered of Peter Pan.  I do not remember Tinker Bell being such a brat. I guess I was a little naive.  But I don't want my girls to start acting like that so we don't watch it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are so many different games- I love it! Having the games hidden from view just makes me want to keep playing to unlock them ALL!
0800141806|5.0|I must lead a sheltered life. I've never known anyone with AIDS. It's a disease that I read about or I see clips about it on the news, but I've never knowingly had a close encounter with anyone who actually had it. Along the same line, I've never known of anyone who was HIV positive. I'm sure there are such people I've mixed with who were positive, but nobody ever said anything. I guess most people would probably keep such information to themselves;<br /><br />In any case, my Ross Stores bargain-bin DVD movie for tonight was \\"Philadelphia\\" staring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. Hanks played a brilliant up-and-coming lawyer who was dismissed by his law firm because he was suspected of having AIDS. It turned out that he did have AIDS, but he was illegally fired because that ailment is protected under the disabilities act. Ultimately, the case got to court with Washington acting as Hanks lawyer. It was a very interesting case. Very well done, I should add. Tom Hanks received an Academy Award for Best Actor, and he earned it. I suppose most movies would be considered to be entertainment. Philadelphia was much more. For me, it was educational. I think that everyone could benefit by watching this film.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B006T5FDLG|3.0|This EP is rushed and it shows, songs are left off of albums for a reason.  This EP is nothing more than Metallica trying to get everyone to forget the disaster known as LULU.  This EP was obviously the brainchild of their management doing damage control.  It didn't work.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is a wonderful, easily accessible adventure game.  It doesn't last very long but it's great fun while it lasts.  I can't wait for the next Fire Maple game!
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|How is it possible to make a movie this lack luster with so many good people in it and so much obviously put into it?  This Conan isn't Howard's Conan, but it could have been worth watching.  I only made it about 45 minutes into it before stopping.  I wasn't disgusted with, just wasn't really into it.  Oh well, back to waiting to see if anyone out there can do Howard's Conan justice (I'd also settle for Bran Mak Morn.)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun game once you start getting things unlocked. at first it isn't that great, but once you get a couple pages unlocked its great!
0439023513|5.0|I just got done with catching fire and can not wait to read this book the final one. I feel that when i get done with this triolgy i will be sad inside because they are such great books and i am very pleased with them. I'll just need to find another book after this.

1595825045|5.0|This book turned out to be so much more then I thought it would. The art that went into Avatar: The Last Airbender was so amazing on screen, and this book is the perfect way to show how it came to be.

B00632HWOG|1.0|kindle fire says there is a newer version of Yahoo mail and wont leg me proceed past the point to install this update. but when I try to install it keeps saying there's an error when downloading. I download other files no problem. currently all I can do is log in via web browser. useless and annoying.
B000063UR2|5.0|The DVD is new and in excellent condition. The package was delivered in excellent condition and in time. I enjoy watching this movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy and simple.  Just how solitaire should be.  Lots of fun - I have spent far too much time playing it, which is a good indication of its value!
B004UHSB5A|1.0|No scaling for a tablet - no options - poor UI - drag zone too restrictive.  In short - not worth it even for free.
0446563048|5.0|While I come from the nonprofit sector this book really resonated with me. The idea of building a business with a vision beyond profit is inspiring. I loved the focus on people and culture. It was a very quick read thanks to Tony's informal writing style.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Maggie Smith: the queen of the droll bon mot is absolutely the highlight of an already excellent series. Proof positive to Hollywood that \\"vintage\\" actresses are to be sought and given the best roles, not ignored in favor if silicon plastic actresses with drug and alcohol addiction issues.<br /><br />Julian Fellowes' gift for mixing comedic moments to balance the heavier moments is refreshing in the vast wasteland of telly. The overarching theme of how WWI changed the world of society and social classes profoundly and forever is not lost either.<br /><br />Well done, Maggie and Julian. The rest of the cast is entertaining too but Queen Maggie is my favorite. After watching it on telly I canna wait for the vid to arrive.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is a little laggy but does everything it is supposed to do. it runs in the background and doesn't seem to use too much ram, just slow opening and changing screens.
B006ON41FC|5.0|good game, lots of fun for kids and grownups.  good graphics and sound.  Nice game play,  program functioned well on Kindle Fire.
0880796863|4.0|This is my first Tarot set. It seems pretty good and I am glad it came with a guide. However, the book is very small and a bit hard to read because the font is so tiny. Overall, a good buy, but expect to strain your eyes a little if reading the guide. :)

B007BLCGNU|2.0|I have another 24 hours on my AIV rental, so I'll probably watch this again, but...I am disappointed.  The constant flip flop between the younger and older J Edgar (complete with Brando-ish stuffing ala Godfather) was visually distracting for me.  I'll admit that I don't know a ton about J. Edgar; I'm upset that I don't know any more about him after watching this movie.  Shot with lots of subdued tones, I liked one scene where the amber glow through a lampshade added additional color.  Later on in the movie when Nixon's inaugural motorcade drives within view of J. Edgar's office window, there is a similar flash of color in the drabness of the scene thanks to the flags.
B004UHSB5A|1.0|This game is the worst game of dominoes I have played. it doesn't even give u the points when you win them. do not download this game, as it is a waste of space.
B006ON41FC|5.0|If you love temple run, you're going to love this game! You can even buy power ups! Its so addictive
B0070Z4M4I|4.0|After the dismal critical reviews I opted not to see the theatrical release. I'm sorry I listened to the critics. My son rented it recently and I have to say it was a decent movie. Much like the original in many ways but with some interesting differences. And to me the ending meshed very well into Carpenter's version.<br />Bottom line if you like horror/sci fi and you liked Carpenter's The Thing, you will probably like this prequel as well.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|This game reminds me of a flash game literally like it on the internet. Its very in depth stratagy I would recommend using the HD layout instead of standard on a kindle fire if you have one, but all in all a very good $1.00 spent.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app, intuitive one touch moves make it fun and easy to use. 14  15 16 17 18 19 20
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I love this movie and would recommend highly. Good family entertainment without nudity and lots of curse words. I mainly got this movie to watch on my new Sony 3D tv, and WOW, it looks absolutely fantastic!!  Excellent, very entertaining movie.
0307888908|5.0|I found this book to be very helpful.  The landscape of the job market is shifting and changing at an alarming rate.  This book is about techniques you can use to adapt to the changes.  A large part of the book is about using networking and social media to advance your career.  I enjoyed the stories and examples of real life people who have used the principles in innovative ways.  Highly recommended!

B001S86J0I|5.0|This is a great movie to have in your permanent collection.  Always good for lots of laughs! The movie came quicly and I have no complaints at all about the service.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Solving history's mysteries by playing ancient mahjong boards wouldn't be the worst way to earn a living. The story is fun, and the boards are creative. I enjoy the ability to adjust the level you play at.
B004JVXTL8|4.0|i enjoyed this movie and would say if you enjoyed the first one you wold like this one as well
B006ON41FC|4.0|great game and fun but it runs really slow and choppy on the HTC evo. smooth it out and I would give it five stars
B003XQG0JI|4.0|bought this for my wife as she is  a fan of the corr's and so naturally wanted this cd when she heard one of the member's was doing a solo album. she enjoyed the cd

B0049VZ2UY|5.0|this is a great tv show and not for kids,i recommend this to any one that likes zombie's  or any thing gross
B001OQCV2O|5.0|...this will be a sci-fi classic watched over and over.<br /><br />2001 was trashed when it first came out. Starship Troopers, Armageddon, 2010, so many others...were all given poor reviews when they first came out. All became insanely CLASSIC flicks watched by sci-fi fans every time they appeared on cable.<br /><br />This movie is no different. Fantastic, and I mean FANTASTIC (if not totally science correct)special effects ROCK in this film. Don't let some of the cheesy Hollywood type theatrics (ending) get in the way. There are so many big names in this film that make this film fun to watch. Everything except the kitchen sink is thrown in to make this movie one of the best `end of the world' films ever made. The Woody Harrelson scenes (as the lunatic who transmits live as Yellowstone explodes) are eye-popping (and the spot where he pulls his pants up to cover butt crack when the caldera finally blows is a nice comic bit). I love the Chinese working faster and more efficiently to create immense life boat arks....makes a sideways slap statement about the USA lacking the ability to respond to disasters in the current world environment. The Tibetan mountain scenes, the destruction of L.A. the west coast cities sliding into the Pacific Ocean, the pyroclastic cloud taking out Las Vegas while CG, are done so brilliantly, the destruction of Washington D.C. and the Vatican....so graphic they look real. By the way, Cusack is excellent in this flick. So is Danny Glover as the U.S. president who goes down with his country (crushed by an aircraft carrier atop a HUGE tidal wave). Oliver Pratt plays a great A-hole politician, and George Segal tugs the emotional strings.<br /><br />You've all seen the movie by now. My review is years late, but I just wanted to put my 2 cents out there. Watch this for the incredible special effects, especially in HD, with 5.1 sound (7.1 is WAY better). While I watch this over and over on the FXHD channel, my blu-ray version is so much cleaner and sharper.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I like this game becuase it requires hand eye coridnatition and i like squirrels a lot and it is a cheap
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is totally addicting. Great game. Helps me chill out and relax. I like that I can change the card faces and switch between 1 and 3 cards dealt

B006ON41FC|4.0|This is a simple and fun game. Good game for kids and adults alike. No problems encountered. Works great on my Droid X2
B006M4F67A|4.0|I enjoy mahjong and have played a lot of different ones, this is one of my favorites.  Its an easy challange so it relaxing without being.g boring. I would saying its worth the purchase.
B004UHSB5A|1.0|It took. me two minutes before. I got frustrated and removed it. Dominoes way too small and hard to figure out.
B005HSL626|4.0|I got it on my kindle fire Twice and it crashed again but I love the game so much I must uninstall it then install it again and as soon as I am about to get the shadow blade,  it crashes.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|The Nyko Zoom sounds like a great idea to make the required area of play smaller for the Kinect. Many people don't have tons of space in their gaming area. The problem is that if you aren't standing directly in front of the Kinect+Zoom combo it loses you. Then when you center yourself again, it has a very tough time figuring out where you are and accurately tracking your movements. I experienced this playing Kinect Adventures where you do a lot of lateral movement and the zoom severely limits the Kinect's ability to track me moving side to side while playing.
B0007TKH66|4.0|I am a Star Trek geek.  Not a costume wearing one, I just enjoy Sci-Fi and I would rather watch this season one set than watch what is on TV today.  Overall I thought this was a good start to the series and I enjoyed most of the episodes on the disks.<br /><br />I thought the characters in the series were played well by the actors but I felt the actor who played Reed was neither the best choice nor the best acting job for the role.  I found him annoying in his defeatist demeanor and whining.  (Shuttlepod One for example)<br /><br />There are several storyline issues but to me the most glaring were the Temporal Cold War and the race called the Suliban.  I found it odd that the writers introduced two totally new aspects to the Star Trek saga that had never been mentioned in all of the past shows.  Wouldn't all of the other shows have brought up a past race of aliens, especially one that tried to destroy the Federation almost before it ever got started?<br /><br />Nevertheless I still enjoyed the episodes and had a lot of fun just watching anything related to Star Trek that was good.  I won't review each episode as so many people have done it and it would just be repetitious to do so.  I felt that overall there were more good episodes that average ones and there was only one I didn't care for. (Fusion)<br /><br />I did like the story line regarding the resentment of humans toward Vulcans for holding back their efforts in space travel and constantly telling them that we were not mature enough to explore the galaxy.  The resentment level made the series more interesting as the crew strived even harder to stand on their own and be successful.<br /><br />If you are a Star Trek fan get this and watch it.  You will enjoy it and just considerate it as entertainment.
B0078JRFZE|5.0|I love the show & can't wait for the new season to start. I love seeing how the British aristocracy lived; the period clothing, beautiful scenery, etc., are fascinating.
0061438294|5.0|Incredible reading material.  Informational, easy to understand, and apply in everyday life.  Highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to truly be aware of their surroundings.  Really makes you think about what you miss on a daily basis before unlocking this knowledge for your personal use.  You get a great sense of what folks are telling you, both verbally and non-verbally via expressions.  What I found most interesting is that my father always told me about looking at a person's face but never explained the other parts of the body.  You miss 99 percent of the true non-verbal expressions by only focusing on the face.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I never played this before, I downloaded it because it was rated high and wanted to try it.  it took me a few times to figure it out. now that I know how to play I seem to be drawn to it every day. I say to myself, just one game, then it turns into two, then three.  addicting? no. but definitely more challenging then regular solitaire.
0143119680|1.0|Possibly the most boring book I've ever read.  Harkness sacrifices plot in order to describe, in detail, the minutiae of a mundane and sexist \\"romance\\" between two characters who are extremely unlikable.

1416583408|4.0|Well, I haven't finished it yet, but it's a very wordy sort of read. It's a very contradictory book.  I have noticed at least 5 contradictions, and I'm only on the 63rd page! First she talks about the rain coat and the reaction of apparent submission  (Pg. 18 and 19), Then on page 59 I think it was, She remarks on how dogs are not a pack oriented group. She also talks about how dogs should NOT be punished when found being bad, she says wolves do not act that way. Ummm Unless I'm going crazy, she says a couple of pages later that dogs are decidedly NOT wolves. \\"Different in every way\\". Odd.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|The old app (splashtop 1) was amazing. Hands down my favorite app of all time.<br /><br />Ever since I \\"updated\\" to Splashtop 2, I can't even use the damn thing. First off, upon installing splashtop 2, I suddenly have to give Splashtop my email address. Why is this even necessary? I get enough unwarranted emails as it is, I don't need another company trying to sell me stuff I don't want.<br /><br />Secondly, after I created the account, it now tells me that my account DOES NOT EXIST. This stupid new \\"feature\\" made the app unusable. Why on earth would a developer throw in trash like this on an otherwise great app?
0307956350|4.0|interesting spin on spy-assassin-housewife novel... not really an action-packed thriller, but an expounded, slow-paced drama that builds to a finish with a twist<br /><br />i enjoyed the book very much - kudos to the author for a well-done first effort!<br /><br />the last half of the book almost reads like a 'women's' novel, but credibility remains in character due to the author's skill and plot pace<br /><br />took me about a week of short evening sessions to finish

B000ICL3KG|1.0|This film is based on faulty information. Many of the scientists who were quoted in the film (the UN's International Panel for Climate Change) later on stated that their quotes were taken out of context and without their permission. Also, if you simply google \\"Climate Gate\\", you will find out that many of the claims from this film are based on \\"facts\\" that have not been actually substantiated by real science. This is not to say that global warming is entirely imaginary, but it definitely is more of a political issue than a scientific one at this point, and this film is extremely biased and misleading. How is this a political issue?<br />Gore endorses carbon caps, which will hurt many industries, particularly in developing nations.<br />Gore does not endorse nuclear energy, which causes zero pollution and is much cheaper than wind farms- which by the way, have caused more deaths (by accidents) than nuclear power has in the last decade.<br />Gore ignores the impact of natural causes of carbon emissions, such as volcanic eruptions.<br />Gore ignores the positive impacts of global warming, such as the increase of Europe's population due to improved agriculture around the year 1000 CE (many historians/archaeologists believe this period may have even been a degree or two warmer than today!)<br />If you choose to watch this film, I urge you to take it with a big grain of salt and to confirm what Gore says with your own research. When our economy is horrible, if we are going to impose restrictions on industry, we better be basing it on scientifically confirmed information rather than on what is politically correct or fashionable.

B006ON41FC|1.0|I have purchased 3 items worth 4000 nuts each from the shop.  I didn't get anything for it.  My kids love flying the animal so I guess it is worth it for that.  Otherwise it is a waste because a lot of the features do not work and they link you to a game site without permission.
0307455874|4.0|I was very impressed by this book. I found it very well written, and nicely structured, with its individual chapters on the Constitution, Race, Family, etc.<br /><br />For a \\"political\\" book, it's respectful of both sides, and he's willing to admit problems on both sides, while making no apologies for being a Democrat. What comes through here is the sense that hard issues are hard for a reason, there aren't sound-bite, obvious \\"common sense\\" solutions that hold up to scrutiny, and that there are genuine heartfelt beliefs on both sides.<br /><br />I find myself wondering how Obama's ideals have changed, after three years in the presidency. Some of his policies as president (keeping Guantanamo open, extension of the Bush tax cuts) seem at odds with what he's written here. The book expresses an enormous amount of will to work on the areas in which people on both the left and the right can agree, and to me (admittedly on the center-left) it seems like he's in an environment where a substantial number of people aren't willing to talk to him in good faith.<br /><br />People who demonize Obama might benefit from reading the book. It is not a left-wing version of Ann Coulter. It focuses on desires that probably 80-90% of people in the U.S. hold in common, though they may have honest disagreements on how to get there. Unfortunately, people who demonize Obama wouldn't go near this book, simply because they demonize him. It's unfortunate, because he displays a much better grasp of the Constitution and the possible approaches to it than I've ever heard from the Right (and yes, he discusses Scalia's strict constructionist approach, and is nothing but respectful in that discussion).<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend it. And I'll probably regret posting this review.

B001O8C5EQ|5.0|It's hard for me to choose a favorite Porcupine Tree album. They're hard to compare because of the way the band evolved over the years and they all have at least one weak track that has to be taken into account and compared to the better songs. After much listening, however, I've decided that 1996's \\"Signify\\" is their highest achievement. Out of all their releases, it works the best as a singular piece of work, that is, an album rather than a collection of songs. I don't own it on vinyl, but I bet it's got one of those sicknasty gatefold sleeves that were big in the 70's.  This music exists in its own world, a trait it has in common with classic albums by Pink Floyd and Radiohead. The production invokes images of a place that's mostly black void, with objects and scenes forming and dissolving into and out of the darkness. A nightmare world, perhaps. There's certainly enough creepy to go around for it to be one. There is a handful of relativel conventional songs on the album (\\"Sleep of No Dreaming\\" and \\"Every Home Is Wired\\" come to mind), but much of \\"Signify\\" is devoted to soundscapes that, while not entirely abstract, aren't exactly grounded in reality either. These songs are fascinating because they take elements from 90's techno/electronic music and give them a progtastic modification by using rock instruments like electric guitar, organ and live drums. \\"Idiot Prayer\\", for example, is pretty much one-of-a-kind, with its angry, sharp guitars and oddly dance floor-friendly bass line. There are samples of a man who seems to be trying to describe a DMT trip. He has a short monologue at one point, and one snippet of him saying \\"Please help\\" that repeats throughout the frantic parts.  My favorite track here is \\"Sever\\", a song that I suspect is meant to be what insanity sounds like. There's a flock of garbled voices in the mix, which to me suggests that the narrator is schizophrenic. I've read the lyrics, and they don't appear to have a discernible meaning, at least notto anyone other than the narrator. Perhaps you've met someone like this, whose mental illness causes confusion in their thoughts and words. They're speaking almost nonsensically, but you think that there might be some kind of message they have that they can't articulate. A similar thing may happen to a person who's taken a large dose of a hallucinogen. Even the song's vocal melody has a not-quite-right feel to it. I find it hard to decide exactly what emotion it's conveying. Fear? Anxiety? A kind of demented exuberance? Sadness? It's really hard to tell.  Listen to this album in the dark.

B004UHSB5A|3.0|This game plays well with the exception of a few interface issues and glitches.  Tiles place accurately for the most part and I had no issues with tiles being too small to see on my device (Droid Razr).  Please read the instructions under Information in the menu; it isn't long and will help new players understand the strategy in this variant of dominoes.<br /><br />The UI works alright.  Tiles with playable ends are larger than tiles that are closed.  When too many tiles end up in one area they start to stack on top of each other.<br /><br />A glitch that I found: On occasion the process that makes the tiles stack causes the tiles to place incorrectly resulting in tiles having playable ends when they should not.  It can also be confusing as to which end is playable after the tile has stacked as you cannot see the tile beneath.<br /><br />If the UI interface were improved and the tile stacking issues resolved, I would give this app 5 stars<br /><br />*Device: Droid Razr

B005ELQVGW|2.0|Like a few reviewers here, I am a serious Bjork enthusiast who has enjoyed collecting her work and seeing her perform live for many years.  Much of her work has been a backdrop to important incidents in my life.  \\"Vespertine\\" is one of the greatest albums I've ever heard.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to the release of \\"Biophilia\\".  I had enjoyed the album \\"Volta\\" quite a lot - I thought there were some great songs there and some incredible instrumentation.  When I heard the first track of \\"Biophilia\\" (\\"Moon\\") I smiled to hear that lovely sound of the harp, one of Bjork's signature instruments.  \\"Moon\\" is a lovely song, with some lyrical moments that recall some of the most heart-felt Bjork phrases.  When she sings \\"Fail at loving, Fail at creating a flow...\\" your emotions nearly boil over.<br /><br />Yet this is the high water mark of the album.  As the rest of the tracks emerge, I have to say I was really stunned by how boring they were.  I had read review after review praising this album and I started to wonder if I'd actually bought the wrong version.  The arrangements of these tuneless melodies is so sparse and spare that there are huge gaps (almost like dead air) continually popping up in the songs.  \\"Thunderbolt\\" is a perfect example.  Academically, on paper, the song sounds fascinating.  But Bjork's usual finesse with lyrics in English is embarrassingly absent.  After she repeats the phrase 'Craving miracles' for about the fifth time, I'm cringing with how new-age and feel-good it all sounds.<br /><br />For all the hype about the various instruments created to be played on the album, the eventual sound is not fascinating by any stretch.  The combination piano/Javanese gamelon used in \\"Chrystaline\\" could just as easily have been created with a sampler.  This, along with the strange assertions that the album is a celebration of nature and science, doesn't become more than the sum of the parts.  Tossing a few lyrics about dirt, crystals and rocks into a song doesn't make it scientific... in fact, the opposite happens; it feels pedantic and cheesy.<br /><br />Lyrically, the album seems to make tons of references to a thread-bare metaphor of the earth / the body.  Vertebrae are rocks, etc.  This is an interesting area to explore, but Bjork has done this already in her previous albums.  This idea, being heralded as revolutionary, has been a consistent theme of painters, writers and musicians for hundreds of years.  She's not adding anything new to the idea.  Of course it isn't Bjork's responsibility to break new ground with each new album, but with all the hyped elements of \\"Biophilia\\", anyone expecting her usual quirkiness will instead be met with that really bad side affect of innovation: Pretentiousness.  For example, Bjork is at the point in her career in which she thinks she can carry a song only accompanied by a solo instrument.  This is the case with the song \\"Solstice\\", the closing track of the album, which is almost painful to listen to.  It is another tuneless track full of recycled Bjork's usual musical phrasing.  Her songwriting \\"style\\" overtakes her actual songwriting.  It's hard to end on a note like this.<br /><br />Bjork is also beginning to suffer from a fate similar to Tori Amos - she can't seem to stop playing \\"dress-up\\" (for lack of a better phrase.)  I think Bjork wants to be taken very seriously as an artist, and yet she's still donning tons and tons of make-up and the trappings of a community theater experimental dance troupe.  If she really doesn't care about such things, why all the theatrics?  The artifice?  For once I'd like to see her perform in jeans and a t-shirt and just be herself.  Perhaps she's finding it difficult to age gracefully.  If her work for \\"Biophilia\\" was strong enough, there would be no need for such extensive visualization.  I won't even start on the whole multi-format release issue.  Bottom line: No app is going to make a poor song sound any better.<br /><br />I had genuine interest in this album before its release. Since I've bought it, I've listened to it three times, and I've got no impetus to put it on for another listen.  There's nothing waiting there for me.  I can only hope that Bjork has a few more good albums inside her that she'll bring forth in the future.  Unfortunately, at the rate she's been releasing work, it will be many years before that happens.enuine interest in this album before its release.

B00000ILDE|3.0|The original Alien was a ground breaking science fiction that relied on mood and atmosphere to achieve its scares. Ridley Scott was smart not to show too much of the Alien, instead leaving its menace up to the viewer's imagination. The alien spacecraft is a masterful piece of design concocted by H. R. Giger, and looks appropriately otherworldly lurking in the ominous background of the alien landscape.  However, James Cameron took a different approach with the sequel Aliens. Like its predecessor the film is a triumph of industry design and technology. However, Cameron unlike Scott seems to be more fascinated in action and military hardware. This does not say that they are scares or thrills in the sequel, but as the movie moves along there is a lot of gunplay between the soldiers and the aliens. The film starts to look like one of those shooting games you play on the internet. Initially when you see the first alien it is quite a shock, but after hundreds have been blown away it gets monotonous. Many of today's action fantasies owe a lot to the pacing of aliens.  The most impressive thing about Aliens is the confrontation Ripley has with the queen alien. It is one of the last full sized mechanized monsters shown well before the CGI revolution. Its movements are impressive considering it was probably moved with electric motors. The final battle is impressively mounted and the Alien is dispatched.  To be fair maybe one should look at Alien and Aliens as two different films done by directors with contrasting styles. I prefer the more subtle approach of Scott, than Cameron's more action orientated direction. That said, it looks as if both films are already classics.
0439023483|2.0|Intially I wasn't going to read The Hunger Games, since it never quite caught my eye in the first place. And I also tend to keep away from things that get over hyped such as this. But after much coaxing from different  people and my older brother I decided to take a risk. Which now I  regret of doing. I hated everything about this book, from the writing to the characters, or maybe I should say character-Katniss.  For an awesome name she sure made a bland protagonist.<br /><br />Another ire of mine was the forced and somewhat absurd romance of Katniss and Peeta. I literally had to rolled my eyes at some of their interaction. Not to mention about the tributes turned wolves. After that I had enough.<br /><br />I think this could have been a great book if another author wrote it.
0439023513|3.0|I loved the hunger games trilogy, however I felt let down at the end of Mockingjay simply because I wanted more from Gale's character. You cannot tell me that Gale, someone who loved Katniss through all of the books, would just up and desert her to live in district two. His character seemed to just vanish into thin air for me. I loved Gale and followed him throughout the whole series and the let down would be less great if there were a fourth book in the series to explain all of the loose ends. Peeta doesn't have to win her over, nor does Gale; they both just seem to stop caring and Katniss just ends up with the one who follows her to 12. This book was VERY disappointing to me largely because I felt the other two books far exceeded this one in plot, character relationships, and most importantly the reader consciousness of the story. Half the time I couldn't follow what was happening because the story would just drop off and would be explained later, but then somethings were never explained! I ended the Trilogy with many questions that will never be answered. I hope that Mrs. Collins decides to write another book to this series I think it will help the reader's understanding IMMENSELY! Lovely books though. Enjoyed the adventurous read!

B001CC7PP8|4.0|Have you ever thought about upgrading a title in your movie collection because the newer version was remastered better?  What about the extra features---like the commentary, background about the movie or director, outtakes, longer scenes, choosing of the cast members, etc?<br /><br />I have to admit that PSYCHO was one of 5 Alfred Hitchcock Films I've never gotten tired of.  But this current version is in a class by itself.  IT'S EXCELLENT!<br /><br />A great digital transfer has cleaned up this nearly 60 year old film!<br />Start by watching the famous Hitchcock Trailer and the reissue trailer.  How many of you reading this knew that they concluded with Vera Miles in the shower and not Janet Leigh?  Once you've seen the restored version---continue on Disc 1 to Newsreel Footage about the Grand Premiere with Sir Alfred and members of the cast.  There are 2 segments concerning the shower scene, posters, theatrical notes and quite a bit of behind-the-scenes info.  You might want to revisit the film a 2nd time for Stephen Rebello's excellent commentary?  [Stephen wrote the book: \\"Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of 'Psycho'\\"].<br /><br />Disc 2 Begins with an excellent documentary on \\"The Making of Psycho\\". This is followed by \\"The Hitchcock Legacy\\", and one of the 30 minute 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' entitled \\"Lamb To The Slaughter\\" which stars Barbara Bel Geddes.  Even though I figured out the ending before the show was over, it proves that a good script, cast and direction never go out of style. [The cars in the episode are the one exception]. The only supplemental feature that I felt was weak was the interchange between Sir Alfred and Director, Francois Truffault.  Hearing each others questions and answers through an interpretor became very annoying after awhile. Granted they both were legendary, but I found their interchange VERY DULL! Personally, I wish TCM & Universal had skipped this entire segment and given us a 2nd (or 3rd) Alfred Hitchcock Episode instead?<br /><br />Overall...I liked it--especially the DVD cover shot of the creepy house behind the sign: BATES MOTEL! Booooooo!e DVD cover shot of the creepy house behind the sign: BATES MOTEL! Booooooo!

B004BSFC6Y|5.0|I got these for my own baby, but first used them with a visiting 3-month-old. She loved them so much, I have been buying them as a present for all my friends who recently had babies. Now my baby is old enough to enjoy them too, and loving every minute of it.  I agree that the socks have very little stretch and no shape (just a tube), but once they got too small for my baby, I just cut the rattles off and sewn them onto socks that fit. This way we can keep using them for months to come, and get to mix up colors too.
0786939532|5.0|When I think of The Legend of Drizzt by R.A. Salvatore, I think about many things. I think of all the deep and varied characters, all thoughtfully and creatively developed. I think of the amazing combative description, with soaring mithral scimitars and shrieking silver arrows. I also think of the vast and complex journey which connects all of this, and the world in which it takes place, from the frigid Spine of the World Mountains to the crowded streets of southern Calimport. But most of all I think of the hero, Drizzt Do'Urden (short for Drizzt Do'Urden Daermon'Nashezbaernon), and his eternal quest to escape the legacy of his heritage and discover the inner truths of the world. It is his quest, along with those of all he meets, that truly draw me to this series.<br /><br />  So first, I will discuss all of the characters that shape this tale and give it depth. One of the most interesting things about this series is the fact that characters, even minor sub-villains or characters that only appear for a single chapter or book, give the impression of realism often lacking in fantasy novels. When backstory isn't vital, it is still given or at least hinted at. While one might think that this could quickly make stories plodding and dull, the descriptions never overstay their welcome and are always intriguing. The story quickly and frequently switches between characters, creating multifaceted tales which intertwine in clever and often unexpected ways.  However, just as many times a character isn't an integral part of the main tale, and that allows for a background world that doesn't feel completely centered on the goals and aspirations of the major characters.<br /><br />  The combat is another one of the main draws to this series. Salvatore's style of portraying combat can convey all manners of emotion, from quick, rowdy tavern brawls to solemn and precise displays of swordsmanship, from high-intensity fights to the death to lighthearted and daring games of sparring. Theintense visceral action of broken noses, gashed arms, and even spines ripped straight from backs, adds an intensity and level of description most writers hesitate to explore. Detailed descriptions of individual combat maneuvers bring visualization to new levels, and inspire awe and respect of the grace and finesse (or raw power) of the combatants. The combat is also made more urgent, as Salvatore avoids the common pitfall of easy and readily accessible healing magic, which tends, in turn, to lead to less detailed and interesting battles. Besides, what's the point of detailing what happens if a quick incantation can nullify most injuries? Finally, I'd like to mention that the victories and defeats of this series are determined by the D&D combat system; the entire plot could change with one lucky (or unlucky!) roll of the dice, and Salvatore would have to cope. So for instance, if it weren't for one extremely improbable throw of a sword, the main (human) villain, the assassin Artemis Entreri might never have entered the Drow city of Menzzoberanzan. Salvatore then took all the statistical data and beautifully translated it into realistic and intriguing depictions of each and every adventure. The final point I want to touch up on is the magnificent world Salvatore Depicts. Though Salvatore himself didn't create the vast and varied realm of Faerun, he had to try to paint it as it was hundreds of years before it was created. Of course, some of this history was already in place, yet not so for the forgotten kingdoms, tiny fiefdoms, and ancient governments all of which were created by Salvatore's own hand. Places interact as surely as people, and everywhere in the entire world has its own flavor. Descriptions which paint the harsh, barren wastelands like Icewind Dale chill the bones; grand depictions of the silvery Mithral Hall, with colossal, raging furnaces to the brilliant rivers of ore flowing through the walls. Each location seems to have a life of its own, independent from the main story, as guilds rise and fall and powerful individuals struggle for power. All of these aspects combine to create an incredibly organic and fluid world, which feels much less mechanical than your average fantasy.<br /><br />  This series does a wonderful job of connecting you to the characters, but not making them seem overbearing in the grand scheme of things. The writing style makes for a multi-leveled and complex story, with plenty of great description and an appropriate amount of twists. Although the stories are full of subplots, they never dilute the main intent of the story. It takes serious looks at many themes and issues, including racism and innocence to experience. It's a fun and interesting read that has credible (yet unobtrusive) morals. Drizzt's adventures are beloved by many fans of D&D, and, in my opinion, should be considered a masterpiece of fantasy literature.

When I got home and pit in on the turn table tears of joy flowed from my eyes. I could not believe what I was hearing. I was only 14 but I knew (i played guitar) that this was something special. I immediatly starting playing for anyone that woud listen. I only wish I was older so I would have know to start going to every concert they performed. I didn.t go to my first VH concert until 198o.

B001N26GFC|5.0|This movie changed everything for me. I needed Poppy in my life. Honestly, I only initially watched the movie because I have a huge crush on Eddie Marsan. I quickly realized that this movie would be one of my favorites for many other reasons than a handsome driving instructor! Poppy is everything a girl wants to be: loving, compassionate, intelligent, funny, secure and most of all...happy. The movie takes you around her world and the people in her life and shows you how she pours love into those around her. It's humorous, it's sad, it's sexy: it's everything you'd want from a movie. The disc includes a segment in the 'extras' that has interviews of Mike Leigh (the director), Sally (who plays Poppy), Eddie (who plays Scott) and Alexis (who plays Zoe).  I think this was one of my favorite parts of the disc!  While listening to them describe Poppy and how Mike created her character and her world, I felt a huge respect for the movie and those involved. It was well planned, and it shows in the movie. I loved hearing the way they convey not only the characters, but each other. Their description of Poppy had me jotting down all of the adjectives they used: open, free, funny, generosity of the spirit, compassionate, a huge heart, a huge soul...happy. I truly hope that others see these adjectives in me. This movie inspired me. I wholeheartedly recommend it!

While not the best way of making new music, it does give us a Van Halen album that sounds like old Van Halen.<br /><br />It looks like they did the same with the album cover, too.  Look at the cover of A Different Kind of Truth, then look up the 1975 Commodores album, Movin' On.  I'll try to submit a side-by-side pic of both.<br /><br />The album sounds a lot like their third and fourth albums, Women and Children First, or Fair Warning - a lot of good sounds, but no obvious \\"hits\\" like either Diver Down or 1984.<br /><br />That being said, Tattoo is a good song that over time really grows on you.  Definitely a good choice for the first single.  She's the Woman, The Trouble with Never, and Outta Space are very good songs as well.<br /><br />Worth picking up if you're a Van Halen fan!

I was skeptical at first when my cousin sat me, mom, dad and himself down in front of the Blu-Ray player to watch this movie, but the movie had me at the first song. Even my dad, who is more of an action - beat the heck out of the other guy til blood comes gushin' out - type of movie watcher actually enjoyed the movie as well.<br />  The songs are very well sung, the costumes and over all theme of the movie is spot-on. I did not know that Renee Zellweger could sing and dance but I do now!<br />  Even the supporting cast was great! Queen Latifah (always a phenomenal singer, no matter what!) shined in her performance as the warden of the jail.<br />  I loved this movie and even if you are not a musical kind a person ... give it a shot. You just might like it! I find myself watching it over and over again whenever it comes on Starz, HBO, Sho etc.<br />  Hope that helps! Going to watch it now!  :)

1932100660|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone interested in their health. Seven plus years ago, I was diagnosed with advanced cancer. The doctors wanted me to have chemo and radiation. Much to the oncologist's opposition, I said, \\"No\\", because I wanted to be strict about a whole foods plant based diet. Now, after these many years, I am fine and in excellent health.  However, I am disappointed with a few recent reviews by people on this site who are being unusually critical of this book and these authors. They are saying nothing worthwhile and making nasty comments that show that they haven't even read the book. Dr. Campbell, senior, is a giant in this field of diet and nutrition. He's one of the most honorable and courageous men there is. As a long time professional, he has gone against big forces who have tried to keep this information from reaching the public. There's a huge amount of money and power involved in this business.  I understand that Dr. Campbell now has a new book in print named, \\"Control\\" I hope it explains about the control over this information that is kept from the public.  I think that these critics represent an organization (being paid by industry) who are willing to tell lies after lies. This book, written by Dr. Campbell and his son, Tom Campbell, MD, has helped so many people with medical problems. These critics should be ashamed of themselves because many people like me need this information. Without it, I probably would not be here writing this message.

B001CDLATE|5.0|Simply the most amazing cinematography I've ever seen.  The images alongside the music are breathtaking, and it really creates a unique perspective on life and how \\"it\\" interacts with itself.  An unbelievably accurate, beautiful expression of the word \\"Baraka\\".
0545425115|3.0|I first heard about The Hunger Games through the book section of the Globe & Mail here in Canada, which had a blurb given by Stephen King across a prominent ad. I didn't rush out to read the book though, just put it on my wish list and left it at that. Then, I saw the trailer for the film adaptation starring Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson, and that's when I realized I needed to get it over with and read this book. But after years of procrastination on my part and ceaseless hype on the part of those who published it, did it live up to my expectations?<br /><br />Set sometime in the future, civilization as we know has collapsed and in its place a new power structure has risen in Panem (what used to be North America), presiding over twelve colonies that all serve the Capitol. There used to be thirteen, but one city was destroyed during a civil war, and serves as a cautionary tale to the remaining twelve. Since peace was reestablished, an annual event airs on television. It's called the Hunger Games. Think of it as a macabre cross between American Idol and Stephen King's Running Man. And our protagonist, Katniss, a sixteen-year-old girl has just volunteered to enter, thus sparing her twelve-year-old sister from having to compete.<br /><br />Each of the twelve colonies randomly select one boy and one girl, between the ages of twelve and eighteen. After being whisked from their homes to the Capitol, they are lavished with every luxury imaginable during their training until they are all thrust into a remote landscape and forced to fight each other to the death until only one remains. Sounds like good watchin'. And it better be, because it's compulsory viewing for the colonists, as a reminder that rebellion will only serve to kill all their sons and daughters.<br /><br />For Katniss, the ideals of surviving to bring honor and glory, however fleeting, back home are a distant second to her longing to spare her mother and sister from seeing her weak and scared. She's spent much of her life providing for them in the wake of her father's death in a coal mine, and has become resilient and calloused in the process. In fact, aside from the selfless act of replacing her sister after the random drawing, Katniss isn't a terribly likable character. She's resentful towards her mother who had a mental breakdown after her Dad died, and is self-centered to a degree that's really irritating. Granted, her living conditions don't exactly lend themselves to a happy-go-lucky adolescence.<br /><br />The first half of the book spends time establishing who Katniss is and how she sees those around her, as she's plucked from her life and introduced to an Oz-like world in the Capitol. Peeta, the baker's son, is the other teen chosen to compete, and together they try to maneuver their way through ridiculous protocol and the stacked odds against them in training. As well, Katniss must weight how much she can trust Peeta once the games begin, because only one can be declared winner, and her paranoia has her questioning not only his every move, but her own as well. The second half of the book is all about the Hunger Games, when she, Peeta, and the twenty-two other teens are sent into the arena to fight. Here, things are really turned on their head, as Katniss finally realizes her hunting skills are the only thing that's going to keep her alive, namely her prowess with a bow and arrow. Unfortunately, the weapons are laid out as bait at the start of the games to encourage immediate confrontation, so Katniss has to settle for grabbing what supplies she can and hiding in the forest before one of the others kills her.<br /><br />The book is exciting for nearly the entire way through, with each chapter offering enough suspense and cliffhangers to make you keep turning pages. There are some aggravating aspects to the book, though. One of the big problems I had with the book was Katniss' evasion of killing others to survive. It seemed at nearly every turn, when herhand was forced and she had to defend herself, there was some kind of godhand stepping in to take care of the killing for her. I don't want to go into detail more than that, as that's spoiler enough I'm sure, but when other competitors are getting blood on their hands, Katniss seems to be surviving less by skill than by sheer luck. Another facet of the Hunger Games I didn't like was the idea of sponsors in the Capitol airdropping supplies to competitors at certain times during the games. Since Katniss and everyone else are being filmed by hidden cameras and tracking devices, their performances are used to garner sponsors for things like food or medicine or whatever the case may be. For Katniss, the little items that parachute their way were literal deus ex machina. Things are at their worst? Don't worry, here's that thing you desperately need and would otherwise die without it.<br /><br />That much I can ignore, but for me, the ending was just awful. This, I can't spoil, so sufficed to say there is something that happens towards the end of the Hunger Games that comes out of nowhere and just derails the whole story for me. And then--and I don't think I'm spoiling anything since this is the first book in a trilogy--after Katniss gets out of the Games, there is further annoyance to the \\"after show\\" and her attitudes towards other characters when things had settled down. I'm still looking forward to reading the second book, Catching Fire, but only because I'm hoping Suzanne Collins' plans for this story make up for the loose strings left in this book.re was some kind of godhand stepping in to take care of the killing for her.

B0052FG8KO|5.0|In Progress is absolutely the best hard rock album of 2011, of that there is no doubt.  If you are even remotely a fan of this style of uplifting, wind through your hair, and rocking music, then this is a must have.  Utilizing soaring vocals that are also expertly utilized as a harmony tool, a lefty guitarist that not only looks similar to Paul Gilbert he is of the same high caliber, layers of lush keys, and insanely sharp hooks, these twelve songs rock you up and down California.  And the funny part about that?  These guys hail from Sweden.  Even though melodies run rampant this is a guitar driven and hard rocking album.  Guitar pyrotechnics rival Eddie Van Halen with fluid lead solo runs and driving rhythms.  The majority of the twelve songs here are definite up tempo and foot stompers for sure.  These guys succeed their peers Journey in the sense that they limit the ballads to a few bombshells of melodic C4 rather than pollute an album with drippy cheese.  Opener The Rain sets the bar at an insanely high level and sets the pace for things to come.  This sums up everything that is great about this style of music and has to be heard to be understood.  Its weather related cousin, Eye Of The Storm, is a perfect example of the deftly executed harmony vocals the band employs.  Sorta like an old school doo-wop act, the backing vocals weave in and harmonize with the main vocal line often during the verses and choruses respectively.  There are harmonies everywhere on this album.  Castaway, near album's end, has the largest, most gigantic chorus of not only the album, but probably this genre.  Starting off with a backwoods-like acoustic guitar and jaunty beat, this then flirts with a detuned modern riff before launching into a grandiose symphony of harmony vocals in the chorus.  Once listened to, it's no surprise why this album has been raved about by everyone that put pen to paper about it.  For fans of melodic rock and AOR, this album is on par with Bonfire's \\"Point Blank,\\" Jaded Heart's \\"Trust,\\" Axxis' \\"II,\\" and Balance Of Power's \\"Ten More Tales Of Grand Illusion,\\" and should be a blind buy.  FOOTNOTE:  This version on Amazon is real deal.  I bought this version, the 17.99 one and it is the real cd on Frontiers Records not some lame cd-r.  Amazon has probably scared sales because of that disclaimer but it is not true.  Get it quick.  It's now out of print.

B000WQ9UA8|4.0|Back in November 2003, Britney Spears released her fourth studio album 'In The Zone' which was a masterpiece. That album is Britney's best album to date and is the album where she gets the most writing and producing credits. The same month of release, she already announced she was writing songs for her fifth album and was planning to start her own record label in 2004. Sadly, all of her plans slowly started being ruined. In March 2004, 'The Onyx Hotel Tour' in support of 'In The Zone' kicked off. 1 month after kicking off, Britney made her worst mistake to date: she started dating her dancer Kevin Federline. She continued to tour anyways, and it was one of her best tours to date and everything was going well until the news came out: Britney cancels the rest of 'The Onyx Hotel Tour' after a knee injury during the shoot for the video 'Outrageous'. All further promotion for 'In The Zone' was scrapped including the final music video for 'Outrageous' and the same song's feature on the soundtrack for the 2004 movie 'Catwoman'. The song was still released in July 2004, but it flopped since Britney wasn't able to promote it since she was recovering from the surgery they had to make to her knee. That same month, she made the other mistake: she announced her engagement with Kevin. During the rest of 2004, she married Kevin, released a greatest hits album including new songs including 'My Prerogative', 'I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)' and 'Do Somethin''. She was planning to release her fifth album in 2005, which had the working title of 'The Original Doll', but it was scrapped after she leaked an unfinished version of the planned lead single 'Mona Lisa' without authorization. As you can see, all of her plans changed and/or were scrapped and things could have been very different if her actions were different as well. In 2005, promotion for her greatest hits album finished and soon after she announced she was expecting a child with Kevin. She made a reality show called 'Britney& Kevin: Chaotic' about the stages of her relationship with Kevin, and the last episode featured the music video for her new ballad 'Someday (I Will Understand)' dedicated to her unborn child. The reality was later released in DVD and also included a bonus EP titled 'Chaotic' including the song of the same name (used as the theme song for the reality), the ballad and a finished version of 'Mona Lisa' that was supposed for inclusion in the canceled 'Original Doll' project. In some editions, another song called 'Over To You Now' was released which was a leftover from 'In The Zone'. She gave birth to her first child Sean Preston on September 14th, 2005. She went on hiatus after that, and released a remix album which didn't manage to make much of an impact. In February 2006, she announced she started to work on new songs for her fifth album and started from scratch instead of using songs intended for 'The Original Doll'. She then announced her second pregnancy and this meant no new music was coming during that year. She gave birth to her second child Jayden James on September 12th, 2006. On November 7th, 2006 she filed for divorce from Kevin and bad things started to happen. She was seen partying at nightclubs and hanging out with Paris Hilton and her behavior was highly criticized. Controversies kept going after the divorce and in February 2007 she shaved her head. She completed a rehabilitation program at Promises and was released the following month. The program wasn't enough for her, she kept the same behavior in public and controversies kept going. Her career seemed to be over. She then surprised us with a promotional tour called 'The M+M's Tour', and a new single called 'Gimme More' was announced a few months later. However, her supposed \\"comeback\\" performance at the 2007 VMAs was a disaster and was also highly criticized. Nevertheless, after all the horrible things she experienced that year, she still released her fifth studio album 'Blackout' on October 30th, 2007 and I'll review the songs now and add a conclusion at the end.  1. Gimme More - The album's first track and first single. The song that started this era and the song performed at the 2007 VMAs is actually an awesome song, the production is awesome and I really like it. I give it a 10/10  2. Piece Of Me - The album's second track and second single. This song talks about her relationship with the media and it totally rocks, an excellent choice for a single. I give it a 10/10  3. Radar - The album's third track. The song talks about Britney watching what her man does (stalking him). It was produced by Bloodshy & Avant who also produced her 2004 hit 'Toxic' from the album 'In The Zone', but I think it's not as good since her vocals are too processed. This song was supposed to be the third single but was scrapped after 'Break The Ice' was chosen, then it was going to be the fourth single but it was scrapped again since she was working in her then upcoming sixth album 'Circus'. It was later included in that album and released as its fourth single. I give it a 9/10  4. Break The Ice - The album's fourth track and third and final single. I used to really love this one but now it's just ok, it gets annoying sometimes. I give it a 8.5/10  5. Heaven On Earth - The album's fifth track. This is like a ballad, and it's a cute song. Britney named it her favorite song from the album and said it was really personal and meaningful to her. I give it a 9.5/10  6. Get Naked (I Got A Plan) - The album's sixth track. I really dislike this song, Danja is annoying and Britney's vocals are just ok. They both try too hard on this one. I give it a 1/10  7. Freakshow - The album's seventh track. Awesome song to dance, wish it was longer. I give it a 10/10  8. Toy Soldier - The album's eighth track. If something is worse than 'Get Naked' it's this song. Britney's vocals are so annoying and the lyrics are stupid, I hate it. I give it a 0/10  9. Hot As Ice - The album's ninth track. This songis so funny, it's impossible to take the lyrics seriously to criticize it. I give it a 9/10  10. Ooh Ooh Baby - The album's tenth track. This is my FAVORITE song on the album, despite the lyrics. The guitar is awesome and the vocals are awesome too. I give it a 10/10  11. Perfect Lover - The album's eleventh track. Another annoying song where she tries too hard, at least it's slightly better than 'Toy Soldier' and 'Get Naked'. I give it a 2/10  12. Why Should I Be Sad - The album's twelfth and final track. The song seems to talk about the things Kevin did while he was with Britney. I'm not a fan of it, it's just that the production really sucks and it's terribly weak, if it was played on the piano and Britney's vocals weren't so processed I would love it. I give it a 7.5/10  This was a long review, but it was necessary to add that information at the start since it was all those events that led this album to turn out like it did. It's not her best album and it has weak points, her vocals are also very processed, but it's a pretty good and solid effort and just like all of her albums it's significant in Britney's career. Believe it or not, Britney finally accomplished her goal with this album, she wanted to make a fun album and didn't want to get that personal and she did it, even with all the controversies and bad things around her, she managed to make the album she wanted to make. This doesn't end here, I'll make a review for this album's sucessor 'Circus' that continues this story and gives it a happy ending.

B0006FO8RA|5.0|Britney Spears released her fourth studio album 'In The Zone' in November 2003. It was and is the best album she has made to date and it was well received by critics. Just like her previous albums, it was heavily promoted by interviews, live performances and was later accompained by 'The Onyx Hotel Tour'. Everything was going pretty well for her, she was at the peak of her career. In June 2004, after finishing the 2nd leg of the tour she started shooting the video for the 4th single 'Outrageous' and injured her knee. Her knee had serious damage, so she had to go under surgery and this only meant the 3rd leg of the tour and the video had to be cancelled. It was a shame, since she was getting more and more popular and it was going perfectly for her. Jive Records released 'Outrageous' anyways but it failed to make an impact due to the lack of promotion. Britney started to have other priorities in her life, she wanted to marry Kevin Federline and start a family, so instead of resuming the tour and promotion for 'In The Zone' she decided to release a greatest hits album. She recorded new songs for the album and selected 'My Prerogative' (a Bobby Brown cover) as its lead single and called the album 'Greatest Hits: My Prerogative'. It was released in November 2004, but wasn't very well received by critics and it was criticized mainly because it was premature and Britney didn't have enough songs for a greatest hits album. Instead of reviewing the songs and say if I like them or not, I'll say if they deserved to be on the release or not (except for the new songs, those are the only ones I'll review) and give a conclusion at the end:  1. My Prerogative - The album's first track and first single. This is one of the new songs and it's a Bobby Brown cover. I love it, it has good beats and I really like Britney's additions to the song. I give it a 10/10  2. Toxic - The album's second track. As I've mentioned, I won't review the song itself since it corresponds to the album it belongs to, so I'll say if it deserved to be on the release or not. This song was a hit in early 2004, it was her biggest hit since 'Oops!... I Did It Again' and revived her career in the United States, plus Britney named it her favorite song in her entire career. This deserves to be on this album.  3. I'm A Slave 4 U - The album's third track. This song was the one that turned Britney's sweet girl next door image into a funky and nasty girl image. The song didn't do that well on the charts but for sure will be remembered as one of her signature songs and for the epic 2001 VMAs performance. This deserves to be on this album.  4. Oops!... I Did It Again - The album's fourth track. This song was a total success and is a Britney classic. She literally did it again, after hitting us with '...Baby One More Time', she did it again and hit us one more time with this classic and curiously the lyrics say \\"I'm not that innocent\\", maybe it was a hint that she would soon stop being innocent. This deserves to be on this album.  5. Me Against The Music - The album's fifth track. This was the lead single from 'In The Zone' and while it was a nice song to dance, it wasn't that huge and wasn't very important in Britney's career and only was a moderate success because it featured Madonna. This doesn't deserve to be on this album.  6. Stronger - The album's sixth track. This is another Britney signature song, everyday she becomes stronger than yesterday and this song proves it. It wasn't a top 10, but was very close to be one and of course will be remembered as a classic. This deserves to be on this album.  7. Everytime - The album's seventh track. This is a very personal and haunting ballad about Britney's breakup with Justin Timberlake. She wrote it together with her friend Annet Artani in late 2002 and was included on her album 'In The Zone'. When this album was released, it probably still was one of \\"the new songs\\" and didn't deserve to be considered as one of her greatest hits, butnow that it's 2012 it has become one of her best ballads. This deserves to be on the album (nowadays).  8. ...Baby One More Time - The album's eighth track. There's NOTHING to explain here, we all know this is a total CLASSIC with big letters. This TOTALLY deserves to be on the album.  9. (You Drive Me) Crazy (The Stop! Remix) - The album's ninth track. Everyone who was here during the 90s probably knows this song and loves it, but it's the Stop! remix that became so popular and was a top 10 hit, the original album version wasn't released as a single. This deserves to be on the album.  10. Boys (The Co-Ed Remix) - The album's tenth track. This was the last single from the album 'Britney' and wasn't a big hit actually, and back then it probably didn't deserve to be on the album. Nowadays, it's very remembered and Britney seems to like it a lot since she still sings it on her concerts. This deserves to be on the album (nowadays).  11. Sometimes - The album's eleventh track. We all know this song, and probably we were all surprised and excited when it was released as a single since her only song at the time was '...Baby One More Time' and we were wanting more. Britney has said she never liked this song, but she knows very well that this song was important in her career and more than songs like 'Me Against The Music'. This deserves to be on the album.  12. Overprotected - The album's twelfth track. This was the second single from the album 'Britney' and just spoke for itself at the time, Britney was overprotected and she wanted to change her image and do what she wanted. This for sure will be remembered as one of her breakthrough songs. This deserves to be on the album.  13. Lucky - The album's thirteenth track. A signature song for sure, now that Britney had a breakdown and fully recovered, people think this song was her cry for help. This deserves to be on the album.  14. Outrageous - The album's fourteenth track. It was so pointless to include it here, this WASN'T agreat hit (it wasn't big and it wasn't good). Back then it was totally dumb to include it and nowadays it still is, just because it was released a single doesn't mean it deserves to be on a greatest hits album, it should just be in a singles collection (like 'The Singles Collection' album she released later, which looked more like a greatest hits since it missed A LOT of singles including this one). This doesn't deserve to be on this album.  15. Born To Make You Happy - The album's fifteenth track (only in editions made outside North America). This is also a classic slow song, not much to say about it. This deserves to be on the album.  16. I Love Rock N Roll - The album's sixteenth track (only in editions made outside North America). This song was originally made by The Arrows and Joan Jett & The Blackhearts made it popular. It was later covered by Britney and released as the fourth single from the album titled after her name. While people do remember this cover, it's not that popular and Britney never sang it live after the 'Dream Within A Dream Tour'. This doesn't deserve to be on the album.  17. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman - The album's seventeenth track (fifteenth in editions made in North America). If it wasn't for its lyrics, this wouldn't deserve to be here, but this song was made in a time of transitions for Britney so it's important in her career. This deserves to be on the album.  18. I've Just Begun (Having My Fun) - The album's eighteenth track (sixteenth in editions made in North America). Another new song, so I won't say if it deserves to be here or not. This song actually wasn't recorded for this release, it was recorded for 'In The Zone' but failed to appear on the album. I'm glad they included it on this release, because it's awesome and her vocals sound really funny. I give it a 10/10  19. Do Somethin' - The album's nineteenth (seventeenth in editions made in North America) and final track and second and final single. This is another new songsand this time it was recorded for this release specifically. It's not my favorite actually, but I like its video and I feel proud that Britney co-directed it and convinced Jive to release it and do what she wanted. I give it a 9.5/10  Overall, I think this is an excellent Britney collection. While some songs could have been left out, it still deserves a 5-star rating on Amazon. I have the international version of the album, so that's why it includes 'Born To Make You Happy' and 'I Love Rock N Roll' while the North American editions don't. 'Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know' was included in the UK, Japanese and Australian editions of the album but I think it should just stay in those since it was bigger outside North America. This album is also offered in a limited special edition that includes a remix CD, you could check it out if you wanted to get \\"the complete package\\" and also check out the DVD titled the same as the album, it includes her videos. The standard edition comes in a jewel case and includes a booklet with a prologue by Jenny Eliscu about what she had done until then, some interesting photos from the photoshoots she had done and a list at the end with her discography and DVDs released by Jive. The special edition for what I've seen comes in a digipack, includes the bonus remix CD and the same booklet.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Like many others, I loved the first 2 books but this book fell short of even decent.  Some of the writing went in 3 different directions that I had to stop and re-read a few passages because I was lost.  I felt the middle to the ending were just horrible, did not like the way Collins just killed off characters and made a \\"heroic Mockingjay\\" become a diaster.  The relationships were crushed and a big vote at the end with who said \\"yes\\" was ridiculous, especially one person. I could go on and on but I won't but will say Suzanne Collins had a great 2 first reads, this one was written, to me, like she HAD to do it and got bored with the story so threw words down on paper to appease the fans.  It is a book for teens so as an adult, maybe what do I know?! I also hope they do not try to create 4 movies out of these 3 books because 2 movies for the final book would not make sense.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read about a quarter of Stephen King's works. Some (Hearts it Atlantis) are among my favorite books; others (Cell) were unreadable.  11/22/63 is up there with my favorites.  This novel is more suspense than horror, with an element of SCI-Fi mixed in.  It's a time-travel theme which takes you from King's familiar haunts in Maine today to Texas in the late-50s/early-60s up to the days leading to that fateful day in our history.  Like all of King's best works, the character development is excellent.  The story moves incredibly quick and had me hooked after by page 50.  It's a real page turner.  I also learned much about the events and people involved in the JFK assasination.  In some ways, Lee Harvey Oswald is a more horrifying character than one King could ever devised in fiction.  While I believe it is the earliest event I can recall in my past, I am amazed how little I knew about it.  While the ending could have been somewhat better and the SCI-Fi components dealing with time travel are hokey at best, I highly recommend it.  I also want to say that this was the first novel I ever read on an E-Book reader.  The Kindle Fire actually makes reading more pleasurable than hardcopy -- something I never would have said 5 years ago.

Obviously this game rocks on Kindle Fire! - Nice smooth graphics and fast response to touch.<br /><br />The game is free and Ads are minimal. The only downside is that you need to keep cleaning your Kindle fire's LCD screen every so often :-)<br /><br />Perfect game to test and see your reflexes as well has how fast your Kindle Fire is performing!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B0063GORYU|5.0|So much fun! It is my absolute favorite fun time consuming family gathering special moments you share game! O yes!!
B001IXXYBA|5.0|I remember watching this movie for the first time falling in love with all of it yet i kept on seeing it after that on local channels where they would cut out parts of the movie and dubb over the bad words the actors or actresses would say and it kinda ruined it for me then i saw that it was on here for a great price i just couldnt resist i had to have it and i love that song that plays when sam and molly are holding each other it makes me cry and i just wanted to add it to my other movie i ve got Black Dog with of course patrick swayze. In my heart from when i first saw him on screen with his busting moves in Dirty Dancing to when he was the cop in The Beast; he ll always be remembered for his finest acting skills and praised upon high yet he ll always be missed as well.
B006PTL1QM|4.0|Once again I find myself tracing my maturity. Carl Gustav Jung wrote 'The Undiscovered Self' a slim volume read in my early twenties. Sigmund Freud gave me the tools to understand dreams and to understand sexuality. Those tools are words. Those words are littered all over 'A Dangerous Method.' The ego, repression, libido, neurotic and biggest of all: freedom.<br /><br />Freedom is being psychoanalysed in 'A Dangerous Method.' A woman has her childhood pain revealed to herself through the talking method. She finds it liberates her sexuality. But it is the welcoming embrace of a dream job offer which really locates herself.<br /><br />A man who finds sex at any 'oasis' is battling with a man who wants to remain in a monogamous relationship; his wife gives him some rope then reins it in when he asks for too much.<br /><br />Meanwhile a father figure is unrepentant in his belief that the sexual urge is behind everything. He has found a new land even though he does not yet know what lies ahead. He is the solid rock denying the chance for more intuitive reasoning to bloom. He is a man of science.<br /><br />A Dangerous Method should be viewed and then reflected upon. Responsibly.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I just wanna start out by saying I am a huge mobster movie fan, I was toying with buying the blu-ray copy of this for a short time (already have dvd version) and I got this wonderful gem of an email telling me that this was 60% off for a short time, I just could not pass it up! I love every second of all 3 films
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its the perfect for me. whenever your bored you can always play this game and you will not be bored anymore.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|The only reason people leave bad reviews is because they want the ad free version. If you really want no ads BUY THE FULL VERSION.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so the game is super fun. one thing makes me mad though,it gos to androerd app vented and not the one I need. I got to have that fixed. it takes me to the internet. I cant get it on the Internet, I just canylt. so if you people could please fix this problem for me??? I need more points and cant download off the Internet. like I said. thanks!! :)
B006M4RN3U|2.0|If you were a fan of their first album or a fan of their previous band \\"the format\\" I believe you'll be disappointed.  Maybe 2 decent songs at best.

B0063GORYU|5.0|This game traps you in a web of colors and fun. Addictive ev enough to make me stop playing Words with Friends.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game worked perfectly on the Galaxy Nexus. Graphics were nice. So were the music and sound effects. I really enjoyed finding the hidden clues and solving the puzzles. Just enough of an eerie feeling to make it interesting, but not scary at all. What I really like about this game is that I don't have to sit and play it for hours. I was satisfied playing it in 10 minute increments in between doing other things. If I had played it non-stop it probably would have taken an hour or so to complete. I do like that it didn't drag on forever, although I would have liked another level or something. The ending was underwhelming, but the journey was enjoyable enough to convince me to buy The Lost City, the latest game from this developer. I hope they make more of these types of games. Even though they're short, they're well-worth the low price, so much went into making them look beautiful, sound moody, and play without hiccups.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|my bro got this app as the free app of the day, and he told me, &quot;Its so not worth its price and I wish that every app was free.&quot; He deleted it from his kindle fire. I haven't tried it but I am going to take his word for it. I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE MINIMUM # OF WORDS IS 20!!!!!!!!!!!
B006PKQQJS|3.0|this game was okay. it was really slow on my kindle fire. that made me sad becase I love these types of games.
1416955070|5.0|I loved this entire series. While some criticize similarities with other well-known fantasy series, that's an unfair judgement. As books in the same genre, they are going to share many similarities- and I noticed nothing here that even remotely resembles plagarism. The work is fun, and left me addicted to the series. Clare has created a fun and unique world that I hope will continue in many more books.
B002BWP49C|5.0|this is an outstanding movie which has proved to follow the book as close as it possibly could. i give it 5 stars . i want to know when breaking dawn part 2 comes out. part one left off at excatly the perfect spot and am really going to be hard to wait for second part.

B004SUWR2C|3.0|this uno app is decent, but could be much better. Not traditional uno but several different variations of the game instead. Game control does not respond well on the touchscreen of the kindle fire.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Bought the game after reading all the good reviews, and I was not disappointed.  The little Icon graphic in the app store (using kindle fire) looks cutesy and almost toddler-ish, however the puzzles in the game are definitely not for toddlers.  Ok price for a great game.  Was worth it to me.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Caution: This game is very, very addicting!!! I had lots of fun playing with it, and it's a definite alternative to Angry birds or doode jump.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Title says it all. The game is very good, but the lag is frustrating. I will try it on my kindle fire to see if it's any better
B004SH40BQ|3.0|Bought this for my husband to use at work.  He's gotten a max of 3 hours on his iPod Nano.  WIthout the bluetooth, he can get 2 days use.  This would likely work better for you if you are looking to use during a short workout, etc.
1595827684|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moBVQOA0IPWRJN]]The first Mass Effect art book, [[ASIN:0761558519 The Art of Mass Effect]], was quite good. The Art of Mass Effect Universe is even better.<br /><br />This handsome 184-page hardcover art book covers art for Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3. Yes, you'll be able to get a sneak peek at the upcoming Mass Effect 3, that's if you don't mind a little spoiler.<br /><br />The book is packed with concept art for characters, creatures, environments, props, weapons and vehicles. There are a few sketches but most are just gorgeous fully coloured designs. The art is top notch, the environment paintings are spectacular.<br /><br />There's some overlap of content with the first art book that features the first game. Here, there are additional content which makes you wonder why they weren't in the earlier book. Anyway, the first art book is already out of print so it makes more sense to get just this one.<br /><br />As all the designs come with insightful commentary, there will be a bit of a spoiler when you're reading the last chapter on Mass Effect 3. If you're just looking at pictures, then it should be alright and it'll give you a nice idea of what to expect visually in the next game.<br /><br />Unfortunately for a book this good, the artists aren't credited, not even with a page on the list of names like they did in the first art book. In many instances, I wanted to find out who these artists are and their websites. This is a silly exclusion, a downer.<br /><br />Overall. this is a great art book for fans of the game and sci-fi art. It should be one of the top art books for 2012.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
0763644765|5.0|My daughter had just turned 1 in Aug. 2011 & hates a wet diaper. So, for Christmas I got her a fun potty & 2 books about the potty. This book was one of the two & my daughter LOVES it. We read it every time & she will even mimic reading the book on her own. It is now Feb. 2012 & she is only just kind of liking the other book & since Christmas we have been trying to learn the potty. Some days are better then others and for every sitting my daughter hands me this book with a big smile & even interacts with the questions & story. I'm very happy I bought this.
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|Actually, I didn't watch this masterpiece in 3D.  Two dimensions of it were sufficient for me and I'm giving it one star for each dimension.  We have a story in which Brendan Fraser's scientist brother Max has disappeared and Trevor (Brendan Fraser)  is setting out to search for him.  But he gets saddled with having to care for Sean, Max's son played by Josh Hutcherson, who starts out as a bratty teenager and, of course, is initially p......d-off at the world.  (Actually, I was suspicious that Max simply couldn't stand Sean any longer and just took off).  But, no. They follow Max's trail, aided by pretty guide, Hannah (Anita Briem) who causes Sean to drool a little, to the mouth of a volcano. They all begin to fall down a rabbit hole and finally land on a heap of sticks  and dry leaves -- no, I'm sorry, that's in Alice in Wonderland.  The volcano's hole turns into a water slide and they enter into a world that resembles a defective ride in a theme park.  They discover that Max had died there, of boredom no doubt, and encounter gigantic Venus flytraps (I  never saw any gigantic flies, though), dinosaurs stomping around and birds that glow in the dark.  They also get to ride in a mining car which turns into a roller-coaster that manages to jump across a ten foot gap and land on the tracks on the other side, the chances against that happening being about 30 billion to one.  At another point on their raft, a sharp-toothed fish is getting closer and closer to taking a bite out of Hannah's rump as Sean is watching and his lips seem to be saying \\"Go for it, go for it!\\"  Even though I was watching this movie in 2D, it was obvious that it was shot in 3D because actors are seen pointing out at the camera or shooting a yo-yo out of the frame at you or some other shenanigans, which simply stalls any continuity this film might have had.  By the time it's over Sean has transformed into a smiling puppy, licking his uncle's hand or whatever.  The 1959 version of this story is a much superior film, having actors such as James Mason, Arlene Dahl and Pat Boone (Pat Boone??  Yes, it is Pat Boone), it's rather antique special effects notwithstanding.  Some shots were actually made in Carlsbad Caverns, I believe.  Now, you can't get more realistic than that.  The backgrounds in this new film look very much like painted scenery flats and the dinosaur chase scene with the characters running in the foreground on a treadmill is clearly a green screen process not particularly well executed.  I had completely forgotten that Brendan Fraser had done a really nice acting job in the fine film \\"Gods and Monsters.\\"  What did he do to deserve this mess?  Presumably he was well paid for it.
0374275637|2.0|I saw this booked reviewed and the author gave a very good presentation on US television and this is what decided me to purchase the book.

B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is a fun and additive game.  Easy touch function, move cards with just a double tap.  I would recommend.
0786915749|5.0|I read the first three books in this series way back in 1985. It started my love of fantasy and an affair with reading that I still have today. From start to finish I was impressed by how much I could create the world in my minds eye as I flipped each page. I still point to these books as the first ones I ever really loved. The books I bought then are lost somewhere in storage so I am going to buy them again to read and enjoy. I also bought them for my nephew not too long ago and still recommend them to young readers who I think would enjoy them. If you like fantasy I would highly recommend these, you will not be disappointed. As another reviewer said, stick to the books by Weis and Hickman.

B0064NTZJO|1.0|No drive, no chases, extremly cheesy story line, weak and lacklustre performances as Mr Goslin being the most mushy \\"care bear\\" tough guy I´ve ever seen, a serious disappointment. Seriuosly if you´re expecting an action packed thriller you´re in for a serious crash against the wall let down. You´d be way better of watching again Ronin, the French Connection, Bullit, any of the Transporters movies.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|It's somewhat understandable that many viewers do not recognize when a movie pays homage to older films, because chances are the last films you saw were recent ones and not older ones.<br /><br />This is the main crime of those who developed a distaste for this film. The criticism falls into 2 main categories and 2 lesser categories, which I will address one at a time:<br /><br />- Silence / lack of dialogue: People are judging the acting based on the dialogue having awkward pauses, because this is not a dramatic tool that is common in the average modern \\"chatterbox\\" film, but it's clearly present in nearly all of Clint Eastwood's films. Even in \\"Grand Torino\\" it was important that he be stoic and not be too talkative. Modern films would lead us to believe there are no quiet characters in the real world. If you are a restless person who cannot stand the \\"silent type,\\" then please avoid watching this film or dropping negative reviews about it. It pays homage to Clint Eastwood, but also to Marlon Brando. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" was a very poetic film that really needed every single awkward silence to build the tension of it's poetics. \\"Drive\\" also pays homage to the silent villain of the original Halloween (especially in the scene when he's standing on the hill overlooking the beach), an homage that also carries-over into the next category.<br /><br />- The gore: I am not a fan of gory films, and I would have liked this film better with four less stomps to the head, so I'm shocked that one reviewer said Goslin's character was more teddy bear than psycho. Again, I do not like gore at all, and I still give this film a strong five stars. The gore is done in a style that I hesitate to call a grind-house homage simply because it's not the Kill Bill style where blood squirts halfway across the room, but it's also not shot in the slick resolution style of Final Destination. The gore style is more like Halloween than Evil Dead, but it has that dry dead-pan camera angle that never looks away when things get rough. The presence of violence is helpful to the story somewhat like \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" in order to give the impression that this guy has either been corrupted by circumstance, or secretly had a hidden psycho in him. Also, it counterbalances the idea that he is supposedly heartfelt and fighting for someone.<br /><br />Now for the lesser concerns:<br /><br />- Not enough driving: Are you seriously complaining about this? Do people really watch movies just because they have a lot of driving? I guess so. Then please by all means skip this and rent \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" (more driving than there is plot) or \\"Furious Five\\" (I hear it is the best driving movie, which is why it doesn't interest me). This movie starts and ends with driving and that leaves out at least three chase scenes, but I guess people wanted the killing to happen in cars, the romance to happen in cars, etc. Get over it. It's like complaining because people have sex in a movie called \\"The Opposite of Sex.\\"<br /><br />- The music: I guess if the music is what drove me to this movie in the first place, then it's only logical that it would be the factor that drove some people away. I would complain that it could use even more corny 80's-type synthesizer music. The actual soundtrack only has like six songs or so and the rest is just the composer's score of mood-evoking tones and what not. I would have preferred if Dust Brothers had handled the composer parts to give it more grit like they did on Fight Club, but it works regardless. The music goes with the \\"Risky Business\\" font used in the title credits and it goes with the character's jacket and gloves.<br /><br />Closing remarks: This is not really the \\"crossover film\\" it was portrayed to be, it's still mostly an arthouse type of film, but the cameras are not shaky, the violence is not cartoonish like Tarantino's style, and the scenes are not shot through dirty windows and stuff like my dad hates. This is a film that builds on the lineage of gangster films, suspense-type film noir, etc. It's only on the edge of the driving movie genre, but a film that the males in my family can all get behind, because it ties back to Reservoir Dogs, Scarface, and The Godfather. This is nothing like the high-pace/soft-violence of \\"Gone in 60 seconds.\\"he lineage of gangster films, suspense-type film noir, etc. It's only on the edge of the driving movie genre, but a film that the males in my family can all get behind, because it ties back to Reservoir Dogs, Scarface, and The Godfather.

0345479092|5.0|This book was given to me as a present when I was pregnant. I read it twice, before and after my baby was born (it's two different perspectives).  It definitively helped me through the first 10 months (so far) and I would recommend it to any first time parent.  I do advise parents to understand your baby as an individual and develop a routine that works for both of you, you and your baby.  Use the book as a guide, but don't feel bad if your baby does not follow exactly, for instance, my baby sleeps well through the night but is not as good for her naps.  Keep in mind that the most important thing is to develop a routine. You will find great tips through out the book, i.e., how to bathe your baby, a suggested schedule on how/when to introduce to solid food, etc.  Recommended.
0071762345|5.0|I picked up Dave Kerpen's Likeable Social Media to read for a class I'm taking on Social Media Marketing.  It was an excellent read, and inspired quite a few ideas as I read through.  Kerpen's conversational approach to the subject makes this book very easy to read, and he takes his time really fleshing out the principles he discusses.  I felt his writing moved at a steady but easy to manage pace - which can be tough because at times the subject matter can seem overwhelming.  One of my favourite analogies of the social media approach from this book was considering your audience interaction from the angle of a first date.  Conversation and stories lead to positive engagement.  Listen, engage, then never stop listening - You wouldn't want to date someone who did all the talking.  Being honest, transparent, and authentic is important - you wouldn't date a liar who was always hiding an ulterior motive.  And lastly have fun in this space.  As a company, you're entering a space where people hang out with their friends - how bad would a first date be if she sat across the table from you and only ever said \\"buy a Ford Focus!\\"  --  This is all good advice.  Kerpen uses tons of real world examples - from his company, and from social media fame/infamy - he shows a very strong understanding of people (as opposed to some of the very tech/market heavy books out there) and you can see that it comes from a background with his very successful company Likeable Media.  Lots of strong theory, and great exercises to help adapt his principles to your project.  I absolutely recommend this book.  And He totally tweets back.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book for my language arts class, as probably hundreds of classes are doing, and I was hooked from the beginning. There are real emotions, real characters, and real fears involved. After reading this book, which I read for myself after the announcement that we would be reading it,my only issue is that it was a really easy read. I hate books that are so simple to read that all 300+ pages can be read in an hour.  I loved it, though. The absolute greatness of it compensated for the easy reading level. While reading it, I slipped into its fictional grip and allowed it to replace my reality and turn everyday life into silly fantasy. But i cant get over its easy level,so 4 stars. I would have done 4.5 if I could have.

0316017930|4.0|I thought the book Outliers was really good. I like how Gladwell used real life examples to pull me in. He uses a couple of examples for each subject to make sure you really understand what makes that person an outlier. At first I didn't really know what to think about people being outliers. By the end of the book I realized there is way more, than I thought, about outliers. In the end they are actually really special. At first I just thought they were lucky, but Gladwell won me over by the end of the book. I also really liked the ending of the book. I liked that Gladwell used his own family as an example of an outlier. It really showed me where his drive came from to write about such an odd subject. I mean really who would think and take the time to write about all of this? It seems to me he is very honored that his mom is an outlier.  Have you ever wondered why the Chinese are better at math than Americans? What about do people with extremely high IQs really do that much better in life than people with normal IQs? How many hours do you have to practice to be really good at something? Why did so many Korean Air airplanes crash in a certain time frame? What makes a person stand out more in the hockey world? Read this book and you will have all of these questions answered and a ton more.
B006Z7XNVK|5.0|It is difficult to watch this completely absorbing film MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE without knowing something about the creator Sean Durkin.  Even though he is still very young he presents evidence of an enormous talent. He has been quoted else where with the following statements: ``I think as a child I was really afraid of groups that conformed. Cults were really an example of that. I'm attracted to fear. I'm attracted to movies that scare you. I knew I would just end up working in that realm.' 'How can you make a movie about getting out of a cult if you've never gotten out of a cult?' Because movies are made by people who don't have to go through things. You have to understand that. I have to understand, emotionally and psychologically, what she went through. And I did that, then I tried to be true to that when I was making the movie. To understand sisters, I need to understand family relationships. I don't think of it in terms of male-female or having to live through it.<br /><br />With that information the plot line of this film seems more accessible, though it is a film that will appeal to a somewhat limited audience. It is an engrossing dissection of the mind of a girl whose life is so fractured that she escapes `ordinary life' to join a cult living on a farm where all of the members work and all are directed by the mindset of a quietly deranged man.<br /><br />Martha (Elizabeth Olsen in a knockout performance) has been living with a `family' headed by the charismatic, dark Patrick (John Hawkes) who has renamed her Marcy May.  Together with Zoe (Louisa Krause), Katie (Mary Dizia), Sarah (Julia Garner) - each of whom is bedded by Patrick in a ceremony of sorts - and with the male members of the family Max (Christopher Abbot) and Watts (Brady Corbett). When we first meet Marlene she is leaving the family, headed for sanctuary with her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) and brother-in-law Ted (Hugh Dancy) - two successful young people who are part of the `establishment'. Martha attempts to find peace with Lucy and Ted, but her nightmares and haunting paranoia make her appear like a severely mentally injured girl: the reasons for her behavior we discover through a series of playbacks of her strange and ultimately criminal life with the family.  Rather than bringing resolution to the film's story writer/director Durkin leaves Martha (now in her new role as Marlene) at a juncture where we the audience must decide the ending. It is this slowing unwinding of a girl's mind as displayed in the relationship with her nurturing but confused sister that makes one of the most thrilling psychological dramas in years.<br /><br />Even though the film as we watch it seems to be the career making performance of Elizabeth Olsen it is far more staggering a `first outing' for Sean Durkin.  From the setting in the Catskills and in Connecticut to the finely shaped performances by Sarah Paulson, Hugh Dancy, John Hawkes, Brady Corbett, and literally every member of this cast, this is one of the finest films of the year.  Highly Recommended.

0439023513|4.0|Suzanne Collins' \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy concludes with \\"Mockingjay,\\" and our dystopian future has never been so bleak.  Similar to Stephen King's magnificent \\"The Long Walk,\\" a good story set in a world that kills children for our entertainment cannot have a happy ending.  \\"Mockingjay\\" opens with Katniss Everdeen recovering from her second triumph in the Hunger Games.  Only this time, she cannot look forward to a peaceful return home where her biggest burden will be the choice between her suitors, Gale and Peeta. As the Mockingjay, she is the symbol of the rebellion against the Capitol, led by the armies of District 13 and their hard-boiled leader, Coin.  Not only must Katniss accept the fact that virtually everyone lied to her about the planned rebellion, she must also confront a new reality where the rebels must consider some of the same hard choices that the leaders of the Capitol made.  In a bleak trilogy, \\"Mockingjay\\" stands out for being particularly harsh and violent.  The rebels may be suiting up for war, but Katniss and the other tributes who survived the Quarter Quell are mere shells of themselves.  Peeta, her devoted ally since the first Games, is in the clutches of President Snow in the Capitol and is surely the focus of their most dastradly tortures.  Gale, Kat's sidekick from District 12, has had virtually every ounce of pity boiled from his soul by war.  And Haymitch cannot mentor Kat any longer as they are on entirely new ground.  Even fans of the first two novels, violent in their own right, will be shocked by the unremitting violence Collins unleashes in \\"Mockingjay\\" as the rebels take the fight to the Capitol.  This is not a criticism - Collins does not want to fall back on the cliche of the rebels mounting a noble war against their oppressors.  Indeed, much of the book revolves around Kat's struggle to reconcile with her new allies.  Trust is just a word in \\"Mockingjay,\\" as empty as air.  This is a powerful, dark book that caps off the HungerGames surprisingly well.  If you know a younger reader who devoured the first two books, you might want to take a spin through this one before letting them take it on - kind of like how \\"The Deathly Hallows\\" required a more mature reader than \\"The Sorcerer's Stone,\\" and not just because it was longer.  Just be careful - this is a book that can cause nightmares.  Highly recommended.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I bought this book, and when I opened it, it wouldn't let me read. I tried redownloading it, and nothing. Eventually I deleted it, and bought it again. Still wouldn't work. Go buy the actual book, not this one. Awful!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|It was like watching the live original but with all the close ups......I am still in awe as I was when I saw it at the Chicago Theater. Goosebump upon goosebump with the wonderful stage transitions, costumes (very colorful and detailed), makeup, wonderful expressive heart felt songs. Then after it had ended, there were added surprises such as Sarah Brightman singing with five of the actors who played the Phantom of the Opera. And a guest appearance by Michael Crawford. Just spectacular. I wish I could give it ten stars, it really deserves it.......If you are disappointed with this, you probably aren't the type of person who is moved by musical expression. If you criticize it, see a shrink and maybe you should show the world your creative ability......Andrew Lloyd Webber is a MUSICAL GENIUS.

B00416D7A4|5.0|I own CW-X, 2XU, and Skins tights - which fit the best?  Skins - hands down.  Why?  I'm a dude and appreciate a gusset.  CW-X - no gusset, just a nice little seam that threatens to saw you in half.  2XU - a faux gusset - nothing more than just an outline of a gusset.  The Skins have a true gusset that hold your bits and pieces in place.  Another thing I like about the skins is the waist band.  Its wide and doesn't have a draw string.  I think if you get the right size then you don't need a draw string to help keep things up.  The last thing I really like about them is that they have a shorter drop than the 2XUs.  I guess I have a lower waist than what the 2XUs were designed for.  The Skins fall right at my hips.<br /><br />I started to use compression/recovery after I read the many articles about the benefits.  I'm not sure about the science but I do know that after a hard day of tri-training that I feel fresher after sleeping in these.  I've also used them for flights to Europe.  They can be a tad warm on a 14 hour flight, but knowing that they are helping me against DVT is worth it.<br /><br />I'm 5'8\\" and got the small/regular.  I probably should have gotten the small/short.  I bet the small/shorts would line up better in the knees.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Another great find. I actually read Wool a while back and although I thought it was great it left me feeling very depressed. I just recently came across the Wool Omnibus Edition and read some of the reviews and thought I would give the other stories a chance to lift my spirits of the Silo world. 17 hours later I had finished and felt myself in a state of awe. I have been reading many dystopian books but this one is a stand out for sure. I highly recommend it to anyone who wanting a dystopian adventure.

B004I2K4DY|3.0|Having been a fan for many years of the original & the tenth anniversary dream cast edition, I was EXCITED to know this production was a reality.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed in all respects.  Initially the PBS airing here in the US was not as exciting as I had hoped.  Thinking the TV didn't do it justice, I purchased the DVD.  I was equally as disappointed.  As my title states, I think the performances , overall, lack the passion and depth of the tenth anniverary performances.  The more modern staging does NOT make up for the less than stellar performances of the cast.  Lea Solonga and the Thenendieres are the performances that bring back the emotions.  Samantha Banks as Eponine was beautiful in the role but I sure did not feel the \\"undying\\" passion of the character.  Nick Jonas is so lackluster in the very passionate role of Marius that I might understand the absence of passion from Eponine. The performance of \\"EMPTY CHAIRS AT EMPTY TABLES\\" lacks the suffering and angst that Michael Ball so passionately provides in every rendition.  Am I sorry I purchased this DVD? NO.  Alfie Boe and Norm Lewis are very good with beautiful voices.  Phillip Quast is an extremely hard act to follow as Gebert.  Thank you for this opportunity to voice my opinion.  I think the original cast was so outstanding that any subsequent cast might pale in comparison, but this is an emotional musical and ANY performance should reflect that passion.

B004EPYZSU|4.0|This is a fun movie, the special effects are out of this world :P  I don't expect a lot of depth out of my sci fi movies, just some escapist fun and that's what you get with this movie.  I love the double genre, too!  I thought the idea was brilliant and they did an okay job of it.  Plus you get to see Daniel Craig. :D  Harrison Ford did a bit better job on this movie then he did in the last Indiana Jones movie.  A guy who was supposed to be such a hero in the war would have become such an evil piece of junk after, and then gains redemption?  Not too sure about that part.  Sam Rockwell, as always, did an outstanding job.  Olivia Wilde was gorgeous.  Overall, all the characters were well played, Spielberg always does a good job with the casting, though, wouldn't expect anything less.  The only real complaint that I have is that Hollywood really needs to come up with something new in the alien department.  They're all starting to look too much alike anymore.  And why do they always have to be bipedal?  Come on, lets show some real imagination, people!! :D

Once you read Austin's book, these ideas will become yours. But before you buy it, know this: it isn't really about theft or art. Hell, it isn't really even a book.

1410430103|5.0|First in the Jack Reacher suspense series revolving around Jack, a drifter recently discharged from the military.<br /><br />My Take<br />Child intrigued me from the get-go with his unique approach. A drifter accused of murder who couldn't possibly have done it. Intelligent. With a gift for playing music in his head and changing keys to suit the situation. I loved it.<br /><br />The man is twisted. Child has come up with a nasty, twisty plot that is, unfortunately, believable. I started reading this and forgot everything around me.<br /><br />Interesting information about the money situation in the United States. Makes it so much more understandable as to why the Treasury is so concerned with counterfeiting. Cool ideas Child provided about cutting back the practice at least in the states.<br /><br />I am definitely looking forward to reading more about Jack Reacher...if only to find out where he drifts to next...<br /><br />Definitely a buy.<br /><br />The Story<br />It's six months since Jack was discharged from the Military Police. In his wandering the countryside, he decides to hop off the bus at Margrave in Georgia. His brother, knowing how much he loves music, had mentioned Blind Blake, a guitar player who was murdered in Margrave some 60 years ago. So Jack wanders into Margrave and gets arrested for murder. Only to find he's stumbled across a counterfeiting ring his brother Joe was trying to shut down.<br /><br />The powers-that-be think Jack would make a nice scapegoat, but there's too much evidence that clears him. Jack's summing up of the crime scene grabs Finlay's respect and, when Jack learns the identity of one of the dead men, there is no way he won't stay on to help.<br /><br />Only, there aren't that many Jack can trust on this. Seems as though the whole town and police force are in on the gig and their way of discouragement is...messy...to say the least. Jack's hoping that Finlay and Roscoe are trustworthy.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Ex-Major Jack Reacher is drifting. Just exploring the countryside after spending his entire life as first a military brat and then in the Military Police. Someone always telling him what to do and where to go. Now, now his time is his own. Joe Reacher was Jack's older brother. Growing up they always had each other's backs. Now Joe is working Treasury. Molly is a coworker of Joe's and his girlfriend. She's able to fill us in on the background and why international counterfeiting is so dangerous.<br /><br />Captain Finlay is the chief of detectives. He took the job to escape his broken marriage. Kick back from the intensity of policing in Boston. Chief Morrison claims he saw Jack at the crime scene. Officers Baker and Stevenson are well-trained at least in tactics. Jack realizes Assistant Warden Spivey is somehow hooked up in all this when he puts him and Hubble on the wrong floor in the prison for the weekend. The lifers' floor. Worse when the Aryan Brotherhood attacks him after pointing him out as \\"the one\\". Spivey just didn't expect these results! Officer Roscoe believes in Jack. It's just too bad for the Kliner kid that Jack likes her right back.<br /><br />Kliner has set up a huge set of warehouses outside Margrave. Most of his textile operation is in South America, but he's spending money here in Georgia with his Kliner Foundation. The foundation is a sweet deal. It works 24/7 keeping Margrave looking pristine with grants going out to every businessman. Every week. His kid has some boundary issues and too fierce a liking for hurting people.<br /><br />Paul Hubble is a banker with a nice, big house and the stereotypical family. Charlie is his lovely and intelligent wife. Two Bentleys in the driveway. And his mobile number on a scrap of paper on the murdered man's body. It's Charlie who asks Jack for help in finding her missing husband. Professor Walter Bartholomew at Princeton and Professor Kelstein at Columbia University were both working with Joe.<br /><br />Sherman Stoller is the second body. A truck driver who seems to have come into a lot of money. Special Agent Picard with the FBI is helping his old buddy Finlay and Jack with this case. Hiding witnesses. Getting documents. Mayor Grover Teale is one bad man. He's been bad ever since he was a boy and got a blind musician killed.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is all white with a bloody handprint.<br /><br />The simplest interpretation is that the Killing Floor is the warehouse at the end when everyone is blazing away...literally in some cases. A less simple interpretation could be that it all comes down to one thing on the ground floor where the killing gets done.r is the second body.

0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus is well trodden territory here so I'll spare you the recap and skip to right to why this is a 5-star book.<br /><br />  1. The Circus itself. Dark, magical, and slightly menacing. As the sign says, \\"Trespassers Will Be Exsanguinated.\\" You believe it but willingly go regardless.<br />  2. The secrets are kept secret. Magic fades under harsh light and the author knows how to keep things bright by keeping the in the dark.<br />  3. The characters aren't explained so much as implied. For example,  Mr. A. H-- is a man so mysterious that we are never to know his name nor why he no longer casts a shadow. Yet we know that the Mr. A will stab you in the back and walk on without a second thought.<br />  4. The world that is created in this book is one of the most original and vibrantly imagined that I have read in years.<br />  5. The writing borders on poetry without weighing down the plot.<br />  6. The romance is darkly passionate and free of cliche.<br /><br />  \\"Marco kisses her as though they are the only two people in the world. The air swirls in a tempest around the, blowing open the glass doors to the garden with a tangle of billowing curtains. Every eye in the crowded ballroom turns in their direction. And the he releases her and walks away.\\"<br /><br />There are some small flaws in this book and I can understand why some would give it less than 5 stars. Some might not appreciate the fact that many of the mysteries are kept mysteries. Some might feel the characters are too distant and unrelatable. Or the ending too abrupt.<br /><br />But I assert that Erin Morgenstern is a major new talent and her inaugural work is a staggering work of beautiful fiction.

1451627289|3.0|Very often I pick up a book, because it has a very promising plot and it's either a hit or a miss. Sometimes the best possible plot is just not put into action in a good way and it's a boring read, sometimes our expectations are met or even exceeded.<br />\\"11/23/63\\" was not a complete miss, but compared with older King novels like \\"It\\" (5 stars) or \\"Misery\\" (4 stars) the most I would be willing to give this book are 3 stars for the wonderful sixties atmosphere.<br />My interest level dropped way off when the story got into Jodie, the town where Jake settles down. It went on and on. Neither did I care for the love story nor did I care for the description of community life. I was skipping pages until it got more interesting again and until Jake finally started doing what he originally had intended to do when he entered that rabbit hole which made him go back in time.<br /><br />Unfortunately our public library only has the large print hardcover version, not the regular hardcover, so I can only compare it with 1030 pages in large print (instead of 840 pages in regular hardcover), according to that the best part of the book was for me the first 400 pages (that's when I kept telling my husband that he has to read this book, too) and the last 160 pages from 11/22/63 on when the plot became more interesting again and Jake finally started doing what he intended to do in the first place.<br />The pages from 401 until 870 were just fillers for me. So if the editor would have taken out those 470 pages (large print), it would have been a perfect time traveller story, but King probably had more ambitions than that (but to me they were wasted).
0525421580|4.0|What I liked: This book is a blast. It's a funny, loud, cute page-turner. I finished it in two days. The friendship between John Green's Will Grayson and his best friend, Tiny Cooper, is very sweet and realistic. His half of the book is endearing and insightful, funny and sad, brilliant and ridiculous.  What I didn't like: This novel is in first person, present tense, switches between the POVs of the two Will Graysons, and has two different authors. Basically, it has all of the major things that tend to make a book exceedingly bad. I definitely give them points (okay, mostly John Green) for pulling this off well enough that it was still a good read, but it could have been a great one.  Green and Levithan chose three of the hardest things to pull off in a novel and, unsurprisingly, their book suffered:  1. You need to be a fantastic author to pull off first person without self-insertion, contrivance or cliché. You need to be an even better author to write fiction in present tense without annoying your reader or making tense change mistakes. These guys aren't fantastic. Judging solely from this book, David Levithan is fine and John Green is pretty good.  2. When you write a book from the POV of more than one character, every reader is bound to have a favorite and character development is extremely difficult. In the hands of an author who is less than genius, this always results in readers dreading certain parts and wishing others were longer. This technique also tends to make books feel disjointed and rushed. That's exactly what happened when I read this book. I disliked David Levithan's Will Grayson for the majority of the book. By the time I started to like him a little, it was too late. I loved John Green's Will Grayson, but I felt cheated out of a lot of time with him and found myself literally counting down the pages left before he was coming back.  3. The issues described in the previous point are exacerbated by the fact that the book has two different authors.It's tough for two people to collaborate and write an awesome, cohesive book, but it has been done. (See [[ASIN:0590213113 P.S. Longer Letter Later]] and its sequel for examples of this aimed at a younger audience.) While I was reading, I felt that the authors may not have spent enough time working on the book as a team.  They did an okay job, but almost all of the book's flaws are a result of the fact that they gave themselves unnecessary challenges that they couldn't handle. They're just not good enough writers (yet).  My final, quick criticisms of this book are:  1. Levithan's lower case was pointless and came off as pretentious, just like his character. 2. The ending of the book (the whole last chapter) was unfulfilling, stupid and unrealistic. 3. I thought the character of Jane was superfluous. 4. It's rarely a good idea to have current cultural references in a novel. This thing will be outdated in a couple of years. 5. I know it's petty, but the title is awful. I would have picked up this book when it first came out if it weren't for the title. 6. This is a popcorn book with themes that are very thin and thrown right in your face. Luckily, the non-serious nature of the book made it so that it didn't come off as heavy-handed, but that's also the flaw. It didn't come off as serious or meaningful either. This book lacks something that would make a reader think about it or feel anything after they've closed it. I started another book at the soonest possible moment. This just doesn't stick.  One last note: I was on the phone with my friend last night, and I told him I was reading this book. I described both of the Will Graysons and their general storylines. He immediately guessed which one was written by John Green. Then, he told me things about the characters and story that I hadn't yet told him, saying that &#34;all of his books are that exact same thing.&#34; I haven't read any of John Green's other offerings, so this point did not contribute to my overall starrating, but I did think it was worth bringing up.  Overall: There's no reason not to read this, and I don't necessarily regret spending money on it, but if I were you I would check it out at the library first before purchasing. It's definitely a fast, fun read, but it has glaring flaws.

0060873027|1.0|This book is not very good.  In fact, it is just plain awful.  It pains me to say that since Michael Crichton is one of my favorite fiction writers to read.  Part of this book (Crichton's last), was found unfinished on his personal computer after his death a few years ago.  Therefore, it is co-written by some guy named Richard Preston (?).  I'm wondering if all they found on this book was a title and introduction, and then said, \\"go with it, we're sure to make money.\\"  - It should be noted, Crichton's book Pirates: Latitudes was also discovered posthumously, and it was a great book!  At any rate, here's the plot in a nutshell.  Some evil corporate types/scientists have discovered a technology that can shrink objects and people... blah... blah... blah... mix Honey I Shrunk the Kids with Jurassic Park and you get Micro.  The thing that has always made Michael Crichton's science fiction enjoyable was his in-depth scientific research, compelling thriller narrative, and just barely beyond believable plot... The things that makes Micro awful are the shear unbelievability of the story, the poor character development, and disjointed storyline...  bottom line: don't waste your time.

B006LEHOL2|5.0|I am always interested in Sinead's releases. Some releases take time to grow on me, but I always get to the point of loving them and hearing that good music and artistic theme. This one is an instant like. It feels like an album, not choppy, song order is important, and it really is a delight. That said, Sinead hasn't had such extreme's on an album and such flow. She really gives you a lot of characters and a lot to think about. I am sure as I listen more I will find more to appreciate. However, with no hesitation I can say 5 star. Lovely art from a great artist.

The premise was intimidating to me at first because I am not a fan of gratuitous violence and less a fan of mindless political correctness.  The author paints the picture clearly but does not dwell on the gore of the essential violence of the story.  The more I read the more I appreciated the unpredictability of the story line, and finally, I enthusiastically agree with the themes of the value of freedom and the virtue of personal integrity and sacrifice.  A great read!
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Hi,<br /><br />  don`t want to write a two pages review but after the first it is just getting better and better and also make me laugh so everyone around me when I read look at me and ask me what is going on!<br /><br />  Thank so much to the author for sharing and please keep Stephanie Plum alive for long!!<br /><br /> Regards
1469984202|5.0|An excellent, unique world filled with well-developed characters. Every book in this series maintains pace and suspense. You'll be hungry for more. What a find!
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|Even though this is a very well written novel, that at points gets hard to put down, it was too depressing. Now if you want to lose any value you find in life, read this book. The cynical outlook on it all is great for that, but on the off chance you like life and don't want to spend 3-4 chapters bawling your eyes out, and then have it just end, then I don't suggest reading it. There were points in this book where I had to take a break from reading it, it got so depressing. How they refer to themselves as \\"side effects\\" of life and not like real people, also I just seriously hated that everything went wrong for this girl, like come on, finding out your cancer is just getting worse, getting your dreams crushed by your favorite author, wasting your boyfriends \\"wish\\", to then find out your boyfriend you just told you loved is going to die, it just seems like a stretch to make the character as sympathy grabbing as can be. I'm not going to lie, I loved this book, I also hated it once it was over, it left me sad, and full of other questions they never answered, and in general unfulfilled .
B004XNGKBS|4.0|I like this app for taking notes.  I do wish it could recognize handwriting and convert it to type though.
B004UHSB5A|5.0|This is not exactly what I was used to when I thought of Dominoes, and it is taking some time getting used to the scoring.  However, aside from that, I LOVE THIS GAME!!  Keeps me occupied for quite a while.  I will get the scoring down, but even without knowing all the nuances, I can beat the machine!!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I didn't expect much in terms of a FAOTD remote access app. I have thus far been very impressed with the overall quality and ease of use of this app. You could use this as a home monitoring solution using a webcam on your home computer or like I do as a storage and word processing solution on my android tablet.  4 out of 5 simply because video can be laggy sometimes.
0307949508|5.0|I admonished a friend for not yet having read these books and she just shrugged and and wondered why everyone loves them. There's a good reason: they are compelling! And if the many Swedish names and locations confuse you, try putting a post-it note on the pages with maps (and the family tree in first book) and refer back while reading - that will help keep things clear while the characters and their world are new to you. Now, put on some coffee (as everyone in these books does, constantly) and READ. Skol!
B005SDDB9Q|5.0|I didn't expect much, I'll be honest. So many compilation releases these days that add nothing and re-releases of CDs which also, for the most part, add little. I'm referring to the music industry in general. And then, there's this CD. A true gem. Although the 'Bound For Glory' title might mislead people into thinking this is another Woody Guthrie/Pete Seeger project, it's not - at all. This was a wonderful surprise for me - the initial tracks on the CD, at least, were broadcast just days before the release of Greetings From Asbury Park. A note: The audio quality is not the best. However, the unguarded nature of the interviews and performances - at least to me - make up for that, especially in a world where most so-called creative enterprises are marketed and exploited to a degree which leaves little room for anything but massed-produced crapola. An entertainment industry that makes a TV series about almost anything - usually involving hyped scenarios (think 'Storage Wars', 'Dog The Bounty Hunter', 'Bad Girls Club', ghost hunters, sasquatch (called a 'squatch') hunters etc.) with everything micromanaged and hammered into a product that is so thin on content as to be almost invisible. This CD has found its way into a world in which art, music and writing is devoid of any originality and humanity. In some ways, it is remarkably like the early 1970s - when these recordings were made - when the popular music industry was about to jump into the disco quicksand pit - only to be rescued, eventually, by the punk and new wave movements. Into this breach stepped Bruce Springsteen - and for those who weren't there and didn't live through the pain this CD might show why \\"Bruce\\" became something of a national hero. It would be another couple years (1975) before Springsteen appeared on the cover of Time and Newsweek magazines - in the same week - the \\"Born To Run\\" moment. So pull up a chair, lean back and listen. This is Bruce before he became a rock 'n roll god.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This app is so much fun. There are few things that the original uno does not have. I highly recommend getting this app. You should get this app.
B007B8EX9I|5.0|This series is SO blooming wonderful! The first year was great, but the second year has been fantastic. I love all the characters, even the ones that are sinister. What a wonderful treat! Cannot wait til part 3.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It definetly a 5 star app when you can get it to work properly. If you make one mistake sighning in. Its close to impossible to set up a new one, ive had so much trouble with this. Why cant i have the same username.password, email on all my devices? It sounds pretty simple doesnt it, but not with this app! Another problem is that if you do make a mistake and then enter the correct information, it will not except it, I wish they would take care of these problems so i could give the five it deserves.<br /><br />Sincerly Tony D
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I love this app on my Samsung Galaxy S II Epic Touch 4g (Sprint's version). It is useful with mounds of info and much customization. I find it fun to doodle with when I'm board as it has many layers like an onion. Everything is tappable and goes to more info presented in different ways when you tap on it. Try \\"dialing\\" the times on the clock - too cool. Or tapping the clock center to get different info like UV index, temps, precip, etc. You can tell a lot of work, thought and inspiration went into it. I expect it will get even better over time and they can add more sources of forecasts to make it even more accurate. I especially dig the Earthquake Map. I had a question and emailed the developer and got a fast and complete answer within 24 hours. Try it out - its cool!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I truly wish I hadn't read this book. The first 2 didn't disapoint, but this one definitely did.<br /><br />It deviated too much from the first 2 books. The plot just wasn't the same without a sane Peeta.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say... I'm just in shock that it was such a dumb ending.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great app!! Hard to stop playing once you get started. My 5-year old really likes it a lot too!! However some games are a little too hard for her.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't decide if I like this book, or the first book, more!<br /><br />I liked how the drama stayed consistent with the drama from the first book. I especially liked how the arena was laid out for these Games. It was much more interesting, and reading about Katniss's experiences in these Games was more enjoyable because she had a group of allies. My favorite was the very end -- how revealing! I also liked how my favorite characters from the first book made pleasant appearances in this book :)<br /><br />As you can tell, I can't find a single thing I disliked about Catching Fire. Wonderful! Does not disappoint!
B00127RAJY|3.0|This is an effective workout and great that it is only 20 minutes, however you can not skip through the beginning to get to the workout which adds on precious time for those that are trying to squeeze in a workout within limited amount of free time.  Personally I find her interactions with the women in the DVD degrading and obnoxious. However my annoyance somehow seems to  motivate me to stick through it and as a result have seen results.  Certainly worth the price. None of the exercises are ground breaking or innovative but again, effective.
B004UHSB5A|1.0|The user interface is absolutely terrible. It's very difficult to turn dominos or place them where I want them to go. Also the program will not let me make some legal moves. This program needs a lot of work and I have no clue how amazon thought it was good enough to be featured as the free app of the day.
B0070R8WY2|4.0|When I heard Tramp's magnificent lead single \\"Serpents\\" my expectations for the album were set high. When I saw the album's cover, a tip of the hat to John Cale's eternal [[ASIN:B000006XCU Fear]], the bar went up several notches. Could it be that Ms. Van Etten had really had a breakthrough? To my great disappointment, the answer is \\"not really.\\" While Tramp is a solid set of songs with a number of tracks that have serious staying power, as a whole it doesn't gel.<br /><br />The album starts off unconventionally and defiantly with \\"Warsaw,\\" a short song that runs in circles melodically and lyrically. \\"You, you're something,\\" Sharon sings, and it's not clear whether that's good or bad. It's an interesting opening gambit that seems to work.<br /><br />The song just stops and \\"Give Out\\" strums in. After a dozen listens, I don't know if I like it or not! It has some very emotionally resonant lyrics and images, married to a not very interesting melody. It just repeats itself twice and then ends, and at the end of 4:18 the musical idea is pretty worn out. The weak wordplay of \\"look down/look out\\", \\"hold on/hold out\\", \\"give in/give out\\" works at first, but starts to grate.<br /><br />Serpents is one of the two pillars of the album for me. It's the most essential thing on offer, and shows a strong voice and emotion that are lacking elsewhere. If nothing else, this glorious brutality needs to be in your library.<br /><br />\\"Kevin's\\" was written after giving up smoking and a boyfriend simultaneously. It's gorgeous, but impenetrable.<br /><br />\\"Leonard\\" is the first of two songs that owe too much of their melody to Andrew Bird. It's the lesser offender. \\"I am bad at loving\\" is a sentiment that is underexposed in pop music, but the song just doesn't resonate with me emotionally.<br /><br />My second pillar track is \\"In Line\\", which like Serpents features atmospheric backing vox by Wye Oak's Jenn Wasner. Like Serpents, this song has an original and interesting voice. The stacked vocals after the three minute mark are intoxicating.<br /><br />All I Can tries to rock out a bit, but at this point the midtempo five minute epics have weighed the album down. You can't hate the ever deepening wall of sound on this almost Harrisonian juggernaut, but it doesn't stand out the way it would if there were more variation in song length and tempo.<br /><br />We Are Fine finally changes the sonic palette enough to make the listener sit up. Uke (?) and a duet with Zach Condon of Beirut work surprisingly well on a song that could get too wimpy (\\"take my hand and help me not to shake\\"). If it were my album, I think it would be the second single.<br /><br />Magic Chords is my secret favorite song on the album. The loping yet martial percussion, groovy organ, and syncopated choppy vocals all combine beautifully. It's just a shame that it's hidden on the back half of the album and is superficially unremarkable.<br /><br />Andrew Bird ought to get a writing credit on Ask, because the melody and delivery and sound are strikingly reminiscent of him. Is it Cataracts? Natural Disaster? Spare-Ohs? I can't put my finger on it, but it distracts me.<br /><br />\\"I'm Wrong\\" is very pretty and builds up impressively but it doesn't really do much for me.<br /><br />As a closer Joke or a Lie, in the vein of Wye Oak's Doubt, is incisive but is simultaneously too slow and quiet to close out such a slow and quiet back half of the album AND too busy to be arresting the way Doubt was.<br /><br />Tramp is a hard album to rate. I don't hate a single song, in fact really like more than half, but listening to it as a whole almost puts me to sleep. Partly it's that, despite how similar most tracks sound, there's not a single recognizable writing voice that links the songs. Partly it's that each song has so much STUFF, instrumental and otherwise, crammed into it. Silence in music is a powerful thing that this album could use more of. Partly the emotions on offer all fall into a certainnarrow range. More variation in tempo and more aggressive editing would help the album's listenability as well. I'd call it a three and a half star album.<br /><br />I hope in the future Sharon feels enabled to experiment more with different emotions, colors, instruments, tempos, and topics. Leaving the confessional songwriting mold might be worth a try too. In fact, I can suggest a great album to consider as an example of disparate parts making a unified and excellent whole: John Cale's 'Fear.' I'll be waiting.<br /><br />EDIT: Well, I'm sufficiently stuck on this album that I can't honestly give it only three stars. However, I still feel it's a bit of a mess. (I did sound too harsh on Ask above - it's a great song.)<br /><br />I figured out a way to listen to the album that is much more satisfying to me. I cut out \\"Kevin's\\" and \\"I'm Wrong\\" and reordered the tracks to group the \\"Jenn Wasner songs\\", the \\"Zach Condon songs\\", and the \\"Andrew Bird-esque\\" songs, and it feels so much more natural and listenable. At 38:20, it's closer to my ideal album length of 40 minutes, too. See the altered tracklist in the comments, and give it a try - you may just get more out of it.narrow range.

0446573019|3.0|David Baldacci is an excellent writer. His words flow easily and he knows how to ratchet the reader's up.<br /><br /> But this story, particularly the climax, is badly flawed. I really enjoyed the book and was flipping pages rapidly, but Baldacci killed it in the last 50 pages when he unloaded one unbelievable plot device after another.<br /><br /> A few minutes after I closed the book, I looked back on it and asked myself why I read it all. The author had destroyed my faith in what started out as a good story, even if it felt like someone retelling a Jack Reacher (Lee Child) adventure.<br /><br /> Warrant Officer John Puller, Jr., Criminal Investigation Division, United States Army is assigned by his superior to investigate a multiple homicide in the tiny hamlet of Drake, West Virginia, in the heart of coal country. Four victims have been executed, one of them being a US Army Colonel who plays a part in preparing the secret briefings for the Army's top brass.<br /><br /> Puller alone is assigned - no partners, no back-ups, no onsite support. To Baldacci's credit, he make this outlandish scenario fly. He has Puller teaming up with local Sherriff's Deputy Sam(antha) Cole. More bodies, three of them, are quickly discovered.<br /><br /> It is only afterwards that you realize just how silly this plot is - and how much it parodies Lee Child. In any event, Baldacci carries us through meeting his own dysfunctional family and then Sam Cole's dysfunctional family and a few other dysfunctional families as well, just to add to the local color.<br /><br /> Puller is a well thought out \\"strong, silent\\" hero type. Baldacci does a solid job of establishing him in the reader's mind. I personally hope to see him again in future Baldacci works with hopefully stronger and more coherent storylines.<br /><br /> The other characters, as one would expect, are painted in lighter brushstrokes, although all the characters are reasonably believable.<br /><br /> There is some relatively minor action along the way, but no floods of blood. \\"Zero Day\\". In many ways, is more a police procedural, then a thrillr.<br /><br /> Anyway, I don't want to spoil this for anyone by getting too detailed.<br /><br /> As I said, Baldacci is an excellent writer and he keeps the story moving and caused me to go to sleep much later than usual for two nights running.<br /><br />But the climax of the story is just plain weird. It left me with the feeling that with all the effort that went into plotting the earlier pages, Balducci just ran into a wall.<br /><br /> Is it worth reading? Yes, I think so.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm a senior in high school. Each year, my cousin (who is a children's & young adult librarian) sends me a list of books she thinks I should read. Since freshman year, EVERY YEAR she put The Hunger Games on the list.. EVERY YEAR I ignored it.. I just wasn't into the \\"fantasy\\" genre, though this book isn't a fantasy. I want to say it's a \\"utopian\\" genre, but it's not really that either. I'm more into books that can realistically happen in this time period.<br /><br />It wasn't until my best friend, who has remarkably similar taste in books as me, told me I *NEEDED* to read The Hunger Games, that I decided to give it a try. I've been hooked ever since, and I can't wait to see the movie March 23rd!<br /><br />The characters are well-developed and the whole idea of the book is incredibly unique. I recommend this book to everyone I know.
B0038VPB5W|5.0|I love Bullet For My Valentine! I will soon be working on obtaining the other released albums. I want more!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I can't believe these guys did what they did.  Watching the vids its like entering a time warp to a magical place that I find it hard to believe ever existed.  Bonzo (Bonham) blows my mind.  The footage of him playing and his progression over the years is fantastic to watch.  Jimmy Page and his blues guitar, his slick fun moves, what a master.  And Robert Plant shows that being a pretty boy or being a god can be one and the same.  John Paul in his quiet way, holding the band together.  And his sublime mandolin on the ballads at Earl's Court, missed if you aren't careful.  These guys and this footage changed the way I will think about music forever.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|So much has already been said -- there are positive and negative reviews everywhere -- but my advice is -- sit back and enjoy the opportunity to enter a world we will never know -- upstairs or downstairs at a time when mechanized warfare hadn't yet arrived as it would with WWI.  The life of men and women rich or poor was very different back then -- the world was a full blown patriarchy and it was about to be blown away on the winds of war which brought social, political, economic, scientific  and every other kind of change to the lives of people everywhere.<br />The scenery in and outside of the house is wonderful, the costumes are sublime, the story is a soap opera but then Dickens wrote soap operas that left you hanging until the next chapter appeared in the newspaper -- this is the same -- at times the plotting is clumsy and predictable, the language lacks poetry, but the people, their problems -- loves, hates, deaths, wants and needs etc are universal and we want to know how things work out for them.  I defy anyone to watch and arrive at the end of an episode and not ask \\"what's next\\" -- even if you suspect what's next -- the fun is in the watching.<br /><br />To all who've watched and enjoyed this series, I recommend the Masterpiece version of \\"Brideshead Revisted\\" which premiered 30 years ago, the gloriously entertaining \\"The Duchess of Duke Street\\" from the 1970's, and \\"The Jewel in the Crown\\" -- all of them are marvelous and if you want more of the same \\"I,Claudius\\" -- a true masterpiece from Masterpiece.

B005COO1X6|2.0|I don't normally write reviews and do not wish to bash Mr King, so i will just say that it's really not worth the $2.99. Amazon seems to have stopped informing us of the number of pages. I read this in an hour and was completey disappointed. It has the makings of a good read, but should be listed more for children than adults. it wasn't the least bit scary, since by reading the write up, you knew about the car and the people that disappear. The ending was silly. When discribing the car \\"puckering and popping, all I could picture was a cartoon. I'm not saying it was the worst book ever, I just wish they adjusted the price to fit the length. As I was looking at how much i had left to read, I expected more, then \\"poof\\".....done. The last %20 was an excerp from 11/22/63, which i have heard is FANTASTIC!, But what's the point of an excerp, escpecially since it seems to be part of the $2.99 I paid for the hour long read.

B0072GPPNC|5.0|I have read the book on my Kindle Fire. I already identify with the boy. My first \\"Great Love\\" was a horse I met when I was 7 years old. Her name was Dot & she was a pinto. This is a story for me as I was broken-hearted when she was sold. I found out where she was & talked my father into taking me there twice for short visits.<br />I have seen the TV program on creating the puppets for the Broadway play. Would love to see it. The puppets are ALMOST unbelievable. I know horses and they move just like the real thing.<br />I expect a good story with beautiful images.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|Probably because they're a group that's been knocking about for decades, Yes has gone through many transitions.  The first was the \\"Try this to get famous\\" stage, which was their first two albums, and then there was the classic prog-rock lineup that kinda started at the Yes Album, and ended with Tormato.  There was the short-lived Downes / Horn version of Yes that put out Drama, and then disbanded.  What resurrected was a very pop-friendly Yes with Rabin in control (though Trevor Horn produced their Grammy-winning album) which lasted a few albums.  What followed after was a confused group that put out a lot of sporatic stuff...which I can't complain too much about because I LOVED Magnification.<br /><br />So Jon Anderson can't tour, the group decides to go on with a replacement singer.  Ok.  Not sure how that's going to play out.  Anderson is one of the cornerstones of the group.<br /><br />Well, in Fly From Here Benoit ends up becoming a Trevor Horn clone.  Consequently, this album has the same feel as the 1979(ish) Drama album...mainly because a good portion of it was written for Drama, and then shelved.<br /><br />Consequently, Drama had one of the few radio-friendly songs that ever got airplay for Yes: Tempis Fugit.<br /><br />In fact, listening to this album has almost the same EXACT feel as Drama, and not-so-coicidently the same players.  Trevor Horn, however, only produces, but it is clear he leaves his fingerprints all over this work.  Is that a bad thing?  It depends on which version of Yes you want.  I liked most incarnations of Yes, though the Trevor Rabin years I found a bit tiresome.  However, I really liked Drama, and thus I like this album...a lot.  Some very catchy tunes, some drawn-out works, and lots of variety.  In my opinion, while the classic Yes years has their variations, the music presented here has a certain dream-like, fantastic quality to it; more subtle than their other works.<br /><br />If you're one of the people who look for the classic lineup, this probably isn't the album for you.  If you liked Drama, you'll definately like this album.

B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is great on the Kindle Fire.  It has cute graphics, but is difficult enough to appeal to hardcore gamers, too.  The challenges are really fun to try to beat.  Most are easy enough that your confidence stays high, and some are harder so that when you complete them, you can actually feel a sense of accomplishment.  For the people that don't like OpenFeint, you can turn it off, just look in the &quot;news&quot; section of the menu for instructions.  For those who use Feint, the achievements on this game, like all games, are fun to try and beat.  There are different obsticles to dodge, and if you collect enough nuts, you can buy upgrades in the shop, such as a crash helmet or a magnet.  The only problem with this game is that sometimes it gets very laggy and that can cause frustrating collisions with trees that you couldn't even see coming, let alone avoid.  Once that is fixed, this game will be awesome.
0812992792|4.0|...why is this darkness and this evil allowed to exist?  There is a hell on earth and it is North Korea.  The Orphan Master's Son introduced me to a new level of the horrors that power-mad leaders can impose on their subjects. I will never forget this book.<br /><br />In a story filled with unimaginable pain and paranoia, one paragraph stood out.  Jun Do is listening to the captain of the fishing vessel recount a story about being a Russian captive.  As he listens, Jun Do reflects on the fact that the captain's story is too emotional and therefore pulls the listener's minds from giving all their emotional thoughts to Dear Leader - and the penalty for telling such stories is death.<br /><br />Is there anything the demonic, maniacal Kims did not steal from these lovely people?  Even their innermost thoughts and reactions are \\"owned\\" by the Dear Leader, not to mention every other aspect of their lives. There can be no such thing as \\"family\\" as we know it, because family is used as a spying tool, as a means of blackmail, and as a means of control.  How can you love freely when you know that loved person could be snatched away at any moment simply for telling a story that is deemed \\"too emotional\\"....?<br /><br /> It is nearly impossible to relate to this kind of brainwashing, but the book does an incredible job of showing how the human spirit can triumph.  It was a very difficult subject matter, and I had to put it down more than once, but I'm glad I read it.

B002PMPTIO|4.0|Well, I have watched this movie a few times now over the last couple of years and thought that I'd chime in with a little review about it myself. I'd love to give this film a 5 star rating, I really would, but I just can't bring myself to do it. Sure it has all of the elements that make for a great Sci Fi action movie, which is one of my favorite movie categories ever. It's got great space battles, cool spaceships, weird aliens, exciting action sequences, and some of the greatest characters that ever graced TV and movie screens, Captain James T. Kirk, Spock, Bones McCoy, Scotty and all of the rest. I practically grew up with Star Trek and have loved it since I can remember--But, this movie just has way too many flaws that are hard to ignore.<br /><br />Firstly, I don't really have much of a problem with the cast, I think that for the most part they picked some pretty decent actors to represent the U.S.S. Enterprise crew. My problem with it mostly is that while the makers of this film had a good and noble idea to try and make Star Trek more exciting to modern day viewers by making it more action-packed like a Star Wars movie, BUT, they ended up copying just a little bit too much from Star Wars for my liking. You've heard it all before I'm sure and I don't want to drag down on this review with a lot of rehashed complaints that other reviewers have already exponentionally expounded on but, [Spoiler Alert!] the scene where Kirk gets exiled on the frozen planet Delta Vega, I mean, come on...I was thinking at the back of my mind about Luke Skywalker on Hoth all the way during this scene. But, then again, what other kind of planet surface haven't the Star Wars films already been featured prominently on? We've got desert landscapes, jungle landscapes, frozen wastelands, swamps, I mean, there's only so many landscapes available to strand Kirk on, but...Oh well. Anyway...<br /><br />Time travel. C'mon now, enough already with the time travel storylines. It's been way overdone in the Star Trek universe. And Romulans?! Enough already with them as well! The last movie before this one featured the villain Shinzon, which, while not an actual Romulan himself, was a clone of Captain Picard created by the Romulans for nefarious purposes, but...He was bald, and while not an actual Romulan, is still pretty much similar to the bald Romulan villain in J.J. Abrams movie, Nero, without all of the cool facial tattoos of course. Hmmm? Facial tattoos...Darth Maul anyone? I mean, Come on J.J., did you even watch Star Trek Nemesis? It wasn't released that long ago. And yes, Klingon enemies have been overdone in the Star Trek films and shows too, but still I would have much rather preferred seeing Klingons make another appearance as the main villains in your movie again besides anything having to do with the Romulans so soon after Star Trek Nemesis.<br /><br />And the total destruction of the planet Vulcan? Are you kidding me?! Not only was that just plain overkill, it reminded me a lot of the scene in Star Wars where the evil Grand Moff Tarkin blows up Princess Leia's home planet Alderaan.<br /><br />And Leonard Nimoy gets to have a major role in the movie, but you can't even give a teensy weensy tiny cameo appearance to the main man himself, William Shatner?! Not cool.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the relationship angle between Spock and Uhura.<br /><br />There's more, much, much more that I could bitch about concerning this movie, but I won't. Others before me have already done a good job of that. Besides all of the above, why do I still enjoy this movie so much? Because it's great escapist entertainment to waste a couple of hours of your life with. It's exciting, fun, and let's face it, it's better than no Star Trek movie at all...and it's still way better than Star Trek Nemesis!<br /><br />I have read that they are currently working on a sequel to this movie, which I am really looking forward to seeing. It is scheduled to be released in theaters sometime next year in glorious anamorphic 3D. And all of the original cast are returning once again as well. I don't know about you but, personally, I can't wait to see it.<br /><br />Live long and prosper.aters sometime next year in glorious anamorphic 3D.

B001EAWMGA|5.0|A neat Sci Fi slash monster flick with a touch of Adventure and Viking lore.  Sounds like a mash of genres but it works well and manages to engage and entertain, which all movies set out to do in the first place.  It was unfortunately screwed over by the Weinsteins as it wasn't properly marketed and given a chance to succeed at all.  With stars like Caviezel, Hurt and Perlman it had top line actors and a good supporting cast to give this film the right ingredients to make this film the cult classic it will destined to be in the years to come.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|Took me just under 20 hours to pass this game. Not exactly Final Fantasy but is worth a play. Also, try out Grinsia; the graphics are a bit better then in this one, although the fighting is slower.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|What a great example of what a father should be! All men should watch this movie with there sons and discuss it's contents. It is time we men take the higher road and be the example the Lord wants us to be. Excellant move!
B006PHD0RW|4.0|This is a fun game.  I enjoyed playing through the levels, some of which took several attempts to solve.  Better than average app.  Easily played on my kindle fire with no bugs or problems.  Appropriate for all age groups.

0312641893|5.0|4.5 stars. Cinder is retelling of the classic Cinderella story, but with a fantastic sci-fi twist. Since I love retellings, I've been looking forward to this one and it was even better than I expected!<br /><br />Kudos to Marissa Meyer for making our futuristic Cinderella a cyborg which may sound weird, but it totally works for this book. The novel is set in New Beijing, a city rebuilt after the fourth world war. The world building is awesome and when I read about the setting of New Beijing, I could not help but think of scenes from one of my all time favorite sci-fi movies, Blade Runner. While Cinder is not dark like Blade Runner, there are the hovercrafts, Asian influences and androids that remind me of Cinder.<br /><br />A big change from the original fairytale is instead of one villain, there are two. Adri is Cinder's stepmother but she is really the wife of the man who adopted Cinder. He died shortly after the adoption and Adri has hated Cinder ever since. Adri is bitter, petty and does her best to put Cinder down. While we hate Adri for bullying Cinder, the real threat is from Queen Levana, ruler of a race of people with paranormal abilities who inhabit the moon. Levana is evil, manipulative and cunning with plans to rule Earth, but she needs to marry Prince Kai to put her plans into motion.<br /><br />Cinder is a very likable character. She has a bad home situation that she desperately wants to escape from, but of course, her destiny is more entwined with Prince Kai and the Lunars than she can ever imagine. There is more to Cinder than meets the eye and it is easy to figure out very early in the novel. With Adri's verbal abuse and Cinder's insecurities over her cyborg enhancements, it's easy to empathize with her, especially when Prince Kai flirts with her and Cinder thinks she is not good enough for him.<br /><br />I don't feel that I got to know Prince Kai well enough in this book. A few portions of the novel were told from his perspective and we see that he is a nice guy who puts the safety and well being of his people before his own happiness. He is sarcastic, smart and completely swoon worthy. His friendship with Cinder is sweet and leaves room to grow and develop. I really hope we get a lot more of Kai in upcoming books because he has the potential to become one of my favorite book boys.<br /><br />Cinder does not end with a cliffhanger but leaves you wanting so much more! Cinder is an awesome debut novel and I hate that I have to wait until next year to read the sequel. This is one of my favorite retellings and I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Content: Kissing and some violencee is a nice guy who puts the safety and well being of his people before his own happiness.

1609611543|2.0|This book was referred by a friend, I was told this was finally the answer and it was simple. I couldn't wait for it to arrive and read it with great anticipation. It started out great and kept repeating over and over Lose the wheat lose the weight. I read on with the excitement of Ralphie on the Christmas Story about the secret decoder ring. I knew I could kick the wheat thing and finally get on top of the weight thing. As I read on and on my excitement grew because I had discovered the secret. LOSE THE WHEAT LOSE THE WEIGHT. Then at the very end, much to my great disappointment, it dropped the bomb shell. You really do lose the weight, but not by losing the wheat, you have to do what all diets do. As I searched for the stuff I could eat, the list was very small. Not only did I have to give up wheat, I had to give up just about everything else but plants and occasionally a piece of lean meat or a fish. This book is a scam with a deceiving title. It even says to stay away from glutton free food. As always, if you want to lose weight and get healthy. Eat less and move more. That is the entire weight loss plan for humans period. Save your money and don't buy this book
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It has everything you need, and its better than the default stickies. If you need to, you can share your notes via email, text, etc. I use it for just about everything!!!
B0061S073A|4.0|My two year old loves to play with my Kindle Fire. I like it that I can use this app to limit which apps she uses. Of course the limitation is easy to defeat by rebooting the Kindle, but by the time she figures that out, she will be at an age where I can trust her more.  Good, useful app.
0679882820|5.0|I love all the small Dr Seuss board books. my baby likes the rhymes and the pictures. the stories are short enough to keep her attending at 8 months but not so short that there is nothing to it. it's just the right size for her little hands to hold. I wish there were more as we already have them all! the ABC book is great.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|I beat all of level one the day I bought it, so its pretty easy, but after that, its boring. The other levels are ridiculously hard or stupid. I finally found that I liked 'Ultimate Bagger', after about a week of playing this game. Turned it on to play today, and all my progress is gone! Everything! I don't even feel like starting over currently, its rather aggrivating.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I love it but there is no niv or nlt offline that is not very good because my pastor preaches out if nib 1985
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Since I saw these movies in the theatre I loved them. The Quality of the blu-Ray is amazing! I fully recommend this trilogy!!
B000P1KTW8|5.0|This Is Incrideble on Blu Ray. The concert Itself Is so good and the run down of songs much different than his uaual. Yet everyone plays In such harmony, this Is one more fine recorded performance of the Boss doing his thing, and has become a perfectionist In his music. These are all great songs given they not his usual hits live. But that's the reason It such a good performance. This one If you like Bruce at all and have a Blu Ray get In Blu Ray It's an unbelievable sharp picture with no guards In the way.  I think your going to love this If your looking at It.  Honestly

B001TZQITM|3.0|Alright, I would like to say although this bag is stylish, rugged, and seemingly well built... it is just incredibly small. I purchased this bag to house my GoPro HD camera, along with accessories. It is a tiny camera, and although all the reviews stated that it's size was small I really suggest seeing this in a store and gauging its size for your application before you purchase.<br /><br />I was able to fit my GoPro + Housing + Most mounts. The side and front pockets are not large enough to hold much of anything and I think are more of a stylish add-on then anything else. I've included pictures of my camera application within this bag. Things fit, somewhat. I'd rather something a little more roomy and it doesn't fit nearly all my accessories.<br /><br />This bag really is for a medium sized camcorder, a couple batteries, SD cards, and that is about it. For now I'll keep my GoPro crammed in it just as a storage type thing but I am still searching for something better. I do have a pelican case, and while that is to the extremes of protection it too doesn't offer much in the way of space.<br /><br />3 Stars for Stylish, Rugged, Seemingly well built. Slightly over priced and the size are reasons I choose not to give this above a 3 Star Rating however.
B000000I42|5.0|The title says it all. This is the epitome of amazing! It may not be the number ONE Misfits album/etc but it's in the top!

0955153077|5.0|Received this book this week and I must say I am thoroughly happy with it. As I expected from the preview I've seen on 3DTotalPublishing's site, this book is not only intended for those just beginning to learn about painting in Photoshop, but instead presents rendering techniques valuable even for professional artists, like some of the artists presenting this book state(for example Kekai Kotaki from ArenaNet's \\"Guild Wars\\" and Daarken). Still, if you're looking for a more images-filled type of book this is not the one for you, since it goes in-depth providing a lot of written information and just the necessary amount of imagery. Each chapter of the main parts is written and illustrated by an artist who presents his own approach, but following the matter of study. You will also be provided with a reminder inside the book to download the accompanying resources for the tutorials in this book from 3DTotalPublishing's site(there you can also see a small format full preview for this book)<br /><br />The book starts off with the basics: presenting the Photoshop workspace, optimizing it for your own needs and in accordance to your computer's resources, introducing the main features such as working with colors, brushes, textures, blending modes, how to establish composition, perspective and basic tonal values, using photographs for texturing or as matte painting bases, working with masks, wand tool, filters and more. Great insight for beginners and medium-level users of PS.<br /><br />It continues with art fundamentals, where you will find a more in-depth presentation of what makes a painting good or great. Lighting, value, color, composition, perspective and depth, portraying emotions in your character or landscape and even storytelling. You will learn about the Fibonacci number and his \\"golden ratio\\", different types of perspective and much more. A very insightful chapter with extended text supported by just the right amount of images, as with the rest of this book.<br /><br />A \\"complete project\\" chapter follows then, basically presenting you with the creation of a finished piece of digital painting using all the info previously presented in the book. Take it as a revision of some sorts, combined with an in-depth, step-by-step tutorial. Great for evaluating your own learning speed and process.<br /><br />The book goes on to hands down type of practice, showing you how to create speed paintings dealing with SF character and landscapes, paint your piece using only tonal values of grays and only afterwards apply the color glazes, how to create a finished piece using elements of photos and combining them with digital painting - a technique known as matte painting, widely used in feature films' concept design -, and finally how to tackle fantasy landscapes, in this case an eery skull-canyon-like view overlooking a river and waterfall. Starting with this chapter and continuing until further you will probably see how the pages at which you find certain chapters don't coincide anymore with the pages given in the Contents page. Or at least that's how it is in my own copy's case.<br /><br />The \\"Project overviews\\" chapter deals once again with step-by-step processes of different artists' finished pieces. Again the emphasis is more on text, but you get a decent amount of images also. Personally I appreciate the written part more, since it allows one to use the given techniques in his or her own way, without the pressure to make the final piece as likely in style as the artist's work.<br /><br />\\"Quick tips\\" is an extremely well-made chapter in my opinion, presenting you with short and concise \\"how to\\" approaches on different tricky elements, such as trees, sandstorms, smoke, underwater, skin, make something look wet, all those detail things which make a painting come alive.<br /><br />And finally the \\"Breakdown gallery\\" is the major eye-candy part of this book for those who were looking forward to it, you basically get step-by-step kind of tutorials containing only 5 images each - including the finished artwork -, so it's up to you to pay attention and observe since you don't get any text accompanying them. However, after a book packed full of text and information, you should be able to analyse and decipher what and how each artist used in every step in order to achieve the final result.<br /><br />And that's about it. All in all a great book which offers you all the necessary information without cluttering too many pictures, allowing you to use the given tips in your own way and creating your own image, not just style-copies. Definitely worth its money and then some.

This product looks sharp as well as easy to put together. Yes its for the international version but it still fits<br />the AT&T \\"domestic\\" (for lack of a better word)version. The only difference is that it comes with a screen protector as well and it has an opening<br />at the bottom of it (as stated in the video review) and I'm not using it either.<br /><br />This case is awesome best money I spent for my phone ever!

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This film was amazing. It made me laugh, it made me cry, but most importantly it made me commit to being a better mother.  The spiritual aspect was great, though I would like to see more spirituality in these films than is normally portrayed.  It even made a good impression on my kids.  They like seeing films that support their own Christian convictions because they don't get too much support in that area with most of their peers and out in the world.  It makes them feel that they aren't so strange after all and supports them in continuing to walk the walk with Jesus.  We are looking forward to the next film by these amazing folks!

B004A8ZWVK|1.0|I don't usually like a movie as much as the book, but \\"The Help\\" did not disappoint.  The acting was superb - especially Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer.  They both deserve the Academy Award and I thought that the moment I first saw the movie.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they both receive this award on Sunday.  I also loved the clothes - took me back to the 60s when we dressed that way!  An excellent movie - deserves all the accolades it will surely receive on the 26th of February.

B000GCFY0I|5.0|Loved it!! Took me a while to get into it but once I was, I couldn't put it down. It has a Hunger Games feel to it for sure but it's definitely its own story. It was different, exciting, kept you interested, and it wasn't predictable. I enjoyed the characters and storyline. It was enough to make me want to read the entire trilogy...and I did.
0761169253|5.0|The book arrived today. I'm already finished with it. This is not a bad thing at all, in fact, the book was exactly the length I wanted it to be. I couldn't put it down although it really is a one day read. I'm thinking about it now, I'll be thinking about it tomorrow and will look at it again soon and likely find entirely new inspiration. It's an honest, straightforward book that helps you consider how you can make more. I've been a fan of Austin's work for a while now. Now I'm a fan of his writing. Buy this, it's good and good for you. And yes, I know I don't know you, but that's irrelevant. In the beginning Austin mentions that this book is for anyone. At first I thought that was insane. Most books are written for someone, not for everyone. And those that are written for everyone tend to suck. Having finished it, I can't think of anybody who wouldn't benefit by even only flipping these pages through their fingers. Except for those who don't want to make anything and well... there's really no helping them.  Bottom line and long rant/review short, do yourself a favor (or someone else for that matter) get this book.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Our family really likes this movie and we were happy to get another copy - not sure what happened to our original copy!  This movie is not fast-paced.  One needs to sit with a mug of hot chocolate or tea or glass of wine and just relax and enjoy the story!
0385535139|5.0|I've read all of JG's fictional works, and The Litigators is my new favorite. Grisham's dialog, while always on the cutting edge, is razor sharp throughout his latest edition. The characters are typical of this author but with a little added zing of humor and sarcasm. It's as though Grisham read a few of Carl Hiaasen's hilarious Florida crime romps(Stormy Weather, Skin Tight, etc) and took some cues on how to make a sleazy cast of characters more lovable. He succeeds masterfully in hooking you in to the David vs. Goliath scenario where the heroes are of course the hopeless and hapless David et al. taking on the powerful pharmaceutical giant in a suit they have absolutely no prayer of winning but which has the very real potential to totally bankrupt their small firm.  When not in the courtroom attempting to defend their defenseless suit, David is otherwise engaged in pursuing an elusive but massively lucrative product liability claim which has the very real potential to make their small firm famously wealthy. In between the two, he juggles one partner in rehab, one recovering from a heart attack, and an office manager who wishes everyone would just go away and let her have her morning coffee in peace. It's high entertainment in classic Grisham form. He's baaaack!

B000KGGLCU|5.0|In comparison with the dvd coming from \\"Sticky tour\\", this one is almost a masterpiece. I panned the first one a few months ago and I am not gonna change my opinion.<br />\\"The confessions tour\\" was excellent almost in every aspect. The songlist, the visualizations, the dancers, the stage production. I was especially amazed by some of the versions of her hits.<br />My favourite tracks are: \\"Erotica\\" (wow!), \\"Paradise (not for me)\\" sung together with Isaac, \\"Substitute for love\\" simple, but beautifully delivered) and of course energetic \\"Hung up\\".<br />Madonna shows here that she truly is the queen of pop.<br />There are only two things that I could complain about.<br />The audio cd contains only some of the songs from the concert. It's a pity. And they could have added some more extras to the dvd.<br />Otherwise, two thumbs up!

1439102724|2.0|First off, let me say that I am an avid reader, but this was my first Picoult book. I read it for a book club.<br /><br />I did not like this book very much. I felt the story line was very \\"been there, done that\\". I also felt no real emotion for the characters. Maybe it's because of where I live. I live in NYC, where being gay is socially acceptable. So I don't really buy the \\"feel bad for me because I'm gay\\" thing. To me, this book was very boring.

You are the best of the best and I thank you for keeping us safe.<br /><br />As per the book; I found myself racing to finish it. Not because I was enthralled, but because I was having trouble with the writing. I think it was the lack of emotion, and personal insight. Mr. Kyle is honest about his actions and feelings about the military command. Still we never really get a glimpse beneath the rough exterior that Kyle wishes to project.<br /><br />I learned a lot about war and what our troops have to face in the field, but I feel as if Kyle spends too much space trying to project the image of a \\"bad ass\\" at the expense of the flow of the book.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this product has made my life easier, I have given up blow, alcohol and one night stands because evermore filled the hole in my life and nasal cavity with something meaningful. THANK YOU EVERNOTE!
B000ZJTPLG|3.0|Does what it's suppose to. Hear more than playing unplugged. Aux-in is a hoot, great for those late night sessions. Sound output is what you would expect. AAA batteries don't produce sufficient voltage to get humbuckers to produce mounds of pickup. If your looking for nuanced sustain and sensitivity to finger pressure forget it. My Les Paul and Strat sound flat. Is what it is. Something cute to plug in and work your scales.
B005723JSQ|5.0|An excellent light hearted read that will have you simultaneously wincing at the dreadful situations the heroine gets into and laughing your head off at the way she handles them. Sophie Kinsella is the best at torturing her characters. I loved this book--money well spent for the entertainment it gave me. Buy it, you won't be sorry!
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app is good on kindle fires it is awesome I love this app for some dumb reason I cant get yiutube on my kindle but when I saw this app I was berry happy get this app if you like free apps videos and if you have a kindle and you like youtube<br />P.S. you can even downlode music vidoes ;)
B004UHSB5A|4.0|Nice game. Works well on HTC Rezound. Good time waster while waiting in line or for an appt. I wish the tile panel didn't wrap around, but had a hard stop at the start and end.
B005ZHB84U|5.0|Enjoyable and entertaining Cd. A very amazing music that is  the natural following to the first Sherlock Holmes soundtrack . Stronh rythms , sometimes even thrilling but always very pleasurable. Don't miss it if you like this kind of movies and this kind of music.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is such a heartwarming movie for the whole family.  Helps to see things from all perspectives.  Made me laugh and made me cry.  I did a lot of soul searching after watching this movie.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I just purchased this cover for my Kindle Fire and its great! It def keeps my screen scratch free in my purse!  It is light weight, and has a strap on the back so when you fold it up, you can secure it on!  You can also prop it up, which is great for watching movies!
B0012Z361C|5.0|I received the item two days after I placed the order, and the dvd is perfect. I can't wait to watch it!
B006ON41FC|5.0|This app is really fun and addictive. I play this game all the time. When I go to the gym this is one of the first games I play. Everything is easy control.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|Tiles are much too small. Surprising to see on the Kindle Fire. There is plently of screen space to make tiles larger. Also, you need to place the tiles &quot;just so&quot; or they won't move where you want them to.<br />Too bad it has these two main issues, otherwise, the game is a fun time waster if you need to kill 10 to 20 minutes while waiting in a doctor's office, etc.
B003ES5ZPK|1.0|For the price I can't \\"Hate\\" it but it didn't work for me. At first I thought is didn't support high speed HDMI signal 1.4b or whatever, but after seeing these reviews I guess it was DOA.  Hard to believe too with the bullet proof box it was shipped in.  $34 for similar products at the Buy More.  Hoping to find something that works.
B004UHSB5A|5.0|thank you for teaching me to play dominoes. I always wanted to learn. I played straight 3 hours before I finally won, but it was fun! IMO, needs win/lose percentage tracking, and multi player would make it better.
B003UESJHE|1.0|The Blue Ray version of the DVD \\"The King's Speech\\" will not play on my Samsung 3-D Blue Ray disc player, purchased from Best Buys in August 2010, but instead sends messages that the player \\"needs updating\\".  I have tried to replace the disc, but find the replacement is the same.  I am unable to create a review of this purchase simply because it gave me nothing to review.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I've been a Metallica fan for a long, long time. They are still one of my favorite bands of all time. Everyone knows they have had more than a few low points in their long and wildly successful career, but this has to be the lowest. I'd like to point out that I'm about as open-minded as can be when it comes to music. I was a metal-head all-the-way when I when I was younger, but I've since broadened my musical horizons significantly and I now have a vast collection spanning many genres. I feel it's important to mention this, because I'm especially disappointed with how Lars Ulrich has handled the critical backlash of this \\"album\\" by consistently writing off the negative reception with a condescending attitude. More or less Ulrich's retaliation has been \\"our narrow-minded metal fans just don't get it because it's not straight forward thrash metal album\\" (to paraphrase of course). They made it very clear, before this was released, that it was NOT going to be anything like a Metallica record, and that it was going to be very strange and different. I was very excited about hearing Metallica play a style that is out of their normal realm, even though I've never been a fan of Lou Reed or The Velvet Underground.<br /><br />However, that is not at all what I got.<br /><br />What I got was Metallica playing uninspired, generic, repetitive Hard Rock/ Metal riffs, with Lou Reed rambling like a psychotic pee-paw, out of tune, out of time, and seemingly without rhyme or reason (both figuratively and literally).<br /><br />I get what they were trying to do here, I really do. Lulu was suppose to be a simple, dark, abrasive, uncomfortable, and awkward journey for the listener, and it is, just not in a good way. I forced myself to listen to the album, scratching my head. I failed. I made it about half way through before I gave up. Listening to this album was sonic torture for my ears. This was a disaster. The only way I can rationalize why-on-earth they allowed this pile to be released is purely out of Metallica's respect for Lou Reed, not being able to say \\"no\\" or back out.<br /><br />I listened to this album as soon as it was released. The reason I've, just now, decided to review it is because I'm disgusted by Lars Ulrich's continued disillusioned attempts to qualify this album as a respectable work of art which is simply not understood by their fan base. The truth is: the only reason anyone even gave this garbage a listen is BECAUSE you have a large, loyal fan-base.<br /><br />Metallica has always been an incredibly talented group, and I would totally be open to listening to them play music outside of their norm, but if this is suppose to be a real example of that, I guess they should just stick to the thrashing.

B001F3FUK6|2.0|Spoiler Alert!  During superman's 5 yr absence from the world's stage, Lex Luther breaks into the fortress of solitude and steals the combined intellect/history of all the planets in all the known galaxies, however the only diabolical plan that the world's smartest, most dangerous, criminal can come up with, is to make land.  Think about that for awhile, let it sink in.  Luther purposes that once most of the world is under water, from the water displacement caused by his new continent, they will have to pay him to live on his new island.  Well, Lex, with no arms or soldiers, how do you plan on keeping power?  Huh, did you think about that?  We also discover that Superman has a son by Lois, who is allergic to everything on earth but kryptonite, lol.  The kid has super-strength but could one day be killed by the common cold, what a joke. I will say that Superman and Luther are portrayed well and this new actor playing superman carried the movie, which was dedicated to Christopher Reeves, which makes it a must see!

B003B02O14|3.0|The Partner is a typical Grisham novel about a lawyer who has a secret, hatches a plot, and gets caught.  Most of the novel is about the lawyer, Patrick Lanigan, trying to save himself from being convicted of a crime.  Like most Grisham novels this one has twists and surprises and enough of a plot to hold my attention.  Unlike so many of the other reviewers, I really liked the ending.  I thought it was a perfect twist and a great conclusion to the book.  When I am in the mood for mindless entertainment, I often turn to Grisham and The Partner served this purpose well for me.  I was not stirred, changed, or left wanting more, I was simply entertained, which is exactly what I was wanting when I purchased this book.  So, 3 stars for an entertaining read.
B00007GZQZ|3.0|great film for Katrina victims enough said or understood  and unsaid Cheshire cat smiled to oblivion politics is the haven of stupid attorneys why can't they keep only one job
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I love courtroom dramas and this book is among the best. Weaved between the present and recent past, the author lulls you into thinking you know where the plot is headed - which is only half true. The book centers on a traditional three person family (mom, dad, and son), the severe dysfunction they endure, but is never seen, and the extraordinary actions that parents endure in the name of love for a child. I found the book's final twist to be extremely disturbing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|As far as Solitaire goes, it's a solid application. Nothing special, pretty straight forward. Never freezes, force closes, and runs well.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I really enjoyed \\"The Kitchen House\\".  Yes, it was dark.  Yes, it was full of horrifying actions.  But it is, after all,  a story of the lives  of a slave and an indentured servant In the antebellum south - these types of  characters do not typically lend themselves to feel good stories.  If you are looking for a southern belle, feel good, sappy love story this book won't be for you.  For me, despite the depressing nature of the story, I was  intrigued by the characters and the action kept my interest.  I quickly devoured this book and look forward to reading more from Kathleen Grissom.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|We fell in love with Downton Abbey last year, and were so happy that PBS picked up the 2nd season of this British series.  Imagine our delight at finding an uncut version?  We had heard swirling rumors that they \\"dumbed it down\\" for the American audience, so we were most anxious to see what had been cut.  We are not ready to begin the 4th episode, and so far we see very very little additional footage.  Maybe a sentence or two in some conversations, maybe an extended view of an outside scene, a few seconds here, a few seconds there.  So while I personally Enjoy the little extra bits, it's probably not worth purchasing if you already own the version shown in America, you have missed nothing so far in the way of storyline or even deeper character development.  I give the whole series five stars, but I am giving this marketing scheme 4 stars, deducting one for getting my hopes up and giving me nearly nothing.

0785132619|5.0|Kick-Ass follows Dave Lizewski, an ordinary high-schooler and comic nerd that dreams of being a superhero, and then decides to actually become one. He discovers that it isn't really easy to fight crime as an untrained sixteen year old, but he perseveres.  I watched (and loved) the Kick-Ass movie a while back, so I knew almost exactly what I was getting into with this book. The movie captures the feel of the book very well, even though the events in the book are somewhat different. The movie treats the characters more idealistically than the book. The book reminded me of [[ASIN:0930289234 Watchmen]] a bit, except that the scale is not so epic, and the mood is much less melancholy and much more optimistic.  I always feel a bit nervous about reviewing graphic novels, because I treat them just like any other book, and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to. I know that graphic novels have their own conventions etc., but I don't think I've read enough of them to be aware of them yet. I really enjoyed the way Kick-Ass was structured, but I'm not sure if that's just a function of the medium.  Anyway, I did really enjoy the book - it's hilarious, the characters are fun, and even though Dave is extremely foolhardy; I can't help but admire his perseverance. And of course, Hit-Girl is my favourite character, simply because she is such a badass (I sincerely hope that she never exists in real life, though.)  I should warn potential readers that there is a lot of violence and profanity from children etc, but overall, Kick-Ass is a very well done black comedy. I can't wait to read [[ASIN:0785152458 Kick-Ass 2]].
B002SSUQFG|5.0|this watch is great, smaller size as noted by other reviews, but with that comes lighter weight.  while i saw many complaints about the band I have none although i will replace it with a NATO style when it wears out.  transparent back is very cool as is the sweep of the second hand.  no loud second ticks here!<br /><br />highly recommended for someone getting into watch collecting since the price point is so low and features are good.<br /><br />my only complaint?  serial number is hard to find

B004UHSB5A|4.0|Game works perfectly on nexus s, but graphics are plain and small. The AI seems to get some advantages, but it could be the randomizer. It's kind of frustrating the computer could get over 60 points in the first few moves while I watched helplessly and loaded up with 12 tiles.
B00005JM1F|5.0|A great comedy. One of my top 10, if not top 5 favorite movies. Hilarious performances by most of the cast, and a great story about an off beat frat house. \\"You're my boy, Blue!!!\\" Grab this one up!

0345495004|5.0|This was a great book, unexpected and heart wrenching ending. Many of the issues that Mamah dealt with are still relevant today. Has a good introduction to the early struggles of the feminist movement and the ideas of the Swedish feminist Ellen Key. Additionally, if you are interested in the life of the architect FLW, this is an invaluable contribution to an aspect of his life that we know very little about. Makes me want to visit Taliesin and learn more about Midway Gardens.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I found Hunger Games to be an engaging read, I don't read a lot of YA material and this was a pleasant surprise. Ms Collins created a fairly simple and easy to follow distutopian society that is like 21st century United States more than people will be comfortable with. That's a plus in my book. The pacing and details regarding survival, suffering, food, physical trauma etc will be startling to most people in the YA crowd<br /><br />Saying that, Some of the concepts were kind of over the top and simplistic. The name of the nation, \\"Panem\\" for example which derives from \\"panem et circenses,\\" \\"bread and Games\\" seems a little harsh.<br /><br />Otherwise and finally, it was an enjoyable read,I'm looking forward to seeing the movie, and reading the other books.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This app is the best pdf reader around, but here in Amazon it doesn't getting updates as fast as in Android Market. At this moment this version it is 1.7.1, but in Android Market it's on 1.8.0.  So, it's your choice.

B004V5QWU2|3.0|Like other reviewers, I love that it lets you make your own mix. But earlier in 2012, it let you download only the sounds you wanted. I had  to reinstall it (and all my apps) and now the only options are to download all sounds or clear all sounds. Grr.  Feature request: a delay function so you can set sound mixes to wake up to with rising volume.
0316017930|4.0|Outliers, written by Malcolm Gladwell, is a story about success. While the story goes on, Malcolm explains and gives several examples of how success is achieved by several different individuals. There isn't just one way that this success is met by these select people, and that is what makes this book so interesting. He defines these successful people as Outliers, which in the beginning of the book is defined as, \\"something that is situated away from or classed differently from a main or related body.\\" These people have achieved such a high level of success, that they are considered \\"different\\" than the rest. While exploring the different scenarios, Gladwell uses great detail, and a lot of explanation on the topic he is discussing, so there is never confusion. Each chapter is about something different, so it keeps the reader interested instead of just sticking to one topic throughout the whole book. Gladwell uses some history to help explain the topics, so the reader has more background knowledge on the topic rather than just knowing that people were very successful. His use of words were another thing that stood out to me. He didn't use big words, and when there was something that needed to be expanded on, he expanded in italics at the end of the page. Overall, Outliers is a great book, and I recommend it to everyone!

B005LAIGOQ|4.0|I saw the prior 1989 film of this book made by British tv.  I've read the book.  I've heard it performed as an audio book.  I haven't seen the stage play of it.  This work thus exists in many, many forms and is very popular in almost all of them.<br /><br />This time the movie had a very lavish budget and starred Daniel Radcliffe as the lead. As a solicitor, he is called in to visit a distant village in order to settle an estate.  There he sees a ghost of a woman wearing funereal black. She is furious at everyone because her son drowned on the marsh and no one even bothered to dig up his body.  They are scared to death of her because certain disaster looms every time she makes an appearance. Sure enough disasters start to take place with the first one being a young girl who falls into his arms at the police station because she just drank lye.<br /><br />There is a bit of a rewrite on this version of the film towards the end. It resolves the ghost story more than it has been resolved in any other incarnation.  I am not sure that this is needed or necessary.  It does not ruin it though.<br /><br />It is a very good ghost movie.  It is scary.  The visual effects are great. However, I can't give it the 5 stars I gave the 1989 version.  That version, with a fraction of the budget, scared me so much that I was turning on lights, keeping my dog nearby and such whenever I was alone in the house. This version does not have that kind of horror punch, It seems the scariest movies often are made on a small budget.  Perhaps the lavish special effects make us too aware that it is a movie.<br /><br />Radcliffe does a fine job.  He is a fine young actor but then again he has been since he was a small boy. I think he will do fine now that the Potter films are over and he is no longer Harry Potter to us.  He is beginning to look less and less like Harry Potter which should help.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B002LC8HF0|5.0|As I came to the end of the Hero of Ages, I found myself in a mixture of emotions: I was utterly satisfied, as few books have ever done, yet at the same time sad; sad that this incredible journey through the world of Mistborn had truly come to an end. This has been one of the greatest series I have ever read.  Throughout each book, Brandon Sanderson leads us on, touring the alien world where the sun is red, the ashmounts constantly spew their soot, and people possess incredible powers related with metal.  At the thrilling end of The Well of Ascension, this book continues onto the climax of the series.  Throughout the storyline, we see not only the struggles of the characters as they face the end of the world, but we also see several very important messages woven throughout; the importance of faith, maintaining your morals in the face of difficult decisions, and the reality of something beyond this life. But not only do these lessons show, but they're bound up in a truly gripping revelation of the truth behind the legends, the secrets of the Steel Inquisitors, and the final destiny of the Hero of Ages. This series will be one I will recommend to all of my friends and to all those who love to read.

0316017930|5.0|Many people think they know what it takes to be successful; however, in his book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell's unique writing style and use of many different examples gives us an idea about normally overlooked factors of success.  This book is a must-read if you want to know more about what it takes to be successful.  As it turns out, there are a lot of hidden things that aren't common knowledge, such as family background, opportunities, and the 10,000 hour rule.  Gladwell does a great job of explaining all of them and provides his ideas with substantial facts and evidence to support his ideas.  If you think that being a genius automatically makes someone successful, you better think again.  You don't necessarily have to be super smart in order to become successful someday; you also need other skills, opportunities, luck, or all of them together.  This book will keep you thinking as you read about somewhat quirky things about outliers in the world of hockey players, computer whizzes, lawyers, pilots, and more.  Some of the people Gladwell discusses are well known, such as Bill Gates and the Beatles.  After hearing about many other people, you'll also hear the story about Gladwell's family history, which includes the overlooked factors of success he discusses in the book.  Overall, he did a great job of writing this book.  He ties it all together extremely well at the end by once again referencing all the outliers he talked about throughout it.  I would definitely read it again someday.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|Every time I tune into a film about Monroe, I find myself unable to look away.  I suppose I am like those people who stare at car crash scenes or crashed plane sites.  It is that kind of sensation.  And although this movie has many lovely moments, every time Marilyn is on screen, we are aware of such a potential crash scene waiting in the wings. Michelle Williams thus well deserves her Oscar nomination for capturing a period in her life wherein she still had fleeting moments of happiness but most of the time could feel disaster closing in on her.<br /><br />This is set in England while she was making PRINCE AND THE SHOW GIRL with Olivier. It is not one of her better movies although she is the best thing in it.  The problem in it was the massive ego of Larry Olivier and having that ego at the helm of the production as director. Monroe needed to be coddled through a film by a director with a handkerchief at the ready and a deep well of patience.  Olivier had neither. Colin, a young man who is third assistant director on the film helps take care of her while she is filming. Most of the time she is the Marilyn who is right at the edge of coming apart but she is still able to be delightful for brief periods and especially with this young man who is still an innocent compared to these vultures in the film industry.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh also does an excellent job playing Olivier and brings a great deal of humor to the film as he plays him so broadly at points that you are sure he is satirizing him. Branagh was an unexpected delight in this role.<br /><br />Williams looks uncannily like Monroe and I think she accomplishes this with some fairly simple tactics.  One, rather than being overly made up, which is what is usually done by those playing her, Williams instead goes for capturing the looks she was more famous for in her stills when she was a lot more natural looking. Two, Williams really worked on her voice and body movements and captured them very well.  We actually identify people every bit as much by those expressive motions and she nailed them.<br /><br />There isn't much plot here.  It is simply getting this picture made so she can be off.  We are so fascinated by her that any more plot would probably just get in the way.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000FQIRXQ|5.0|My purchase of this movie was a good choice. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition. This version of David Copperfield  is true to Charles Dickens' book. The powerful emotions of each character, not to mention the likeability (or hateability?) of the characters  makes this movie a moving and great choice for any buyer.
B004SZHIR6|3.0|This is a review of the Blu-ray version of the movie. The picture is superb and the audio is good, if not great. As far as the adaptation from the novels is concerned I don't think it has done them true justice. The movie is based on Pratchett's first 2 Discworld novels - The Color of Magic and The Light Fantastic. I had previously watched the HogFather and Going Postal on TV and enjoyed both immensely. Before watching this I chose to read the novels first. They were fabulous. If I had watched the video first I think I would have enjoyed it more, and then got further enjoyment from the books. By all means watch the movie and then read the books, IN THAT ORDER, otherwise you may be find the movie lacking, as I did.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a voracious reader, and I have been all my life, since the age of 7. There have been many books that I've liked, that I've enjoyed reading, but the ones that I've read, and didn't put down, and was sad because I had come to the end of the story are few.<br />Some come to mind, [[ASIN:0307743683 The Stand]], also King's Dark Tower series, all 7 volumes, [[ASIN:B0010SKONO The Baroque Cycle - First Editions - Volume One - Quicksilver, Volume Two - The Confusion, and Volume Three - The System of the World]], and some others. All these books I have not only read, but re-read, multiple times for the sheer joy they bring. Mr. Howey's \\"Wool\\" is now added to the list.<br />It is not just well written, many books are well written, but it is written in a fashion that gets you involved with the characters to the point that you want to be involved with them, they are real, and that is artistry.

I hope Puller becomes a series.  The more Reacher books the better.  It's kind of like all the books written in Jane Austen's style because fans can't get enough.  Of course, Lee Child is still alive, but if he doesn't mind, I sure don't.

0142410373|5.0|Roald Dahl's books are classic. Mathilda and Charlie and Chocolate factory are the best. In mathilda, story is weaved with great flow. The characters are serious, hilarious, genius and caring. The kids these days learn of discipline back in the days and how Mathilda through her strong reading skills and genius skills tackles peoples and makes friends. Any kid will love this book. There is a movie with same name that can be enjoyed after reading the book. Good for children ages 7 and up. Girls will especially love this.
0307352145|5.0|Albert Einstein was one of the more famous \\"introverts\\" who claimed, \\"Its not that I am so smart, its that I stay with the problem longer.\\"  Cain uses examples like this to highlight the inner workings and social contributions of the introvert type. In this case, introverts she explains are often better suited at quiet reflection, deep thinking and analytical problem solving.  Sufficient to say, this is not a book extolling the virtues of extroverts (who may squirm reading parts).  It is a rugged defense and forthright advocacy of the essential and irreplaceable roles, value and contributions of the introvert type.  This is a smart, well-researched and meaty book on the popular psychology topic of introverts compared to extroverts.  As such, it is less a simple \\"self-help\\" format and more investigative distillation of the various studies on the topic.  However, the research is presented in a casual, easy-to-read way that should not alienate or put off too many.  Its easy to see a next book by the same author - one less in scope but focused on applying the many powerful conclusions Cain's research for introvert personality types to gain new awareness and empowerment to shed any inferiority and use their powerful gifts to change the world.  Part of this research involves the latest findings of fMRI brain imaging.  Some of the conclusions are useful to the lay person, but the same person might roll their eyes with too many words like \\"orbitofrontal cortex,\\" \\"nucleas accumbum\\" and \\"amygdala\\" (regions of the brain) or sentences like \\"So where was his neocortex when he was chasing the stock market gains?\\"  Cain does not hesitate to apply such conclusions to take direct aim at \\"forceful extroverts\\" who took insane, excessive financial risks and nearly brought the financial world to near-disaster (while belittling the many introvert colleagues who warned them). She backs up such claims with key research points.  Parts I found of most interesting were:  - her fleshing out ofvarious definitions of extrovert vs. introvert (no one is 100% of either)  - her sub-division of highly sensitive individuals (HSI) and how they are so much more reactive to stimuli than extroverts  - how introverts are threat-sensitive oriented vs. the reward-driven orientation of extroverts  - the comparison of Asian values (largely introvert traits of listening first, quiet reflection, group moral dynamics) vs. American values (extrovert-dominated values like self-promotion, passionate communication and drive for achievement...).  Yet, she does a decent job to avoid stereotypes to get valid and useful insights across.  This book should have a serious place with professions like counselors, human resource professionals, educators, parents of super-shy kids and anyone identifying as an introvert.  At the end of the matter, author Cain makes a case for balance between action ... and reflection as she gives a new voice to the often ignored, less respected introverts of the world who should gain new insights and empowerment from Cain's solid and fresh contribution to the topic.

B004EPYZP8|3.0|This is a great movie. The plot, story and acting. Very different for Matthew McConaughey. However, the video I received is almost unwatchable. Half the screen is cut off. Not like wide view.  I ended up renting the movie to see it. Didn't want the hastle of the return to Amazon. The cost wasn't over the top. But I was disappointed in the quality.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|At first, I was a bit worried about buying this watch over the 305, because people in reviews often pointed out the less convenient interface on the 405 (or 405CX). After seeing it (and also seeing my friend's 305) I have to say they are pretty much on par. I'm sure the GPS technology is similar, and the touch bezel on the 405/405CX is not really that hard to use. Sure, it's no Apple touch pad, but you can easily get the hang of using it with minimal problems.  All in all, I'm happy with the accuracy of the GPS and the online training software on Garmin Connect. The heart rate monitor seems accurate (I took it out on similar runs and sure enough, the heart rate readings were essentially the same; no aberrations there).  My only problem is with the way pace/speed is displayed during the run. I realize it's virtually impossible for the watch to give your exact speed at any given moment because of the inherent error in satellite measurements. But what's the point in showing these erratic measurements on screen? Sometimes I get a pace of 5:30 min/km, then two seconds later it jumps to 6:30, and a few more seconds later bam! Back to 5. One time I even got 1:40 min/km... in your face, Usain Bolt! Anyway, if instead of showing the instantaneous speed, the watch would show the average speed for the last 10 seconds or something, that would make for a more stable and useful reading.  In general, I think it's a great training tool and a neat toy. The price is a bit steep if you ask me, but I guess you should expect that since Garmin has the whole market.

0061726826|5.0|Delirium has been one of the best, jaw-dropping, and intriguing novels I've read in a very long time.  I must admit, my reaction to Before I Fall wasn't that great, so I was a bit nervous... but Delirium delivered, and I can't believe I waited this long to read it.<br /><br />Everything about this novel is interesting.  The characters are intriguing... and there were definitely some twists I didn't anticipate.  Lets just say this novel had a lot more to it than I expected, and I loved it.  I'll start with the characters -- Lena specifically.<br /><br />Lena is a type of character that I love reading, you know where the character arc is probably going to go, however you don't necessarily know how they're going to go from \\"Point A\\" to \\"Point B.\\"  She starts out as an advocate for the procedure, and from the very beginning you think her best friend, Hana, is going to be a catalyst for change... but if anything Hana's feelings make Lena retract into herself and cling harder to what she's been brought up to believe.  It's this desire to cling to societal standards that solidified my thoughts on the fact that she'd be an interesting character to travel with.  Watching her morph from this one, rather \\"safe\\" character to this strong and independent character was fun -- the transformation also felt natural, and I think that's important.<br /><br />As for our male lead, Alex, I really enjoyed him. Lately I've been reading novels that I'd like to A) See more of the male lead, and B) Have the story, or at least part of the story, from their perspective.  I think I'd love to see this type of story from a male perspective.  Alex was just intriguing.  He wants, loves, and fights hard.  As much as we learn about him, since the book is through Lena's eyes... we don't necessarily get as many details as I would have liked.  We find out the basics about him, but not necessarily his complete, detailed, life story.  I'd love to know more about where he came from, what he's done, and what he wants in the future.  Perhaps we'll find out more as the series goes on... I'd really like that.<br /><br />As for plot?  I'd say this was fairly straightforward.  There was one twist I hadn't anticipated, actually make that one and a half (I half expected something, but I wasn't sure if it would actually happen. It did.).  With the few twists of this novel, the story was a lot more interesting than it would have been without them (such as most novels are, I suppose).  What made this story unique, rather than fading into the background of all the other great dystopian novels was the \\"love factor.\\"  I touched on this earlier, but what makes this novel stand out is the fact that it tackles the concept of love quite literally head on.  It's not even just romantic love, but familial and friendships.  When a novel focuses on all three it's instantly more interesting to me than a pure teen romance novel.<br /><br />(Also, quick setting side note, the setting is Portland, Maine... not Portland, Oregon, which is what I thought it was while reading.  I read \\"Portland\\" and I instantly think \\"West Coast!\\" Oops... haha.)<br /><br />So, if you're asking yourself whether or not you should pick up this novel, you are missing out on valuable time to be actually reading it.  The sequel is coming out soon, and I'm so glad I finished Delirium in time to pick Pandemonium up pretty much right away.aps we'll find out more as the series goes on... I'd really like that.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|I received this as a \\"deal of the day\\" and paid a measly $25 for it.  I couldn't be happier.  The Godfather trilogy, on Blu-Ray, for $25.  What's not to love?  I can't add more than the others about this series, but you know that at least the first two are generally regarded as some of the all time great movies in cinematic history.  Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Deniro...some of the all time greats.  Highly recommend.  Especially if you can get it cheap!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This little flash is perfect almost all the time and that's why I love it.  It serves every short to medium range need, provides perfect outdoor fill flash, and works in every iTTL situation.  It does not bounce in the verticle position.  And that's ok.  Most every picture that I take is horizontal.  I made and use a bounce card and the lighting is even and extraordinary.  Just like every other Nikon flash. So 80% of the time it is perfect.  20% of the time I might want to have a bigger more versatile flash, but I work around it. It is also so compact that I always have it with me. The SB-700/900 is simply too big to keep in a compact camera case and the occasional benefit to me is not worth it. If I were a professional event photographer, this would not be my primary flash.  I would still own one for travel and fill flash. Like many others, I do wish that Nikon would make an affordable in-between size flash with swivel and tilt. But until that happens, the SB-400 is perfect for me. It's not an ego flash. It's just a great flash.
B00005JNX0|2.0|This movie just isn't very funny and there's not much to the plot either. Animation is just OK. The lemur and penquin characters are relatively funny, but all the main characters just aren't. The movie fails to hold my 2 year old's attention for more than a few minutes, while he'll watch Finding Nemo and Toy Story in their entirety over and over. There are far better animated films out there for little ones and adults.
B004UHSB5A|1.0|I was excited to see this, but no graphics, small dominoes, and they do not move easy.  Game needs more work.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game with lots of options. keeps my kids busy!! the only down side is that you have to complete levels before you get enough points to open more games.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Pretty nice app, but freezes when you hit a spot in the game where there is no way to win.  Also, with this lastest update, if you accidently hit a wrong tile, half the tiles will be highlighted.  That's not toobad, unless you are like me and constantly trying to beat your score.  But overall, I recommend this game.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of Matthew McConaughey's (spelling?), but this has got to be one of his finest performances since A Time to Kill. This movie has a great blend of suspense, character arc, and story twists. McConaughey plays a lawyer who defends the unorthodox, and seemingly has no motivation except money. But when his client admits to being guilty, McConaughey finds himself in a moral dilemma. Highly recommended movie!
B006ZWLXZ8|3.0|When you buy an album released in the past couple years on vinyl, you buy it expecting certain things: The warmth and richness of the medium, actual album artwork, a download code/CD in order to have the music available on your computer/ipod/mp3 player, etc... This release has almost none of those things. It is not pressed on heavy vinyl, making flimsy and cheep feeling. It came in single fold with excruciatingly thin plastic wrapping reminiscent of discount record stores in the 80's. The single worst thing about this release though, is that there was no download code or CD to accompany it. Out of all the records I have bought in the past couple years, this is the only one to not have it. This basically forces you to either buy the album all over again, or pirate it, if you want to listen to it anywhere other than where you keep your turntable.
B004EPZ070|3.0|I'm hard pressed to remember the last time I was so indifferent watching a movie--especially a chick flick, when I'm apt to quickly reach for the remote and start surfing to find something more. . .pain-less.  Such was my experience watching SOMETHING BORROWED, a quirky (sort of) rom-com about BFF Rachel and Darcy (Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson), who've more or less been inseparable all their lives, with Rachel having some self-esteem issues while Darcy always gets her way (and would be fabulously fun to party with).  Thus Darcy is engaged to wimpy Dex (Colin Egglesfield), a dude Rachel has secretly been pining over since law school, and with the wedding rapidly approaching Dex suddenly reveals to Rachel that he, too, is smitten with Rachel, not Darcy.  Accordingly Rachel must decide whether to be happy with spineless Dex (who definitely needs a strong serving of testosterone), or remain bosom buds with Darcy.  Oh, what a dilemma!  And the movie swooshes to its predictable ending--although I'm darned if I remember what it is.<br /><br />And all of the above begs one pertinent question:  Why is John Krasinski in this flick?<br /><br />For all I know I baked a cake and knitted a sweater while watching SOMETHING BORROWED; I was that indifferent.  The only time the film had my undivided attention was when Goodwin and Hudson had a sweet little dance together.  Give me 90 minutes of that next time, as the film SOMETHING BORROWED was so vanilla it was akin to eating a piece of air.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
0761169253|5.0|If you've been paying attention to certain parts of the Web recently, you may be familiar with a rising chorus of voices talking about creativity as \\"remixing.\\"  The broad thesis is that creativity isn't a mystical flash of insight in the mind of a lone genius, but rather a combinatorial, collaborative process in which artists and designers consciously and gradually combine existing ideas into novel forms.  Books like \\"The Gift\\", by Lewis Hyde, and video series like \\"Everything is a Remix\\", by Kirby Ferguson, champion this burgeoning idea (and are name-checked by Kleon at the end of \\"Artist\\").  But if Hyde and Ferguson are the theorists charting the contours of these new ideas, Kleon is the practitioner, the man-of-artistic-action, bringing the means and the message to the people.<br /><br />\\"Steal Like An Artist\\" began as a lecture given by Kleon at Broome Community College that later emerged as a viral blog post.  Kleon makes no effort to hide the fact that the blog post forms the skeleton of \\"Artist\\".  But even if you've memorized the post, Kleon layers enough muscle and flesh on it that you feel like you're encountering his core ideas all over again.  The same rush of discovery and energy awaits.<br /><br />Kleon describes himself as \\"a writer that draws,\\" and \\"Artist\\" is proof of that.  He designed the book himself and his voice and style shine through.  \\"Artist\\" feels unified, innovative, balanced, and, above all, intimate.  The book is small, like a big cocktail napkin.  It's full of illustrations by Kleon and little flourishes that keep things brisk as you read.  The small size makes the book feel approachable, ready to provide a quick inspiration burst if need be.  Kleon describes ten basic principles to boost your creativity.  He lists them on the back cover of the book (a choice that Kindle purchasers will miss) so that they're easily referenced.  It's a small touch, but emblematic of the book's careful construction.<br /><br />Most importantly, \\"Artist\\"is focused on practicality.  Kleon has absorbed the lessons of Hyde and Ferguson, but he wants to do more than evangelize; he wants to transform.  \\"Artist\\" is stuffed with practical tips that you can adopt.  In fact, there's a section at the very end of the book titled \\"What Now?\\", in which Kleon gives you a long, itemized list of things you can do *right now* to prime your creative pump.<br /><br />One recent book that Kleon doesn't reference is \\"Where Good Ideas Come From\\", by Steve Johnson.  \\"Good Ideas\\" is one of the best new books about spurring creativity, but it's primarily focused on principles of creativity and their historical origins.  \\"Artist\\" is a perfect companion to \\"Good Ideas\\".  Once you've read Johnson's book and your head is full of theory, Kleon's book comes along and gives you a good, firm (and lighthearted) kick in the pants to send you on your way.  You certainly don't need to read \\"Good Ideas\\" or any other book to receive the full benefit of \\"Artist\\".  It's a short, heady blast of exuberance that's guaranteed to kick-start your imagination.
B004WESFZW|5.0|Matt Damon again proves his acting chops in this unorthodox movie about another power's attempts to come between 2 people who were apparently fated to be together. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and wondered how it would all end. Emily Blunt puts on another great performance, and the two stars have an honest chemistry. I highly recommend this movie.
B006ON41FC|3.0|We've been playing this game for several days now.  So fun!  My only question/complaint is that when we buy a permanent upgrade in the shop, it doesn't work.  The one-time use purchases work, but the permanent don't.  We've bought both a permanent helmet and a head start, but neither show up.  Otherwise, this game is great.  We love it!

159514188X|5.0|This book came upon me in the 5th grade. I remember it pretty well actually, it was a recommendation from my ex best friend Heather. I've been reading big books since about 2nd grade. Harry Potter was all I would read from 2nd to 3rd grade and a bit into 4th. My grandma would actually check my bookbag for books and take them out if she found any because the teacher would complain that I didn't pay her any attention, only my books. Sad right? A little bit I would say. But since the day Heather read Th1rteen R3asons Why and told me that I should read it too, I fell in love.<br /><br />My Take:  The first thing I noticed about this book was...wow this is deep stuff, the writer must really be a very thoughtful and amazing person. And the second thing I noticed is that this story is addictive. Maybe a one, two day read tops?<br /><br />Let me just say that I LOVE Clay. I would have been all over him if I was Hannah. (but I'm not *sigh*) He was very sympathetic and true to her and I mean putting him on her tapes is harsh to me. You hear you're a reason for someone killing themself and you're supposed to be happy? I don't think so. She should have just sent him a letter saying how much she needed him and how she really liked him. Not put him on a tape with other people who ruined her life. So mean D:<br />Some of the stories of the people that started it all made me want to cry. Especially since on involves rape, and another one has a creepy guy who stalks girls and takes pictures of them from outside their bedroom window, and to me this book is a great example of how you're judged and not trusted because of your past. A few wrong relationships and mistakes and everyone in school thought Hannah was a whore. And that's how the snowball effect started.<br /><br />\\"I wanted people to trust me, despite anything they'd heard. And more than that, I wanted them to know me. Not the stuff they thought they knew about me. No, the real me. I wanted them to get past the rumors. To seebeyond the relationships I once had, or maybe still had but that they didn't agree with.--Hannah Baker\\"<br /><br />Being in highschool I know exactly what it's like to be judged and torn apart for your past or through what people THINK you're like, not what they know. I'd recommend this to anyone and everyone. So if you have the chance to read it, pick it up. Who knows, it might teach you a lesson or two.

0142419400|5.0|The First Line: \\"Here is everything I know about France.....\\"<br /><br />My Take: So I officially decided that this is one of the best romance novels I've ever read! I mean after reading this I totally want to go to France! It even inspired me to buy a shirt yesterday that said bonjour on it :) But yes! This book was so amazing. I love Etienne and Anna. This entire book was just full of wonderful surprises. People make Paris out to be the city of love and this book definitely backs up that saying.<br />(I've already informed my boyfriend that we are having our honeymoon in Paris. He thinks he can talk me out of it. But he's wrong.)<br /><br />The characters were so fresh and loving that it was like you were there and you felt everything and saw everything. I fell in love with Etienne along with Anna and felt hurt when Toph was a jerk! I just can't believe that it took me so long to read this book. Definitely a fav!<br /><br />The Cover: Very fitting for this novel. The cover draws you in all by itself. It speaks of romance and hott parisians xD<br /><br />Would I Recommend? Yes, yes and more yes! Come get some yummy french guys ;)

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm a 30 year old man and not ashamed to say I read this first book based on reviews and the need for something outside my normal reality based books and education.  Although I was occasionally annoyed by a character or two and how the book play's a bit into the ego's and tastes of younger women I was thrown back into my chair by the speed of the books (*I read all three in the trilogy as fast as I could turn the pages), the immense depth of the world and deep though not boringly overpushed character development.  The books in this trilogy will take you into another place that leaves you still wanting more, yet no part of the books leave you feeling as if you have not been given your fill of information about the current situation or people that make each chapter feel remarkably as if you're there, wanting to help or be a character yourself.  The dynamics of each character left me feeling for each of their personal situations and at time I wanted to yell at the book hoping they could hear what I had to say as the world enveloped me and sucked me into theirs.  The Trilogy of the Hunger Games left me disoriented a bit after putting them down each night as I'd spent time in these books and I'd started to feel like a charcter myself.  I felt for the characters deeply and was constantly surprised by the constant turn of events that left me Hungry for more every day that I was reading them.  The one thing that I was not expecting because it is done so much in literature today is that no part, not a single sentence feels rushed as if the author wanted to get past a scene and move on.  Every paragraph had depth and feeling which is the true sign of a very talented writer.  I look forward to future novels.
B006ON41FC|4.0|It's a great game overall. The only thing is that there isn't much content. I achieved all of the goals on the first day. Short but sweet.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After months of weighing the advantages of reading on an e-reader, I saw a recommendation for Wool and with the low bar of entry of 99 cents and 70  pages, I figured I'd give it a shot on my girlfriend's iPad.  Shortly thereafter, I had to buy a Kindle.  I think the first part (Wool) works fabulously as a self-contained novella, and would still recommend that as a stand-alone even if they didn't want to commit to the whole series.  The fact that the world continues and has a natural arc through the next four installments is a sci-fi reader's dream.  Howey writes great suspense as we slowly discover more and more of this mysterious world.  Unlike in the TV series LOST, we never feel like there is no one driving the bus.  Howey knew the final scene well in advance, and it shows.
B0026IA0QS|1.0|What an awful mess! Going into this, I knew it was either going to meet my expectations or be total crap. Well, it was total crap! &quot;santa sangre&quot; (&quot;Holy Blood&quot; from 1989), was pure artifice and mimicry. I did see Alejandro Jodorowsky's &quot;Fando and Lis&quot; 1968, &quot;El Topo&quot; 1970 and &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; 1973 (and believe me, I did like and find &quot;El Topo&quot; to be very interesting), so I knew what to expect. But why hasn't he learned how to make a proper film since that period of time? Compared to seriously gifted filmmakers, Jodorowsky comes across like an impostor, a trickster at best. Even the great Blanca Guerra could not save this absurdity. The film's pretentiousness and lowbrow approach, will appeal mainly to people that cherish: comic books, vampires, monsters, and ultra-violent movies, etc., etc. I failed to see anything remotely funny in this film and I have a very good sense of humor. It even reinforces Mexico's negative image: i.e.---superstitions, ignorance and collective-violence. Jodorowsky could have been straightforward and honest, but instead he resorted to using hollow symbolism which only added to the confused storyline. For this, he is more than likely a shill of the Establishment (he's not the first and won't be the last either)! I don't doubt it. Jodorowsky as a shaman is a fraud, a filmmaker he definitely is not! This review is for the 2-disc DVD special-edition, NTSC, NR 120 mins. The picture quality was very good. (BTW: I collect rare and obscure films, but just because they're rare and obscure does not necessarily make them good!)<br /><br />Love and Peace,<br />Carlos Romero
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I own a 2011 F-150 XLT fully loaded.  That means hot on the audio offering as well.  There are 4 options, radio, CD (unfortunately single CD only and not MP3), an audio input, and USB input.  I had the speakers upgraded, including high end tweeters in the front door, and my amp installed (75x4 nominal 100x4 peak) because loud and rich across the entire frequency spectrum makes me really happy (listening to William Tell that way is a moving experience).  But there was a problem  The radio, the CD, and the audio selections have a totally and significantly different volume output.  Meaning, leaving the volume level the same, the audio output was low with limited dynamic range, the CD is 30% louder and better dynamics and the radio was louder yet with enormous frequency width.  Even the guy who installed the amp commented on the differences.  I went to Ford and tried my MP3 player on another new vehicle, same thing.  I guess that's how they build them.  Now considering I primarily listen to MP3's through a Sony player containing some 5000 songs, and a Sony MP3 walkman with a 14\\" stack of MP3 disks, no way was I satisfied with things as they were, considering both players were turned up full and still weren't in contention with the radio or CD.  Bummed out, but not to be outdone I turned to Amazon and purchased a Pyramid 749 7 Band Graphic Equalizer  which restored realistic volume levels as well as real functioning frequency control.  But still I wanted more.  Hence the Fiio E6 Headphone Amplifier.  Well, that was all she wrote.  That thing came in and it was the icing on the cake.  It augmented everything ahead of the equalizer and gives a super quiet response and perfect enhancement that the system was crying for, its astonishing. For about a $50 investment, the resulting sound quality is more that I could've hoped for.  For those who say this little headphone amp isn't worth it, I can only believe that they're not wearing headphones, but instead cold weather ear muffs because the unit I have works great.  My only beef with the unit is that I cant keep the USB charger on while I play.  The background noise that becomes present is that of SETI listening to the universe. But thats not worth taking a star off for. Then there are the instructions that came with it.  Written in Chinese English that has no sentence or grammar structure whatsoever and reading is so poor, its laughable.  With that said, I suggest getting this device and apply it to your vehicle's audio system, or Ipod or any portable playback device and I know you'll be quite pleased.
B006UG90RM|3.0|Okay, let's get one thing out of the way: it's not the train wreck many expected. There's some solid stuff here. Nothing that grabs you by the ears and screams LISTEN TO ME, but nothing to make you reach for the SKIP button either.<br /><br />Roth does not have the range he once had. That said, the songs fit where his voice is now. And that's fine. Although it does make you appreciate the timeless rock icons like Halford, Dickinson, and the late, great Dio.<br /><br />The one thing that is sorely missing, as many others have noted-the soaring backing vocals of Michael Anthony. I've always been a fan of the big vocal sound. and it's just not here. Listen to \\"She's The Woman.\\" When it hits the chorus, it just begs for some Anthony on top. Then go listen to \\"Dance the Night Away.\\" You'll hear what I mean.<br /><br />Another nit to pick is the sound quality. It doesn't have that great airy live feel of the old Ted Templeman/Don Landee discs. It does seem a bit mushy at times.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's not gonna disappoint the fans. Will it win any new ones? Maybe, maybe not. For now, let's call it a good (re)start, or \\"A (slightly) Different Kind of Van Halen.\\"

B006M4RN3U|4.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 2/22/12**  It seems like I had heard so much praise for Fun's last album, yet for some reason I never got around to checking it out. So when they came back with this new release, I was interested to delve in. After all, I love a good indie-pop record (especially the \\"pop\\" portion). Turns out that, for me, this is really an album of peaks and valleys. The peaks are amazingly high. If only it wasn't for the valleys (but honestly, even they aren't so bad).  1. Some Nights Intro - I don't rate intros as a rule, but if I did, this would get a high score. It perfectly sets the scene for the next track in a dramatic, melodic way.  2. Some Nights - Perhaps the album's finest moment. A rollicking mix of rock, gospel, pop and bombast, this track sets the bar so high that the rest of the album struggles to keep up. I'd like to see the band follow this track for future work. It really is powerful. 10/10  3. We Are Young - The big hit single. It's wearing on me a bit after hearing it so often, but there's no denying that galvanizing, anthemic melody. Janelle Monae is completely extraneous, but she adds an interesting element, I suppose. 10/10  4. Carry On - A nice ballad. Nothing earth-shattering, but I can easily imagine this finding success on the radio. The chorus strives for the same rousing singalong nature of We Are Young. It doesn't quite get there, mostly because the song's more subdued, but it's close. 9/10  5. It Gets Better - Back to uptempo. The production here's very interesting. Frantic, cluttered and a cool mix of electronic and acoustic. The verses don't do much for me, but I love the chorus. 8/10  6. Why Am I The One - The album's best straight-up ballad. Though it takes awhile to get to the hook, it's worth it because the harmonies are simply gorgeous. It has a real throwback sound in the best way. It sounds like a lost AOR hit from the 70's. 10/10  7. All Alone - The album's first real foray into hip-hop influenced production. There's a reggae vibe too. In fact, the entire track is a hodgepodge of sounds that shouldn't necessarily go together. And yet it all works. 9/10  8. All Alright - This is where the album starts to sag for me. This certainly isn't bad, but the melody and production just kind of plods along. It's heading for epic territory, but I'm not sure it gets there. Missing some oomph, maybe. 7/10  9. One Foot - This is a bit more experimental. Over a spare, (very) repetitive brassy beat, this song is much more \\"chanty\\" (yeah, I made up that word) than melodic. In other words, it's an experiment that I'm not sure entirely works. 7/10  10. Stars - My least favorite track. Personally, I find that the high vocal parts grate and I really don't like the vocoder/autotune choices. I realize it's intentional, but this just seems to meander along. And at nearly seven minutes, that's a lot of meandering. Honestly, take it off the album and you've got a much better listen. 5/10  11. Out On The Town - I can't believe this is only a bonus track, because it's as good or better than half of the songs on the actual album. It's not necessarily the most memorable of the bunch, but its solid pop songcraft is a welcome sound after that last track. 8/10  Album Grade: 8.3/10
B005D7ECMM|5.0|Lawrence of Arabia : 40th Anniversary Limited Edition : 2 Disc Set - Over 100 Minutes of Bonus Footage  Lawrence of Arabia : I remembered watching this movie on tv in the `60s;bought it in the `80s widescreen VHS....excellent still.Now 2011 looking for BD ,but only ,so far in this 40th Anniversary DVD 2 disc set.remastered in 5.1 D.D.master A/V,anamorphic,subtitles,217 minutes,DVD-ROM archives of historical pictures,interactive map of Middle East,much more.disc 2 all the back stage:how made,commentaries,4 original featurettes,trailers etc.An reprint of the 1962 original theater souvenir booklet much more.But the movie unscaled to 1080p near HD via HDMI.What is really coool is the 2 disc are held in a book like case .really looks like a book cool pics front/back.The movie still rocks after fifty years and it took about 3 years to make and you can see Peter O`Toole age,in his first movie;Only bad thing(the book like heavy cloth material) should have had a case cover to protect it and keep it clean and keep it from getting any marks etc. I very picky about all electronics,VHS,DVD,BD  only one that touches them ...they look like as new as day bought if not damage by packers/shippers.My collection is massive.VHS are playing like new ;even better now they can be unscaled to 1080p HD widescreen and cinema-photography in panoramic really shows the beauty of the desert ;pictures will never be made in the locations that this one was so history is captured. won like 7 Oscars.Base on T.H.Lawrence during WW1 of course it has been hollywoodized..Read the book on Lawrence,the man was a true force of nature;he had all tribes unified for the first time,till it came time \\"politics\\" destroyed them and in step the Brits and King of Arabia stepped in an created OPEC.FYI early 1900 Winston Churchill was some type of ambassador when they discovered oil and he really messed it up so bad;he never did much till WWII when he became prime minister,a really messed up manic-depressive and afterWWII ,he wasnt needed anymore ..fade out til he died in the `60s..side note.But it shows how the peopel of the middle east ,even though all Muslims,differ so much;been killing each other before Jesus was born..if when left them alone they would destroy each other....pretty much as they do today;they dont need any outside help..this is a strong point I saw in this movie now after all has happened.But if Geo,H.W.Bush wasnt head of C.I.A. and didnt train Bin Laden to be freedom fighters against Russia;had the regulations wrote/printed in Wisconsin Al Qida rules of engagement,gave weapons and monies and created the security after the first time from trying to blow up the Twin Towers in 1991;9/11/2001 would have never happened .If Gore was president like he should have been \\"W\\" and Jeb ,his bro ;gov. of Florida and Janet Reno didnt order the F.B.I. to go in and take the voting ballots and let them ALL be recounted ,as law dictates,the war president,and god didnt speak to him and said he chose him and America to have a Holy WAR;but he,\\"W\\" had to go in and clean up Desert storm mess ,13 week war in `91 when daddy Bush was president..oh and Reagan was president and Oliver North said that it was better the president didnt know that the monies in the Iran-Contras fiascoe;let the monies go and fight the \\"drug\\" wars and not sent it to Iran; all this was on tv ,documented, check it all out.. Clinton had this country in the best it had been in decades ..low deficit,high employment,lower taxes ..check it and do some research.The movie is pretty much on those lines;Lawrence knew it and said if politics and other countries left them alone,its a middle east thing.The movie made alot of sense the more \\"others\\" interfer with other cultures and tell them how they should live;then again one can read a book ;I think it is called the Bible,they been at each other since the alpha of life...dont forget the un Holy Wars from 1099,approved by the pope for 200yrs and three major attempts till Saladin finally pretty well took back control of Jerusalem and middle east and it still goes on...it holds strong that El Lawrence had enough and knew it would never be but one way..as it is today.for about a 4 hour movie since it has been made makes one think all that has happened for many millenniums a strong movie with many points that you can relate to what is going on,will be going on and has been going on for a long time..if ones mind can see the what the meaning of the movie was about  a true story.

B0006J28BO|5.0|This was a great gift for my daughter who loves anime. she has seen just about everything but this was new for her as an older show she had not seen and she loves it so much she has sat and watched it at least a dozen times in the last month alone if not more.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this game! It is so addicting, I cant get it out of my hands! the graphics are lovely on my kindle fire!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book I found by word of mouth from a friend who was reading it and enjoyed it. I bought each of these separately but I'm reviewing the 1-5 bundle as I have just finished book five. I truly love reading good stories and this is one of the better books I've read in quite some time. It was hard to put down and now that I have finished book five I just want more. The characters are very real, and the plot often seems to be predictable then turns in ways you don't expect which is truly a merit of great art in writing. It is a very believable, very real and very well woven story. Worth every penny.
B003Y5H4YI|4.0|I finally watched \\"The Debt,\\" a movie that had been on my radar for some time but one I seemed to just not find the time for.  It was, for me, something of a struggle to figure out the bones of the plot during the opening scenes. The time-shifting elements and younger/older casts members requires some up-front attention, and some odd casting choices are just confusing. The pairing of the two younger men and the two older men characters seem backwards, and I could not figure at first which older character was the future version of which younger one.<br /><br />The story is fascinating, how the deeds and nondeeds of the past have powerful repercussions, and how choices made seem the right ones on the surface while the underlying truth is another matter. I think there are enough plot recaps and summaries among the other 80-plus reviews here that I don't need to venture there. Be prepared to keep focused while watching \\"The Debt,\\" and be prepared when it messes with your head later. It does not lead to pleasant dreams but this is a smart, insightful movie.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|What a regretful amount of negativity.<br />  Man and beast. Man and God. God, what a mess.<br />  There are some superb survival films out there. This is not one of them.<br />  Survival means perseverance and hope. Not a preponderance of gore and blasphemy.<br />  First and foremost Liam Neeson is a wonderful actor and is supported here by a terrific cast. A great acting experience which unfortunately did not have a comparable screenplay.<br />  There are those who would say \\"you missed the point\\".<br />  What point? Do not pray for help? Do not expect any divine intervention? Struggle yourself to survive and then curse God?<br />  This makes no sense and neither does this rather poor excuse for cinema.<br />  Incidentally, I was never a fan of primary credits at the end of a movie But to have a final scene afterwards is ludicrous.<br /> An audience expects to be entertained and not to be indulged in hopeless delirium.
0879309210|5.0|It showed up quicker than I thought and in better condition than advertised.  I was amazed to find the DVD intact.  The binding is a little sideways but it has no effect on the product.  Also, since it is a tech. manual I plan to cut the binding off and drill some holes for a three ring binder.  Great job guys!!!

B004YKB50Q|5.0|Bought this cd about 30 years after first hearing it on vinyl when I was a pothead. It still feels just as cool to hear it now without the benefit of mind-expanding drugs!

0316056863|4.0|Tina Fey's Bossypants is such an amazing, easy read. I found myself laughing out loud on multiple occasions. I do wish she would have expanded on her background a little more, and I wish the entire book would have been longer in general. But, I've read it twice now and will probably read it again in the future. It is an overall great book.
B004UHSB5A|4.0|This app works great, is easy to use and has not crashed. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's pretty plain looking.
B0012FE4BS|4.0|The new remastered CD FINALLY restores the digital version of the album more closely to it's original sound.<br />The previous release of this on disc has the very unfortunate addition of reverb on some of the songs which to my ears killed the dynamics of the original vinyl. Frank Beard's drumming is WAAY better without the reverb gumming up the works. And, of course, this is a great record, one of the best in their catalog, etc. etc. Just avoid the earlier print with that godawful reverb. Yecch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. it is my favorite book filled with suspense and thrill. its nice to see someone writing great novels for teens. I would recommend this book to everyone.

B0025KVLVA|5.0|For most of us this represents a collection of some of the best Beatles songs onto one CD... but for those who came along after the Beatles hayday, this will represent a (sort of) \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD. For the money, this is the best way to become more familiar with, arguably, the music of the greatest band of all time. But there can be no argument about their great influence on the era they lived in and music in general.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|Ok, Im an admitted gore hound zombie classicist. Outside of Romero's film, Dead Snow, and James Gunn's classic remake of Dawn of the Dead, I usually end up panning all zombie fare. The Walking Dead has it all!! Great characters, great action, great zombies and a storyline that just won't quit. The pandemic is and its details are kept in the bag, which is nice for now and the evil characters make the zombies look good which is a nice clever aspect of the series. The acting could be stronger in spots but overall the main characters are very solid. As a reader only a few Z novels make the cut on this level of entertainment: Max Brooks, WORLD WAR Z, MONSTER ISLAND and a great new one i just discovered called BLUE BLOODBATH by Katrina Von Kessel...I hope the producers who did Walking Dead have something to do with Brad Pitts WWZ...they know what they're doing!!!

Also I can view and or rearrange apps, files and folders on my Kindle Fire, so be careful here, or you could turn you Kindle Fire into a brick, as you can actually get down to the system files.<br />Kudo's to the developer, and Thanks Amazon for getting us something that not only works, but that we can actually use.
0140540563|5.0|I was at someone else's house and picked this book up - I thought it was hilarious!!!!!  I went into Books a Million, who showed it in their computer, but I (and they) couldn't find it, so I had them order it.  I must've not known about Amazon.com then.  I get everything from them now.  I just ordered one from here and noticed one (and only one so far) person give it a bad review, saying the good ones must've come from friends or family of the author!  Anyone is welcome to check my other reviews and the fact that I just ordered this.  I'm going to send it to an adult friend to read before I pass it on to another family member.  I think it's too cute.  The author has a great sense of humor.  I wondered how it would come across to small children, but actually I think it's a great lesson to read the original, then read this version.  They'll learn there's usually two sides to every story!

B004JZBGWI|5.0|This program it great! I use it primarily for its Checklist, Notes and the Calender, which really helps me manage my \\"to do\\" lists while I'm working. It helps me organize my day, and to do lists. I can set a reminder on the tool bar. I also love the fact that is saves automatically every time I make a change to it. The widget runs smoothly, I enjoy utilizing various note colors for organization, and it is very easy to use. Highly recommended!<br />Good Job Amazon.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|What can I say!  Great movie as a child and still a great movie as an adult!  DVD works great and arrived in a timely manner!  Thank you!
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|OMG, what can I say??... I am so sad to see it come to an end, but happy none the less bcuz it ended on such a high note. I could not have predicted a better ending, this 3rd installment was the icing on the cake.I loved the way E.L made an erotic story between Christian and Ana into something so beautiful, romantic, and lustful (lustful bcuz I wanted more lol). I never paid no more than $5 for all the books on my kindle and this trilogy was worth every $10 I spent on each!! Knowing what I know now, Id pay more for the Fifty trilogy bcuz its worth so much more. I wish fairytales like this was true in real life, I consider this a fairytale bcuz, even though Christian was Fifty Shades he still treated Ana like his queen, he cherished her and did everything he could to make her happy. He may have went over board when it came to her safety, but then again he was still learning how to love and Ana was his perfect antidote, because without her he would have never been able to get passed his fears or find love and feel worthy of it. She stood by her man!! Love her for that!! Like I said, I wish I could give it a perfect 10, but Ill stick with 5. HIGH PRAISE FOR FIFTY SHADES OF GREY!!!

1451626657|4.0|Catch-22 was a tough read for me at the beginning, the story was just to weird for me and the characters didn't seem to likable except for Yossarian of course. As i kept turning page after page the story really took off from there, the characters that are introduced and described are quite entertaining. Catch-22 isn't the greatest book in my opinion, but it is quite an entertaining read and to understand the absurdities of war and the people that are involved in it. This book is definitely worth checking out.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I have spent the longest time reading this book among its predecessors. This does not necessarily mean that this book is that bad, at least not as bad as some people depict.<br />In fact, I was having a good time reading the book. I did enjoy the development of the plots, the in-depth examination of characters' minds, especially those minor twists that took place in each chapter. When I finished the last page of the book, I gave a long sigh concluding the long journey through such a bundle of paper, and thought about it, I actually found that the book was quite well written. Don't start to protest, not yet, let me finish please.<br /><br />Before I start to read this book, I read some of the helpful reviews on this book out of curiosity, and discovered that the general views towards this book had been pretty negative.I hence developed this kind of fear of going into the book and suffering such a great length without being able to enjoy anything. With such a mindset I turned to the first page of the book, and all the way until the last.<br /><br />I want to say that this book is not as horrendously bad as people said, it is still comparable with the rest of the books in the series, although may not be as good as certain. I think that this book is better than the fourth book, a feast for crows, in the sense that the plots and twists are more delicately designed, and attention grabbing.<br /><br />However, there is room for improvements. I am not trying to be Martin since I know I know that I can never be able to mimic half of what he is capable of. I just feel that certain chapters can be shortened of some dry descriptions on how the cloths look like, how the weather look like, how the people look like ( maybe this one can remain). My point is that more twists can be added into those mundane part just for the sake of making the story more interesting.<br /><br />I tend to believe that whatever Martin has put in this book, he put it there for a reason. We would just believe in what he can promise, and sit back and enjoy the song of ice and fire.<br /><br />I think that Martin was trying to link up all the small points that he mentioned in the previous books and to make the whole world created in the book to be more evenly described and three-dimensional. After this book, we are no longer so sure on where the main battlefield for the final showdown would be, neither will we be certain that the scenes that are given more words would be the one being focused on in this book. We then have a sense of the entire fantasy world consisting of different things happening everywhere, and a greater admiration of the awesomeness of such a large-scaled creation!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really like the reading plans and differnet translations and devotionals. I would recomend this app to mg friends and family
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I bought mine about three months ago and so far I've had no troubles with this great little amp.<br />Originally purchased just to give my little iPod nano a little help playing through a cassette adapter in my car, I didn't have high expectations.<br />This little thing has opened my eyes to the world of headphone amplification and I'm a fan. It makes my Denon AH-D1001's really shine when played through my iPod.<br /><br />When charging via mini-USB there is a little bit of audible noise in silence but nothing you can notice over your music.<br /><br />For $20 this thing is really a good deal, very small, and effectively acts as a cable extender while I'm just walking or biking around campus. The only wish I have would be the ability to play/pause/skip on the device itself.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Seriously, and I know this is stated too often but so true with Defending Jacob: A Novel, I could not put this book down!  In the style of Nelson DeMille, this story is absolutely fascinating. The character development is first rate and you can be certain Landay knows the legal system - which as a Father had me very concerned.  Isn't it funny how you can live a life only to discover after a fulfilling law career, success as a writer could be so rewarding.  Hopefully, there will be many more novels from William Landay! For the time being, I just ordered an earlier thriller \\"Mission Flats\\".  Highly recommend!!!!

B005599XJK|5.0|No lover in the world ever wrote a valentine more exquisite than Virginia Woolf's tribute to her lover Vita Sackville-West, \\"Orlando.\\"<br /><br />And few movie adaptations are as coyly, exquisitely lovely as the 1992 movie adapted from that book, a magical-realism tale about a perpetually youthful, charming hero/ine who traverses three centuries and both genders. Tilda Swinton has the right combination of androgyny and intelligence to perfectly embody Orlando, and director Sally Potter gilds and perfumes every set and costume.<br /><br />Orlando (Swinton) was born a young aristocratic man in the time of Queen Elizabeth I, and when the dying monarch visited his home she became his new court favorite. She also bid him, \\"Do not fade, do not wither, do not grow old.\\"<br /><br />And Orlando did as she said. With the death of the queen and his father, Orlando's passionate, curious personality attracted many women -- and during the Great Freeze he fell in love with Sasha, a mercurial Russian princess (Charlotte Valandrey) who enthralled him, but left him as he ice began to thaw. Bereft of true love, he devoted himself to poetry and entertainment.<br /><br />But then he's assigned to be an ambassador to Constantinople, and something strange happens -- while a bloody revolution rages, he sleeps for a full week... and wakes newly metamorphosed into a woman. With the same mind and soul but a female body, Orlando sets out on a new life of poetry (befriending Pope!), sex and legality, stretching all the way to the twentieth century -- when she finally finds peace.<br /><br />\\"Orlando\\" is a treat for the senses, filled with showers of gold dust, luxuriant flowers, pale sunlight, golden sands, cities veiled in ice, dark rivers, snowy forests and mist-filled hedge mazes. It feels like Sally Potter took Woolf's beautiful book and sprinkled it with roses, gold and crystals -- and it just adds a suitably magical atmosphere to a already unreal story.<br /><br />The center of all this is Swinton, who plays Orlando in both incarnations, and she's utterly brilliant. Her androgynous features and slim body mean she can pass for both a man and a woman, and she manages to carry both genders off beautifully -- she captures gangly boyish grace, sleek femininity, and a sort of chummy male attitude with equal skill.<br /><br />And she captures Orlando's elusive personality. Her Orlando is all puckish charm, sweetness and unleashed passion -- even to the audience. While watching a street performance of \\"Othello,\\" he glances at the camera and whispers, \\"Terrific play!\\", as if we're trailing after him over the centuries.<br /><br />And as I mentioned, Potter does a brilliant job with a very difficult book, sticking faithfully to most of Woolf's novel and adding a shimmering, silken atmosphere to it. There are lots of beautiful scenes that could have stepped out of a Pre-Raphaelite painting, and she deftly handles the passing centuries by having Orlando sprint through walls of mist. The ending is slightly different from Woolf's novel, but it has the same pleasantly timeless, thoughtful quality -- the only downside is that weird freaky angel thing. WHAT was that about?<br /><br />Fortunately, the freaky angel thing is the one downside in \\"Orlando,\\" a timelessly sensual movie that perfectly highlights Tilda Swinton. Absolutely stunning.utterly brilliant.

B007B8EX9I|5.0|I watched this series, all of seasons 1 and 2, over the last three evenings and have been totally drawn in by the story and the characters.  Maggie Smith is always wonderful of course and the rest of the cast is so believable although I don't know if any are well known artists in England.  I watched the entire series on my PC with a 25\\" HD monitor and thought the reception was beyond complaint.  A previous viewer mentioned the reception was badly pixellated on a 32\\" television.  I do not know what level of equipment or internet reception this person has but my picture was clear to the point of appearing nearly 3D.  I love the streaming video from Amazon!

0061969656|5.0|I read Bernard Cornwell's Death of Kings in just two sittings.  This is the first of his Saxon Series that I've read (though I read almost all the Sharpe books a few years back).  Historical fiction is my favorite and I'd forgotten how well Cornwell mixes fact and a really good adventure story.  But in this book he outdoes himself.  I remember in his Sharpe series many of the supporting characters tended to be stereotypes, but in this they are just as real as Uhtred. I see where some other reviewers think the book and characters are a bit stale.  Maybe it's because I haven't read the other books in the series, but I found the characters fascinating.  Such is the author's skill that you feel you are really in the period, and the characters' troubles are treated realistically and with less dime-novel heroics than Cornwell employed in the Sharpe books.  The characterization and structure overall are outstanding. I think this is one of Cornwell's best.

B004UHSB5A|5.0|This is great on kindle fire. This is a game I played as a kid and it is good for people who like strategy or puzzle games. The tiles just have to be placed over the tile that you want to play on. When it glows green it is in place. I will play this one a lot.

Since I carry my Kindle Fire everywhere, many  of my friends have commented on what a pretty cover I have, and have asked where I purchased it.  Of course, I told them that Amazon was the only place that I knew carried it.
B003E88TKS|5.0|While I'd hardly be inclined to label this movie as a must-see for everyone, it does work on several levels so as to appeal to a rather wide audience, making it certainly worth most people's while.<br /><br />I suppose the most recognizable piece of the film is its star, George Clooney. No suspension of reality is required in order to believe the character Clooney is playing; he fits the part real well. So well in fact, that the emotional evocation brought out by his character, Ryan Bingham feels (dare I say it?) real and far from fabricated (though I figure it was, all the more credit to dir. Jason Reitman). A good-looking, globe-trotting bachelor, who has sworn off marriage and any chance at a stable home, Clooney's emotional development throughout the course of the film is what to watch for.<br /><br />So, forget the planes, hotels and frequent flyer miles; more than any of that, the movie is about a man's solitude (brought about at his own behest) and the loneliness that so often follows when one thinks that they can take on the world all on their own. The difference between being surrounded by people (as Clooney often protests) and actually being with other people, is one that takes the course of the film to discover. While the entire film builds upon this idea, I felt it most evident during the wedding sequence, where Clooney's character returns home almost a stranger. More specifically, there is a scene where Clooney asks his sister if she wants him to walk her down the aisle (evidently after the passing of their father). She informs him she already has someone else. The look on Clooney's face and his subsequent stumbling for words is perhaps the most memorable part the film, at least emotionally. I mean it when I say, you feel his character's pain, and that's quite the accomplishment considering the type of character that he is.<br /><br />Of course I could go on spilling praise for the rest of the cast, they all worked well, but it really is just Clooney's picture. A film about interconnectedness, isolation, and individualism in the modern world; one can't help leaving the film without thinking that maybe life's better with feet firmly on the ground.nectedness, isolation, and individualism in the modern world; one can't help leaving the film without thinking that maybe life's better with feet firmly on the ground.
B004SDEP38|2.0|Why do I rate it just ok?  With my Vizio Vtab, all I can do is look at spreadseets.  I need to be able work with them.  Office Pro is a much better choice, at least for me.  It works quite smoothly I've been disappointed with Doc To Go and will now use it any longer.
0439023513|4.0|Though \\"Mockingjay\\" didn't have quite the same forward momentum for me that the earlier books in the trilogy had, it still was a fairly brisk read. Essentially everything that happens follows from what has happened in earlier books. When you start with a society where much of the populace lives in slavery, we know a push for freedom is coming. We know a war of some sort is inevitable. We hope our characters find some peace and resolution at the end. So does this book deliver all that?<br /><br />There are some great twists and turns here, a good share of action, and some genuine heart-wrenching moments. There were a couple instances in the main character's journey that I questioned. Should she have voted that way? Should she have done that? Did she really learn anything from all this?<br /><br />And yet, I think \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy should ultimately be judged by how the reader feels when they've read the last page. Was there enough resolution for them to feel \\"yes, that pretty much does it.\\" And for me, there was.<br /><br />It was a good journey. I'm glad I took it. You should too.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is in league all its own.  Doc To Go is not even close. I had loaded Doc To Go on my Vizio Vtab and when I opened spreadsheets, I could do nothing but view them.  Now, in all fairness, the Doc To Go advertising did not say I would not be able to edit them.  But, with this app, I am able to open all the documents and spreadsheeets and work with them.  This is now a valuable piece of software on my tablet that I would not be without.  Nice job!
B004UHSB5A|2.0|I downloaded it even though it had bad reviews. it played fine for me on my fire, but as otheres have said the tiles are way too small.  they snapped in place with little effort though. I got a headache..uninstalled due to tiny tiles...

B005TPCQ5I|1.0|It was a terribly boring and slow movie.  Couldn't sitck with it to the end.  It was a display of the lack of creativity and morals of the European culture.  Well displayed was the decay of the European mindset to a society growing ever more heartless and irresponsibly self-centered.
B006T5FDLG|1.0|This EP is a collection of overlong, boring, tuneless, annoying outtakes from Death Magnetic. I can't understand why reviewers are giving this mess postive reviews. Maybe, because there is absolutly no new good Rock or Metal music out today. Thats the only reason I can think of because the songs on this EP just don't measure up. And to be quite blunt, they suck big time.
B006UG90RM|5.0|When Van Halen released their smash multi-platinum album \\"1984\\", they were riding a huge wave of success. The only problem was that the album- and tour that followed it- also became the thing which tore them apart. Shortly after the exit of lead singer David Lee Roth, Sammy Hagar stepped in to fill the role for the next ten years with the band. When tensions boiled over in 1996, Hagar left the band and Van Halen were reunited with original singer Roth- but only for a short minute at the MTV Video Music Awards. The band then recruited yet another lead singer- this time Gary Cherone of the band Extreme for their overtly political album \\"Van Halen III\\". The album floundered and Cherone departed soon after. Over the next decade, the band experienced numerous shakeups- such as getting dropped from their longtime label Warner Bros. Records and the departure of longtime bassist Michael Anthony in 2006. Eddie's son Wolfgang took over for Anthony and soon after David Lee Roth was invited to rejoin the band after a 25 year absence.<br /><br />In 2012, they released their first album on their new label Interscope Records- \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\". On this new recording, they enlist the production talent of John Shanks- who is best known for his work with Ashlee Simpson, Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morrisette and Michelle Branch. While Van Halen have a pop music producer behind their new record, the album is anything but pop music. In fact, this album sounds exactly like a Van Halen album- and a great one at that. They open with the first single, a song about the appeciation of body artwork \\"Tattoo\\" and sing about a one night stand on \\"She's The Woman\\". They go back to their thrash roots on seedy underworld themed \\"China Town\\" and on \\"As Is\\". They sing about getting rid of a moody woman on \\"You And Your Blues\\" and pay tribute to those who rose from their bad situations on \\"Blood And Fire\\". They tackle the subject of procrastination on \\"The Trouble With Never\\" and seek spirituality on the bluesy rocker \\"Stay Frosty\\". Overall, \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" is a fantastic record from Van Halen and could possibly be a strong contender for the best album of the year. Despite all they have been through within the last fifteen years, it's nice to hear from them again.n the bluesy rocker \\"Stay Frosty\\".

1415724784|5.0|This presentation makes a strong fact based backing of what can or is already the consequences of global warming.<br /><br />I have been to a few of the locations pointed out in the video, including Glacier National park. And if I had just watched this video I may have been skeptical of a one sided argument that was packed or spun for ulterior motives. But seeing the results here and now this becomes really spooky. The thing that makes Stephen King stories so scary is that he keeps them just n the realm of reality; so if there is any credence to the global warming we are now in the middle of a Stephen King scenario.<br /><br />The film is not just a scary we are doomed message but offers reasonable sounding practical alternatives.<br /><br />The first step in any action is awareness.<br />What do you think?<br />What will you do?<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000I5Y8FU Who Killed the Electric Car?]]

B00005N6KG|4.0|I have small ear canals too. These are perfect for the gym.  They stay in place but loosely and lightly and I can still hear people if I need too. I listen to books so I don't care if I hear background noise.  I take terrible care of them and sometimes pull them out of my gym bag full of stuff by the cord.  I used to go through a pair per year (about 150 uses) but my current pair I wrapped a little tape at each cord attachment and they lasted until I lost them!  Looks geeky but I'm not sexy and I know it ;-)
B006O5Y0SS|4.0|The first time I went to Paris I kept telling people how beautiful the city was in the rain.  How it confirmed all the cliches, yet you ended up not really caring that it did. I guess Woody Allen agrees! Watching this movie reminded me of how simply romantic the city is (see, a cliche...).  All the painters and writers featured in the film add a vintage touch that makes you nostalgic for the 1920s even though most of us were born no where near that great decade of the \\"Lost Generation\\"...and, which is the point of the movie.<br /><br />Owen Wilson convinces us of his pessimism and insecurities the way Woody Allen does in earlier films.  Rachel McAdam does a great job of being annoying and superficial.  Marion Cotillard looks like she belongs in the past.  I loved it all.  Loved how Hemingway spoke like he wrote, the humor in Dali's view of things, and so on.  I didn't expect to like it this much.  Glad I watched.

B005K17RU0|3.0|This is app is beautifully organized and laid out. When it works it provides all the relevant information on all the different locations I'm interested in. It's really user friendly. EXCEPT - It crashes incessantly on both my Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy phone, to the point that I've had to uninstall it on my phone twice. It usually fails to open from the phone's main menu and instead requires a Force Close. Even downloading an update causes errors. Now I have no intention to reinstall it on the phone but I do hope to salvage it on the Kindle Fire.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I know many fans were expecting a rocky/pop album, and I must admit I was too. However, after being cautious with this material I have really come to appreciate it.  I think we all need to agree that Paul McCartney is a complete artist. He has done classic, rock, pop, painting, etc, so why are we surprised to listen to something different to what we are used to? To those disappointed at a first look, I would like to invite you to listen carefully to the album. It's just excellent, not what many were expecting, but excellent.

B006LEHOL2|5.0|Well, let me introduce you to the MIGHTY RETURN OF SINEAD O'CONNOR!   Just picked up her latest \\"How About I BE ME (and you be you)! And oh what a return it is! Stunning in it's beauty, shimmering in it's magnificence, and the occasional shouts of protest that first made me fall in love with Sinead! Welcome back Sinead, not that you have been gone that long! Loved all of your most recent albums, from \\"Throw Down Your Arms\\" to \\"Theology\\" to \\"She Who Dwells\\", but it is your original work that speaks volumes from YOUR heart, and what a beautiful and full heart it is! Mahalo Nui Loa!  And the musings of her brother Joseph in the liner notes will bring tears to the eyes!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Although Wool was really a short story, it was written well enough that it piqued my interest and got me to read the rest.<br />I used lendle.me to get borrow the 2nd, but just couldn't get the 3rd one quickly enough.<br /><br />The omnibus edition is definitely the way to read it, as it saves you money and the hassle of getting the next installment. I am a Prime member so I took advantage of the Kindle Lending Library so I could get the 3rd, 4th and 5th episodes in one shot. I cannot say enough good about this series to do it justice. If you are a true fan of ALL sci-fi, you owe it to yourself to read these before the movies start rolling out. I can readily see continuation of the storyline to a very long and complex overstory, with many serial episodes. In fact, this could be a TV series in addition to a regular movie. Juliette's and Lukas' characters could even drive a few more stories before focusing on others, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />I am sure Hugh would love to quit his day job and do this for a living.<br />The only possible negative I see is that there are only so many knitting metaphors for the titles!

B0000041Z3|3.0|This set has several merits in the current (2012) environment: an unbeatable bargain price, the marvelous Decca sound (still holds up well, even from the 60s) and beautiful playing of the Vienna.<br /><br />If you are looking for an inexpensive set as an introduction to the Sibelius symphonies, this could fit the bill. Several reviewers (and Gramophone) have alluded to the staying power of this set in the catalogue over the years. Its easy to see why: (in addition to the attributes listed above) the performances are immediately accessible, and straight up. A good way to \\"learn\\" Sibelius without getting too bogged down in worrying about the deeper points of meaning, Sibelius's experimentation in structure and harmonics, or the richer sonorities he offers.<br /><br />And indeed that's the main problem here. These performances are like the Hollywood \\"story board\\" version of Sibelius...all fast moving, chunked out in bite-size scenes, dwelling mainly on the surface. Sibelius' sound world, as conveyed by Maazel, is bright, energetic, cordial, even perky. At times I wondered if I somehow had put on Mendelssohn by mistake. In a world in which the catalogue still holds tremendous Sibelius efforts by Barbirolli, Vanska, Segerstam, Davis, Rattle, Von Karajan and (even) Ormandy or Beecham, the Maazel set unfortunately isn't competitive on anything but price and sheer beauty of the VPO playing. For most Sibelians, that's not enough.<br /><br />If you want the complete symphonies and you're willing to pay a little bit more than the cost of the maazel set, you could do far worse than to start with the 2 twofers of Colin Davis and the BSO on Philips (see below); other reviewers will of course have their own preferences for inexpensive complete sets.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000041BV Sibelius: Complete Symphonies, Vol. 1 ~ Nos. 1, 2, 4 & 5]]<br />[[ASIN:B0000041BW Sibelius: The Complete Symphonies 2]]

B0017SWPXY|3.0|I'm a dog lover, so after encountering some hype about this book, I got the book from a friend of mine and read it in one sitting. It's not overly long or written in complex form. The prose style appears to suit its narrator - Enzo, a terrier-mix breed who is adopted by Danny and his family.  Seeing the cover, the Youtube trailer (which was kinda cheesy), and the other reviews, I sort of held off reading the book because I didn't want to cry buckets of tears, like most of the readers apparently had. But I needn't have worried. The only part that made me cry was about Enzo towards the end of the book (no spoiler here).  I really wanted to like the book. The plot line was promising - a story about a dog, a family that bravely faces and overcomes tragedy to remain together, and a man who never gives up and achieves his dreams. But when I started reading, the book did not engage me. The human characters could've used more development. The story was somewhat plausible but I found it to be too simplistic. The most robust character was Enzo, probably because he's telling the story. Were the humans lacking in character because Enzo's ability to observe humanity was limited? Who knows.  I can see why some reviews came in much lower than other ones. I would give it 3.5 stars for limited entertainment value, and don't necessarily regret reading the book. Maybe my expectations were too high.

B003Z0BWRM|4.0|Demons, Vampires, Werewolves, Faeries - The Mortal Instruments has it all. This is not, however, another Twilight clone. City of Bones begins what promises to be a great story of good against evil, tolerance against bigotry, falling in love with the wrong people and learning that all the stories are true.<br /><br />City of Bones came well-recommended to me and I was looking forward to seeing whether all the hype was deserved. As I read the first few chapters of this book though, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.<br /><br />Here were Clary and Simon, ordinary teenagers. They meet a trio of mysterious, tattooed youths who seem very free with information about their secret world.<br /><br />As more and more details about the Shadow World are revealed, I couldn't help but cringe at the dialogue even though it was quite funny at times. Pretty much everything Simon says in the whole book is a chucklesome one-liner, and the other characters engage in witty repartee even in the most dramatic of situations. Teenagers, at least the ones I know, just don't talk like that. I just felt a little like such an epic story deserved characters who took the whole thing a little more seriously.<br /><br />Despite their dialogue, I did become quite fond of the characters as the book went on. Clary, despite being blind as a bat when it comes to relationships, was a sweet character. She did seem to spend rather a lot of time looking at Jace's muscles - but who wouldn't, right? The obligatory love-polygon (it's more than a triangle!) aspect was well written and left me wanting to read the next book to tie up the loose relationship ends.<br /><br />The second half of the book was action-packed and left me unable to put it down - I nearly missed my station on the train a few times this week! I loved the Shadow World that Cassandra Clare has created. The storyline (in the first book, anyway) was quite reminiscent of the Harry Potter series - I was unsurprised to find out later that Cassie Clare had previously written Harry Potter fanfiction and has supposedly used some of that material in City of Bones. I'm hoping that the story will take on some more unique elements in the rest of the series.<br /><br />City of Bones was an entertaining and exciting read.

B004A8ZWWO|4.0|Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy lead an all-star cast in Tower Heist, a comedy caper about working stiffs who seek revenge on the Wall Street swindler who stiffed them.  Stiller and Murphy bring their \\"A\\" game to \\"Tower Heist\\". Josh Kovacs (Stiller)is the building manager in a high rise luxury apartment building.  When he finds out that his and all the other employee's penchants are all gone and have been foolishly invested by a Bernie Madoff type boss, Arthur Shaw(Alan Alda). Kovacs and 3 other employees decide to break into Shaw's apartment suite to find the safe and get their money back. In preparing for the robbery, Slide(Eddie Murphy)is asked to help assist in the robbery since he is a criminal. Hilarity ensues as this group tries to pull off one of the biggest heist.  Can they get away with it? Will they get caught?  Can they coexist together without turning against one another?

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I think the only way to turn a good book into a film and do it justice is to break it up into a series.  The first season was pretty good, not too much was left out or different from the book. Hopefully the second season is just as good.
B002VECM6S|5.0|In case you're wondering about the acronym, it stands for \\"Make A Difference\\", something that, even though churches and well-meaning parents try to teach people, rarely EVER happens. And when it does happen, who notices? Apparently, someone noticed and brought to light a situation most of us would be uncomfortable trying to be around. And the one who would dare to go into it has more guts than most.<br />A young black man that gets ragged on by a bunch of white people at a predominantly white \\"Christian\\" school can't stand it. The way the teachers treat Michael is rather disgusting, acting like he's just another lost cause, since he can't read and doesn't seem to pay attention worth crap... the reason they took him in? One of the teachers threw out a provocative thought, that if they weren't willing to give someone who hadn't been given a chance in life, they may as well take out the \\"Christian\\" part of their school's name.<br />Turns out, that wouldn't be enough to help him. The teachers feel like they may as well give up on him, yet it takes one person to see through his struggles, the superficiality of all her rich, white friends, and do something- she challenges him to make his life better. Academically, that'd be a long shot, yet worth it if he can pull it off. His one winning shot? Use his anger, confusion, frustation, and more into a medium, something he's good at- football. But it's not only the friends of the woman nor the teachers who show socially racial bias against this newcomer from nowhere, even a redneck family gets a good chewout by Mike's newly surrogate mother. Literally everyone who portrays any trace of racism gets a good chewout to appropriate degrees, and no one can prepare for the wrath of this one mother who shows she can see through the surface of other people, see their potential, and help them. No matter what it takes.<br />Helping Mike find a place to call home, finding people he can call family, helping him find people to identify with, no matter where from. Even the people from teh ghetto try to take him in, but end up making the mistake of making sexually degrading remarks about the mother and her daughter and Mike being around them. Not a good idea when the guy you're making bad jokes about is literally at least 2x your weight and, despite having a gentle nature, can take you out very quickly and very well.<br />From Mike (the well-sized, misunderstood man willing to be different and hates the way others treats him as though blacks should be gone and is grateful someone sees him as a human being and treats him as such) to the Tuohy family, these people literally transcends social barriers in every way.<br />When I first heard of this, it was through the movie poster. Saw it was a football movie (which I can't stand), so I decided to not try it until I saw the trailer for it, then wanted to check it out.<br />To this day, I'm so glad I did.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|If you enjoy the topic of love in all of its ramifications and aspects, this film provides a humorous and sometimes poignant look at it through the lives of different characters. Love between friends, stepfamilies, employers-employees, colleagues etc. are showcased in this film.<br /><br />It shows how love has to overcome various obstacles to survive and thrive. Obstacles of race, culture, language barriers, age, title, class, work, family, and failure are overcome. This film highlights love's obstacles in a light and humorous way. My favorite characters and story lines are the aging rock star and his manager and the Prime Minister and his biscuit girl.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies of the past 10 years. Even my sons are willing to watch it.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|I wasn't going to write a review of this because several others have done so eloquently on this site. But the thing is--it's been four days since I started listening to this recording, and it's all I want to hear. Great pop albums are so rare, my standards have lowered over the years. An album that has three or four tracks I enjoy is usually cause to rejoice. How About I Be Me (And You Be You)? is that exceptional album, for my ears and soul, that resonates from start to giggling finish. This is the work of a mature and assured artist. Clearly, the production is significant in the achievement, and the playing by the musicians works in synergy with both the artist and producer. But this recording is somewhat akin to pulling a rabbit out of the hat. I have enjoyed certain songs of Ms. O'Connor throughout her tumultuous career, but even her early and most successful albums fell into that three or four song category for me. This one is on a completely different level of great, and it's going to stay with me a long time. Despite the seriousness of some of the subject matter, I find myself alternately teary eyed, or uplifted, and completely happy to be alive at the privilege of listening to every track.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Whether at home or on the go, Splashtop works well as a remote client for the desktop.<br /><br />Two things seem to really set Splashtop apart from similar products. Its interface is well made and takes into account how to best give the desktop experience from a handheld. The account management system with profiles for your computers makes connecting across the internet even easier by releasing the need for specific (and static) network information.<br /><br />I can highly recommend Splashtop to any user wanting to access their desktop remotely.
B006XOBFTM|5.0|So much has been written about Bruno Walter's place in the world of Mahler that adding anything would be practically superfluous. Suffice it to say that the Mahler revival, typically credited to Leonard Bernstein, goes back fifty years; but before that there was Bruno Walter and his recordings for Columbia.  Walter's recordings were definitive at a time, unlike today, when there weren't hundreds of options to choose from. Nevertheless, Walter was to Mahler as Horowitz was to Rachmaninoff, Ansermet was to Stravinsky and so forth - these were close working relationships where the composer's musical vision was passed directly on to interpreters who had the insight and skills to communicate the music in their own unique way.  Are all of Walter's Mahler recordings definitive? With the exception of the Fifth, I would say yes - and the problem with the Fifth, which seems impossibly fast in places, was probably a consequence of timing limitations at the time the recording was made. Even with the frenetic pace, it falls into the category of all of Walter's Mahler which I believe to be inspired.  In summary, these recordings are enduring documents of greatness that have stood the test of time, and this inexpensive package is practically a gift from Sony that allows anyone who hasn't acquired them the perfect opportunity to do so. Five stars.

0062101897|2.0|This book is very cool, don't get me wrong. I love having it displayed on my bookshelf, but as far as content goes, it's a pumped-up version of Harry Potter: Film Wizardy.

B005TZFYNE|4.0|Rihanna's sixth studio album, \\"Talk That Talk\\", is a decent album. As a Rihanna fan, I like this album better than \\"Music of the Sun\\" and \\"Rated R\\" but I don't like it as much as \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\", \\"A Girl Like Me\\", or \\"Loud\\". \\"Talk That Talk\\" is upbeat almost the way through and is balanced between American R&B/hip-hop and European electro-house.  Unlike her other albums, there is only one slow ballad on the album and no occasional rock track.  And at under 40 minutes, it is Rihanna's shortest album to date.<br /><br />Many of the album's songs have good beats.  My favorite song on the album is \\"You Da One\\". It's a mid-tempo song with a very catchy chorus and elements of dubstep and reggae. \\"We Found Love\\" and \\"Where Have You Been\\" are produced by British electro-house DJ Calvin Harris.  Calvin Harris is one of the best at what he does, and these tracks are no exception. Unless you've been living under a rug, you've heard \\"We Found Love\\". The title track, \\"Talk That Talk\\", has a fast, heavy hip-hop beat; \\"Cockiness (Love It)\\" is dancehall infused; \\"Birthday Cake\\" is just a minute and a half long and features a slowed down electro beat.  The latter two are the, umm, racy side of the album.<br /><br />However, the lyrical content on the album is lacking.  \\"Talk That Talk\\" was released less than a year after \\"Loud\\", and it shows.  Many of the songs feature the same lines repeated over and over, and have lyrics that are not clever or inventive.  The album only ballad, \\"Farewell\\", is underwhelming. \\"We All Want Love\\" is a mid-tempo song that does have good lyrical structure.<br /><br />Even though I like six or seven of the songs on the album, none of them stand out like \\"Umbrella\\", \\"Unfaithful\\", or \\"What's My Name?\\" however.<br /><br />If you are a Rihanna fan or a fan of pop music that is R&B-based or club-based, you may or may not be satisfied with this album.<br /><br />(3 1/2 out of 5 stars)

B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible app is a great addition to the Kindle Fire.  Whatever Bible you want comes directly to your Kindle Fire to look at over the web.  The only thing I do not like is you have to have Internet access to use it.  That is not a problem for me because I have downloaded the free Bible book from the Kindle Bookstore.  The other thing I really love is the audio it gives you.  You can listen to any Bible story by listening to a recording of it. This Bible app is a highly recommended app to all Christians.

Also, the touch interface isn't bad but my finger moves faster than the actual Domino, so that has to be improved upon.<br /><br />There are just a bunch of complainers here for the ones giving bad reviews.

The only 2 things I would like is for the dev to make it easier to place dominoes...such as double-click/touch and it plays OR at least pop into place when dragging.  Dragging does work, but I generally have to repeat it several times as it doesn't stick.  Secondly, maybe just me, but I don't get or like scoring.  I can win every hand and still lose?

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|this help application is very helpful to recording thoughts and other notes. I have this application on all of my mobile devices.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|one of the best notepad apps out there. I would recommend it even for beginners. its also free so go ahead and try it.
B001EC3JME|3.0|I bought this flashlight \\"holster\\" for an \\"Inova\\" flashlight (battery size 123). Although I can make it fit, it's really too snug to get the flashlight out without having to wrestle with  it. The holster is designed to expand to some degree but it doesn't do what you would think it does. The concept is excellent but in my opinion, it needs work. This holster works great with a Maglite (battery size AA). Anything larger....you should expect a very snug fit. The clip on the holster to secure to your belt works too well! Nobody wants to lose the holster off your belt but frankly the clip is so secure that I had to unfasten my belt to get it off. This too, in my opinion needs work in terms of the design.
0307931803|5.0|Dr. Seuss, no complaints here. We got this one because it was a board book and perfect for our one-year old to not destroy like he has with other books that get left around. Brings back memories of my own childhood reading this to him :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it especially on the kindle very relaxing after a long day at work. would recommend to any to play
B0048Y9TPG|2.0|There were a couple songs on here that I liked, but the rest made me feel like I was celebrating Christmas at the club or something.  I much prefer her original Christmas album with it's more traditional sound overall. To be honest, I took this one off my Christmas playlist because it just didn't feel like Christmas to me.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|When first I saw the advertisements for this movie, I had no desire to see it.  Shakespeare is certainly one of my greatest literary heroes, and any slight against him (especially when said slight was a claim of complete illegitimacy) was not to be well-received by me.  I was eventually convinced by a friend to watch this movie against my better judgement (it was a choice between Anonymous and The Ides of March; the R-rating of the alternative decided it for us), and am I ever so glad that I was.  This movie is well-written, well-paced, true to the feel of the Shakespearean verse and, perhaps most importantly, very enjoyable to watch.  If you are curious about whether or you would have any interest in this movie, I can strongly recommend it to you.  It may be a bit long, but it never feels slow.  If, however you are like I was, and you are avoiding this movie on account of its premise, I urge you to reconsider.<br /><br />I don't know whether or not it's true, but now, at least, I certainly want to believe it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|enjoyable mahjong game! great graphics, simple play instructions. very addicting!! I reccomend everyone try this awesome app! nothing bad to say about it.

B004L35GAQ|5.0|This has quickly become one of my all-time faves. At first, my favorite songs were the two that get radio play--\\"Guilty, Filthy Soul\\" and \\"Sail.\\" With each listen, though, I chose a new favorite tune, until in the end, I decided that listening to it from beginning to end really told a story, and it is the story of the band. I like hard rock, prog rock, alternative rock, 2-tone, and roots music. I am not a pop fan, but I do appreciate a catchy hook. If your tastes run along those lines, I think you'll like this band and this album. The lead singer has a very natural voice that at times breaks into an achy, hoarse cry that isn't overdone. It's fun to listen to the various sounds and pick up the various influences. For example, \\"All I Need\\" evokes the choir in the intro to the Stones' \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\\" I can't wait for more from AWOLNation.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I spent two hours playing when I first got it. It is kinds nuts. But still a pretty fun game.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I remember watching this show as a kid late at night.  When I got older and appreciated the humor more, I went in search for it.  The only time they would have Daria on air was on channels I didn't have.  When I heard they were releasing the whole series onto DVD, I sought to get it as soon as I could!  Thanks for bringing back childhood memories for me to view over and over again--but now at age 24!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|My 7 and 11year old sons fight over my kindle to play this game. They get excited over the goals and shopping for clothes. Great app for all ages....I love playing too, but don't tell them.
B005723JSQ|2.0|I have enjoyed most other Kinsella books and bought this one the day it came out. The overall storyline was boring and the footnotes were extremely annoying. I usually fly through these books, but this one was definitely more difficult to get through. Needless to say, I was disappointed.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is awesome on my kindle fire. I haven't had any problems, I bought the full version, completed it, and I'm re playing! Its great!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Ok, so I never watched any of the trailers before going to be this little gem of a film.  Whoaaa was I surprised and spellbound upon leaving the theatre!  What other film this year would require you to use the words \\"contemplative\\" and \\"explosive\\" in the same sentence....none I can think of!  The noir vibe created and throwback to the 80s is simply mesmerizing.  With stunning cinematography, arresting violence, and tense dialog, Drive is pure art house action!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for my 12 (soon to be 13) year old. He loves it! He has told me about what he is doing and how hard it is, and how many moves it will take, etc. etc. His younger brother has an easier model and he loves that one. Great toy to make their little minds work!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I really like this game!  The only thing it needs is more levels in the quest.  Otherwise I really like it.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Although I enjoyed the book itself, I would recommend against buying the Kindle version because the publisher decided to make it non-lendable. That means when you are done reading it, you cannot pass it along to anyone else. You can do that at least once for many books. All I can say about that is Boo-Hiss! Next time I will be sure to check whether a Kindle version is lendable before I purchase.
B006ON41FC|5.0|two thumbs up, my kid loves it. two thumbs up my kid loves it. two thumbs up, my kid loves it.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|I know next to nothing about snowboarding, but I do love mountains and flight, and helicopters are cool. These guys drift down mountains of massive scale, tap peaks of snow ridges, then fall sometimes over a hundred feet before coming back into contact with the slope. Tricks mid-run, it's just . . . wow. The music tracks alone are worth getting this Bluray set. I watch this again and again.<br />Update 10/17/2012 I watch this several times a month, sometimes running mute while practicing music, sometimes just to hear the soundtrack. And when someone else gets to see this film, they're astounded. This is a mesmerizing experience, and may someday qualify as literature - I really think so. Please recommend it to your friends -- it's worth the purchase, easily. Update 9/26/2013, still lovin' it!
B004JC16LC|5.0|Many that will buy this box probably have several of these recordings already.  If they do, this box places all this wonderful music in easy to access boxes.  If people don't have alot of these recordings, this box gives the buyer a chance to immerse themselves in masterful recordings.  Furtwangler was an intuitive conductor.  The results were usually empowered and very moving.  I recommend this collection very highly!!
0486274268|5.0|Really beautiful work and easy to understand depictions of a nice variety of animals. I have a few other books on animal anatomy but they're usually very dense and hard to pick apart. This one has loose, gestural work that's backed up by a solid grasp of anatomy. He does a good job of helping you see animal construction quite well, then ends each animal section with a caricature section which is a nice way to loosen up the occasionally dry subject matter.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book in basically 2 days.  I didn't know what to expect when I started it, other reviews were pretty high on the book.  I'm for a fantasy guy than a sci-fi reader, but the written was excellent.  Easy to read, good flow, good pace, and a great story.  I really couldn't stop myself, I just had to finish the book.  And there were some good twists in the story that I didn't see coming which made the story even more enjoyable.
0060920084|5.0|As hilarious as when I read this book several years ago. Bill Bryson's wit and verve comes across on every page - there is not a dull moment in this travelogue. There are many \\"laugh out loud\\" moments in this book, which can be somewhat embarrassing as I read a lot in public places - such as metros, buses, parks...<br /><br />And not only laughter - Mr. Bryson can penetrate through to the lost soul of America with his sly observations - on consumerism, language, modes of travel... Not much escapes the vision of Bill Bryson. His perceptions range at different levels and he is able to turn the humour over to himself as well.<br /><br />After twenty years from publication date there is still much that is valid and real in these pages  - and laughter is ever so important!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have never played solitaire before and just thought I would give it a try.  I like the winning hand feature because I'm learning and otherwise I would not know if I messed up. It seems that if you can't win, you're wasting your time even trying.  I wish the show me how to win feature would pick up where you left off.  The suggestions are nice for beginners. part of the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't feel I'm qualified to say it's the best.  I'm loving it though.
B0036OS3O2|4.0|It's a good value for the price.  Since I got it on sale, I paid $30.  Not bad for a snow boots.  It's not as warm as Sorel or other hardcore snow boots, but it's ok if you are just plowing snow in your drive way.  If one thing, it doesn't give you much traction.  So don't go running around in slush or anyting.  otherwise, it does what its supposed to do.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|There are certainly some good reviews already on here. Overall there seems to be general common agreement about the great production values, great actors and realistic portrayal of Rome during that time - including the violence, tension, scandals and sex. Surely the writers took some liberties from strict history but for the most part does not seem to be an issue. There also seems to be agreement that season 1 is better than 2, but mostly expected due to HBOs decision to quickly wrap up the expensive series.  I thoroughly enjoyed the 2 line story-telling with the imperial families and Vorenus/Pullo. The show was great to see a lot of political maneuvering as well as action. I liked that it showed the more common, and dark, elements of that time as well. It was also interesting to see that the characters sometimes moved in or out of roles as villains/heroes as real life unfolded for them.  My regrets for season 2 were the lack of attention to the increased time gaps (done to move the story/history along of course, but not really bring home just how much time had passed, and the significance of the time it took to get from place A to place B back then). Also, I thought we might see more of Brutus in both seasons accomplishing more (rather than being so torn), and thought Cicero's portrayal as a coward was poor (the actor did great, just thought the writers taking that line left out better options).  Perhaps strangely I thought the best character was Caesar. Historical accounts have him as both villain and savior and Rome had him walking that line as well. I would highly recommend season 1 to everyone, I just wish season 2 wasn't so rushed.
B003L7DK74|5.0|I purchased this item for my son, who lives several states away. I wasn't certain his address wasn't problematic  and I'd never purchased something and sent it to an address, otherthan my own. I ordered and purchased it online,  with no trouble whatsoever, giving his address for delivery.  It was very important, because it was the ONLY item  he's asked for, for his Christmas and this was a post holiday purchase. I had a time finding one.  I was given an 'expected' date of delivery, which through emails to my son, came and went without any delivery. I'm not clear on what held up his present, but sometime later I asked him again, out of the blue, and he confirmed that it had indeed come, as I'd said it would. It was in perfect shape and he was grateful for it.  BULLSEYE!! that's all that really mattered. We're both happy campers! Thanks!

0385534639|5.0|Something about the cover caught my eye. I know you are not to judge a book by its cover as they say, but something called me to the book. I have not finished reading it yet, only 100 pages to go and I don't want it to end, especially a book that truly captures my interest. It was well written and easy to follow. I love to read, I have this book on my Nook, so I am going to purchase the hardcover book and keep it in my collection and read it all over again in the near future. Enjoy the Book.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I got this app to use at church and I downloaded the Nasb version .  when I go to use the app it tells me can not connect to server and to refresh every time I try to look something up.  I thought I downloaded the Bible.  it tells me that version is in my library of downloaded bibles.  this was happening every Sunday and was very annoying.  I sent a message to the developer.  they responded almost immediately that there were server issues that day at that time but all is fixed now.  I responded that my problem happened evert time I used the app and I questioned the whole downloading a version thing.  I received no response.  at that point I uninstalled and found a fifteenth app.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|just as great as the desktop app, maybe better! this has everything you could ask for, and it syncs with the evernote servers super fast too.
B004XISI4A|1.0|GRRM is literally losing the plot (and readers) . This longwinded bloated story is now reminiscent of Jordans Wheel of Time series, which despite the latter authors untimely demise, still wanders aimlessly on and on and on! Whole forests have been wasted on paper for both, though thankfully ebooks may limit the eco-damage and global warming resulting from this literary (??)  waffle. I fear the same fate awaits this series-  maybe I will pass the toil of finishing this series to my grandchildren, at around volume 10 in say, 30 years from now. Such a pity to see such a good first 3 volumes dissipate into such aimless meandering and navel- gazing!!
0439023513|1.0|I was disappointed with this book.  The first two are excellent.  I did not like the ending and thought it was unimaginative and also I got tired of reading about Katniss being either maimed, injured physically or mentally and she spent half the book in the infirmary.  Not a very good ending to a super beginning for the trilogy.
0440242401|4.0|\\"Remember Me?\\" combines aspects of \\"The Vow\\" and \\"The Apprentice,\\" but the best parts of the book are the interactions between the protagonists.  It's a great book for hopeless romantics, with a couple of funny scenes like the one where Lexi encounters Mont Blanc. :)  The focus on memory loss, the annoying corporate politics, and Lexi's dysfunctional family drag it down a bit relative to Sophie Kinsella's other books like \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" and \\"I've Got Your Number,\\" but overall it's a light read that's hard to put down, especially in the second half of the book.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love Mahjong. This gives a variety of tile setups. very fun!  I'm. not sure it worth five bucks but it is fun

B003UESJ9M|5.0|I really enjoy the music. The actors are great,in my opinion. I hope they consider making another similar movie!!!!! Thanks Amazon!!!!!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I have an ipad2, and this works just like they said, you just plug it into the iPad and it automatically start to show you the pictures, you have the option to just view the pictures, download all of them or just pick the ones you want, this will be great for on trips!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|working well so far. cant say anything bad about it yet. still learning though. its on my phone and Mac as well
0786868724|5.0|I love Mitch Albom's writing and I loved this story like all the others I have read by him, however it made me think.. not about faith like most of the other reviews I have seen, but about how many people he will pretty much watch die and write about their story? This was a re-do of Tuesdays with Morrie for me, and I am OK with that.. I am not dissing it at all. I was just off-put by another story about a mentor that had passed.<br /><br />Have a Little Faith was a wonderful read and I recommend it strongly regardless of religion, or none..<br /><br />It is the story of Mitch put to the task of writing a eulogy for his lifetime Rabbi, the \\"Reb\\" and how he goes about his task by learning who the Reb is as a man rather than a religious figure.<br /><br />It also tells the tale of another figure, a Reverend in Detroit and how these two stories come together for Mitch
B004G600A4|5.0|I am EXTREMELY happy when the toddler/pre-schooler combo I have request this movie. Man, it's so much better than Dora, Diego, Elmo, et al constantly bombarding me with repetitive \\"learning.\\" Say \\"backpack?\\" Don't think so, little girl. And where are your parents? You're in the jungle with a booted monkey, wild animals, trolls, and no adult supervision? I'm calling Child Services.<br /><br />OK... moving on. This movie is well animated, well written and well voiced. The characters are hilarious, and the chemistry between Mandi Moore and Zachary Levi is very good. I even learned that \\"Chuck\\" can sing.  I find that, as a dad, I can sit through this movie with my girls and be thoroughly entertained from start to finish without being annoyed or bored. I look forward to watching this movie, even repeatedly.<br /><br />When watching movies with/for kids, I just ask that parents are entertained, too. That's always been my \\"dream.\\" Yeah, I know.<br /><br />My dream sucks. ;-)
B003O86FMW|3.0|So frustrating, between Katniss being an overly oblivious teenage girl to the amount of depth Collins tried to squeeze in before ending this book. Overall the plot line was pretty good, it started a little slower than I had hoped but then picked up. After reading the first one I felt like the characters were portrayed well, in this one they go kind of crazy and then settle back in. Without giving anything away about the plot, I have to say that the ending frustrated the hell outta me! I understand why it was done with all of the themes Collins played around with, but man...so angry but glad I picked up book three already....<br />I'm somewhere between 3-4 stars... really liked but super frustrated..
0767817710|5.0|We love cowboy movies.  We love the Quick and the Dead especially with Gene Hackman.  He plays a real bad guy. One of my many orders from Amazon.  Good price..Good condition as advertised.
1416955070|4.0|Background: Clary is just an ordinary girl, or so she thought, then she began to see things that weren't really there. A mysterious and very handsome boy takes an interest in her ability to see him when others cannot. Clary thinks she is witnessing a murder, when really these mysterious people are Shadowhunters who fight demons on earth to protect \\"mundanes\\" or human. The City of Bones is the first book in the Mortal Instruments series and has all the suspense, action, and romance a teen reader craves.<br /><br />Review: This was a great story. Clary the main character is wonderful to follow; she is a confused teen with few friends and lives believing that her father has long been deceased. Throughout the story Clary makes realizations about herself and her life that form her character all too well. The romantic triangle between her, Simon (her best friend), and Jace (her new mysterious follower) is hilarious and full of sarcasm, drama, and confusion. I really enjoyed this read but was very upset at how this romantic involvement turns out, but I won't spoil it.
1619492911|3.0|As anticipated, Fitzgerald's writing is electric and beautiful. The story, however, is a sad account of two people's plummet into depression and despair. I wish I could have walked away feeling some kind of excitement or lesson learned from this book, but I instead came away with a dark outlook on humanity as it pertains to money and lust.
0439813786|5.0|Background: Hugo Cabret is an orphan, his father passed away in a devastating and untimely fire, and his uncle stopped coming home one day. Hugo is left to tend to the clocks his uncle once kept for the train station, however he also has a secret...he as a marvelous machine. An automaton. It only needs to be rebuilt.<br /><br />Review: I am so glad my younger brother was reading this book. He told me it was \\"the most awesome book ever, and it has pictures\\" so I picked it up. The Invention of Hugo Cabret is not a new book, but it is a classic for young readers, grades 3-6, maybe a little older. Selznick captures the essence of a young boy without a family, who turns to machines and routine to live his life as normally as he can. It chronicles how he finds an amazing machine and rebuilds it to solve the mystery of whose it was at the beginning.<br />The illustrations are beautiful and it is not only a book but you also feel like you are watching the events unfold through the images...so good!
B001TH7GT6|4.0|Don't ever make the mistake of spending too much money on so-called premium cables. These Amazon cables work just as well at a fraction of the price and the frustration free packaging and quick home delivery are nice bonuses. This cable is still going strong after a year.
0545425115|5.0|So, I have to say that I absolutely loved this book! I had some reservations because of all the hype it had gotten and sometimes they fall really flat, but this one did not.<br /><br />Katniss is a teenage girl who willingly takes her younger sisters place in an all out death match instituted by the Capital, called the Hunger Games. The plot takes you on a first person adventure through what happens after Katniss volunteers herself. Kat is a spectacular main character with enough emotion and personality to keep me reading, it has been a while since I finished a book so quickly.<br /><br />The Hunger Games for me was a combination of 1984 (which I hated) and Battle Royale (a movie about a random Japanese class that gets picked to fight to the death on a deserted island) and I think this is a very good comparison. However, Collins wrote about the Capital in a way that made the book as a whole likable-- unlike 1984.<br /><br />The plot line, while entertaining to the younger reader also had a lot of depth for older readers, although I would have read it without that depth, but it was nice. It was also refreshing not to have a love story from the very beginning, or vampires, or zombies...like may currently popular young adult reads.
1416972242|5.0|Background: Clary's mother is in a coma after dealing with her insane father and menacing bad guy Valentine, and all she wants is for things to go back to normal. In this, the 2nd book in the Mortal Instruments series, Downworlder children are dying and Valentine must be up to it. The Shadowhunters are blaming Jace for all the bad things his father has been doing and to make matters worse, Clary's best friend Simon is acting stranger than normal. All they can do is wait and hope that Valentine does not start all-out war with the Clave.<br /><br />Review: I loved City of Ashes, so much more than City of Bones. Here we see the character development continue with the suspense and tension from book one, but so much more. I know it is weird, but I am coming to think that Jace and Clary should be together; all of the tension wouldn't/ couldn't be for nothing right? So cleaver though.<br /><br />I think my only hang up was that the word incredulous/incredulously was used a lot..but I may just be weird about things like that. I really enjoyed the teenage tensions between Clary and Simon, Clary and Jace, and Simon and Maya...fun to read.<br /><br />I am always a little sad when a book ends on a cliffhanger, but I knew it was a series so the next one is waiting for me. :)
1451648537|4.0|With this book, Walter Isaacson presents us with a cradle to grave story of one of the towering and iconic tech and media personalities of the past 50 years. What makes this book unique is the unprecedented access the writer had to his subject in the years leading up to Steve Jobs' death, the fact that the author was there himself to witness many of the later events described in the book and that in spite of all that, the material and the tone of the book has not been tampered with by Steve.<br /><br />Isaacson was in the unenviable position of trying to write a biography and an honest exposition of a dying man, who is not easy to write much flattering about as a person and a human being. One one hand, the indirect influence of the mind and will of Steve Jobs in the lives of millions of people via his contributions to the fields of computing, tech design and portable media is undeniable. On the other hand, the direct influence he had in the lives of people immediately around him due to his arrogance, insensitivity, tendency to alienate or betray them becomes just as apparent in his book. For the most part, the author is able to strike a balance between these two and the task of assessing, whether steam-rolling over people and crushing everyone in his path in pursuit of his vision is an enviable or despicable trait, is left up to the reader.<br /><br />Although mostly well-written, the quality of the book becomes a bit uneven towards the end. The early years of Steve Jobs are wonderfully researched and beautifully presented, whereas the latter years are a bit of a disarray. The problem here is that the latter years have been crafted from the interviews of dozens (if not hundreds) of people, many of which conflict with each other. Instead of presenting us with a flowing narrative, Isaacson opted to give us both (or more) sides of many stories. While admirable in giving us a more well-rounded picture of what may have happened, it unfortunately makes for a jerky reading experience.<br /><br />The other issue is that the author lacks the benefit of hindsight on many of Steve's latest creations. For example the iCloud has yet to prove itself, yet it has been thrown in with the paradigm shifting Apple Mac, iPhone or iTunes as equals, which it clearly is not. Had the book been written 20 years in the future, then undoubtedly many of the events covered in detail in the last third of the book would probably not even have gotten a mention.<br /><br />I also found the detailed introduction of Steve's children quite unnecessary. It is a snapshot in time of the people who Steve wasn't particularly close to and although probably much appreciated by the children, Steve's wife and Steve himself, it is extraneous and irrelevant to the reader. Steve never was a family man, so the segment dealing with his children doesn't really describe him in any meaningful way and thus the value of this part of the book will diminish the fastest in the years to come.<br /><br />All of the above though don't detract from the fact, that for the most part, Isaacson is able to capitalize on his unique access to both Steve Jobs and his friends and enemies, and does an admirable job of painting an honest picture of one of the most fascinating and unique creative minds of this century. As such, it will most likely remain the definitive biography on Steve Jobs. A solid effort and four out of five stars.her issue is that the author lacks the benefit of hindsight on many of Steve's latest creations.

1582701709|1.0|I was so excited to read this book. My excitement didn't last long though; I kept wondering when I would across something earthshattering or noteworthy. That moment never came. I kept an open mind but it was just a huge waste of my time. It's all glossed over theory. I think Dave Chappelle described it best in his bit at the Laugh Factory--sums up what a load of garbage this book is. So disappointed!
B00479SVBU|4.0|This is just what I wanted for listening to music and other downloads while driving. Using my laptop I save stuff to a usb memory stick, and later play it in my car via the FM radio. My only worry is that the plug that goes to the cigarrette lighter might break off if not pushed in carefully.
1451648537|4.0|This is a very comprehensive commentary about a complicated, yet simple man.  Personally, I know very little about technology, but even as a common reader, I could see the brilliance of his mind and the art of his thinking. What the U.S. needs now are more jobs...Steve Jobs. Amazon is great on price and delivery of their books.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this is a wonderful puzzle game. difficult but not exactly created for geniuses. it's challenging enough that i get sort of nuts when i can't figure one stage and won't allow myself to move on to the next one. love the graphics, too. it's like Toy Story meets Tetris meets Whole Foods.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|I did a lot of research on this watch before buying it.  I have heard that Invicta has had some quality issues in the past.....but this watch is FANTASTIC!  People love the watch and ask me about it.  Has good weight and looks impressive on the wrist.  The face is a beautiful electric blue....great to look at!  No complaints!  Highly recommend this watch....you wont find a better watch for the price.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|Skrillex has really done it with this album.  The music is great, and trust me, I know some good music.  The only disadvantage to this CD is that it is rather short, only 7 songs (about 35 minutes).  The price is cheap though, which justifies that.  If you like Skrillex or want to try something new, then get it.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Marissa Meyer's debut, Cinder, is not your typical young adult novel. Yes, it is science fiction. Yes, it is based on a fairy tale. Yes, it is dystopian. It is indeed typical to see all of those genres hitting libraries and bookshelves lately. What is not typical is for the mash-up of all three genres to work well together - and it does.<br /><br />The heroine, Cinder, is a cyborg who is just trying to make a living in post-apocalyptic New Beijing. Cyborgs are second-class citizens that have no rights and live at the mercy of their owners/guardians. She is owned by and lives with her adoptive mother and two \\"stepsisters\\" (only one of them being nasty), doing all of their work. The difference from the original story is that instead of doing actual household chores, she is one of the country's best android mechanics and all of her income supports her family. Cinder is able to mask her cyborg nature from common knowledge by wearing gloves on her refurbished hands and covering her other metal parts, but things complicate when Prince Kaito comes to her booth in need of her service and develops an interest in her.<br /><br />There are quite a few similarities between Cinder and the versions of the Cinderella fairy tale with which most people are familiar. However, do not expect it to be a mirror image (no mirrors at all if Queen Levana can help it!) of the original tale. There are quite a few interesting variances, not least a plague sweeping through the kingdom, and the happily ever after you're looking for may not be waiting for you at the end. There are three more projected books in Meyer's Lunar Chronicles, so it may be quite some time before things head down the path to happiness for Cinder.<br /><br />I've been lucky to read quite a few amazing books lately, but this is the first one that I stayed up all night to read and put down all of my other books for (I usually read 2-3 at a time) since The Hunger Games. It was funny, enchanting, and magical. Scarlet - book 2 in the Lunar Chronicles - cannot come quickly enough.<br /><br />*To satisfy FTC guidelines, I am disclosing that I received the book for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

B003ES61EE|2.0|At first this seems like a great alternative to the regular LensPen brand cleaner.  The reversible tip with different size cleaning pads is a great idea, letting us clean the viewfinder window and other recessed areas that the regular size tip can't easily access.<br /><br />However, there's a terrible design flaw.  The reversible tip body is made of soft plastic (or rubber), and simply will not stay in position.  By about third or fourth circular swirl of the tip against the lens, the tip body is ready to pop out of the pen body.  Very annoying.  I suppose I could tape the tip body to the pen body, but that kinda defeats the purpose of having reversible tip, doesn't it.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|If you're like me - hard rockin' teenager in the 70's, lover of metal in the 80's and beyond - your middle-aged sensibilities might be growing nostalgic for the fine art of \\"clean\\" vocals.  Let's face it, thrash is an incredibly exhilarating genre, but there comes a time when aging rockers want to sing along while banging their heads!  How many times, in recent years, have you listened to a new release and silently wished to yourself that, to go along with those killer riffs, it had a real singer with real lyrics, as opposed to screams, grunts, groans, and cookie monster growls?  Well, if you're a fellow-traveler, you will love this album!  Not only does Joey's voice sound fabulous - and, frankly, I wasn't always the biggest Joey fan - but the lyrics on this album are meaningful, thought-provoking, and clever.  The production is first-class (and I hope Metallica has learned a lesson after the shoddy engineering of Death Magnetic, an otherwise superb CD); every song on Worship Music is a winner.  Though not the fastest or heaviest album out there, the album definitely jams: every song (except the three instrumentals, which are excellent in their own right) has catchy riffs and overtones of genuine thrash.  The leads are technical and wonderfully melodic.  The bass-work and drumming provide an incredibly solid foundation.  There's no need for me to give a song by song breakdown - many reviewers have already done an admirable job in that department.  Let's just say you will find yourself air-guitaring, head-banging, and singing along to these sophisticated, well-constructed tunes.  (Wait 'till you hear the chorus on \\"Crawl\\" - IMHO, one of the greatest hooks in metal history!)  Perhaps it's an overly used cliche, but - in all honestly, speaking of hooks - this album has more hooks than a tackle box!  Notice the high percentage of 5-star reviews at this Amazon.com website.  That tells you all you need to know.  Anthrax has always been a great band, easily deserving its status as one of the \\"Big 4\\" of thrash metal.  With this CD, the boys have proven that it's possible to mature with age and yet stay close to the roots.  Needless to say, highly recommended!  Buy it, crank it up, and enjoy it to the max!
B0063IH60K|4.0|basic game . not easy to win even in the winning mode. easy to see,  clear . hey its free!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love the game! really addictive and a great pass time! the challenges make the game engaging and I always tell myself &quot;one more game&quot; and about 15 games later....im still playing.

B004RKXN44|5.0|I have liked Hawke from the very beginning of this series.  He was a worthy adversary turned ally to Lucas and mysterious and sexy.  But who knew so much feeling and conflict was going on inside!  I never knew much about Sienna, but I was sooo pleased with her personality in this novel.  She is courageous, smart, POWERFUL, loyal, persistent, etc.  She is everything a man like Hawke needed in his life.  ***Spoiler Alert***  \\"Except I never had a prayer when it came to you.  You're in my every breath and every thought, intertwined so deep inside me that love's not a strong enough word--you have my devotion, your name branded on my soul, my wolf yours to command.  A hundred years? It'll never be enough.  I want eternity.\\"  Tears, slow and quiet, ran down Sienna's cheeks.  He wasn't finished.  \\"You have the power to tear me to pieces, to wound me so deep and true that I'll never recover.  What Rissa's death did to the boy I was?  You have the ability to do a thousand times worse to the man I've become.  Some part of me knew that was a possibility from the instant you walked into my life--so I tried to keep you at arm's length even as I demanded everything you had.  I was a coward.\\"  *********  I probably read the above excerpt about 20 times.  Those are very powerful words.  They exude vulnerability and honesty and demonstrate just how intelligent Hawke is and how deep feelings can run in seemingly guarded men.  This was also exactly what Sienna needed to hear. Sigh.  On another note, I was not disappointed in the Lara/Walker story.  It was sweet in its own right.  Walker was another one of those no-nonsense, former Silent Psy and it was evident in his every thought and action.  Very endearing to watch him set aside his fears and embrace his feelings for Lara.  As a matter of fact, I enjoyed reading about the Lauren family in general even little Marlee and Toby.  Finally, outside of Sienna and Hawke's romance (and the birth of Nadiyah Shayla Hunter!--so much happened inthis book!), I enjoyed learning about Sienna's power the most. Up until now, all the Psy, even the cardinals almost seemed like a repeat of the same powers just at different levels of strength.  Sienna, however, blew all of them out of the water.  I loved it and that she survived its power just endears me to her that much more.  I never read romance novels more than once, but my eyes were flying over the pages of this book so fast, I can't wait to go back and savor this book a second time!  I cannot wait for the next installment in the Psy/Changling series.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very fun and challenging. its recommendable for any age group. I think that it is addictive and mind challenging which is something you don't get out of games alot
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love it it is addiicting for a reason unknown it is a challenging game specifically interesting Don't know what to say so blah blah blah blah blah thanks to reading this

B0035ECHJK|5.0|Fellini's great story about a director who has producers, actors, critics, the press and assorted others hanging in the balance while he plans his next film.  Everyone is getting ready to film and the actors are all present but the character played by Marcello Mastroianni doesn't have a story much less a script.  He confronts his wife, his girlfriends, friends and others who are hanging on his every whim and desire for employment and success.  Only with his leading actress, Claudia Cardinale can he let his guard down and allow her to be in the driver's seat (literally).  The others cling to him as he tries to run away and not be bothered in order to think.  The idea comes to him at the last moment before production has shut down and in the face of a staunch critic who tells him that he was right not to try rather than to risk failure.  The effort of creativity, fear of its loss and the vision others have of the artist which can be positive or toxic to artistic talent is a large theme in this movie.  A film to be seen several times during a lifetime.  Once is not enough and only the beginning.  Wonderful and spirit lifting.
B006ON41FC|3.0|Trees nuts and everything in the same place every time. Never a unique experience after the first game, fun for kids gets old pretty quick though
B00005JNTX|1.0|On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being the worst and 10 being the best I would rate this movie 1 and add \\"only because the scale doesn't go lower\\". The reviews on the back must have been paid for because for the life of me I cannot see why anyone would find it \\"in an acclaimed and visually stunning hit that's the coolest movie of the year\\". For starts the movie is in black and white and is done in anime (I think that is what it is called) where it is a \\"life like\\" cartoon. The actors are, sometimes, real but everything is else is cartoon-like. In some instances the lips, eyes, blood, car and in one instance yellow skin are in color. Color is used to accent something. I bought it because I like Bruce Willis. He's in the first story and it is 13 minutes long. Then there is a second story which was 34 of the longest minutes I've ever watched a movie. I have no idea how it ended, if it ended. The third story was so bad I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes. Seeing the movie was only half over I clicked further up the bar and came to a second part of the first story. This is where the yellow man showed up. Even though it was Bruce Willis it was BAD!!! (I bet he doesn't claim this movie on his resume.) Powers Booth was also in this part of the story and, though I like him, the movie was still bad. Not necessarily the acting but the plot and the whole thing. I usually like to watch a movie a second time and/or more because, sometimes, if you don't like it at first you do on a re-watch because you better understand what is happening. I don't think I can watch this movie again and am not even putting it in my collection. I may take it out and put it on the \\"community table\\" for anyone that wants it. I bet if someone took it it would end up on the table again. And again. And again, etc. Would take a special kind of person to like this movie (of stories) and I'm not one of them.
B003G93ZCM|5.0|As my title says, this was the best book I've ever found on the Apollo program and the experiences of the astronauts who flew the missions. Gene Cernan is funny, informative, and tells the story in a way that puts you in the capsule with him and his crew mates. If you are interested in the American space program of the sixties and seventies, this is your book.
1451648537|5.0|Just like every other book I have ordered through Amazon, this book was in impeccable condition. It was an incredible buy, specially because it was a Christmas gift. Loved it!!!!
B005POK858|5.0|It plays Extremely well should be easier to exit out of tho and on my old DROID x it froze my phone up but on my rezound work great and had alot of fun playing it
B006ON41FC|4.0|A fun game that just keeps getting more and more challenging. The graphics are pretty good and the ui is easy to operate. The start up is a little laggy, mainly from the login, after that its smooth sailing.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Dropbox is one program I include on my list of \\"I can't live without it!\\" I have it on my desktop at work, my laptop at home, my Droid phone and my Ainol Novo 7 Elf tablet. I can access files in my dropbox folder from all of them! Without this program several of my other programs wouldn't be one-tenth as useful. I keep my KeePass datafile in my dropbox and all my passwords are available on all my devices. I haven't yet come close to my limit for the free version, but I'd pay for this program regardless! Brilliant and useful concept simply implemented! I simply cannot recommend it highly enough!
B0071NLG0W|4.0|I love Amber Fox. Each time I read her, I like her even more. She is witty, strong and self-sufficient. This book was different and I liked it for totally different reasons than the other ones. While this one didn't have quite the amount of sarcastic wit than the other ones, I loved the mystery in this one more. I thought it was well constructed and I thought the story was going a different way than it did.
B006O5XYWG|2.0|This movie was not that great Why i say that, 1 the Apes are fake and they are not real Apes, 2 there ant no way that a Ape can move that fast, 3 and you can see that they dont move like apes in real life, but if they did put real apes in this movie that would be much more better movie out there to see. I would not wast my money on this movie..
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love it, I never rate apps, I'm just trying to get the popup to go away....but really an awesome game.
0307946711|5.0|I was hesitant to start this book based on negative recommendations I had heard and read. Choosing to read it anyway was one of my better decisions. I must warn you, my appreciation for this book is partially biased. The story of Dex and Emma parallels with a friendship of my own.  Nevertheless, One Day is a story worth remembering, worth reading, worth recommending. I read the last 100 pages or so on a Friday night at college. My roommate walked in only to find me balling my eyes out. We had a good hug and a good laugh. Brilliant piece of work.
0802473156|1.0|I bought this book with very high hopes after reading all the reviews from others. My boyfriend and I decided to read the book together and hoped to learn something useful. Unfortunately, we were both disappointed beyond belief.  Chapman's book tells us that there are 5 main ways that we can show love and affection for our partners. They are:  1. Words of affirmation  2. Quality Time  3. Receiving gifts  4. Acts of service  5. Physical touch  He goes on to explain each one of these in detail and suggests that an individual is most influenced by his/her primary love language (according to Chapman, you are most influenced by only one language and this does not change throughout your lifetime regardless of changes in life situations or any other factors). In case you have some difficulty deciding your primary love language, Chapman gives some advice. For example, he wrote about a woman that was always getting put down by her husband. He was always complaining how she could not do anything right and told her she was stupid. Through a session with Chapman, the woman explained how upset this made her. He came to the conclusion that \\"Words of affirmation\\" is her primary love language! Are you kidding me? Would anybody in their right mind be OK with constant put downs from their partner? I don't think so. This has nothing to do with deciding which is your primary love language. This is a matter of respect from one's partner.  He also uses a situation where after careful consideration, he decided a woman's primary love language was Physical Touch after she complained about getting beaten up by her husband! Really Chapman?  The rest of the book is filled with embellished and fabricated examples in which Chapman is always the hero. He seems to be able to solve anybody's and everybody's problems. On top of this, he ensures the reader is well-aware of his books, CDs, and seminars. This type of self promoting should be banned from self-help books.  This is a topic that could havebeen adequately explained in 2 pages of a magazine article rather than in 13 drawn out chapters. The book is very repetitive. Chapman seems to have made a fortune off this ONE theory of his five languages (which is not backed up by any psychological or scientific studies). But don't worry. If you buy one book and learn the 5 languages, you can apply these SAME languages to ANY other life situation. Please see below for some of Chapman's other books.  The 5 Love Languages  The 5 Languages of Appreciation in the Workplace  The 5 Languages: Men's Edition  The 5 Languages: Gift Edition  The 5 Languages of Children  The 5 Languages of Apology (both in paperback and hardcover)  The 5 Languages, Singles Edition  The 5 Languages of Teenagers  The Heart of the Five Love Languages  God Speaks your love Language  This book was terrible and a waste of time to read. Don't waste your money buying this book, you can have mine.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. it makes reading and studying the Bible very easy. I have learned a lot these past few weeks.
0439023521|4.0|The book is great. I give it an A for writing. It is a very tight story with tight writing.That being said, it is not original and draws from many SF books I've read.  However, it appears that the publisher, Scholastic, snookered Middle Schools in making this a mandatory 8th Grade book. It is not an 8th grade book.It is not Holes.  I have 2 8th graders and of all their friends who had to read this only 1 loved it. The other 11 kids either refused to read it and just faked it or tried and were uninterested in it or didn't understand it.  This is a 10th grade book and is a lower grade example of a dystonian world genre. If Brave New World, Farenheit 451 and 1984 are at the top, then this is a B or C version of that.  I can't imagine an 8th grade class getting into the meaning of Brave New World or this book and how it relates to the Soviet Union or to today's society.My kids said their teacher never mentioned it.  Currently they are reading Animal Farm and they don't really like that either. That is also a 10th grade book.  I have ordered the other 2 in the series but are just reading them from a SF genre point of view. Overall I give the writing an A, but the story a C or B-. Better than most tho.
0345457692|5.0|Do you like Snow Crash? If not, stop reading now. Like Neuromancer? If not, also, stop reading now. Like The Matrix? If not, what the H is wrong with you, anyway? The best way I can describe this action-cyberpunk-noire novel is in this fashion:<br /><br />If Jack Bauer traveled 500 years into the future and wrote a book in first-person about all the people whose asses he kicked, he would call it ALTERED CARBON. Hopefully that's self-explanatory, but in case it isn't, here's more: sex, drugs, rock n roll (not particularly in that order), but it's all in the book. I'll put it this way, point by point:<br /><br />Sex: Explicit. Very, very explicit. Not for the faint-hearted.<br />Drugs: \\"Neurochems\\" can be used to enhance your ability to kill people. Whoever you want, really.<br />Rock n roll: Don't want to spoil anything, but just think Jimi Hendrix.<br /><br />BONUS!!!: People get killed all over the place. Jack Bauer + The Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood) = the main character, Takeshi Novacs (learn how to pronounce that properly, btw).<br /><br />The only weakness of this book is the style of prose--it's a little simplistic and trite. But then again, how would you expect Jack Bauer to write? He'd get to the point. And that's how it's written. It's been a long time since I've gotten chills reading just the first page, but this does it for me.
B0041VB8BO|5.0|Upbeat, catchy, heartbreaking, and addictive. That's what this is for me, at least. My favorites are \\"Be Calm\\", \\"All The Pretty Girls\\", \\"I Wanna Be The One\\", and \\"At Least I'm Not As Sad (As I Used To Be)\\".

B005HSG3VK|3.0|Works well for protecting the Kindle.  Thought it would also be used as a cradle to hold the Kindle but it doesn't work very well.  The flap doesn't fit in the grove.  Like the strap to keep the cover closed.  Great for protection of the Kindle.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Fun game but the permanent upgrades don't work!! Please fix before I go nuts!! I bought permanent helmets for 4000 nuts and never got it!!
1439192812|2.0|The nice things about this book have been said in many other long reviews. Here I only want to point out that: This is a book for teenagers, not for adults. There's no need to spend time and money on this book if you are a college graduate in science or engineering major, or if you have had general interests in science when you grew up.  The title makes it sound like a book on philosophy. But it's really not. This book is basically brief history of various scientific subjects: biology, physics, astronomy, etc. Most of the subjects described in this book are covered in high school or college science courses.  A few pages in, I was kind of bored and disappointed - not much new information. I finished the audio book only because I had nothing else to listen to no my commute.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|This case and screen protector are great for my iPhone 4 from Sprint.  The case can be difficult to get on but once it is, it will provide great protection.  My only major complaint is the screen protector produces a rainbow effect under bright light.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|This book is a quick fun read.  And expands on the world of Percy Jackson.<br />I like these books, but sometimes he treats his readers like they are dumb, not just young.  He beats the reader over the head with details and foreshadowing rather than letting the readers explore on their own.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|Hello, my review for this watch is this: its a really good time piece, of course it is big, but i think it is one of the advantages among others, big numbers, 60 minutes chronograph, it does all i want i a wrist watch; since the first day i wore it people started to asked about it, and one last thing remember to apply for the five year warranty in invictas web page, see you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow.  After reading \\"The Hunger Games\\" in one day I was more than a little excited to start \\"Catching Fire.\\"  I was not disappointed.  I could not put this book down.  At first I feared this series bearing resemblance to the sappy \\"Twilight\\" series since both are young adult fiction.  However, they could not be more unalike.  Where \\"Twilight\\" is a sentimental teenage love story (full of subtle hints of absinance) in which Bella continuously depicts herself as a pathetic teenage girl willing to throw her life away for a boy, Katniss is her superior opposite.  She is everything I wish I could have been at her age.  Confident, powerful, athletic, alluring, smart and not to mention BAD A**.  Of the three books in the series, \\"Catching Fire\\" is my standout favorite.  Katniss has won the Hunger Games and thinks she and her family are safe for life, however, the Capitol has other plans for her.  I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say it's more of Katniss kicking a** and taking names.  I would recommend this book to anyone of any age or gender.  I dare you not to love it.  If I could have given it more than 5 stars, I would have (could NOT put it down).
B006ON41FC|5.0|love this game, good graphics on my tmobile sensation 4g, super fun to play and very addicting. highly recommend to anyone who wishes they could fly...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you enjoyed the first two books of the series then you'll love this one as well.  The story of this book is a little different than the first two, which revolved around Katniss and Peeta fighting in the Hunger Games.  \\"Mockingjay\\" instead is all about the revolution against the Capitol with Katniss as their symbolic (and literal) hero.  I wish it could have ended a tad differently (I don't want to spoil anything), but other than a few little details, I think the book was a great story.  This is less a story about teenage issues and more of a story about an uprising a revolution against an evil dictator.  Enjoyable by anyone!
0385040253|5.0|This is a very detailed book that has tons of pictures anlong with their explinations. Some of knots could use a little more detail, but overall this is a must have for a sailor.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|HBO does it again!  As someone who loves anything WWII and LOVED \\"Band of Brothers,\\" this was no disappointment.  This miniseries was done a little differently.  It revolved around 3 marines and their stories and struggles.  This series focused a lot on the toll the war took on the characters and was an extremely emotional experience.  The vicious nature of the Pacific side of WWII is exposed in this story and really made me appreciate the sacrifices our heroes have made.  Though I have always been in awe of our soldiers' sacrifices (my grandfather is a WWII vet and fought in the Pacific), actually seeing depictions of the war in the Pacific was something else.  I found myself emotionally involved with the characters, feeling their pain and fear.  I loved it so much that I immediately went out and read one of the autobiographies that the series was based on.  HBO did such a great job creating visuals for what I read in the book that I can only assume \\"The Pacific\\" was an extremely realistic depiction.  I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoyed \\"Band of Brothers\\" and anything WWII.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy this app! The best thing to have when you want to study the Word or have the Bible read to YOU! Awesome!!!
B007C4ZJ3K|2.0|Great cast ,great acting, horrible script HORRIBLE directing. If u can get past the first 50 min its tolerable<br />. I regret the 7 bucks I paid to see this the previws looked amazing! But,I was mistaken.Please listen to me and ATLEAT rent it before you buy it!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This works great to protect the screen on my kindle.  Was worried that I would scratch it and that would create a problem when reading.  This cover takes the worry away.  Plus it is a fun color
B0036OS3EM|2.0|I like how the boots look and how easy they are to get on. They do keep my feet warm, however my boots leak. Whenever there is rain or snow my feet get wet.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is the only movie that has ever brought me to tears and also made me laugh alot as well. Very good movie and I would recomend it to anyone who is a father. :)
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Wow. Wow is the only word I can say to even come close to this album, Yet it is still an understatement. I love Muse and they made an awesome album (ONCE AGAIN), and I can't wait to see what they'll do next!  1) UPRISING - This track is amazing! At first listen I couldn't get the catchy tune out of my head, \\"They will not force us.. They will stop degrading us... And they will not control us... And we will be victorious!\\", beautiful... The song starts with a nice bass intro, and then the drums/claps come in, along with a synth. When Matt's voice comes into the song... It completes it, even though the song has far to go. The song's length is around 5 minutes. But overall, this song is AMAZING!!! 5/5  2) RESISTANCE - This song gives me chills whenever I listen to it... The epicness is overpowering... And his voice is amazing... First the track starts with a weird starship sounding noice, and then the piano and drums come in. The lyrics are magnificent! \\"Love is our resisitance! they'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking down! Hold me! Our lips must always be sealed!\\" is the chorus. And his voice is amazing, so what more can I say? I LOVE IT!!! 5/5  3) UNDISCLOSED DESIRES - What a beautiful 3rd track. Matt's vocals are beautiful (AS ALWAYS), and the music is amazing!!! I listened closely to the vocals in the background on the chorus, some special effect is used to make Matt sound robotic, I don't now their intensions, but I love it! The song is played with a lot of instruments, but most noticably is the strings (WHICH ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!!!). I wonder how many instruments Matt must know how to play, being the songwriter of a band with so many instruments in their songs. It's amazing overall. 5/5  4)UNITED STATES OF EURASIA (+COLLATERAL DAMAGE) - This is probably one of the most obviously political track on the album. I mean, besides \\"Uprising\\", \\"Reseistance\\", \\"MK Ultra\\" and \\"Unnatural Selection\\". I can't see any others being really political. Well, this track is very amazing!!! And I love how the outro goes right into \\"Guiding Light\\". It's a very beautiful track. 5/5  5) GUIDING LIGHT - Probably one of my very favorites on the album, but doesn't it sound like a Christmas song? All well, I love it. It's romantic, epic, epic, epic and... EPIC!!! I love this track, it represents Muse's new style very well, though still shines off of the old style of the other albums. 5/5  6) UNNATURAL SELECTION - The longest track on the ablum. Starting with a organ, it quicklty turns into the most hypergenic track on the album. My favorite lines are, \\"Counter balence this commotion, we're not droplets in the ocean\\", I don't know why, it just sticks like glue in your mind. Probably the most catchy song off the album. 5/5  7) MK ULTRA - My very favorite song off of the album. It is one of those songs that just gives you a very warm, epic feeling. The guitars are amazing, too. It's just so amazing, I can't stop listening to it! I love all the tracks, but this one is AMAZING with a capital A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! I love the darkness of this song, and the happy-sounding moments of this song. It just gives me an open, energetic, amazing peice of comfort. 5/5 (OBVIOUSLY)  8) I BELONG TO YOU (+MON COEUR S'OUVRE TA VOIX) - Yes, I know this track is on Twilight. But I still love it like every other Muse song. I think it's beautiful and mysterious. I love it so much! +Matt sings very weill in french! 5/5  9, 10 & 11) EXOGENESIS - I know I should review them seperately but they are like one beautiful symphony. Anyways, this track is also very amazing. And yes, there are lyrics. It has a very nice feel to it, it makes you feel very warm inside with all the symphonic instruments + Matt's vocals!!!! 5/5  WHOLE ALBUM RATING: 5/5  NOTES: GO ON! BUY IT NOW!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|title says it all. very enjoyable way to kill time and game is very User friendly unlike some other card game apps
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so fun I play it all night long I can never put my kindle fire down that's how addicting it is.This game is a 5 star review for me.
0618918248|4.0|This is an intelligent, detailed religious polemic on the existence of God, coming down resoundingly against. And make no mistake, it is a polemic, with all the accompanying pitfalls of argument by advocacy instead of by pretense of strict fairness. So you are almost certainly unlikely to be swayed from your own beliefs, *especially* if you believe.<br /><br />On the one hand, Dawkins' tone is almost always didactic, pompous and often even truculent towards religious believers; which is irritating -- he is a little like the (also atheist) villain played by Donald Pleasance in the American cold war film \\"Fantastic Voyage\\", the script of which equates atheism with cold-hearted intellectualism, communism, and (therefore) evil, by way of this character. Of course this character dies horribly in the end, a fate that has so far eluded Dawkins and his ostensible blasphemy.<br /><br />One might count how many times Dawkins uses the word 'nonsense' - it must be at least a dozen. And a bigger number is how often a synonym for nonsense is used, though I don't remember him resorting to 'poppycock', 'balderdash', 'horse feathers', 'twaddle', 'tripe', or other such hackneyed phrases (admitting myself that \\"hackneyed phrase\\" is similarly hackneyed.) In short, Dawkins' whiny indignation is almost laughable.<br /><br />So Dawkins falls flat at the task of persuading by way of gaining sympathy for his case, and this is more relevant that it should be, since his approach is prosecutorial and therefore emotional (in the sense that he expresses outrage passionately and almost constantly, and occasionally injects tangents out of his field of expertise about Mother Teresa's intentions, the lack of credibility of childhood memories of sexual abuse, etc, that temporarily debase his argument into an almost Limbaugh-esque rant.)<br /><br />Yet on the other hand, and despite all this prosecuting of religion, the core of his argument is sound to my ears. And his outspokenness on such a controversial subject is admirable. In fact I agree with almost everything he says, even if he seems as dogmatic as do those faithful folks he so passionately disagrees with, since his dogmatism is mostly informed by, expressed with, and correctable to the facts; and so can be held accountable for it's intense certainty in a way that religious dogma cannot.<br /><br />The best sections are those in which polemics are set aside, and which describe in eloquent and illuminating detail how astounding science has been at raising human consciousness by lifting the veil on so many mysteries of nature, proving its value as a superior epistemological tool, one that has probably surpassed religion. In particular, his defense of Charles Darwin and the great consciousness elevation that Darwin's theory of natural selection propelled, are clear, concise and almost devastating to the cherished eternal verities of intelligent design believers, and especially to their intellectual leaders.<br /><br />Dawkins, with several tips of the hat to Carl Sagan's words on the subject, is also very informative on modern cosmological theories which beautifully explain so much of our vast cosmos and how the universe may have come into existence. This is a topic on which the bible has little to say which can be verified, or even clearly understood -- for example, the idea of the firmament (written in the first book of Genesis) which seem to be described as a giant lid over the sky, possbly solid or liquid, between the air we breath and outer space beyond the earth.<br /><br />These wonder-filled elaborations on the beauty of scientific discovery form the most worthwhile core of Dawkins' argument. The rest -- in which he selectively picks out the most horrifying biblical passage, dresses down religion's many failings though history, and takes an axe to various cherished consolations that religion is assumed to provide -- is a little too personal, generalized and biased for my tastes, given my own experience with so many intelligent, good people who love their religious beliefs and who make those beliefs work in very productive ways, and harmlessly to others. But as an explanation as to why so many scientifically minded people do not feel an urge to believe in God, and to how scientific knowledge, wonder, and awe might replace that of religion to the few of us truly open to change, I found much to appreciate.nce with so many intelligent, good people who love their religious beliefs and who make those beliefs work in very productive ways, and harmlessly to others.

B0053JJLLC|4.0|This is a classic Micheal Crichton novel, a blend of the cutting edge technology and fiction. Michael always poses the questions, \\"where will this science / technology take us? How will mankind abuse it? and what will the outcome be?\\" I realize that since his death the novel was completed by another author, but you'd hardly know. Gripping suspenses and a fantastic view into the micro world of nature. If you enjoyed Prey, Airframe or Jurassic Park, then you'll love this book.
0802473156|5.0|Great book shared by my daughter in love... So of course I had to share with all. Only thing is this edition doesn't go indepth like the original regarding other love languages.
B000FC13E0|5.0|This is possibly the best novel he has written, I have read all Crichton's books and this stands out as one of the best in terms of his blend of fact, fiction and cutting edge technology, hung on a frame of a genuinely good story. So sad this great man has passed away.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This is much cooler than the regular game of Mahjong.  It kept me interested for a while!  I would have given this 5 stars if it didn't have the adds.  This is a PAID app... there shouldn't be adds!  :)
B0060FXDCG|5.0|This was an awesome sale on the trilogy and provided a great weekend of entertainment. Fantastic special effects! Amazon and the Transformers were a win/win combination.
B006O3MU96|2.0|The game only one place to play I was so happy at firest but then I realized it was not that good
0783219695|5.0|What a fantastic story to be told and what a great cast to bring it to life. I have watched this numerous times since it arrived and it just never gets old. Highly recommended!
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I remember listening to Graceland when it was first released - it didn't fit into any existing category and the songwriting was astounding.  I listened to it a lot until I somehow lost track of the CD in one of several moves.  The new, remastered CD still strikes me as both original and compelling.  This is a classic, timeless in its combination of musical elements and cultures.  I still know the lyrics to most of the songs and sing along shamelessly in the car.  Everyone should have Graceland in his or her music collection.
0316017930|5.0|There is a reason why Gladwell's 'Outliers' is called the #1 National Best Seller, because it really is as good as everyone says it is!  I was skeptical at first because I'm not really into those \\"if-you-work-hard-you'll-succeed\\" books that present such a boring cliched view on a boring cliched subject.  It is anything but that.  Gladwell explains that there is no such thing as a self-made man as he explores the lives of familiar and unfamiliar names that grabbed opportunity and came out at the top.  He also explains why some people didn't make it to the top.  It's a very fascinating book that was able to keep my attention well, especially because he explored many different topics and explains his theories and stories skillfully.  I read this for my college English course and really enjoyed it, and would definitely recommend it to college professors or avid readers anywhere!  It's worth it!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works well, great map feature, but I wish it was a little faster. Some times it crashes, on restart. Forecasts are laid out well.
B005GI26PS|1.0|As someone said before, it didn't work on my kindle as a default dictionary. I don't see the point in buying it if then we can't use it.
B005HSL626|5.0|it is fun if you like twiddling your fingers and think your a ninja!!! they have fruit ninjas at craigs cruisers that's how I found out about it.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I tried to instill this game 5 times. It did not work ones. It is a rip off.do not get this game.waaaaaaaaa
0060555661|5.0|Learned a lot from this book and I think everyone should read this book before they start trading.  Read this before investing in a financial advisor so you can talk in the same lingo.  This book is easy to understand and explains a lot of concepts to you that other financial websites or news programs expects you already know.  It will give you a good overview of financial market.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|No real complaints folks. Its the best remote desktop I've ever used. Does everything I want. We use it for streaming our huge movie collection, mostly for our daughter when we want to keep her busy.
B00127RAJY|3.0|The workout was very good and intense, and that was level 1. I haven't even touched levels 2 or 3 and I am not super over wieght or out of shape. I would say I am about average. This DVD whooped my you-know-what. I was ore for days. I think the longest stretch I have done it was 4 days. It just gets so repetative after so many days, and it is so intense, I need something more low-key. Even if that means I have to work out longer.  I do recomend this as a good hard core \\"quick\\" work out, but not a 30-day \\"shred\\" Give your bod a break to recover!!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Wonderfully complex strategy game with lots of excitement. A great evening of fun for the family or friends- it takes a little bit of learning to get started but the subtleties of positioning and approach make it endlessly entertaining.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good fun but don't get enough points. cant open other games til you have enough points. I have to keep going back and playing other games over just to get more points.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is awesome!!! i love getting.g points on it and saving them up so that i can buy a lot of games at the same time!
1416583408|5.0|I wish I'd had this information decades ago. This book will open your eyes to how we misinterpret a lot of the signals our dogs send us every day. I've become better at understanding my Westies' behaviors and what they are telling me. This book will help you see the world as your dog sees it, which is a very different perspective. Did you now that dogs DO see some colors? Blue green and yellow mostly. If you ever wished your dog could talk, this is a must-read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|the description doesn't do it justice. it is a very zenlike game where alot of thinking is required. you have to move a raindrop and catch all the pearls. you wont regret buying this game!
0316056863|5.0|I'm actually sad that I'm almost done reading this book. Puts me in a good mood every time I pick it up. I'm a big \\"30 Rock\\" fan and adore Tina Fey. She has a way of expressing some of the woes and gripes of her life in such amusing ways that it's quite inspiring. I definitely recommend this book to anyone that enjoys silly, light-hearted, and, at times, perhaps slighty crass humor.  Wonderful read.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|very elegant interface - a lot of fun spinning the globe and useful features like alarms and time slider; I looked an several apps - this one beats all of them, stable operation
0823013626|5.0|There is a lot of information in this book!  It tells you in clear terms how to do so many different techniques.  Not all books deliver what they say they will, this one does.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Wonderful, heartwarming, perfect for all men who have families or will some day. Puts a man back as the leader of his family as God designed putting God first and directing his life by being a godly example for his family.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|This movie starts out shocking, carries the shock through the middle, and finishes with shock. It has the perfect ending for any movie. Even greater to me than Apocalypse Now, which can rarely be achieved. To those that say its boring, well it is long, but I never got out the world that the director made. At no point in the movie did I think outside of the movie, for example \\" Hey I think I left the door open.\\" And I didnt find any plot holes in it. I really incourage everyone to watch it. Even if you think its boring you cannot miss this. Dont take my word on it that its a masterpiece or what not, just watch and see for yourself. Let me just tell you its worth more than 10 bucks if it gets so much reactions from this amount of people.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game. it is some what like temple run that isn't on the kindle wich it should be. it is so much fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is off tha chain. I mean dang how hard can u go 101 games y'all really need to pat ur selves on the back. the whole buy option is just plain genious
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this backpack to take the place of my little camera bag.  I have a nikon D5100 camera that i like to take with me pretty much everywhere.  I read several reviews on several different camera bags before choosing this camera backpack.  I really like the compact design of this bag.  It has many different and easy to access compartments for each of my camera accessories.  It even has a velcro spot to put your tripod on.  The only Con that i can see is it is not weatherproof, but i have not taken it out in the rain to see how wet the inside gets if any.  I love the inside compartments where you keep your camera and several lenses.  All in all, this is a GREAT backpack for your digital camera and accessories :)
B001E45XT4|5.0|This headset has to be by far, one of the most comfortable ones I've ever had.  The earpads are quite large and easily overlap my ears, providing the sound the best chance to really reverberate in my head.  The top of the head is also padded (as shown in the picture) and this makes the headphones very comfortable.  The sound quality is good, sometimes it needs to be turned up a little more than I'd like for me to really get the feel of the music, but I've never had a glitchy problem with them.  The mic is really good, I mean, what can you say about it?  It transmits your voice really well!  It's also extremely easy to forget that it even has a mic since it can be hidden so well in the headset portion of it!  One negative thing is that when wearing these for extended amounts of time in hot weather the headset gets hot.  The cloth padding really warms you up (which could be positive or negative depending on weather).  The cord is extremely durable in accidents (I slammed the car door on mine and drove for 3 miles before realizing it, didn't even leave a mark on it) but is a little heavy sometimes.  Overall this headset is DEFINITELY worth the money!  :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|quick action and just as addictive on my kindle fire as I remember from those first computer solitaires in the 90s!
B005FMZVLQ|4.0|Overall the quality of the watch is about what I would expect for this price point. It's a quartz motion, and it doesn't lose too much time. I have no particular complaints about functionality, and it appears to be relatively resistant to moderate wear and scuffing.  The band is a little lower in quality, and I've noticed that after a few weeks it's started to get a little discolored. Not a big deal to me, but it may make sense to pick up another band.  It is a fairly sizable watch, and if I didn't have particularly large wrists it would look fairly out of place. It's also very thick, so be cautious if you've got smaller arms.  I picked this up on clearance so your mileage may very if you're looking for best value, but in the near hundred area (± $20) it seems like a fair bargain.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Added this game to my kindle and love playing it on there as opposed to my phone or PC. Picture clarity is awesome on it and it seems to run more smoothly.
B004UHSB5A|2.0|This game isn't that great... It was the free app of the day, so why not? But I definately wouldn't pay for it. The graphics and game layout are terrible. Rules- simple... In otherwords, go buy yourself a real pack of dominoes with the money you would spend on this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is so convenient to have when I need to access my Lord! I can read anywhere without worrying about damaging the pages. This really is a great feature to have. The absolute best app EVER!
B0063IH60K|5.0|works great.  never freezes.  allows me to exit back to home page, unlike some other apps on my kindle fire.<br />would recommend to others.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I am so thrilled with this case. It doesn't feel cheap at all, yet costs under 10 dollars! Typically the inexpensive iPhone cases are garbage, but not this one. It is very well made, fits my AT&T iPhone 4S like a glove (nice and snug, not loose at all), and looks GREAT. I also bought one for my mom who has an AT&T iPhone 4 and it fits perfectly, as well. The screen protector it came with is great quality and was quite easy to install. I can't even tell it is on! I am really pleased with this case. I love Amazon and their AmazonBasics line hasn't let me down yet. Highly recommend!
B004UHSB5A|2.0|Requires that the tiles be so precisely placed that the game becomes frustrating to play.  Graphics are very basic and small.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Love the Twilight Saga! Breaking Dawn Part I is great! Can't wait for Part II in November.  This is my favorite book of the Saga because it let's Bella have a more exciting personality than the other movies or books. So good!
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I bought this for my Verizon iPhone 4 and it looks great.  I have the white one so I wanted to have the white color show through, which this cover allows for.  It fits well onto the phone and protects it pretty well too.  I have a more colorful rubbery Otterbox cover as well that probably protects the phone better against damage in case you drop it, but I like to rotate the two cases back and forth.  For $9 and free shipping it's definitely a good deal.
B005COO1X6|2.0|I am a Stephen King fan. I love a good thriller. However, I was extremely disappointed with this short story. I will admit that it drew me in right from the beginning. I had to keep reading to find out what was going to happen next. But when the story turned weird, my excitement was gone. There was nothing exciting about \\"the bad guy\\" so to speak. The ending made no sense and offered no explanation. I understand writing about weird beings and such, but at least explain the why or the what. It was a waste of my time.
0439023491|4.0|Great product and excellent service. The shipment arrived within the time scheduled and the price of the product was very good.<br />The book is good but not as good as the first one (\\"The Hunger Games\\").
B004UHSB5A|2.0|Computer cheats!  On three occasions so far the ai has made illegal moves.twice they played a double on the end of an existing double, and just now they played a 5,1 backwards to score .
0307592731|5.0|I am not a hiker, or an outdoor or nature person. The very idea of attempting to hike the Pacific Coast Trail, as Cheryl Strayed does in Wild, seems like the least entertaining idea possible. Yet I was riveted by this book, from the sad start as Strayed recounts her mother's death, to her eagerness and unpreparedness, her trial by fire, sometimes literally, such as when she has to burn parts of Faulkner's book As I Lay Dying. \\"It hurt to do it, but it had to be done. I'd loved books in my regular, pre-PCT life, but on the trail, they'd taken on even greater meaning. They were the world I could lose myself in when the one I was actually in became too lonely or too difficult to bear,\\" she writes. This is a memoir about fortitude and fallibility, about battling and pairing with nature, about doing something unthinkable, emboldened in part by not thinking too much about it. The writing is as impressive as the feat Strayed describes, and Wild is a memoir in the true sense of the word, not simply about her adventures hiking, but all the moments that led her there and how those moments crystalized into various decisions, good and bad, whether heroin or flings or friendships.
B006O5Y0SS|2.0|I was hesitant to watch this movie...then it was nominated for Best Picture, and that intrigued me. I read the  synopsis, and it explained that the movie had a moral to it; sometimes that grass seems greener on the other side, but life is what you make of it. I gave in, and watched it. My first instinct, that hesitation to watch it, was spot on. Not my type of film. Owen Wilson could have been portraying Woody Allen, he rambled just like him, in that nonsensical manner. People were talking about wine, history, art...the main characters came off as snobs/yuppies, and not very likable. The story itself was very simple. I like movies where I have to think about the moral of the story; this film explains it to you.  The acting was good, the locations were nice to look at, but overall, there wasn't much story.
B004UHSB5A|4.0|I love it, but its a little sticky with moving the tiles, a little fix on that would be great, but other than that, I love the app.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I had been using XiiaLive (paid version) for Shoutcast and streaming audio, but TuneIn is much nicer. Many more features, better (and less gaudy) interface. Easier favorites management. Oh and it's also substantially cheaper. Wish I had known about TuneIn before shelling out for Xiia. If you're into streaming internet radio this is the app to get for sure. Definitely worth paying a mere $0.99 for to get rid of ads.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like the variety.  There truly is something for everyone.  I also like how you get points to unlock the next games but you don't have to beat every game.  This is a great game!!!
B002BWP49M|5.0|Bought Breaking Dawn Part 1 from here and it was exactly what I expected. Still in the shrink wrap, no damage and the shipping (standard) was fast. Thanks!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great for all types of people.. have fun and download this game its awesome I'm 16 and I love this game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like how this game has a lot if different games with all different challenges. I really love this game!!!
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is fun and really addictive i love it and i play it all the time its one of my favorite games
B0007MWZEK|2.0|IN SUMMARY:<br />Don't expect a hepa vac or a hoover windtunnel but for me it certainly did a quick and rough spruce up of my small entrance foyer and back patio that is always getting light sprinklings of grass & woodchip debris, dead leaves and palm seeds.  Still - running it felt like a noisy toy from the 60s. Easy enough to empty with note to REMEMBER NOT TO turn the sweeper upside down as debris could fall out of the two gaps there. Great portability for seniors.  Shonky quality but for the price $20 - it goes where the iRobots are not allowed to go.  I wonder what the differences are to the G2 and G3 (battery life aside)  ANOTHER DOWNSIDE: CHARGER DOES NOT INDICATE WHEN THE CHARGE IS FULL - I find myself wondering when to take it out.  Read a lot of review of peeps frying their batteries or needing to buy new ones.  SNEAKY!<br />=======================================================================================<br /><br />Mine came RED, but is NOT the G2 or G3 after all - I am hoping it's not a fake (I see a lot of black units when not G2 or G3)...<br /><br />Got this online for $19.95 plus $11 shipping.<br />A little carried away when I first noticed it, I had not realised there is a 2nd and 3rd generation which has better batteries, the 90degree elbow joint and touchless bin opener.<br />Package arrived today and here's the take.<br /><br />Features are great.  Quality is iffy.  I can't imagine this unit was sold previously for $98 (claimed online) unless there is a drop in quality specs or change of manufacturing source. The handle is a two part screw on like the pledge swiffer - just feels a lot flimsier.  Like the battery charger and battery which is currently charging for at least 8hrs prior to use.  Glad though that the shaft is \\"bendable\\" though the mechanism felt very flimsy.  Even happier that the \\"touchless bin\\" is there. The 4 rows of brushes are sparse and not dense - hence be interesting to see how much is picked up, how much is missed, how long it takes to finish the job and wear & tear.<br /><br />First run [on stair carpet]:<br />After 9-10 hour charge, sounded underpowered but was quite surprisingly able to pick up carpet lint and debris on stairs with just a light swivel rolling motion (w/o force). The manouver was less than ideal as the Sweeper \\"Stick\\" was not as rigid as one would like due to the many joints and parts making it already \\"rickety\\". If more robust, would keep this for the stairs.

0439023521|4.0|I get asked by parents all the time, \\"Should my son or daughter read this particular book?\\"  My general response is yes, unless there is something completely inappropriate (age must be considered here) or the book is just a waste of time (think Diary of a Wimpy Kid).  So, if you are going to read The Hunger Games or allow your children to read it, utilize the opportunity to engage them in conversations about the various themes and concepts introduced by the book.  The Hunger Games raises very interesting issues for dialogue - from the idea of a Christ-figure to the ethical dilemmas of \\"what would I do if.\\"  I put my notes on our school website for our parents to use to help them learn more about the book and to give them discussion points so they can sit around the dinner table and dialogue with their children about The Hunger Games.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I got this because I used to have a ford fusion with sync, and being able to play music off the thumb drive was nice. I missed that feature. I didn't want to pay a few hundred bucks for a head unit and installation. This works great in my truck. I get no static and I chose the first frequency it offered. My power outlets are pretty close to the stereo so that might help with the absence of static. I have no problems using the remote to navigate the folders and files. You do have to point the remote directly at the unit. The position of my power outlet allows me to see the screen clearly even in the day light, however I can tell that some people may have a hard time seeing the screen depending on the location of their power outlet.  The only downside I have found so far, my power outlet stays on even after the vehicle is turned off, so I either have to power the unit off, or unplug it. Not that big of a deal, because most of the time I remove it if I'm going to be away from the vehicle for any length of time.  I'm glad I found this unit. I hate listening to the radio, and I don't want to be constantly swapping out cds.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Playing this great game reminds me of all the times I would play with real cards with my grandparents!! Love the game and the price was great at free.
B0013AZTR0|5.0|I'm agree with Doctor Dan. I've bought this XRCD in Hong Kong a few years ago and when I compare it with the 2005 SACD we are in another world. Who have made the SACD? May be shoes sellers but not musicians or music lovers.
B001DHXT1G|3.0|The movie was good, no question there, though clearly not one of the better movies from hte Marvel universe.  Ed Norton as the Hulk was good, too bad they lost him for the Avengers.  Now, on to the produect review.  This came with a Digital Copy disc, no code to activate it.  That's really annoying.  No, it wasn't listed as Blu-Ray+Digital copy, but clearly it was at one point.  that means that either it originally had no code, or someone opened it, and took the code out.  It was listed as new, not previously used or previously opened.
B002NJWHHA|4.0|Alright so I have never read the books and still have yet to, all though I'm sure I will someday. This movie was nothing great it lacked so much, but I'm not surprised it's Hollywood. Take any good idea cut it up into little pieces and then film it. This movie had great potential for being one hell of a good movie, but it was destroyed by the 1:30:00 dead line that is for some reason the guide lines for movie making... I don't get it. If they had given this movie a longer run time and given the story time to develop and evolve It could have been a Masterpiece. What made The Lord of The Rings so great? The fact that Peter Jackson didn't settle for half-assed. while he couldn't exactly make 10 hour movies he crammed every piece he could into those movies and gave them a decent run time that gave him a lot of breathing room on what he could incorporated.<br /><br />So would I like to see a sequel? Absolutely but for the love of god make it more than an hour and a half, and stop taking the story and giving us the summary.<br /><br />The movie was disappointing but the CG was phenomenal and Rachael Wiesz as the voice over was a good pick. Overall I'd say watch the movie if your bored.
B002VECM72|3.0|Great movie, good story.  Bullock delivers a believable performance.  Well worth owning.  Now, on to the produect review. This came with a Digital Copy disc, code expired. That's really annoying. No, it wasn't sold as Blu-Ray+Digital copy, but clearly it was one.  Digital copies should have an expiration date (in my opinion) but if they're going to expire, release the movie without the copy please.
B006ON41FC|5.0|i love this! however feint is REALLY annoying adds wise, if you pay for something you should be getting zero adds, period!
0061726834|4.0|Oliver writes beautifully, but to enjoy the story, you have to stick you head in the sand about some of the inconsistencies.  For example, if love can be eradicated through brain surgery, then the cured patient shouldn't care about anything much less get irritated or angry about something.  And if patients don't love, then what's their motivation for living?  I actually enjoyed the love story even though it is was fairly predictable because of how beautifully Oliver takes you through Lena's inner dialogue.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I can't say where this latest entry in the Mission: Impossible franchise ranks among the other three, having been too long since I've seen them, but I can say that it's one of the best action movies of the year boasting a stunning collection of extravagant action sequences including at least one that will become iconic. It shows that, just a year shy of 50, Tom Cruise is still more than capable of being the ultimate action star, braver and more dedicated than many half his age. Brad Bird, known for acclaimed and beloved films like The Iron Giant and The Incredibles, makes his live-action debut, bringing an animator's sensibility that I think is at least partly responsible for why these action sequences are so memorable and extravagant. Anything is possible in animation and Bird doesn't allow shooting a live-action film to interfere with this credo. He may have a background in animation, but he obviously knows what makes an action movie work as Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol doesn't rely solely on CGI and the latest technology to make its most impressive sequences come alive. There is CGI of course, but the most impressive action sequence here uses it only to erase the cables and wires used to protect its fearless star. Furthermore, Bird opted to shoot 30+ minutes of footage in IMAX rather than 3D, thank goodness, and he has fashioned a film that continues to impress me the more I think about it.  The film opens with two heart-racing action sequences, the second of which involves IMF agent Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and newly promoted field agent Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) orchestrating a Moscow prison break for Ethan Hunt (Cruise). Once he has escaped, Hunt is immediately put on assignment to infiltrate the Moscow Kremlin archives to assist in identifying a person of interest, code-named \\"Cobalt.\\" Things go wrong on the mission and Russia declares the occurrence as an undeclared act of war, prompting the president to activate Ghost Protocol and effectively disavow the entire IMF. Joined by William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), the IMF secretary's chief analyst, Ethan and his team must stop Cobalt (Michael Nyqvist) from initiating nuclear war with none of the government backing or tools usually afforded to them. Branded as terrorists and with government agencies all over the world after them, they truly find themselves with an impossible mission.  These movies are defined by the greatness of their action sequences, which will lead many to brand Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol a great film as each sequence is followed by another with a higher or equal breadth of vision. These sequences are clever, inventive, and frightfully exciting, assembled by people with a true grasp of how to put together action. The scene destined for future icon-status, already the most talked about part of the film, features Hunt, equipped with gloves that adhere to glass, climbing up the glass windows of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. It's common to see a character in an action film scaling a tall building; less common is when the building is the tallest building in the world, the character is more than 100 stories up, the scene is shot on location without green screen, and that's actually Tom Cruise up there instead of a stunt double. How's your masculinity feel now? This is the best action sequence of any film this year and I have complete faith in making that statement without further vertigo that my palms were actually sweating and I breathed a sigh of relief when it was all over. I saw the film on a standard theater screen and was astonished by this sequence, but I would pay full admission price just to see this one sequence alone in IMAX.  The Burj Khalifa is the main set piece among additional action sequences that seem equally determined to make an impact. More elaborate and well-executed than what you'll find in most action movies, they don't take themselves too seriously and usually balance suspense and humor in equal measure. The scene in the Kremlin is certainly goofy, but undeniably clever. Renner's big sequence, an idea that had to sound too over-the-top on paper, involves a large spinning fan, a magnet, and a steel mesh suit. It works due to Renner's convincing fear and the even-handed filmmaking. After all these fabulous moments, the final action sequence in a space age, multi-level parking garage that was constructed over six-months solely for this scene may be underwhelming in comparison, but would warrant high praise in any other film.  It's written by Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec, two first-time screenwriters with backgrounds in television. Writing is often overlooked on a blockbuster action picture, but here it's equally responsible for this latest entry in the Mission: Impossible series working so well beyond the awe-inspiring action moments. It functions almost as a direct sequel to the last film and intersperses moments of strong dramatic conflict, allowing the heroes to be human rather than emotionless machines. The dramatic conflict and the comical character Benji may seem a bit formulaic, but it works by using a formula rather than following a formula. The smart script breaks some conventions with Jane, the \\"love interest,\\" being an agent who is just as smart and capable as those around her and able to hold her own in a dangerous situation. She is there to look sexy too, but her purpose isn't just to share romantic moments with Tom Cruise. In fact, there is no romance between them which makes her seem like an important supporting character rather than the static \\"sexy female agent\\" character. I don't know how much of Benji results from being played by Simon Pegg, but he works as the comedic foil because he's not over-the-top or preoccupied with inserting witty dialogue into every sentence.  The greatest weakness is the main villain, who certainly isn't as interesting as the hero. The idea of starting a nuclear war to initiate the next stage of human evolution is a bit of a stretch for any psychotic villain but, more importantly, he seems less interested in accomplishing these bad deeds than the heroes do stopping him. Nyqvist does a fine job in the role and he has the perfect look and demeanor to eventually play a Bond villain, but his character here lacks a real feeling of purpose and depth.  All of the acting is fine, more than adequate for an action film. Patton is convincingly tough, Nyqvist convincingly evil. Pegg isn't too brash or obnoxious as the comedic relief and Cruise is his typical, sensitive but fearless self. It's been said that Renner has been introduced so Cruise can pass the torch when he finally steps away from the franchise and I'll admit that he settles into the role well as he possesses the emotional depth of a real actor and the physical prowess of an action star. I'm not ready to see Cruise step away from this franchise, but Renner could be quite effective in his shoes. He does a particularly good job looking frightened before jumping down a ventilator shaft; I wonder how he would've reacted having to climb the Burj Khalifa.  Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is a film that you can see without risk. If you disagree with any of the positive elements I've mentioned, you're left with exhilarating action sequences that can't be dismissed. It's a blockbuster action film that intends only to entertain and it succeeds so wonderfully at doing so. People have qualms with Mr. Cruise because of some zany television antics a few years ago and his controversial religious preference, but this is all irrelevant when you get down to the movie and his performance. Few actors bring the amount of dedication and desire to entertain that Tom Cruise does with every film he's in. At 49-years-old, Cruise is still a bonafide action star that can convincingly play a character like Ethan Hunt without resorting to self-deprecating jokes about a receding hairline or high cholesterol. This man works hard in his movies, doing things that some much younger actors would pass on. On a recent television appearance, Cruise was asked why he didn't use a stunt double for the Burj Khalifa scene. \\"He was afraid of heights,\\" Cruise replied.  Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol shows that this franchise and Cruise's star power are far from burning out. With the brilliant creative decision to bring Brad Bird on board, this is a great action picture, more entertaining and creative than most of the blockbuster garbage that's spewed into theaters and gobbled up like fast food by philistines. In an era when filmmakers seem to think that CGI is all that's necessary to make a blockbuster, it's great to see a solid action film using traditional daredevil tactics while utilizing the latest technology to improve on tradition rather than replace it.  GRADE: A-
B001974DG0|5.0|From beginning to end this book was captivating.  Koontz is a master at making you care for his characters, and he doesn't disappoint with Watchers.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|me and many users just saying about this game was an ads-paid-version.  (Actually all G5 games does.)  Okay, let's forget about that.  Problem is: I can't even start the game!!!!!!!  All I got was open the applicaton--->watch the ads--->click \\"play\\"--->black-screen--->force quit the app!  vote it 1 is very friendly I think.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|The case is strong but I would have preferred one with a light. I also thought it would stand both ways but it doesn't.  All in al I like my husband's with the light better.
B0068RHSCW|3.0|To begin, I agree with a lot of other reviewers in the regard that the trailer pretty much spoils the whole movie. It absolutely killed any kind of potential suspense factor for the movie.<br /><br />With that said, I'm still not sure how I feel about the movie. Daniel Craig's acting was a little suspect to me. Maybe it's just his style but sometimes it felt like he was just having conversations with his self and frequently gave off-key, emotionless responses. Beyond that, I'm still really sure what to make of what happened. I got the major storyline. But the way or the order they depicted things left me still confused as to what actually was happening.<br /><br />I give it a 3 because I can't award a 2.5. And the movie probably is better if you just watch it without knowing anything about the story.
0439023483|5.0|I bought just the first book thinking I should hold off on buying all three. (I've been disappointed by others before). NOT THIS TIME. I bought it, and then immediately bought the 2 hardbacks. But I couldn't wait, so I downloaded a free copy (sorry!) I still bought it though, and will be urging my friends to read it. I read all three books in about 2 and half days, I couldn't put it down. Yes, I even carried it to the bathroom with me.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have just completed the 30 day shred and it's amazing. I should begin by stating I don't love working out. In fact, before this video I did not like it at all. Sure it feels great afterwards but it takes so long to see results. Not with this DVD! My scale has not changed much but that may be because 1. it may not be an accurate scale 2. I have not followed a perfect diet. For the most part I keep to 1200 cal a day but there have been a lot of slips in 30 days. Regardless, you won't regret doing this video. It's 20 minutes, which is motivating in itself. Jillian can be annoying but I'm so zoned out on the pain and focused in on what i'm doing I forget she's bugging me. She will motivate you and you will feel AMAZING after 30 days. I'm going to be doing ripped in 30 next and I couldn't be more excited to work out!! Who knew?! 20 minutes a day will tone you, motivate you, give you confidence in your strength and make you want to stay active and healthy...it's worth it!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is super fun. I really enjoy playing it. ive literally spent hours playing it already. I would reccomend it to anyone, anyday.
0525478817|5.0|I read Looking for Alaska a few years ago, and loved the book so much that I vowed to read all of Green's subsequent novels. I was a huge fan of An Abundance of Katherines, but did not really enjoy Paper Towns for its unreal characters and implausible plot. This book, however, is why I love John Green. Funny, but touching. Insightful, but modest. This book is fantastic, and I recommend it to anyone. Very easy read, and great writing.

1594203334|5.0|I devoured this book in 2 days after getting it on my kindle. I am not a mother but plan to be one in the near future. Nor am I one of those france-obsessed americans, who think the french do everything better because they're european. I do work with young children and have a lot of experience with upper-middle class american families.  I found this book to be fascinating, enlightening, and applicable - I plan to keep many of these insights in mind for my own future family. I have read and re-read it, highlighting sections and taking notes. It seems like those who are bothered by this book are personally offended because they feel that the author is accusing them of being a bad parent or calling all american families deficient in parenting skills.  I think this is unfair to the author, as Mrs. Druckerman clearly states that she is not making blanket statements about ALL FAMILIES - just many that she has observed (including her own). In my experience with young children, her insights are right on.  Don't be scared away by the controversy. This is now one of my favorite books!
B005QUQ99K|5.0|My 5 yr old grandson is all about Lego's - specifically Ninjago Lego kits - these days, so I ordered this set for his birthday. The first 3/4's of the set went together perfectly, but I will say the last 25% was a bit more difficult than what we usually encounter (and that includes putting together the giant ATAT at Christmas time), and still doesn't stay together very well. That said, my grandson loves the set, and that's really what counts - not that Grandma had a hard time putting it together!
B0071T5PN0|5.0|How often do people wait years for an album and have it be better than they hoped for?  I'm not a Hagar hater, but there is no substitute for Diamond Dave.  Yes, his voice just misses that note once or twice (especially without Michael Anthony), but the swagger and attitude just take Van Halen to a different level for me.<br /><br />Some people are upset that the alot of the material was written years ago and reworked to some degree, but I'd prefer material spawned when VH roamed the Earth as a rock giant compared to studio musician collaborations that are weak reminders of former greatness.  (I'm thinking of you, Aerosmith.)<br /><br />It's not perfect, despite the 5 starts I give it.  Roth misses some notes, I think Eddie replays a couple riffs from released songs, and there's no Michael Anthony.  But within seconds of starting it up I was fired up, felt twenty some years younger, and maybe, just maybe, that bald spot on top filled in a little.
0345529057|5.0|I came across these books by chance and am so happy to have found them!  The storytelling is fantastic, the characters are well-developed and easy to love/hate, and the story itself makes it impossible to put these down.  Previously, my favorite series was the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon but this set makes it impossible to choose.  I find myself reading into the wee hours of the night every night and will truly be sad when I am finished with these books.

B001KOFH2G|5.0|If you are a fan of the series or have never seen the series, you will enjoy this movie. If you have never seen the series, this may cause you to purchase it! It has action, science fiction, fun, and even romance. How can you go wrong? The story flows and there are a few surprises - even for fans of the series. This is Joss Whedon at his best.

B006UG90RM|5.0|I must agree with many of the other reviewers, this is a CD to move you and wake your Rock & Roll spirit.  It's fresh and classic and it's NOW! I've listened to it about ten times through and just can't get enough.  This album is what the American public needs to uplift us in these difficult times.  To see these guys (a family band more than ever) pull it all together is just such an amazing success story.  I am so happy for them and all the fans who now have this masterpiece, \\"A Different Kind Of Truth.\\"
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I first heard about this book in a Ted talk.  That got me interested to read the book.  The book is easy to read.  I found the book to be full of truths.  Of course I found pieces that would certainly not work for me in my environment but that was expected.  All in all I loved it.

0446573019|4.0|A bit of a stretch to give it 4 stars. Far, far too similar to the Jack Reacher character of the Lee Childs series - physically large, deadly combative miltary guy with similar mind set and mannerisms. He, at least, does own a car and a cat so not quite so footloose. And still in the military. Could also be similar to Mitch Rapp character by Vince Flynn but far more compliant to the wishes of his institution. Interesting story but certain things do not ring true such as the tremendous lack of military support and not sure the terrorist act highlighted justified the objective. Good beach book. Like most of his stuff it moved right along.
B004NSULHM|4.0|The first 3 times I listened to this album, all the songs seemed to kind of blend together into one body of work. No single song really stood out and almost seemed kind of uninteresting or even boring.<br />Last night I decided to give it a fourth listen and focused more on the songs than I had before. I realized that this is an extremely complex album that has a lot of subtle layers in the songs. It's also a very atmospheric album and that makes it harder to acknowledge certain songs. My personal comparison would be a cross between \\"Amnesiac\\" and \\"In Rainbows\\". By listening more intently, I also discovered that the first 3 songs on this are average and should've either been cut or replaced with something of better quality. Track by track:<br /><br />1. Bloom- 3.5/5<br />2. Morning Mr. Magpie- 4/5<br />3. Little By Little- 4/5<br />4. Feral- 5/5<br />5. Lotus Flower- 5/5<br />6. Codex- 5/5<br />7. Give Up the Ghost- 5/5<br />8. Seperator- 5/5<br /><br />I really don't think this is a bad album but I also don't think it's anything to rave about either. There are really only 5 top notch tracks on an 8 song album so essentially, if you cut off the first 3 tracks this is a nice EP.<br /><br />If you're a die-hard Radiohead fan, you'll find something to enjoy about this album.<br /><br />For people who are getting into Radiohead, start somewhere like \\"OK Computer\\".
B006UG90RM|5.0|I did not expect much when I bought this album.  After listening to it the past week I am shocked at how much intensity Van Halen at this stage in their career.  There is not a single filler song on this disk, and more than half of the tracks are up there with anything the band put out in the 1978-1984 era.  Amazing work, high energy, and inspiring guitar make this a must buy album for any hard rock fan.
B000Y1H7VA|3.0|One thing needs to be addressed here: D'Arcy Wretscky (bass) and James Iha (lead guitar) had no involvement with this album. The problem with this is that these 2 people were crucial to the sound of the Smashing Pumpkins and without them, you're left with the primary songwriter Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlain writing and playing all the new songs on this album and acting as if this is still the same band. This plays like a Billy Corgan solo album as it should and should've been marketed that way and saved people a lot of confusion. It also might've sold better too.<br /><br />Now, having said all that, I want to fairly describe and judge the music on this album. In some songs, there are faint reminders of the Pumpkins sound but the majority of the songs sound like Corgan had a clear vision and made sure they sounded like his vision to a point. It feels like Chamberlain is his back-up drummer (which should make sense). The songs are very hit and miss; one minute, I'd be thinking \\"how pretentious and lame\\" and then the next I'd think \\"Corgan's in his element and I'm loving it\\".<br />Some reviewers tear this album apart because of the missteps and the mistakes on the album and how the whole thing was marketed. Here's my fair ranking of each song:<br /><br />1. Doomsday Clock- 3.5/5<br />2. 7 Shades of Black- 3.5/5<br />3. Bleeding the Orchid- 4/5<br />4. That's the Way (My Love Is)- 5/5<br />5. Tarantula- 5/5<br />6. Starz- 2.5/5<br />7. United States- 3.5/5<br />8. Neverlost- 5/5<br />9. Death From Above- 5/5<br />10. Bring the Light- 5/5<br />11. Come On, Let's Go- 3/5<br />12. For God and Country- 4/5<br />13. Pomp and Circumstances- 5/5<br /><br />So you see that some of the songs aren't good but all in all this is a decent Billy Corgan album.<br /><br />Pumpkins fans should recognize this for what it is and if you like Billy Corgan's songwriting, this isn't a waste of money; just know what this album really is.<br /><br />People new to the Smashing Pumpkins should get \\"Siamese Dream\\" or \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" for a real introduction to the band.uld get \\"Siamese Dream\\" or \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" for a real introduction to the band.

B0067QPVJ6|5.0|I had not seen the 1982 film in about 20 years, I remember it as a kid, & how it scared me to death, however, when I heard they had done a Prequel film, & that Mary Elizabeth Winstead(Die Hard 4) was in it (why have we not seen more of her??), I immediately ordered both films on Amazon, the 82' film is about the only Kurt Russell film that I didn't have, not having seen the 82' film in so long, I was able to judge both films on their own merit, & I have to say the filmakers were smart to do a Prequel, in this one we find out what happened to the Norweign outpost, these team members unearth the alien who has been buried in Antartica for thousands of years, Winstead is Kate who is a scientist & discovers that the alien can replicate humans, just as Wilford Brimley realized in the 82' film, she tries desperately to warn the others, but the alien thaws out & goes on its killing spree & learns how to replicate the others, Joel Edgerton(young Owen in \\"Star Wars Ep II)& the guy who played Mr.Ecko in \\"Lost\\" are here as the helicopter pilots who are the first to discover the \\"Thing\\" & try to warn the others as well, Winstead's Kate pretty much becomes the hero who is in many ways equal to Kurt Russell's character in the 82' film, we discover how the two-headed creature came to be, the ax in the wall, the dead guy Russell & Richard Dysart find in the 82' film, & why he committed suiside, but most of all, we discover that the helicopter sniper seen at the beginning of the 82' film is actually a survivor hell bent on destroying the dog seen running at the end of this one, I really liked how the this one runs directly into the 82' film, this is a Prequel done right, when I went to watch the 82' film with Kurt Russell I was amazed at how well the two films connected to one another, & loved this aspect of it, & some reviewers have mentioned inconsistencies with the spaceship in the snow, in the 2011 film, it is buried underneath the ice, in the 82' film it is not, however if you watch the very end of the 2011 film where Winstead & Edgerton are looking for the alien, he tries to leave, but is intercepted by them, the alien had fired in engines, only to turn them off to deal with Winstead & Edgerton, it can be assumed that the heat of the engines melted the above snow roof which in turn would make it visable as seen in the 82' film, highly recommend this one to fans of the 1982 film.<br /><br />Spoilers.....Winstead's fate becomes unknown just as Kurt Russell & Keith David's fate in the 82' film...if they do a sequel, they should at least explain the fate of these three survivors..
0545101417|5.0|I had previously read the books and enjoyed them!  I wanted my husband to read them as well but knew with his work schedule he wouldn't be able to so I bought these for a road trip we were taking! Great way to pass the hours in a car!!
0307588343|5.0|This book is a real life \\"thriller\\". I enjoyed it so much i have given it twice as gifts. I wanted to understand how the mortgage failures and the banking system and Lehman brothers all worked together to create this nightmare and this book tells all. It reads well and is unforgettable.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I really like this app! I use it to journal when I am away from my home computer. I tried several other apps before settling on Evernote. But Evernote met my needs better than all the rest. If it had better cut and paste ability between notes, and didn't wipe my notes out when I exit the program, I would've given it a 5 star rating.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I give this product two thumbs up. It's sturdy enough to provide good protection for my kindle, light enough to not bog down my purse, yet \\"cheap\\" enough that if my dog chews on it (and she probably will) I won't be heartbroken over the cost. :)<br /><br />UPDATE: I have used this daily for about seven months. I have traveled with it, dropped it a thousand times, even left it outside for two days on accident. It is still in \\"like new\\" condition. It gets banged around in my purse or bookbag every day and it is still holding up great. I will be buying another for sure!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire. Great app. This is the only weather app I will use and very easy.
B00130VLZ4|5.0|I was very satisfied with the camera case. It was just as advertised.<br />Delivered in a timely manner. I would recommend this case to anyone.
B007BLCGNU|2.0|My wife and I watched this movie and I had to wake her up  towards the end of the moive. She called it a \\"sleeper!\\" Pun intended!  Not one of Eastwood's best movies. Giving this movie two stars out of five  is over-rated.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|If you like Adele you will LOVE this concert DVD. It is so good I can't stop watching it, and it comes with a cd of the performance so i can take it everywhere! As far as her \\"filthy\\" language, I couldn't care less. She's real, and hilarious and there is an edited version out there for people that are concerned with their kids viewing it. She interacts with her audience in such a genuine way. Simply put, its fantastic and definitely worth owning.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love hidden picture games. My favorite is Mystery Case Files. This game is right up there with that. I love how you can play a relaxed untimed game. I have played way over my $4.99 to buy the game. If you are looking for a fun hidden pictures game this one is great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Hours of fun.  Great way to relax after a good book.  I have yet to discover any negatives about this app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love the game, it's a great challenge and the perfect way to pass the time.  Those who whine about having to unlock the extra games should read before they download.  5 stars!
0307959856|5.0|The truth is P.D. James doesn't write romances.She writes mysteries. This one is compelling. If Austin's book has value because it gives us a glimpse of life and love in the 18th century this one is valuable because it broadens that view to show us a society caught the Napoleonic wars. It gives a harrowing view of the justice system as well as life on the crowded streets of London. It makes clear the importance of class, honor and duty in the structure of English society. It contains all this along with a  well told story that highlights the plight of those left landless and without support in such a society. She does all this while retaining the flavor of Austin's style.<br /><br />Anyone who sets out to read a romance will likely be disappointed. Anyone who loves a mystery by one of the best mystery writers around they will find a great read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app so much it is so cool how many mini games it has!!!! And it is free!!!!!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I read the reviews stating that it was a tight fit. I didn't have any issues at all. It is absolutely beautiful and laid perfectly flat from the moment it was put on. It is amazing quality. It's super soft leather and just what I wanted. I am a happy camper!
0143034901|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I had never heard of Carlos Ruiz Zafon but found the book in a bookstore by chance.  The cover and plot looked interesting so I ordered it.  Definitely one of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br />There are way too many murder-thriller-suspense stories in bookstores these days.  They are as predictable as the rising of the sun.  However, the setting and plot of this book are very unique.  Plus, there are nice twists and turns that keep the story flowing.  Mr Ruiz Zafon's writing style is excellent.  Highly recommend \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\".
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Great series if you are into Vampire movies!  My niece loves them.  I got it for her Birthday and she loved them!  Now she wants them all!
0451232577|2.0|I got 300 pages into this book and just couldn't continue.  It's like a 20-hr miniseries on TV where nothing really happens.  It's just dull.  Too predictable and too boring.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app to study cor bible verses frum &lt;3 it expecially for thi kindle fire yaaaaaaa love it
B00003CXQY|5.0|My son had been wanting this DVD for a long time so  he was very pleased.  Thank you that it was in excellent  shape and sent promptly.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I am very glad I bought this cover for my also new kindle fire.  This allows me to put the fire in my bag and not worry about the kindle getting scratched.  I leave the cover on all the time and never take it off.  It is both convenient and comfortable for both sitting and reading or for carrying around.  It works well, just as advertised.  It is VERY light, which is what I wanted.  I don't think this would protect your kindle fire if you drop it on a tile floor from a height of 3 or 4 feet, but if that's what you need, there are other products made specifically for that kind of use.  I also really like the elastic strap on this product which allows you to secure the cover either off the screen or on the screen.  I would recommend watching the available video to see how it all works.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|What a great album full of clever musical arrangements and lyrics that touch your soul. It will stay on your play list for a long time!
B006ON41FC|4.0|fun game that is completely addicting  easy to gather nuts and buy the items needed for each goal I love this game
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good game just wish it didn't take so many coins to unlok the levels but my kids love it too
0307888908|5.0|Fascinating and invaluable for any person, employees, entrepreneurs and business owners, looking forward to be successful. Reid is the modern/digital combination of Dale Carnegie and Napoleon Hill. He is sharing his and analyzing other's success, determination and vision. The true ingenuity in this book, is that through this pure and natural advise, Reid also markets, in an elegant way, LinkedIn - wow, that is clever and at the same time pure.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I've used Polaris Office, QuickOffice, and OfficeSuite. Of the three, OfficeSuite is clearly the best for use with the Asus Transformer keyboard. The software recognizes all the normal keyboard shortcuts, which makes writing much easier.
1595827684|5.0|Wonderful book packed with many many drawings. The book essentially outlines the creation process of the characters/alien species, architecture, weapons, vehicles and clothing as well<br />as passages here and there of what influenced their design and any major revisions plus any other things they tried out.<br /><br />It's split into 3 sections: Mass Effect 1, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3.<br /><br />As for anyone concerned about spoilers: there are some in the Mass Effect 3 portion (which is clearly labels as Mass Effect 3 to keep you from venturing forth if you want to wait until you finish the game).<br /><br />They aren't major spoilers that will give away the plot, but still some minor character appearance spoilers.<br /><br />If anything, it will raise more questions. But to be honest, I kind of wished I would have not seen those so I could have been more \\"surprised\\" while playing the game instead of just being \\"surprised\\" looking at pictures.<br /><br />But in truth, it will not ruin the experience knowing in advance. I'm still looking forward to it but now just have some questions that need to be answered through the game play and plot.<br /><br />If you appreciate conceptual art and design, you will appreciate this book. And if you are a die hard Mass Effect fan, this will give you more of an understanding of why they made the game they did, and what it could have been. Plus the pictures of the early Elcor designs are worth the price alone for all their hilariousness.<br /><br />And most of all, this book will give you all the more appreciation for Bioware's art direction because believe me, they could have taken the game in a different, very unoriginal direction. But instead they stuck with the more obscure and original designs.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game.  it is perfect for all ages and challenges any age group.  hopefully it will play without the wifi on for plane trips
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is the best game ever its so fun everyone should have it! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

6304698623|5.0|I'm writing this review for those of us who read the book asking: \\"is this version like the book???\\" No it isn't, I love to read and up until I saw this movie I thought that the book was always better than the movie however here that is not the case.  This movie surpassed the book in many ways it evoked more emotions than the book ever could and though I loved the book it never made me cry like this movie does every time I SEE IT! It is also way better than the Shirley Temple version which was sickeningly happy and seemed to gleam over the fact that her father died on her birthday!!!! I watched the first 30 minutes of that version and turned it off right away.  This movie is beautiful and I recommend it to anyone especially people who read the book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its great fun but some of the games aren't amazzing! wish there was more variety!! great for people with too much time on their hands!
B0062QFZ10|2.0|I too bought this CD on the recommendation in the Gramophone magazine, but that turns out to be not a convincing performance to me anyway. There are many far greater recordings of the Beethoven, Syzerng, Schneiderhan, Arabella Steinbacher,to name a few. The Berg is better. Not high up on my list of recommendation.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Title: The Hunger Games<br />Author: Suzanne Collins<br />My Rating - 5 Stars<br /><br />There are times when the sheepy decisions of the masses make you shake your head and wish that you had moved to Costa Rica. Those times include the 'Whoomp, there it is!' years, IMHO. And then there are those times when those same sheep make pretty good decisions. What a burden for the holier-than-thou, the eschewer (not accepted in Scrabble) of all things trendy, the misanthrope who will wait a year to watch it at home rather than commune with the sheep.<br /><br />I went to a really great concert in Clearwater, Florida once. It was a Norah Jones concert. She played in a little park by the water and it was a beautiful, clear evening. At sunset. No lie. There were people with blankets and wine and children strewn about the lawn and everyone, absolutely everyone, was relaxed. When Norah Jones became popular I remember thinking that it was really great that everyone loved her because she was, well, really great. How can you not love her? Well, I am sure that there are some people who find a way, but clearly they were few and far between. Score One for the sheep.<br /><br />Like everyone else, I have also become a fan of Stephanie Meyer, and not just for Twilight, though I enjoyed the saga a great deal. It was suspenseful and fun and sexy. I found it to be a great read. I also loved the Host, which I DON'T think I've reviewed here. I will have to do that one next! But I consider this grudging acceptance of my enjoyment of her storytelling Score Two for the sheep.<br /><br />Having made this transformation, I decided to go ahead and read The Hunger Games. And I loved it. It is completely horrifying, as was its intent, and yet fascinating at the same time. Though the audience of the Games in the story is seen as sort of bloodthirsty and sickly fascinated, you find yourself feeling the same way once the Games begin. It is a frightening dystopian story, which is very popular right now,and I think it is one of the better ones. My only criticism would be that the ending seemed a little abrupt. I know it is a trilogy (reading 2 at the moment), but it seemed to fail to end as a stand-alone book would do and felt a little odd. Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend it for the fan of dystopias. And so I must say, Score Three for the sheep.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Seconds to learn, hours to master, great 3d graphics, lots of goals to keep you interested. Would definitely reccomend to anyone
B003O86FMW|5.0|Title: Catching Fire - 2nd Book in the Trilogy<br />Author: Suzanne Collins<br />Warning - Spoilers<br /><br />My personal feelings - LOVED this book!  LOVED it.  Truly.  It's weird, because there is a lot of revisitation, but it's done right.  I felt like she was true to Katniss and Peeta throughout.  My only beef is that I never really connected with Gale in the first book and still struggled to do so in this one.  I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />In this story Katniss finds herself adrift in the Victor's Village with Peeta and Haymitch, in an uneasy place with her former best friend, Gale.  Though he kisses her once, that is their one moment and then they must retreat back into their roles.  Gale now works in the coal mines, like all men from the Seam.  And Katniss just tries to survive the calm after the storm.  Everything changes when a personal visit from President Snow let's her know that all is not well.  The Capitol did not like her outsmarting them with the berries and there is unrest in some of the other districts.  He warns her to convince the world that she was in love with Peeta, despite the fact that she is not.  It is clear from his threat the the lives of the remaining people she loves hang in the balance on her ability to tell the right story and save the Capitol face.<br /><br />Which brings me to the Quarter Quell.  You'd think that revisiting the Hunger Games would be redundant, but it was actually pretty fantastic.  You meet all the other Victors and even fall in love with a few.  A dangerous thing that, to care for a character in this series.  They tend to die off at an alarming rate.  The Quarter Quell Games are truly diabolical and disgusting, but all of the preparation leading up to them gives you hints of a hidden pattern, an organization.  Though Katniss seems oblivious, even she begins to sense something different in the conversations and interactions with others around her.  In the midst of the Games, alliances are forged and Katniss once again has to place her faith, and her life, in Haymitch's hands. Her only goal is to save Peeta's life, a repayment of debt for his sacrifice in protecting hers in the prior Games.  Despite her surety that she does not have the same feelings for Peeta that she has for Gale, under the cover of night and in the middle of Hell, they reconnect once again.  This time there is no pity, no sickness, no cameras, only Peeta and Katniss and hunger.  To say that this leaves her confused is to imply that this is a romance novel.  She's not confused, she has no time to be confused!  She is trying to stay alive people!  So it's a moment, just a moment.<br /><br />When her alliance begins to figure out the Game Arena, they start to manipulate what they can.  They craft a plan to electrocute their two most dangerous remaining opponents, but &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILER - DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE NOT DONE!!!>>>something goes terribly wrong.  Katniss is badly cut by a supposed ally and she returns to the site of the trap to find that it has broken down.  She puts together all the pieces that have been floating in her mind and fires a shot right through the Arena force field and it explodes.  When she awakens, she is in the custody of the legendary people of District 13 and she is safe, but she finds out the Peeta is not.  He's been captured by the Capitol and she is bereft, confused, and angry.  The only person she will talk to is Gale.  Unfortunately, though he assures her that her family is safe, he also has to tell her that there is no more District 12.  The Capitol bombed it off the map following her stunt in the Arena.  Katniss is devastated.  No matter how low a home it may have been, her only home is now gone.interactions with others around her.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|What makes this DVD release so special is the additional features, in particular, the commentary by Stallone.  In it, he speaks of the story line, the camera work, the lighting and the thought that went into each scene.<br />The movie shows us the 'dumb' Rocky, with slower speech and seeming inability to reason well, when, in fact, the character's 'dumb' responses are actually wisdom and patience, as the character sees, for example, an obnoxious and superficial boss at his son's job, yet does not comment on it.  When dealing with brother-in-law, Paulie, Rocky allows him to take his verbal shots, yet remains kind.  In this, the writer attempted to make a Christ-like character in which he lives to benefit others, sacrificing for others.  It's a wonderful, touching movie and restored to us the lovable character from Rocky I and Rocky II.  The additional of Geraldine Hughes (\\"Little Marie\\") was a perfect piece of the puzzle, allowing the audience to see Rocky fall in love, as he still has a future, in spite of his age.  Critics will ridicule as they do, but audiences loved the movie, and will continue to love the DVD, especially the cut out scenes and the alternate ending.  One of my favorite movies!  He pushes all the right buttons.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game all the time and I would recommend it to everyone who loves to play solitaire. I play it all the time.
B0055OG2BC|4.0|I have always loved the original Casino Royale... Peter Sellers is wonderful in this movie, as is everyone else. Image is fairly good for a mid/late 60's production, and Hughes does a wonderful job of directing this epic.
B006OV7RQ4|5.0|'Martha Marcy May Marlene' is a low key tale of fleeing personal demons. It takes a look into a demented cult that entraps its members and makes them one of their own, which we learn is not such a great thing.<br /><br />The tale begins suitably. Martha, as portrayed by the Olsen sister you might not have heard of, is escaping the cult and they are giving chase. This goes on for a while and she does get caught by a cult member, but still breaks free. She calls her sister who then takes her to live with herself and her husband.<br /><br />It might all sound good from this point on, but even though Martha has escaped her physical 'demons' she still cannot overcome those that lie in her mind. The fear she has that stems from the damage she recieved from being a member of a cult that tries to exists through kidnap, ransom, thievery, and any other means necessary.<br /><br />This film will keep you on the edge of your seat as Martha has a series of flashbacks, dreams and is subjected to a downward spiral with no light at the end of the tunnel. You will enter her mind and feel almost like a victim yourself, as the tale unfolds. It didn't keep me up the night that I watched it, but it did make me question if somthing similar might be going on, closer than I think.<br /><br />I was satisfied with its ending, and think most people will be. This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone, as long as they are an adult, as it is rated R and definitely not for the children.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|this game is good for what is provided, the drawbacks are what isnt provided. it only allows for the user and 1 cpu to play. needs support for 4 players and the option to have 2 or more human players. also, different game types...mexican train, etc should also be included. the game works perfectly as is, i just hope the developer plans on making additional features available
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Isn't it wonderful that this production can still be seen in all of its former glory? The story has become widely known for its whimsical, yet serious, mood-setting, storytelling. I find it to be almost Shakespearean in its plot, what with all of the madness and tragedy, you will laugh, cry, at first despise, and finally cheer for the phantom while watching this fabulous performance of the most successful theater production of all time. This story is one that can not be missed. There is a reason that it has grossed over 5 billion dollars in twenty five years, this performance (as seen at the Royal Albert Hall) delivers that reason in the form of an involved and experienced cast. I have always loved this story, and I finally had the chance to share it with my family. It is a classic that is most synonymous with good taste. Followers of theater probably have already picked this up, anyone who likes a good story should do the same. To not pick it up, would be missing out on perhaps the most important contribution to theater in its history.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|when i read i the sample I knew i had to have this book.

B004SEUJK0|5.0|What a fantastic movie.  I have read the book, and was a little worried when I saw Zellwegger was cast as Bridget.  She was truly wonderful.  She captured Bridget perfectly.  Colin Firth was also amazing.  I'm not a huge fan of Grant, but he plays the cad very well.<br />Overall, very well done and honors the book it was adapted from.

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Awesome movie! Big hit with tween boys. Mom doesn't mind watching it either. There are some raw edges, but it's a heartwarming father-son story. The robots are very entertaining. Good soundtrack.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I've never played mahjong before, but this app is easy enough to learn on while being challenging enough to be interesting once you figure it out.  Great app!!
1589975030|5.0|This remains one of the best selling books in the U.S. It is wonderful to have the CD version.  It is a classic for children of all ages.  Perfect for an Easter gift!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is a must have game. It is addictive and entertaining. Sometimes it is frustrating when stuck on a level but there are plenty of walk-through on YouTube. It is important to learn what each of the birds do and to develop a strategy. One you start the game, it is hard to put down.
B005URRCUY|4.0|This cd is the best one I've heard from them yet.  I can listen to it over and over again and it never gets old.  There are 1-2 songs that I give a miss but it's a bargain at the price.<br /><br />A few beats into a song and you can easily recognize it as The Black Keys, they have a certain sound that is very distinct.  If sounding different for every song is your thing, you might want to give them a skip but if you heard a song by The Black keys and liked their style, you'll be a huge fan of this album.  You can hear them sell every song they play; their love of music is infectious with their driving beats.  So far, \\"Lonely Boy,\\" \\"Run Right Back\\" and \\"Gold on the Ceiling\\" are my favorites that I have on heavy rotation.<br /><br />This band from Akron, Ohio hits the sweet note with \\"El Camino\\" which makes it worth every cent.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I've read about Settlers of Catan from many places, including several online blogs I frequent.  Every time I read about it, it is touted as a very good game, with a simple rule set but engaging strategy.  I've eyed it for quite some time, hating to spend $35 on a game I'd never played before.  I finally decided to jump on it, and I'm glad I did.  The game arrived a week ago, and my wife and I, along with our 9 year old daughter, have played almost every day, some days multiple games per day.  The game includes a \\"beginner\\" layout, with the game \\"hexes,\\" dice roll markers, and even player starter positions in specific locations.  This creates a very balanced game where each player has access to similar resources throughout the game.  Playing with this layout makes it a lot easier for beginners to learn the rules and introduce some strategy without a lucky roll of the dice creating a huge gap.  We played this way 3 or 4 times, then we switched to completely randomizing the layout according to the rules for subsequent games.  The game is won by earning 10 \\"victory\\" points.  This can be reached by a combination of building and/or upgrading settlements, building roads, raising armies, and using development cards.  Each activity requires spending a different combination of resource cards.  Players have a chance of receiving resource cards upon each roll of the dice.  Players may trade resource cards with the bank at ratios determined by settlement positions along the ocean, or may negotiate trade among each other.  Numerous strategies may be employed determining where to place settlements, how to spend resources, and whether or not to trade with other players.  Quality of the game itself is great.  The game board consists of 6 \\"border\\" pieces, 20 \\"hex\\" pieces, and 20 \\"tokens.\\" All are made of very thick and durable cardboard, as are several game cards made of the same material.  When the game arrived, all of those pieces were in sheets of perforated cardboard that neededto be punched out.  The perforations were done properly and none of the pieces were torn or damaged during the punch-out process.  Also included is the instructions, a promotional flyer for expansion sets, a deck of resource & development cards, wooden structure and road pieces, and a pair of standard 6 sided dice.  I was surprised to see the wooden game pieces when most every game piece is made of plastic these days.  The only complaint I have quality wise is the cardboard border pieces.  The die cutting was slightly off so when assembled the board has a slight bow to it, making it difficult to fit all of the hexes inside.  Over time it seems to be \\"breaking in\\" and is becoming less and less of an issue.  It could also be fixed with a razor knife to trim a few edges down to make it fit better.  We've also already lost one of the small wooden road pieces, which isn't a quality issue, but it would be a great bonus if a few extra pieces were included.  Overall I am  very pleased with the the quality and playability of the game, and we are enjoying playing it together as a family.  I'm likely going to buy the 5-6 player expansion so we can play with more players when we have friends and family over.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants a fun and challenging game.
B005NA3B8U|5.0|Love this game played it all the time at the Arcade. Takes me back to the good old days.<br />It works good on  Verizon Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Just what I was looking,my Nikon 3000 fit perfectly, it is enought protected and not too big to be uncorfortable. An aditional lens will not enter, but I knew that before I purchase this item.
B000KUD2G4|5.0|The hum destroyer breaks ground loops by using a transformer to disconnect one side from the other. It's also capable of changing an unbalanced output (like on an ipod) to transformer balanced and isolated. It's a very good little box to have, I've bought several because I'm always thinking of ways to balance or unbalance and isolate line level signals, I detest hum. The HD400 provides two independent channels to be used however you want. That means two separate transformers inside, I can't buy one high quality transformer as a component for that price, much less a completely built box with two full channels. I am very impressed with the sound quality of this unit, it's very transparent. Regardless of the price, I'd buy several of these just in case the price goes up, it could easily sell for double and still be worth it.
B004UHSB5A|1.0|It's just too hard to place tiles on the board. They keep snapping back into my pile. Destroys any fun factor. Tiles are also too small. Uninstalling this sucker.

B0025KVLUQ|1.0|I Love rock n roll to the fullest, my favorite bands are Nickelback, Staind, Creed, and Kid Rock. One thing I absolutely hate is when boy bands try to disguise themselves as rock n roll groups.  First of all, Mic Jagger can't sing at all on this album and why does he change his voice up so much!!!  Second, just because a song is named \\"Octopus's Garden\\" doesn't make it good!  lastly, if the Beatles want to have any success they should try to sing about better things like talented groups N Sync and Backstreet Boys.  Mic Jagger and his band the Beatles have no place in Rock n roll and should take their garbage back to Australia!  For good rock n roll stick with:  1. Jonas Brothers  2. Simple Plan  3. My Chemical Romance  4. Fall Out Boy  5. Limp Bizkit  6. Killswitch Engage  7. Blink 182  8. Coheed & Cambria  9. Sum 41  10. Nickelback

1594203334|3.0|I have to admit that I did not immediately want to read this book, since the article version I read online seemed very different from my own views about parenting. But my father bought it and lent it to me, and it turned out to be a very entertaining and easy read. Druckerman does a fabulous job building a narrative out of her experience and weaving together personal anecdotes with strong research. As a work of non-fiction, it is highly enjoyable to read and thought provoking.<br /><br />However, there is no question this book will also be read as a \\"parenting book\\" rather than just a \\"book about parenting.\\" And, it does, at points, venture into \\"parenting book\\" territory, even though Druckerman never uses the imperative tense or claims ultimate authority. But, she does consistently present \\"French parenting\\" in a very positive light, and in every contrast to American examples, French examples come out ahead. I have very little experience with this culture myself, so I certainly can't judge how consistent this parenting style actually is, so I have to take her word for that. It wouldn't surprise me that a centralized European nation would have a more consistent parenting style than the mish mash of approaches here in the states. Given that \\"French parenting\\" is always presented within a very reasonable seeming paradigm of success, there is definitely a feeling of \\"this is a very good way to do things\\" throughout.<br /><br />And, certainly, the ideas that overlap with successful parenting in the U.S. (often called \\"authoritative\\" parenting in the states) seem good. As a vegetable farmer, I especially loved the chapter about food and how to help our kids learn to enjoy a wide range of flavors -- so refreshing that parents aren't coercing kids into eating vegetables for their \\"health\\" and instead expect them to do so out of enjoyment!<br /><br />But some of the cultural notions struck me as more negative than Druckerman allowed in her exploration. A few examples that stood out to me: the 99% (or so) epidural rate, the low breastfeeding rate, and the emphasis on infant/child independence from birth. The lack of natural births in France (or even the opportunity to choose one) is treated as very sensible (meanwhile, to the north in the Netherlands -- also a sensible country -- over a quarter of all births occur without medication at home). Druckerman mulls over the lack of breastfeeding for a few paragraphs but it's a minor exploration of what seems like a very big thing to me.<br /><br />But the idea that even newborn babies need to start being independent from parents struck me as especially ... off? Scary? Potentially damaging? Going against instinct? I tried to keep an open mind when reading these bits, and the reasoning in the book is compelling (babies sleeping through the night at 3 months is always compelling!). But, from my reading elsewhere, most of the current science of infant development points to different conclusions about human newborns.<br /><br />The human newborn/mother connection is strongly supported by biology on many counts. So, the idea that \\"the pause\\" (wherein a mother waits 5 minutes or so before respond to nighttime crying) is a good and scientific-based thing is hard for me to swallow -- I couldn't help thinking of how hard it would be to do as a new mom. When I first became a mother, I felt strong physical and instinctual desire to hold my baby as much as possible and be near him and care for him at night -- I didn't do it because I felt it was \\"good\\" for him; it was truly my #1 desire, and I think that is the result of strong and successful bonding. (Interestingly, there is a world famous French OB, Michel Odent, who worries very much about the role medicated birth plays in French mothers lack of bonding to their babies. He talks at length about the \\"love hormones\\" that are released during an unmedicated birth and how essential they are for creating those necessary human attachments. He wasn't mentioned in the book.)<br /><br />That being said, I do think the French (according to Druckerman) are right in believing that children need to be treated as people from birth and allowed opportunities for autonomy -- but in my experience children begin pushing for that when they are ready. We as parents can then respond appropriately. Overall, I was struck by how much of the book focused on detaching from our children rather than bonding with them in appropriate ways and then letting them push off from us by giving them space. Even though Druckerman tells us so-and-so-mother is a warm, nurturing mother, the examples and emphasis is often on being apart or not interacting in playful ways. I couldn't help wondering when French parents and children PLAY together ... maybe they don't?<br /><br />I would wholly agree that the American style of parenting she describes seems unhealthy in another extreme. Kids obviously need to their own space to develop as people. However, as a mother of a toddler, I rarely see the American extremes she describes -- but I don't live in New York City so maybe parents in my rural community are less anxious and less \\"helicopter\\"-like. We can have dinners with friends and have adult conversations, but we also like a good parent-child racing game at a party (especially since often for the dads this social time is also weekend family time). Because of my own experience, I couldn't help feeling like her \\"American parent\\" was a bit of a \\"strawman\\" in this argument. Since the American parenting seems exaggerated in its anxiousness and lack of control, I have to also wonder ultimately how much of the French examples are exaggerated too (or, at least, are the good examples that stood out once Druckerman started observing the perceived differences).<br /><br />In closing, I would recommend this book if someone wants a good read and is curious about how France parents its children. I can honestly say I will be mulling over some of these ideas ones for a while (especially the ones that push on my own existing understandings of babies and children). It was also good to have some of my own weaknesses as a parent brought to light by contrast -- I have begun trying to \\"educate\\" my two year-old son in how to be patient, and it has already helped both of us get through the day calmer.<br /><br />But, if a reader is interested in some different evidence based views on babies and their need for connection, I recommend [[ASIN:0385483627 Our Babies, Ourselves: How Biology and Culture Shape the Way We Parent]] and/or [[ASIN:193527886X Attached at the Heart: 8 Proven Parenting Principles for Raising Connected and Compassionate Children]]. Also, it's not my favorite book in the world (in part because it's a challenging read), but [[ASIN:0201050714 The Continuum Concept: In Search Of Happiness Lost (Classics in Human Development)]] is a classic example of another very successful parenting culture that has embraced a different set of values (when it comes to infancy at least).<br /><br />ETA: I recently read [[ASIN:0062103296 French Kids Eat Everything: How Our Family Moved to France, Cured Picky Eating, Banned Snacking, and Discovered 10 Simple Rules for Raising Happy, Healthy Eaters]]. I would highly recommend it to folks who are interested in French parenting. It is also a very delightful read and goes into way more detail about how the French think about food and parenting. As a \\"parenting book,\\" I even found it useful and was inspired to make some major and minor changes in my son's eating habits (most notably cutting way back on the non-stop flow of snacks to encourage him to eat more at meals -- it worked!). This book is also a tad more critical of French culture (when appropriate), which was refreshing after reading Bringing Up Bebe.d in the book.)<br /><br />That being said, I do think the French (according to Druckerman) are right in believing that children need to be treated as people from birth and allowed opportunities for autonomy -- but in my experience children begin pushing for that when they are ready.

0307888908|5.0|Let me gush a bit: \\"The Start-Up of You\\" is the best business book I have read in a long time. The premise is relatively simple on the one hand, and given that Mr. Hoffman is the chair of LinkedIn, the thesis is easy enough to guess. While generations of workers had a life-long career in a single company with a progressive path upward inside the company (as in Detroit automakers), the reality is that most of us do not have that option today, and that path is no longer even viable (as in Detroit automakers).  What follows is a guide not for what to <do> to chart a career path, but rather for how to <think> about what you do. For those of us who assumed the \\"old\\" rules, this re-thinking of professional assumptions helps make sense of sensible growth and risk management in the world of \\"new\\" work rules.  Implicit in the suggested strategies is the self-serving idea that you need to be on LinkedIn. The case for that position is presented very, very well, however.  I usually find that business books can be nearly skimmed to capture the essence of their arguments, and I don't have any interest in returning to them again. This is the exception: I actually bookmarked multiple pages, penciled notes in the margins, and will deliberately re-read it again as I think through the ideas suggested. For me, that's the best endorsement I can give!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun, being able to play a bunch of different games. and winning points gets u excited to win as many as you can so you can play more games!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Holy crap! I literally could not put it down. I finished the book in about a day. I bought it in the afternoon and was up untill eleven. I woke up the next day at seven and finished it. You ROCK Suzanne!!!
B0078JOAOI|1.0|After season 1 I expected more!  Sadly its not good unless all your into is constant and neverending melodrama!  Dont waste your $2 spend it on snacks and watch this elsewhere ;) and when you find out how bad it blows proceed to watch movies and buy kindle books that remind you why you love zombies!  Dont be fooled by all the sneak peaks that seem interesting, as soon as you get to the actual show itself all you might get is about 2-3 min of zombies.  Its supposed to be about survival but all they are doing is sitting around on a farm where the cows roam around and dont even get eaten.....so how threatened do you think the people are?  SAVE YOUR DOUGH!
0761169253|5.0|This gorgeous book isn't just for \\"artsy types\\" -- it's for anyone who wants to explore and nurture their creative side and do cool things with their life. The larger frame is a sort of practical memoir: Austin's tips he'd give to his younger self. The advice ranges from tactical (use a calendar!) to the philosophical (leave home!), and it's peppered throughout with quotes from famous creators and Austin's own brilliant, crisp, clever illustrations. When I'm not forcing my copy onto all my friends, I know I'll be diving into this book again and again, looking for a timely prompt, a new perspective, an encouraging nudge into the next project.

B001E45XT4|5.0|I got these headphones and they suck when plugged into my ipod or computer. But when they got good power going to them? They are freaking amazing!! Deep loud bass, clear mids and highs, its crazy how big the difference is. These are more like huge comfy, head mounted speakers then headphones so keep that in mind when you are using an iPod or crappy computer sound cards to power these.
0802473156|5.0|This particular purchase was a gift. I do own this book personally. I have enjoyed reading and learning from it. Dr. Chapman has written this book in such a way that it is easy to read, understand and apply.
B006OT03BM|4.0|The package looks cool enough. Unfortunately the discs are held down with tape. be extremely careful peeling the tape off or it will also peel the letteing off of the discs themselves. something besides tape should probably be used here.
B005LLXB9K|4.0|I love this documentary. Cameron Crowe combines a whole lot of footage and music to create a poignant overview of the band and it's history. The interviews and contrast between members and their younger selves is interesting.<br /><br />Praise for:<br />-Chris Cornell's interview. He brings an excellent perspective to the story.<br />-Mother Love Bone's story, along with Andy Wood's<br />-Stone Gossard admitting how much Kurt Cobain's criticism had on the band.<br />-The clever transitions to certain elements of the story.<br />-Great backstage/live stuff.<br />-Even the credits were fun to watch.<br />-Temple of the Dog<br /><br />But wanted more history/info on:<br />-Other bands from the past (Bad Radio?!)<br />-Side projects of the guys (eddie's solo work, Brad, Mad Season)<br />-What about relationships with other bands from the Seattle area? (Alice n Chains, Mudhoney)<br />-How's about some info on Boom Gaspar?<br />-And how's about the influence PJ has had on so many other bands? Would love to know what the guys think of bands covering their songs...<br /><br />So overall I LOVED this movie, but as a die-hard fan I guess my only gripe is that I wanted even MORE!<br />I can understand though, timing and how to make so much info from 20+ years flow together. Such a great documentary. And I find it funny how I so want this documentary to get an Oscar, but know that the band wouldn't care! Despite my wanting for more info, I felt like this documentary was a thoughtful love letter to PJ's fans.
B006AX6ONI|1.0|Mark Cuban made his money by selling his small company broadcast.com to Yahoo. Broadcast.com never made a dime. At the time Cuban sold the business, the company only had 22 million dollars in revenue but a whopping 18 million dollar loss. Yahoo after spending millions on broadcast.com decided to shut it down only after a few years because it kept losing money. At the time of the purchase broadcast.com only accounted for a mere 2% of Yahoo's total revenue. Yahoo brass must of felt like fools to have paid so much for so little.<br /><br />Cuban's other companies don't make money either. The Dallas Mavericks have lost millions of dollars every year, even last year when they won the championship. HDNET, Cuban's cable channel, loses money, the films that Cuban produces also lose money and after buying Landmark Theaters several years ago, which also lost money, he now wants to sell. LOL The internet sites he invests in like Sharesleuth.com have all been failures. What is even more troubling is that he is currently under investigation for insider trading by the SEC, which sets a bad example.<br /><br />There is not one example of Cuban making money in any of his businesses, so I have to ask what good advice could he possibly give readers? He often talks about his business skills but for all of business skills he does not make money and isn't making money what good businesspeople do?<br /><br />As far as the book is concerned, the writing is poor. Cuban is not a writer and it shows. Most of the material here has already been written about in magazines and newspapers. There is really nothing new.
030788743X|3.0|i reserve 5 stars for absolute brilliance.  this book is good, not brilliant.<br /><br />4 stars is my usual \\"good\\" rating, but i painfully had to give this book 3 stars.  let me explain why.<br /><br />i understand this book is a geek-fest.  i get it, and i loved it.  even though ive never played an mmo in my life i know what they are and i do play video games.  i did grow up in the 80s with a lot of these classic arcade games.  i appreciate what was done in this book completely and fully.<br /><br />HOWEVER, some parts of this book go from exciting adventure to slap-dab in the middle of emofest with the main character.  i wound up not liking Wade several times because he was such a wuss when it came to the love story.  i understand the character that was developed, the geeky nerd that wasnt good with girls and i get that, but the love story part was just too sappy for my likings.<br /><br />also several times in the book it went from \\"cool\\" geeky to downright annoying.  it was like the ubergeekness of the book was trying to make the point that it was there and by god you must realize it.  sometimes being subtle is more effective than beating you over the head with the club of your point.<br /><br />lastly i almost put the book down at the dance club scene.  i wont write any spoilers but once you read it you will know what im talking about.  some of the dialogue is pure cheese and what happens i just couldnt help but laugh.<br /><br />BUT, thats only roughly 15% of the book.  the other 85% was really great.  the battles, the illusions to 80s pop culture, how it is tied into current and even future gen tech... i loved it all.<br /><br />i do suggest this book, but get ready to be told in no unequivocal terms and be told constantly that the book you are reading is a geek-fest.
0385339100|4.0|This book is a great read even if a tad unrealistic. However, entertaining fiction needs to be larger than life itself, right? As to the ending, while it was unsatisfactory from the protagonist's point of view, Grisham should \\"finish\\" the story with a sequel.
B004AKCME8|4.0|My daughter and I really enjoyed this movie. I, myself was thoroughly stunned by the visuals of the owls, especially in the feathers. The story is good, the visuals are amazing and overall this is a great movie.
B002BWP49C|3.0|This is a great franchise and has enthusiasm of youthful cast and author. If you have not read the books, you are missing extremely well written books.  Have read these books at least 7 times and am about to go back to the fourth book and read it again. The script seems to deviate often from the book and the deviations were not an improvement to the storyline.  The actors did their part, the camera people did an excellent job, direction was good and all of the special effects were excellent. Was surprised to see how much the actors had matured and notable changes in physical appearance.  Since this was produced by Ms. Meyers, am surprised the script was so disjointed and produced poor results portraying an excellent book.  We will get all of the movies because we like the books so much and appreciate Ms. Meyers work authoring this excellent series.
B001NXBRJG|4.0|I loved this movie when it came out so I decided to get the Blu-Ray, well its more enjoyable in HD for sure.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|I really really enjoyed this movie. Great fighting, cool robots and the kid actor did a great job. But a little more depth would've been nice. So there goes one star.
B006PZBRCY|4.0|Great movie, entertaining and thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie.<br /><br />I understand people may be like \\"rock em sock em robots\\" but its a good movie. Watch it!
B005KELR3A|4.0|The Belkin Grip Sleeve for Kindle is a nice, no-frills neoprene sleeve for your Kindle device.  Despite what the Belkin chart on the Amazon product page says, this will *NOT* work for a Kindle Fire.  The title description (for Kindle and Kindle Touch) is accurate.<br /><br />The square design on the sides of the sleeve, though unattractive in my opinion, serves a functional purpose--grip.  It's a nice grippy texture that is easy to hold when carrying the sleeve in your hands.  Also, the metal zippers are coated in a rubberized material that feel good and are easy to operate.<br /><br />The sleeve is great for a Kindle or Kindle Touch, but I think it could use a slight price drop.  It's priced at near or above laptop sleeves and well, I just don't feel like it should be.
B006QKJQ12|4.0|I didn't care for the first KungFu Panda, so when my daughter wanted to rent this, I was skeptical. Just a quarter way through and it was already better than the entire first movie.<br /><br />The story is much better, the execution, screen play and everything about it was better than the 1st. I highly recommend this movie.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing.  I could not put it down.  The whole concept of the book seemed very strange to me before reading (children killing other children for the amusement of other people).  I was hesitant at first, but after all the great reviews I decided to give it a shot.  I couldn't put it down and was sad when it ended because it didn't really end.  I went straight for the second book!
B00271HAK8|5.0|What else is there to say besides Classic!!!!???<br /><br />It's even better in HD, I love this movie and enjoy watching it every now and then.
B005C7SXMS|5.0|I have to admit that seeing that this was produced by Ben Stiller (and a few others)is what attracted me to this little-known movie.  This movie didn't disappoint, and I sensed a bit of Stillerisms throughout this movie in both the actor playing Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts) and in the cinematography, in which scenes are flashed acrossed the screen using lighting techniques and Jacques Brel songs, a famous Belgian singer popular in mid-20th century France.<br /><br />This is a unique coming-of-age movie.  All the main characters are weird (something I find Ben Stiller is famous for portraying as well).  Craig is an outsider 15-year-old determined to find a girlfriend.  He's scared enough he won't succeed in ever having one, let alone of having intimate relations with one, though.  He has a mean touch to his action, too.  His parents are weird in their own way, trying to survive or revive their own staled marriage, which is further threatened by their neighbor who is an old flame of the mother.  The parents are so consumed by their own woes that they don't see the anguish of their own son, and when son talks to mother about his attempts at finding a girlfriend, mom is only relieved her weird son isn't gay.  Is this a typical response of a parent toward their sexually-awakening son?!<br /><br />The acting is stellar on all the actors' parts.  The writing is crisp and the cinematography is just as beautiful.  The sountrack is also nice in its own right, being so unusual for a British-made film.  If you aren't a fan of 1960s French music, it may hurt your ears, but it fits in well with Craig's love for French romance singers.<br /><br />The movie is about love and friendship, doubt and self-doubt, but also about forgiveness and redemption.  There are some sweet and tender moments in this movie, and I found the end a bit of a surprise...or not.<br /><br />This is definitely worth watching, for both Ben Stiller fans and fans of independent/British films.
B003PIUC02|4.0|The slow motion sequences of blood spattering all over the place get old quickly but once you get passed that, the story is compelling and the acting is second to none. The costuming and set are beautifully done and all in all it is well worth the money.I woiuld rate this a four star movie.

B0063IH60K|2.0|Decent game, but annoying, frequent ads interrupt play between games. If there were an ad-free pay version it might be worth it.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful app to have. I use it every day for my  Bible reading and devotional reading.  It is easy to use, keeps me up to date, and it keeps me motivated. If I'm not going to be connected to the internet, I just keep up with my Bible reading by writing down the upcoming reading plan on paper and check off the chapters as I read them.  How archaic - but it works! I highly recommend it!!!
B002DKGWSO|5.0|This is alot better than the original last house on the left because it has a more serious and way more scarier tone then what the original did and the music in this version is alot better also and so is the acting Tony Goldwyn and Monica potter did an awesome job playing as the parents of mari and killng the bad guys in a very bloody gory fashion was alot better than the original and the 2 main characters live mari and justin which worked alot better than the 1972 version ever did the bad guys in this are krug francise and sadie francise get's it the worst but the other 2 death scenes are awesome and the rape scene was not as distrubing as it was in the original this version pawns the 1972 version.
B001JV5BIA|1.0|I really hate this version Of The Last House On The Left it was very stupid and very lame and very retarded I recommnd the 2009 remake which is alot better than this version is I hate the story in this movie the acting is lame and the rape scene is very distrubing and I hate the rape scenes in this movie and I donot like that the 2 main characters die which was retarded and a dumb move this 1972 original version is crap compared to the 2009 version which is alot better wes craven what were you thinking with this aweful piece of garbage.

0743299795|5.0|I read this book in 2011 and even though most of it is 20 years old, it's still amazingly up to date. Even though the Japanese car makers have stumbled, the book is spot on.

B0018LMZOO|5.0|I haved alwaays liked the early music of the Moody Blues.  For me it represents a unique time during my youth.  There were so many social and political changes going on at that time and the music reflects those changes.  It was a great time.

1444710338|3.0|the product content was fine, I expected a better version such as I had seen at stores in a paperback copy.  It did not help that the product was late in arriving and only after I inquired, did I receive a response.  The book is smaller than the regular paperback product, it's like a knock off of the original, cheaper paper, cheaper cover.  I do not think I would knowingly buy from this supplier again.  However, all of the content was there.
159514188X|5.0|Review originally posted on Hands and Home Blog Feb 24, 2012 <...>    This book was, and still is, incredible. I'm not exactly sure how to go about reviewing a book like this. Should I talk about the unique format, the incredible and compelling narrative, the intense emotion or the ultimate message that Jay Asher is giving?    The message...  I think that I will start with the message because I have read a lot of reviews criticizing this book and the reasons why Hannah chose to commit suicide and I think they are missing the point. And that point is far too important to ignore. Asher says it himself at the end of the novel in the interview questions:    \\"...even though Hannah admits that the decision to take her life was entirely her own, it's also important to be aware of how we treat others. Even though someone appears to shrug off a sideways comment or to not be affected by a rumor, it's impossible to know everything going on in that person's life, and how we might be adding to his/her pain. People do have an impact on the lives of others...\\"    This book wasn't about the individual reasons or events leading up to Hannah's suicide as much as it was about how your actions, or lack thereof, have the power to affect someone's life is ways that you cannot even imagine. The unfortunate reality is that suicide is a desperate decision made at a time when a person feels that there is so little hope, and so little to live for that they cannot imagine any other way out. Suicide is the action of someone who is hurting. It doesn't matter why they are hurting of it the same situation wouldn't hurt you, the fact is they are hurting. Who are we to judge their reasons and determine which events are worthy of harming yourself which ones aren't. That kind of thinking just doesn't make sense to me.    On to book itself...  Thirteen Reasons Why was A-MAZING. I could literally stop my review right here because that is all you need to know! But there are so many reasons why I loved this book I guess I will share some of them! ;)    The narrative: Asher was able to seamlessly transition between two view points throughout the entire novel and I have never seen it done quite like this before. The entire novel took place over a period of 24 hours and focused on the evening that Clay Jensen spent walking around town listening to the tapes that Hannah Baker left for him (and 12 others) explaining why she decided to take her own life.  The author used the symbols for \\"play\\", \\"pause\\", and \\"stop\\" to help distinguish between Hannah's narrative on the tape and Clay's narrative in the present. Clay's thoughts were interspersed throughout Hannah's so readers were given Clay's reactions to what he was hearing at the same time he would have though them, as opposed to waiting until the end of the tape to read what he thought. Ordinarily I would think that this would get confusing, but it not only worked but it completely made the story for me. The pace of this novel was extremely fast and I stayed up until well into the morning over two nights finishing this book. I couldn't get the characters or the story out of my head and had to read more.    Asher didn't have to try to evoke emotion it just poured out naturally as the story progressed. From Hannah's initial confrontational tone to her gradual apathy and despair and Clay's shock, fear and intense sadness, it was all there.    It is hard for me to decide exactly how I feel about Hannah's character. On the one hand the very idea of the tapes didn't sit very well with me. It felt extremely vindictive and her threat to each of the 13 listeners didn't do much to foster a sense of compassion or sympathy within me at first. But then I started reading, really reading through the novel and I couldn't help my heart breaking for this girl a little more with each tape. Her loneliness and despair transcended the pages and by the end of the novel I was a mess.    \\"I started rocking back and forth, back and forth. And onceagain, no one was around to hear me cry.\\"    The emotional journey this book takes you on is certainly not limited to Hannah's character. As much as I ached for Hannah I couldn't even begin to put myself in Clay's shoes. He admired Hannah and wanted to be a part of her life, and the closest that he got to her was through a series of tapes detailing the reasons why she choose to end her life. He would have come out of that evening with so many scars, as would anyone who listened to the tapes. As much as Thirteen Reasons Why is a look into the heart and mind of a girl who was desperately looking for a way out of her life, it is also a study of the emotional turmoil those affected by suicide go through as well. Suicide does not end in death, not for the friends, family or community of the person who has taken their life. We could argue for days whether the people who were given the tapes \\"deserved\\" to be on them, or \\"deserved\\" to be forced to listen to them but the only fact that matters is that they did listen, and it will affect them.    This is one of those books that I wish I could have read when I was a teenager. There is so much more that I could say about this piece of fiction but it unfortunately would not do it justice. It ultimately comes down to the fact that Thirteen Reasons Why is a haunting and unforgettable novel that I highly recommend.    I received a review copy of Thirteen Reasons Why from Penguin Canada (thank you!!!) in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.
B000AJIAOO|5.0|People who are much better at being music critics than I have already summed it up nicely, but I have to say, this group is just incredible. The vocals are unmatched and the songs run the gamut of emotions. I listen to WT quite a bit while I'm writing, and \\"Aquarius\\" has become a sort of unofficial theme song for the book I'm currently working on. The music really does a good job of stirring up emotions, and I think even if you aren't a hardcore metal fan, you'll enjoy this album.

B005Z271Y6|4.0|The ladies sat and chatted while the guys played pool. The quality of the DVD and performance was such that we all kept turning our heads to watch when Adele would belt out one of her top hits.
B0078N2MTE|4.0|I think this is the first review I've ever done on here and I'm only doing it because I almost didn't watch this movie due to the other reviews comments about the ending and how slow the movie was. Based on the other reviews I believed the ending may be disappointing, but the trailer looked really good so I wanted to see it and form my own opinion; I'm glad I did! I don't understand why people keep making it out like the ending of this movie is somehow ambiguous as to whether Curtis is crazy or his visions are omens....*SPOILER ALERT*....he's NOT crazy; I don't see why anyone would have interpreted it any other way.  To me it was very clear in the end.  I can see how some people would feel that it moved too slowly, but I was interested in the story the whole way through. The actors were great and the storyline was interesting.  All in all, I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.

B0068MNO4S|3.0|What we have here, in this movie, is a dramatization of an argument.  This has produced many entertaining and well-reasoned reviews and posts, seemingly because the movie itself is a diatribe, and arguments beget arguments.<br /><br />Still, when you look at a movie, you have to ask whether it succeeds at more than merely being provocative.  In this case, I would say no, not really.  'Anonymous' is off-putting.  Just out of the gates, in the beginning segment, the beguiling Mr. DeVere announces that \\"all art is political...\\"  Well, that is a very postmodern statement from an Elizabethan personage, parroting the common modern 'wisdom' that history is but an agreed-upon set of lies.<br /><br />It also seems a bit disingenuous to present a 'hot' controversy that in fact has been debated for centuries.  And this movie nearly succeeds in creating a reductio ad absurdum.  Marlowe, Jonson and other playwrights of the period are depicted as semi-competent and glib, sort of like a fraternity of precocious underclassmen.  And then the dubious 'true author' is presented as a shadowy, Phantom-of-the-Opera figure--an isolated, bitter genius, who is quite professorial in his outlook, and sports a desk and study bedecked with cliches.<br /><br />This also feeds into a current love of conspiracy theories in the movie-going public, which has been treated to \\"Amadeus\\", and \\"The DaVinci Code\\".  Are these speculations really brave, or are they manipulative?  They certainly are moneymaking.<br /><br />In the end, the argument seems to hinge on whether a lowly actor could indeed possess the imagination and knowledge to have produced these masterpieces.  Actors are cattle, right?  But doesn't an actor succeed on innate understanding of human nature?  That is a question this movie doesn't answer, because Shakespeare had perhaps the best understanding of human nature ever known to mankind.  One would think he would also have been a terrifically social individual, and not really a reclusiveman who hid in darkness.<br /><br />It reminds me of one of my favorite song lyrics.  \\"All in all, it's all the same--but, call me if there's any change\\" , from a baroque-rock upstart named Keith Reid.  It doesn't matter.  It will never be resolved.  Maybe Shakespeare could have been--an alien?  We'll just never know, will we?

B005LAIGN2|5.0|\\"Red Tails\\" is a heartwarming movie about the Tuskegee Airman.  There is also a touching love story thrown in for good measure.  All the actors gave strong performances in forming an entertaining and dramatic portrayal of the Tuskegee Airman.  However, my two favorite character depictions in \\"Red Tails\\" involved the acting of Terrence Howard as Col. A.J Bullard and Ne-Yo as \\"Smoky.\\"  Terrence Howard cleverly plays a military leader who is tested with making careful decisions under strict circumstances.  Ne-Yo creates a happy persona of someone who cautiously juggles the demands of war with having an optimistic spirit. \\"Red Tails\\" is an enjoyable movie for the many who like films inspired by true stories.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I would have really enjoyed this app for my Kindle Fire if it provided data that was more current.

0393339882|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read on the history of quantum mechanics. Manjit Kumar explained quantum mechanics in an understandable way. But this is not the strength of the book. Kumar explored the personalities of the physicists and their relevant personal histories. He also explained Einstein's problems with quantum mechanics and I was surprised by what I read. The writing style was simple which is a good thing since the subject matter is so complex. But this is a book foremost about personalities and I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in the history of physics.

Big goofy looking eyes, playing it casual, no commitment, etc.
0439023491|5.0|Boy, Suzanne really delivered it with Catching Fire. I read this book in less than a day. Talk about addicitive, there was no way that I could stop reading... I mean, the last sentence to every chapter left me craving for more. I felt like a word junkie. Haha. Great cover? Check. Great binding? Check. Cliff hangers? Check. Romance? Check. Violence? Check! I believe this book may have had the best cliff hanger of all time, I'm literally fighting a growing knot in my chest for the next novel. (I need my FIX. I need book 3!!) I read the last page 3 times. I should have written my review after I cooled down a little ;o)<br /><br />This book was intense. Just like in the previous novel, my favorite aspect was the Games. There is compassion, hatred, fast paced action, betrayal... Everything you could possibly want from the Games. Just like in the first installment, you're in for a wild ride with Katniss Everdeen.<br /><br />I think I still favor The Hunger Games over Catching Fire, but I was not disappointed. I loved this book and I think there was a slight bit more humor- I liked that. Suzanne Collins hit another grand slam.<br /><br />Catching Fire is divided into three parts: The Spark, The Quell and The Enemy. The story picked up right where the previous book left off- Katniss and Peeta's Victors Tour to each district. Peeta is emotionally wounded because Kat confessed she only \\"loved\\" him for the games. It just seems as if all the most important relationships in Katniss's life are strained in one way or another. Enter President Snow. He visits to ensure Katniss convinces all the districts of her love affair with Peeta, which he knows is a fraud. He has been watching her and has put a threat on the lives of all those she cares for. If the districts believe Katniss is defying the government, it could be the spark they need to begin uprisings every where and President Snow must put a stop to this.<br /><br />Katniss is our reluctant hero. She is the new face of rebellion. And with that, the Capitol decides to take her and the mockingjay out with a very special type of Hunger Games.<br /><br />I only have a couple complaints about this book, and they really don't matter because this book is one the best I've read in 2009. I wish the Games was longer and I wish we would have seen more Gale. However, he works in the mines now so he isn't around quite as much. Boo. I do love Peeta though, it was great that he was always around.<br /><br />If you haven't read the first installment of this series- READ IT. Then read this one. I think these books could make awesome movies. Just think of seeing the tribute costumes on the big screen! I know most avid readers don't like their favorite books made into movies, but I don't care- this series would be brilliant on a big screen.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the complexity, secrets, cliff hangers and all the plot twists and turns as much as I did =)n.
