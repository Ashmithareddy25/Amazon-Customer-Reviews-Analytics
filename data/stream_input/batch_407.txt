B00005Q45W|1.0|After waiting all these years, Leonard finally came down from the mountain to deliver this mouse. Most of the song lyrics are just &quot;Westernized&quot; Zen cliches. You want to know the sound of one hand clapping---listen to this CD and you'll find out. Boring!!!!   <br />The only song that shows his wry sense of humor is &quot;That Don't Make It Junk.&quot;  <br />Also, Leonard, spring for a real studio next time with real musicians.  Trading hard-drives with Sharon (Oh, Sharon, beautiful Sharon...What Happened???!!!) just didn't pan out. <br />And please, Leonard, next time pick up the tempo.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|What a terrific soundtrack. Stephen Schwartz is truly a genius with this score... it is absolutely amazing!
B0001HAISG|5.0|I don't rate too many films five stars. I'd probably give it something like 4 1/2 if I could. The reason for the severity of this rating is simple: I LOVE THIS FILM! It captures the wonder and adventure of the best childhood daydreams but it also does something more. To be Peter Pan might be fun for a day, even a year, but for all of eternity? The fact that the film dares to explore this suggests that something is a little twisted about this Peter. Rachel Hurd-Wood, in a stunning debut, gives Wendy a complexity seldom seen from child actors. This Wendy is clearly attracted to Peter, and he seems to feel the same way, but their love is forever marred by his staunch refusal to grow up. Pretty heady stuff for a children's film and it's simply amazing how well this film keeps it all together. Jeremy Sumpter is terrific as Peter, although his performance has some awkward moments, mainly because he's the only American cast member. While the other kids deliver their lines with the spot on quality of classically trained actors, Sumpter's accent tends to make him sound like he's mumbling when he delivers some of his more poetic dialogue. What keeps his performance good is his amazing physical presence and his naturally, likeable cockiness. This Peter has the happy-go-lucky wit of an Indiana Jones combined with a sort of stunted quality that makes him a little like Edward Scissorhands. Jason Issaacs, in a dual role as Captain Hook and John Darling (Wendy's father), steals virtually every scene he's in. Whereas other Hooks have been sort of comedically bumbling villains, this Hook is a true bad guy. This is the first time we've seen a version of this story where Peter actually seems like he has a match in Hook. Combine all this with amazing visuals and a number of entertaining set pieces and you have a film that literally touches every joy a movie can. If I ever have kids, this will be the first PG film I ever let them see.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Leaving aside that this non-interactive video game must be one of the most dehumanizing things we have ever seen in the mainstream cinema, consider this: in earliest days of the motion picture, nobody had learned to care about story or character. They just wanted to see the pictures move. And that's exactly what we get here: no story or character, just moving pictures. We end where we began. But in a sorrier condition.
6302212529|5.0|This Disney Classic, made in 1989 is the tale of a young mermaid, Ariel, who is at the point in her life where she is ready to become and independent woman. Her fantasy of being part of the human race explodes when she swims to the top of the sea, and sees Prince Eric, who will eventually become the love of her life. After saving Price Eric from drowning, she can not get him off of her mind. She decides that it is time for her to gain some independence, so she goes to Ursula, a sea witch. In exchange for her beautiful voice, Ariel is given the opportunity to become a human, and risk everything for Price Eric. This movie is meant for young girls, yet uses a lot of imagery in order to speak about societal issues. Women in this movie are viewed primarily as dependent upon men, until they take their own initiative. Ariel is dependent on her father for her whole life, and only tries to gain independence when she has the chance to be with the man of her dreams. In order for Ariel to win his heart, she must give something of great importance away. This in itself may give young children the message that in order for a woman to win a man's heart, she must do it without using her voice, that her looks would simply be enough. Ariel in a sense will be judged by Prince Eric, simply based on her body, exemplifying the notion that women are only viewed by men, having nothing to do with their \\"voice\\" or personality. Although this view of the woman is negative, in the end of the film women are looked at in a much more positive light. The idea that a man can get passed looks, and love a woman for her \\"voice\\" comes out at the end of the film when Eric chooses Ariel, the woman with the beautiful voice for who she really is. This makes the stereotype of an \\"Independent woman\\" seem possible to young girls; Ariel was able to persevere through problems that would come her way, and would use all her effort, including her \\"voice\\" to win a man's heart. This movie has many messages for young girls, although not positive all throughout, in the end children are given a positive view of what it means to be an independent woman who is able to accomplish her goals.
B0001HAISG|1.0|I can't believe they force you to watch The Cat &amp; The Hat  trailer bfore the movie starts horribly irritating. The movie was not enjoyable at all I felt like I was watching HOOK all over again. Hook was an excellent movie because,of Robin Williams, Julia Roberts. I really came close to turning Peter Pan off. Besides the awesome talent by Jason Isaacs the acting was horrible. You could even tell when the blue screen was up &amp; rolling. I did not care for the awful special effects either. Don't Purchase this movie!!! If you have to see it RENT IT!
6305428425|4.0|In this film, both Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino play a set of best friends whom decide to go to their 10 year high school reunion. Although this film is meant to be a comedy, it can also be viewed as a parody for many of today's societal notions of what it means to be successful, as well as what it means to be a woman. <BR> As Romy (Sorvino) and Michele (Kudrow) examine what they have done with themselves for the past 10 years, they realize that in effect, they have done nothing. They decide that in order to go to the reunion, they must remake themselves so that they can impress their old classmates. They get new outfits, and manage to get themselves a jaguar to drive to the reunion. Their efforts make it seem that in society today; in order to be successful one must drive a nice car, and be wearing a typical business suit. They try to exemplify the stereotypical \\"successful woman\\", and go so far as to lie about their professions. At first, to Romy and Michele success is defined as having money and looking good. As the film goes on however, these women learn that this image of success is simply false. The women they were trying to impress, although successful, were not happy. Romy and Michele realized that even though they might not be successful under society's rules, they have found their own success because they are happy with each other, and what they have become as women. <BR> This film also stereotypes women as being ditzy, viewed by men as sexualized objects. In order to get her jaguar, Michele must fake having sexual intercourse with a mechanic. Throughout the movie both characters wear outfits that show a lot of skin, making them seem more attractive to men. They are extremely ditzy, and are portrayed as being subordinate to men because of their lack of intelligence. In the end, both women participate in a dance with a smart, rich man, who embraces them because of their personality, and looks. Although this film is meant to be a comedy, it does bring up many important societal issues, and is definitely recommended to people of all ages.
B00006879E|5.0|(...)Each song is unique, catchy, clever and did I mention GENIUS! The song writing is awesome and the music that goes along with the lyrics is great too and actually makes you feel emotion. Maroon 5 may not be the only band to combine rock and R&B but have by far done the greatest job of it. I like linkin park but blending the two song styles together goes by much more smoothly on Songs About Jane than on either of the linkin park albums. I never skip a song because each and every one of the tracks I love. With all the songs on the radio right now talking about getting drunk and high, and not to mention untalented so-called artists like hilary duff, britney spears and countless others trying pathetically to create some sort of good music, it is about time an original and unbelievably talented band like Maroon 5 give us REAL music to listen to and I thank them for that. This is without a doubt THE GREATEST rock album ever and Maroon 5 is of course THE GREATEST rock band ever to exist on planet earth and I cant wait to hear more from them. I love Maroon 5!(...)
B00008YJH5|5.0|Arguably &quot;Doolitlle&quot; contains their best songs but &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; is definitely their most driving,trailblazing and fierce album.<br />And when you're talking about the Pixies that's something really good.<br />&quot;Come on Pilgrim&quot; had already shown traces of their future songwriting but the thrashing guitars had yet to be fused with their trademark rompant melodies(Steve Albini unarguably made them progress in the right direction).<br />The beginning is downright scorching and we're given no respite until Kim Deal's &quot;Gigantic&quot;.The extremely abrasive &quot;Something Against You&quot; has my favorite riff ever(cuasi metallic,cuasi flamenco)and the choruses to the first two tracks are the Pixies at their very best.<br />It would be tiresome to describe all the details that make this album superb and that send it soaring above any possible contender,still the utterly perfect ballad &quot;Where is my Mind?&quot;(best ballad ever made?)and the melodic&quot;River Euphrates&quot;deserve reference.<br />Besides,Black Francis' lyrics are incredibly inventive and whatever the subject he tackles is you can almost always recognise his demented sense of humour peering through even the most violent wordplay as he even manages to mix some spanish words in his lyrical hodgepodge(&quot;Vamos a jugar a la playa&quot;<br />-from &quot;Vamos&quot;).<br />&quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; is,like many have already said,the best punk album made after 1977 and an exciting and quite addictive rush of adrenaline matched by few other recordings.
1592400876|5.0|I have hugely enjoyed this little book! My own \\"inner stickler\\" (a beautifully apt Truss characterization), groans at all sorts of ubiquitous language abuses and misuses - from menu entries such as \\"Liver with smothered onions\\" (do onions taste better when they die slow?), to radio announcements of sales on \\"gem joolery\\" (surely they meant \\"jewelry\\"?), and headlines on \\"capitol punishment\\" (Washington, DC, I hope!). <br />Punctuation is merely one small peninsula on the coastline of the veritable continent of modern linguistic abuse! I've spent years suppressing outbursts as I scan signs, billboards, headlines, and, yes, book reviews. (Note: All the reviews but the briefest on this page - and, hopefully, my own! - contain egregious misspellings!) Truss' book refreshingly out-stickled me; it's good to know there are other language sticklers out there.<br />But Truss is wonderfully humorous and down to earth in her presentation, avoiding, or at least leavening, pomposity and pedantry with deft wit and wonderful anecdotes.  <br />A real treat!
0385510438|5.0|Frankly, the dust doesn't seem to be settling over this latest Grisham novel.  Has any author, anywhere, anytime, ever created such furor when he changed styles?  Surely this is an indication of his talent and popularity.  But even so, you'd think that with that many fans, more of them would cut him some slack when it comes to changes in styles and/or subject matter.  And THE LAST JUROR isn't that far off Mr. Grisham's regular path!  It IS courtroom friendly, and DOES have elements of A PAINTED HOUSE and a few of his other works.  So why the big upset?  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes good writing.  Forget it's by Grisham--it's just a good read no matter who wrote it.  <br />If you enjoy good writing, like McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD or other Grisham books such as A PAINTED HOUSE or KING OF TORTS, you'll like this book.  All I can say is, give this one a chance.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This movie was so cute! It was the quintessential romantic comedy. After viewing it, I was surprised that it was PG-13 and won't my 13 year old daughter see it until she is much older. But all in all, it was a fun movie to watch and fairly clean (language wise).
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Im giving this movie 3 stars because the action scenes are beautifully done and are pretty over the top. Kudos on that.<br />However, the other scenes just drag on and on. The scene with the architect, Morpheus speech, and Zion love scene are especially horrendous.<br />And for all the people who think thats theres this extra hidden deep profound philosophical mumbo jumbo, get real. These movies are not worth the time or mental energy to even try to find a deeper meaning. A pure action popcorn movie and thats it.<br />And the confusing storylines probably have to do with the Wachowski brothers starting the movies as males and at the end of the trilogy one is now a female.
0613279816|3.0|an early written story by a future great storyteller!Ok, so it's not Triple of Jackdaws, but it's worth reading nonetheless.Pick up a copy and look for glimpses of brilliance, that's the way I approached it! I found a few, but not many...see for yourself, you might be surprised!
B0000024K1|2.0|I wanted to like this album, but after the hearing Flava Flav shout &quot;yeah boyee!&quot; for the 100th time I lost my enthusiasm.  Chuck D has an awesome voice and puts it down with authority, at least when Flava Flav isn't talking in between his raps.  Terminator X, the DJ, creates some pretty funky beats but gets scratch happy and reverbs the voices too much.  Example: track 9 is an ear irritant and headache inducer.  The saxophone overlay is a redeeming quality but they go nowhere with the song.  You want good old school rap?  Check out the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, even Ice T and Naughty By Nature.  Leave this overrated album though.  It's a little too high strung for my tastes, but hey, I'm white so what do I know?  If you do end up buying it, skip track 1 because its filler like the beginning of all great rap cds, track 13 because it's a boring instrumental rap beat that just repeats, and track 16 because it will cause you smash your boombox into 1000 pieces.  Heck, I'll give you my copy for free.  Oh wait, forget I said that, I can't waste valuable coasters.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|The heaviest album I have heard from these guys to date, it also shows how immortal Dream Theater is when it comes to writing fantastic music.  I must say that my favorite songs are &quot;As I Am&quot; &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot; and &quot;Stream of Consciousness&quot;.  All the other tracks are amazing as well, I will add.  Portnoy is definitely at the top of his game, blazing on his &quot;Siamese Monster&quot; drumkit.  Rudess is flying, Petrucci never ceases to amaze me, James is screeching (in a good way, because at times, he also takes it down and goes all possessed on us.) Then there's Mr. Myung, playing in the background, jammin' with his mates.  A solid effort by Dream Theater, it almost never leaves my CD Player (and it's only a 3 CD changer, so that says something!)
B00008NG5V|5.0|This cd is un-real. i didnt think it would live up to brushfire fairytales but it does and much more. i can listen to this cd straight through and i love every song.  one of the best cd's ever. no joke.  so relaxing and chilled u'll wanna just sit back and enjoy.
6302038324|5.0|Not a gore fest movie.  It is supensefull and thoughtfull.  It's a wild drug trip with the characters all strung out on laudanum.  Surreal imagery mixed with drugged out viewing from the character's perspective.
B000003TAL|2.0|Perhaps no band represents the gap between poseurs of the alt-80's/90's and those who just like good music than Sonic Youth. The band takes a 25% kernal of passable melody and written piece;  adds distortion and instrumental effects as filler for the other 75%, calls it an album and releases it. The poseur crowd and a few critics love it.<br />The rest of us are out a $15 cd purchase.<br />Be forewarned; they don't get better than this distortive semi-musical cd, it's actually the height of their creative output. Save your money and buy any Pixies or Pavement cd instead. Most of us work far too hard for our money to let it go to waste.
B000002NIW|4.0|I think this is definitely one of the best Deftones album , and indeed one of the most original rock albums of the last decade. The combination of Chino's vocals and heavily distorted guitar at times seem to reach sublime levels. That said, I had recently purchased this album  (for the second time, I lost the first that I had bought on cassette) and found myself tiring of it after listening to it about 2-3 times. What does this mean? Not really anything necessarily,just that the Deftones and specifically Around the Fur , needs to be taken in doses.
0805047905|5.0|My son has loved this book and Polar Bear, Polar Bear since he was 1 1/2 and he is now 3. He learned his colors and animals as well as enjoyed the rythmatic way the book reads.  He reads this book to me all the time from memory and it is a book we treasure in our house.  My nephew has it now too and at 2 1/2 reads it to his mommy too!<br />Get this book!  Take it out from the library and see your child's reaction if you don't believe me. By the time the book is due back, you will be headed to the book store to buy it!
B000005RU2|5.0|Arguably one of the best live documents from one of the best hard rock bands ever. It has never sounded better having finally been remastered.  Sure some of the songs stretch out a little (well some more than a little ie &quot;Space Truckin&quot;), but that's what makes this album so great.  The band uses the studio versions to springboard into some of the finest rock jams ever put on tape.   If you have the 2 lp vinyl set (and I know you're out there), definitely upgrade to this cd version.      Every rock collection needs &amp; deserves this album, I hope my review can give you the nudge toward the &quot;add to cart&quot; button.
B000002UAX|2.0|The accolades accorded this album in the fluff laden reviews by people who weren't even around when this was released in 1968 are laughable at best. The best advice given regarding the White Album was by George Martin, who wanted it reduced to the obvious 10-11 finished songs.<br />Rest assured, there is a great 5-star album buried within this release. Conversely, there are two other 1-star albums in the remaining 20 tracks that overshadow it.  Altogether it averages out to 2-stars.  Don't portray Revolution 9, Long Long Long or Good Night as innovative and insightful music. It's not.  That's not say you shouldn't buy it for the good songs, but it doesn't make it a 5-star album.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|ok LISTEN......don't worry about what everyone else is saying about racism and eminem being conceited and everything...they have it all wrong. I love the album and I'm white....so it doesn't matter who you are. Plus, think about it  THEY WOULDN'T BE WITH EMINEM IF HE WAS A JERK TO THEM AND RUBBING IT IN THEIR FACES.  So, all there is to know is that this album is great from track 1-21.  The songs just get you pumped up and flowing to the beat and lyrical rhythm ....it's great.
B000002UYZ|2.0|Disk One - outstanding.  Every song a classic.<BR>Disk two - mediocre. Too dominated by awful music from Rubber Soul and Revolver.<br />Overall rating - 2 stars. Better to buy Beatles 1.
6305428425|3.0|\\"Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion\\" is a classic \\"dumb blonde\\" comedy about two high school best friends who have spent their whole lives together.  When they hear about their ten year high school reunion, they are forced to think about their lives and are surprised to find that they have nothing impressive to share.  Because of their new found void, they decided to invent a new exciting life to share with their former classmates.  They place themselves in a life of wealth and success to impress everyone at the reunion.  When they arrive, all prepared to fake their way to acceptance, they realize that there is one person there who knows their real situation.  By creating a fake but \\"better\\" life they think that they will be more accepted by their peers than they were in the past.  They struggle to keep their old lives a secret and to let their new concocted lives stun the others.<BR> This movie is a classic representation of the blonde stereotype displaying the pairs' hilarious mishaps and brainless actions.  They are depicted as having the very typical passions of shopping, club-hopping, and creating their own fashions.  They try to throw all of this away and take on the role of the rich and successful business woman but later realize that it is not worth faking because the lives they live are just as good and even better.  The movie evolves around the all too common and (very sadly) realistic theme of impressing others by advancing their economic stance and success.  <BR> Overall, it is a fun comedy.  Lisa Kudrow is perfect in her role and she makes it all the more ridiculous.
B000002J09|5.0|Another awesome album by Led Zeppelin, the band that led rock music out of the painful, pop oriented 1960s. Stairway, When the Levee Breaks, Going to California...the list goes on and on. Eight 5-star songs on one album!  Very highly recommended!

006441034X|5.0|Howl's Moving Castle is an excellent fantasy story.  It deals with Sophie, the oldest of three sisters.  She believes, as the oldest of the three, she is doomed to a bad fate.  One day her father, a hat seller, dies and leaves the girls with their step-mother.  The youngest goes to live with a witch to learn magic.  The second sister goes to work at a bakery.  Sophie is stuck with the hat shop.  One day, an evil witch, the Witch of the Waste, comes in and without explanation turns Sophie into an old woman.  Sophie decides to leave the hat shop and find her own destiny.  After leaving the town, she runs into a huge moving castle.  This castle belongs to Wizard Howl who is know to steal the souls and eat the hearts of young girls.  Believing herself to be too old for Howl's morbid tastes, she decides to enter the castle.  Perhaps Wizard Howl can lift the spell she is under.  This begins Sophie's adventure.<br />For fans of fantasy, this is an excellent book.  Diana Wynne Jones is an excellent storyteller.  Also, for fans of Japanese animation, Hayao Miyazaki's next film will be based on this book.  Be sure to read this before watching the movie.  I'm sure you'll love reading it as much as I did.
B000021Y74|5.0|\\"Run Lola Run\\" is a magnificent movie set in modern day Germany.  It is easily one of the best foreign films I have ever seen.  It is entertaining and thoughtful and constantly keeps you visually engaged.  <BR>Lola's boyfriend, Manni, has lost 100,000 marks that he was ordered to deliver to his boss (an unforgiving gangster) in 20 minutes.  If the money is not recovered and delivered within the time allotted, Manni will suffer a terrible fate. He desperately asks Lola for help in this race against time.  She jumps around from one disaster to another desperately trying to help.  We see three different scenarios of Lola running to save her boyfriend giving us a play on the chaos effect.  Tiny details in Lola's quest for the money ultimately change the result of the situation.  As things change so do their fates, momentarily touched by her presence running by.  The film is a visual display of Tykwer's collaboration of camera, music, and story creating a display of cinematic emotion.<BR> The film illustrates a very different kind of female role that strays from the stereotypical portrayal of women.  Lola takes on more of a male role as she desperately tries to be the hero in this situation.  Her boyfriend is the one who seems incapable and asks for her help.  The gender roles are essentially flipped and the stereotypes disappear from the female gender as we see classic beauty and attitude disappear as Lola runs through Germany.  But surprisingly, at the end of the story, the female role is present and given to Lola as we see that Manni did not need her after all.  They walk away together with Lola being the dependant female pretending that the chaotic journey never happened.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|On the first listen of this cd I was mildly impressed, however what I did not notice was my foot tapping throughout the duration of the cd. On my first listen this guy's vocal ability was immediately apparent. From the second listen onwards my liking of his songs quadrupled! Funnily enough I had never heard of this guy before which is such a pity as he's a &quot;real&quot; singer. I don't think I can compare him to anyone as he does things his own way which is done amazingly well. A very good cd and well worth the praise it's been getting.
B00005N9CV|5.0|You will notice some bad reviews of this album sprinkled among the glowing ones; because on this album the artist does not overlook the obvious but instead puts it to use, Diana Krall opens herself up to attack for being a sexy woman. Yes, she is good looking. Yes, she has great legs. Yes, she's wearing heels. What of it? She looks good, and all of it is icing on the cake - the music is wonderful.<br />The sad part of all of this is that if the photography that accompanies the album had featured Krall in sweats and Birkenstocks, these same bitter cranks would be singing the album's praises. Instead, she looks good, so they say the music is bad. That is rather pathetic.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies. I normally am not a romance fan at all. However, Jane Austen has all ways been able to hold my interest. The characters are always so alive and vibrant.<BR>This is an excellent movie adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.<BR> I highly recommend it to any one who wants a very sweet story. With not much depression attached to it.
B0001Z363W|3.0|In an age, were a war is being waged to keep heavy music alive and to strengthen it beyond its greatest boundaries, one of the &quot;mvps&quot; of heavy metal offers a disc that would cater to fans of Evanescence.  The tracks that open the disc are rather good, sounding a bit more melodic and grungy than what I'm used to hearing from BLS.  However, the disc quickly turns into a yawner of heartfelt piano anthems.  I don't think this is what we need on the mainstage of Ozzfest.  I say bump Lamb of God or Slipknot up.  For a much better dose of heavy metal check out the new one from God Forbid entitled &quot;Gone Forever&quot; or &quot;As the Palaces Burn&quot; from the as for mentioned Lamb of God.
B00006J3WH|4.0|I love this CD. The music and the voices all work smoothly together. Joss Wheadon really knew what he was doing with this series and was able to create an excellent musical for it.<BR> The sound track for the episode \\" Once More With Feeling\\" is great. The sound could be worked on a bit more. However, all, and all it's a great sound track.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is a beautifully written book by Mitch Albom. It is his own true story, about Albom's own battle in the process of loosing his favorite college professor, Morrie Schwartz. Albom flies to visit Morrie every Tuesday for him to teach Albom life's greatest lessons. These include lessons about the world, feeling sorry for yourself, regrets, death, family, and many more life-changing lessons.This book is filled with inspiring quotes, which if you read carefully, could deeply move you. &quot;In the beginning of life, when we are infants, we need others to survive, right? And at the end of life, when you get like me, you need others to survive, right?&quot; His voice dropped to a whisper. &quot;But here's the secret: in between, we need others as well.&quot; Albom kept visiting Morrie until the day-before he died, and in the process learned a better way to live life. In other words, this is a story about experiencing life through the death of a close friend. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars!!
B00001QEE9|1.0|This certainly is not one of my favorite Disney movies. I just really didn't get in to the movie I guess but then I never really cared for this Fairy Tale either.<BR>The voice actors are good and the scenery, and colors are great. But for some reason this one really just didn't hit home for me.

B0000DIXN7|3.0|Amy Winehouse - Frank (Universal, 2003)<br />I read about Amy on dustygroove.com and I had to check this album out. She doesn't disappoint here. It may take some time to get into her voice, though. She has a Ms. Dynamite/Nelly Furtado thing going on (although I would listen to Furtado over these two artists). Still, help yourself to &quot;Help Yourself&quot; and the funny but true &quot;F*** Me Pumps&quot;, where Amy tells a woman to stop dressing the way she does if she wants some respect in the clubs. Producer Salaam Remi (Nas' God's Son, Fugees' The Score) contributes here as well; in fact, &quot;In My Bed&quot; features the same beat from Nas' &quot;Made You Look&quot;. -EJR
B0000013GT|5.0|While most of you try to dichotomize terms like hip hop and rap, i just listen to the music. music is now so intermingled with videos, clothing lines, fancy beats, and image, that we have forgotten very music that paved the way for bullsh*t to drive on.  this album strays from that path. it doesnt come with any fancy videos or special guests.  nor skits --just pure [circle term(rap or hip-hop)]. this album is not only the best outkast album (if you are a true fan you'll agree.), but it is also an archetype for any hip-hop classic; crisp beats, good lyrics, and, most importantly, consistancy (i hate it when an album has one good single and the tracks range from hot to wack). Andre and Big Boi both grew lyrically from their first record to create this futuristic masterpiece.  it will be years before the the rap/hip-hop community will understand the genius of this album. if you dont have this album please dont write reviews or consider yourself an Outkast fan.

1577311523|2.0|I got this book from the local library after a strong recommendation from a friend and eagerly started reading it. <br />Tolle's near death experience and subsequent spiritual awakening is strikingly similar to the Great Indian Saint Sri Ramana Maharishi's a century ago.

630512762X|2.0|Dont take my low vote on this movie the wrong way. I'm not voting down the movie, the movie is a great movie, a definit 4 star movie for me. But I rate the DVD down for the Australian (regioun 4) version which has &quot;Special Edition&quot; written on it! And I want to know what exactly makes it a special edition? It comes a with a trailer ... whoopie... it has somthing called &quot;Action Overload&quot; which i thought might have been a featurette? but it was just a 60 second montage of the action in the film! Basicly it was another trailer! and of coarse &quot;Cast biographies&quot; which wernt planned out very good, they dont even give you a list of movies Travolta or Cage have been in! It just mentions a small bit of details and somthing about an awarard? <br />If your looking specificly for this movie on DVD? Then i rate it a 4! Also, if you havent seen it? Then i recomend you at least rent it, and decide if you'd be intrested in buying it? But if your not intrested in bonus material, then its worth it!<br />But if you where like me? and was hopeing that &quot;Special Edition&quot; ment more then 2 trailers (which i dont consider bonus features, they should be standard. and pretty much are), a terribly thought out biography, and Wide Screen (if you consider that any kind of bonus?) then i dont recomend you pay alot for it, to me this was just the way a normal DVD is usualy represented. What is &quot;Special&quot; about this &quot;Special Edition?&quot;

Wild shoot em ups, some close to realistic SWAT tactics, lots of guns, lots of sex and cussing! PERFECT. My wife did make me sit through Chocolat again though. Sometimes a man just wants to watch an action movie. SWAT fit the bill better than most \\"action\\" movies currently out. I enjoyed it. <BR>(...)
B000002INJ|4.0|This is a band who's gotten a bad rap by most metal fans throughout the world, everyone just seems to write them off as the \\"cheesiest metal band ever.\\" Blender magazine (corporate junk) made them one of the top 50 worst acts of all time. Gimme a break! I was hesitant to buy this at first but i wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I am more then happy with my purchase.<br />The opening track \\"wheels of fire\\" could really be compared to the opening track on Metallica's \\"Kill em All\\" debut. It's about riding your bike at night and not caring, the rebellious attitude that goes hand in hand with heavy metal music, just in with the Metallica line \\"no life till leather...\\" A fantastic way to open an album, the song is catchy, memorable, and will have your fist in the air in no time. The second track is really kind of egocentric, basically about how Manowar kills every other band out there, a good song, another fisterupper, but the lyrics you just gotta appreciate for their again, rebellious attitude. The third track is a pretty good ballad, but I've heard better. Good acoustic work... yes, they use ACOUSTICS! Although the vocals really weren't made for acoustic ballads. Next there's a bass guitar solo that's so fast and energetic it's amazing on \\"sting of the bumblebee.\\" A fast high note bass guitar really does sound like a bee!<br />After this there seems to be a break in the album's attitude, which is a really cool thing, the songs \\"Crown and the Ring\\" and \\"Kingdom Come\\" are fantasy oriented power metal tracks, one which mostly sticks to keyboards and clean vocals, slows down but has a very epic stand-atop-a-cliff-with-sword-in-hand feel to it, creative and highly melodic.<br />Afterwards there's \\"Pleasure Slave\\" which starts out by hearing women having sex and loving it, it's a pretty sleazy sounding song and displays Manowar's love (or disrespect depending on which way you look at it) for sex and women, a surprise track which further enhances the variety of therecord. Track 8 is somewhat mediocre but still decent, another hard hitting metal track. Track 9 is just an old man telling a boy a story, a fantasy tale of war an battle, which works as a good opener for the final amazing track \\"Blood of the Kings.\\" Now this is a GREAT fantasy metal track, their use of choir type vocals during the chorus makes this one extremely catchy and melodic.<br />In the end i really have to say that this record emcompasses everything a passionate heavy metal band loves, whether it's fantasy, rebellious leather clad attitudes, sex, or a sensitive acoustic ballad, it all goes to show that these guys, though image wise are seen as idiots, really are imaginative, creative, sensitive and passionate human beings. This MUST be in EVERY metal fans collection, it's a classic!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|There are two kinds of people in this world.  Those who have seen this movie this movie and those who haven't.  I have and I love it.  This is unquestionably the greatest western ever made.  The performances of all the leads are top notch.  The direction by Leone is superb.  The editing is seamless.  The cinematography is gorgeous and the music by Morricone is haunting and triumphant.  Everything about this movie is perfect.  It is a film that is truly deserving of the first-class treatment that has finally recieved.  This is a cinematic experience that should not be missed by anybody who enjoys GOOD movies.  The extras are worth the price alone.  Wonderful interviews and recollections by Clint, Eli and various crew members give the viewers a first time look into the making of this classic motion picture.  All documenteries are very well done and informative.  The deleted scenes and the ultra-rare French trailer are fun to see for the first time.  The film itself is as beautiful as it's ever going to be and that's good enough for me.  The newly integrated scenes don't necessarily add to the story but they don't take anything away from it either.  Leone put them in the film for a reason and I for one am glad to have them added in.  The sound has been remastered in a welcomed 5.1 mix that further immerses you into the surreal frontiers of Sergio's old west.  The audio commentary has a few interesting facts and insights but is nothing groundbreaking.  I pesonally would rather have had a group commentary including Clint, Eli and others who were available but I understand how difficult that can be to do.  The bottom line is that this is the best treatment and presentation of this film that is going to be released for a very long time and possibly ever.  I highly recommend this film to anybody who has any shred of taste in films.
B0001M0A4I|5.0|This album is a must have for any music fan out there. After the first listen you will want more. Also Tony has more stuff out there that is just as good if not better. I love this album and cant wait for more in the future.  Brando
0440241413|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has it down to a science. I'm a shopoholic myself and I found myself agreeing with Becky's reasons for buying all the things she does. It tells a great story of a young twenty-something living in a big city and wanting it all. I flew through this book - it was easy to read, lighthearted and entertaining. If you love to shop , you'll get a kick out of this book! I also recommend two other books that I enjoyed &quot;Good Grief&quot;, and &quot;He Never Called Again.&quot;
B00001QEE7|5.0|I recently purchased a used DVD of the Little Mermaid from Sk60433@smconnect.com.  The item arrived on time and in excellent condition.  I would highly recommend buying from them.
B000002HPV|4.0|Ok...Firstly...This album is one of the strangest records I've ever purchased...not that it's bad. Just it's definitely unusual and certainly not for your everyday music listeners. To give you a hint what the album sounds like........remember Portishead's self-titled album ''Portishead''- now take that and strip away the thickly-based trip-hop beats and add some unfathomable-techno with strings...-and on top of that place Bjork's voice- the result would definitely be rather unheard of, most of all UNIQUE and vocally pleasant.<br />Not all of the tracks are techno influenced, when mentioning tracks like ''Hunter'' and ''Bachelorette'' which sound allot like ''Human Behavior''. ''Joga'' is really a great song, also one of my ultimate Bjork favorites. And ''Pluto'' is very...I don't know?-------Remember Madonna's song ''Ray Of Light'' with all those crazy beats and erratic sound effects...this track definitely sounds like that.<br />Her voice is so powerful and when she cries out and it soars through it's highest peak- she is fully capable of putting other grand artists to shame with her voice. There's really no other artist (apart from Dido) that sounds like Bjork.<br />''Alarm Call'' is a excellent song, really no other track that sounds like this, this is what I love about this SONG!!!. But...my favorite is ''All Is Full Of Love'', I like the version on this album, but I prefer the originally (Unreleased) version which was used for the video, So you might want to pick up the CD Single for the video version.<br />I'm glad that I have a CD with a original sound to add to my Collection. <br />Excellent Work!
B00004XONN|4.0|When Radiohead released the 2000 album KID A, many people were puzzled.  There was hardly a guitar to be found on the whole album.  Radiohead traded in the claustrophobic, dense melodicism of OK COMPUTER for a much more electronically twinged sound.  People didn't know how to react.  Some loved it.  Others wished they'd return to the sound of 1997.  I'm glad made KID A, though I do not believe it is a wholly successful album.  KID A is self-consciously difficult and avant-garde, whereas OK COMPUTER never felt forced, but developed according to its own internal laws and rhythms.<br />The biggest problem with KID A is that, because OK COMPUTER proved to be one of the biggest records of the 1990s, a Gen X DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, Radiohead felt they had to come up with another genre shattering record.  THE BENDS still held Radiohead in a pop status, albeit a very mature sounding pop band.  With OK COMPUTER, they had been pushed over the brink, where the commercialism of music, a la Britney Spears, is regarded with scorn.  In a word, they became one of the major bands in rock music producing worthwhile, lasting music.  They graduated to elite status, where rock critics faun over them and college intellectuals, when speaking of current bands with as little distaste as they can muster, speak of a band called Radiohead that has a very intellectually stimulating record about a computer.  This process begun as early as THE BENDS, for it is on that record, and the numerous B-Sides of that project (a full album in itself), that Radiohead proved themselves far above their peers.  With OK COMPUTER, they cemented their reputation as a post-modern musical force to be reckoned with.  <br />OK COMPUTER also established Radiohead as one of the best guitar-rock bands of the 1990s.  The music on OK COMPUTER is tight, muscular, densely layered, and wonderfully executed.  OK COMPUTER, much like DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, presents a very English view of reality, and like its predecessor, OK COMPUTER finds the world dehumanizing and cruel.  There is a wistful voice throughout OK COMPUTER, wishing to retreat into a world of isolation because everything has gone so dreadfully wrong.  The entire LP announced to the world that a major, landmark album has just arrived.<br />So how do you follow up a record like OK COMPUTER?  Floyd followed up DARK SIDE with WISH YOU WERE HERE, which is tunning in its own right.  The Beatles followed up SGT. PEPPER, the ultimate high watermark in highly valuable, artistic rock music, with the vast double album THE BEATLES.  (For an aside, I find THE WHITE ALBUM much more musically satisfying than SGT. PEPPER.  This reviewer does not wholly agree with the general public perception of SGT. PEPPER.) <br />Well, the answer's simple, really.  To throw out the guitars and get into electronic music.  Radiohead now has a reputation that it must uphold.  So KID A is the result.  Where COMPUTER used music as a catharsis, an aural equivalent of Orwell's 1984, KID A was now more interesting in constructing challenging, `artistic' music, not because they have something to say, but because that is what is expected of them as an avant-garde band.  And that is the real problem with KID A.  OK COMPUTER never sounds forced; that record plays like a stunning document of post-modern ansgt in modern rock and roll trappings, albeit very English rock and roll trappings.  KID A, on the other hand, sounds like the band is trying to be live up to a reputation set up for them by themselves and by public perception, as the premier intellectual rock band living in a technological and ideologically bankrupt world.  KID A, although musically very far afield from Radiohead's previous work, is the next logical step in the career that OK COMPUTER predestined them for, because the very fact that KID A exists shows people that Radiohead has risen above mere commercialism and is into making real music, wherever their muse follows them..<br />All that being said, asfor the music on KID A, I find it very highly rewarding.  Radiohead, while trying to develop a stylish, `hip' sequel to their critical smash, did manage some genius songwriting here.  Although you have to be open to electronic music to begin with, in KID A you will find that the whole album stands up as a very solid album with a lot of good songs on it.  It's a very good electronic album from a rock and roll band, and a great addition to Radiohead's catalogue.  It's just KID A is a self-conscious stab at trying to be `different,' where OK COMPUTER is a natural, organic statement of a world view.<br />P. S.  One controversy sparked by Radiohead's move into electronic music is people unfamiliar with electronic music are claiming it to be pure genius while people who are very heavily into techno, etc, say Radiohead's KID A is not as musically rewarding as, say, the Aphex Twins or other major musical electronic groups.  While not being familiar with electronic music, I will say KID A has a lot of great electronic music, though I wish they would have cut \\"Treefingers,\\" which as far as I'm concerned is little more than a dead-weight instrumental.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Look, I'm no big fan of hers- but Christina Aguilera is quite simply a incredible artist, she cannot be topped by no other performer since her voice is unique and can't be mistaken for anyone else. I liked her collaborations with Ricky Martin, and one of my favorite songs is her previous Spanish influenced ''Pero Me Acuerdo De Ti''.<br />Despite 9 incredibly good tracks from a LARGELY composed 20 track album ''Stripped'', the rest are well- not so fantastic, But Christina's voice is still so beautiful in its haunting and tuned form. This is definitely not for fans of her Britney Spears-esque ''Genie In A Bottle''. I'm glad that she has matured into adult contemporary pop, this is the kind of collection/album that's probably comparable to Madonna's early 90's album and Maria Carey's general pop music.<br />My Favorite tracks are: Voice Within, Beautiful, I'm Ok, Stripped Pt. 1, Stripped Pt. 2<br />Well, what else can I say?. I'm impressed with Christina and I will patiently await for her next retail which (hopefully) will be another great compilation of easy-going ballads. Really Nice, Enjoy!.
B00008BRB5|5.0|The Police's fifth, last and best album.  Every Police album surpassed the previous, until they reached their pinnacle - Synchronicity.<br />On their early albums they sometimes tried to be too clever with the lyrics, ending up coming across as pretentious, while the music was good, but sometimes just didn't seem to flow properly.  \\"Ghost in the Machine\\", their fourth album, is the first album where they got it all together, and Synchronicity builds on this.  That said, their first three albums were not bad at all, all worthy of at least three stars, and perhaps even four.<br />Synchronicity strikes the perfect balance: tight yet creative, finely crafted, yet with enough rawness to not feel over-produced.  Andy Summers' guitaring was never as silky and crafted, Stewart Copeland's drumming never as powerful, or timing as efficient.  Sting's bass was just perfect - pronounced and confident, yet not overbearing.  His vocals were superb, as always.<br />The radio-hits \\"Every breath you take\\", \\"King of Pain\\" and \\"Wrapped around your finger\\" are clearly great songs, the former especially, but the hidden gem is \\"Synchronicity I\\".  \\"Walking in your footsteps\\" is another great and under-rated Police track.<br />It was ironic that relations between the band members were at their worst during the making of this album, if the documentaries are to be believed.  They seemed to get better the more they fought!  Maybe the duress brought out the best in them, like when Fleetwood Mac made Rumours.<br />Sad to consider that this was their last album, just when they hit their peak.  Imagine the music they would have made if they could have stayed together for a few more years...well, we'll never know.  Especially as Sting's solo stuff is no indication of what might have been, being rather boring and pretentious and falling well short of The Police in quality.
B000089RVR|3.0|Firstly &amp; Foremost...this album is not as good as ''No Angel''. It's over average -but it's not beyond average like ''No Angel'' was....it does however feature some good moments on tracks like ''Life For Rent'', ''White Flag'', ''See The Sun'' and ''See When You're 40''. More or less, the album does not possess the same powerful stream as ''No Angel'' breathed. Her voice is still beautiful in its tuned form. It's the kind of voice that gives absolute perfection, I only know one other performer who can be compared to Dido and that is Tracy Thorn (From Everything But The Girl). Both Dido or Tracy Thorn could sing about ''laundry detergent'' as someone else put it, and they'd still make it sound incredible. That shows you, how incredible both of them are.<br />And I will give this album 5 stars, the songs are average standard except for the excellent title track and her voice still sounds great!. This artist will get really far, mark my words.
B000068OSK|4.0|...and they got even better, with &quot;De Stijl&quot; and &quot;Elephant&quot;.<br />Good garage-blues-rock, with a scaled-down sound (just guitar and drums). Reminiscent of Led Zeppelin's first two albums, and you can't get a much bigger compliment than that. Gets better with each listen, as good albums should.<br />The only gripe I have is that there is a degree of &quot;sameness&quot; between the tracks - they could have done better by trimming a few tracks off the album, and maybe worked on introducing some more variety.<br />The best tracks are &quot;Stop breaking down&quot; (a cover of the Robert Johnson classic, though for the definitive version listen to the Rolling Stones' version on &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot;), &quot;Suzy Lee&quot; and &quot;Sugar never tasted so good&quot;.
B00009ATIX|1.0|As a fan of the book, I would like to say at the outset that I don't expect movies to be like the book, but should be judged by themselvs.<br />That said, the book is one of my favorites, and is an exciting, mind-bending journey into the nature of consciousness and an incredible 'what-if' of a sentient planet.<br />This stupid movie tried to turn that into a love story.<br />Yes, the apparition that looks and 'thinks' she is his wife, and unaware that 'she' is dead is a psycological shock, but turning it into a romance simply had nothing to do with the book.  A different story entirely.<br />There are so many opportunites for excitement, special effects available in the book.  (Helicopter rides into transient foaming structures, historical replays of previous expiditions, etc.)<br />I often envisioned an exciting dramatic movie--without losing any of the intellect.  I also was very excited about this movie until I had to found myself nodding off--something I NEVER do in a movie.<br />If you are interested in a good movie adaptation, check out the original directed by Andrei Tarkovsky.  There is an excellent DVD produced by Criterion Collection.  (Just skip the boring highway scene in the beginning, and you have a great movie.)<br />Better still--read the book-- two or three times.  It's well worth it!
B00006M183|5.0|I have been a fan of Pearl Jam since their very first album, \\"Ten\\", in 1991 and this is their most mature album to date.  They started out as a typical grunge band - angry at the world and letting that anger show through in their music.  They were never ones to repeat old gripes and riffs though, always emerging with a different sound and lyrical moral each album, while at their core remaining true to what they do best - solid guitar-orientated hard rock.  No wandering off to experiment with synthesizers, tape loops, drum machines, and other useless c**p.  (Radiohead and U2, take note!).<br />In Riot Act the feelings expressed are more diverse than previously - less anger-centric - and are expressed in a more subtle sort of way.  The guitar solos are tighter, Eddie Vedder's vocals more measured and less of a scream.  His vocals have always been a highlight of Pearl Jam's music and now he goes to the next level, swapping pitch for tone.  His voice now more fully conveys the emotions and sentiments of the music, to the extent that one doesn't even have to understand the lyrics to grasp the emotions, a truly remarkable performance.  A great example of this is on \\"I am mine\\", for me the best track on the album.<br />The more mature sound may be a conscious effort on Pearl Jam's part, or simply a natural progression, being more mature, worldy-wise individuals now and not the naively bitter and angry youngsters they used to be.<br />A great album, though there has never been a bad Pearl Jam album.  \\"Binaural\\" is their worst offering, and that is a 3-star effort.  All the rest are 4 or 5 star albums, \\"Yield\\" still being my overall favourite, though Riot Act runs it close.
B00008MZ0N|3.0|I have to say that this movie did have its good points, to any women reading this review, Paul Walker and Van Diesel are HOT! The cars are cool and the racing rocks (though stupid and should only be in a Hollywood movie and not on &quot;real&quot; streets)! I have to admit that the plot is pretty much non-existant and some scenes could have been left on the cutting room floor. I gave this movie 3 stars because;<BR>1) The cars are really cool!<BR>2) Paul Walker and Van Diesel are hot! and<BR>3) You have to give credit where credit is due, it was a well filmed movie and the camera angles were also very well done, (I work with filming TV and so I see little mistakes in everything, but this one I saw hardly anything. That gives it a thumbs up from me).<BR>I realise some of my stuff is bias but I actually liked the movie. So for what its worth, if you go to your local video store and buy a &quot;previously viewed&quot; version for $15 or less its a good movie.<BR>But please, DO NOT TRY ANY OF THE STUNTS AT HOME! Because if that's your plan than don't bother watching it. Thank you and good night!
B000002TQV|5.0|(The best was OK Computer)<br />Fantastic album. Searing guitar riffs mixed with emotionally charged vocals and lyrics. From the hard-edged rock of &quot;Bones&quot; and &quot;The Bends&quot; to the melancholy of &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; and &quot;Nice Dream&quot;, every note is just perfect.<br />Radiohead followed this up with an even better album, OK Computer. Less raw and rocky, more ambient and symphonic, it just grows and grows on you.<br />Now if Radiohead would kindly get back on track after wandering off to do the very mediocre and forgettable &quot;Amnesiac&quot; and &quot;Kid A&quot;, and the mostly forgettable (though with some evidence of a slight return to form), &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;, the world would be a better place.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Okay lets be honest here i have a couple of things to say about this fantastic film, The Way the werewolves look in this movie are probably one of the best werewolf effects ever, EVEN MUCH MUCH BETTER THEN AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, Thats one of the good things that underworld uses. Another thing is The Group called &quot;The Death Dealers&quot; Okay lets face it Vampires do not really have blue eyes. There a couple of things that disapointed me in Underworld, One thing that really got me upset (And this is why i gave it 4 stars). Okay I really dont want to spoil this for everyone but i just have to and i apologize for doing this. For Example that part in the movie were selen's boyfriend gets bitten by a werewolf then he loses his mortality then towards the end Selen bites him and Then he turns into a mixture of a werewolf and vampire put together. That part of the movie really hurt the movie right there, I mean it was so stupid! Look at the way he looked he WAS BLUE I MEAN COME ON WHY WOULD THEY EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING THAT, THAT WAS A VERY foolish IDEA. What is he a fricking smurf or something. Even if they hadnt made him blue it would still be stupid. Werewolves do not match with vampires and the curses do not mix. That was the part that made me really upset when i saw that part i felt like i didnt want to watch the rest of the movie but since i saw it so far and it was towards the end somehow i managed to watch it. I am definitely getting the Unrated Version Of Underworld Because there are more interesting special features and the good thing about it is that there is extended footage that wasnt shown in theatres and some other goodies that are on the dvd.
B00005JMCW|3.0|It's an old story with a predictable storyline.  Jamie Lee is finally starting to look old.  It's a good movie and the acting was pretty good.  It's just this story has already been told tons of times before.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|My comments:<BR>- Two annoying covers. The originals are much better (Knockin' on heaven's door, Simpathy for the devil)<BR>- Bad single disc compilation. You know why.<BR>- Not cheap<BR>- Why<br />Bye
0553293397|4.0|The only reason I've rated this book only four stars is because some of Asimov's later books in the same series, written later in his career (e.g., Robots of Dawn) get even better. I found that there was a linear improvement in Asimov's writing through all of the robot novels.<br />Not only do you get to experience a great mystery-adventure, but you're also exploring the social consequences of near-human robots and the continued urbanization of the Earth along with man's push into space.<br />Daneel Olivaw, the robot partner to detective Elijah Baley, is one of the most memorable characters in the field of speculative fiction.<br />This is the best place to start reading Asimov; however, you should begin by reading the first novel in the series, Caves of Steel. If you enjoy these two, you will absolutely love the sequels. After reading the Robots books, try the Foundation series, which starts slower but gets very good--and ultimately rewards readers of the Robot books by tieing it all together.
B000060MMI|1.0|I was wondering if this band thought nobody would remember who the Pogues were.  This band is so un-original it's not even funny.  One of the founding fathers of punk Irish music is the Pogues, not these idiots.  So too bad this was done 20 years ago and the Pogues were a million times better.  Flogging Molly is nothing new and different so don't waste your money!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|The writing on this show is more than fantastic! Watching the first season on DVD was great because I could use the subtitles to read what they were saying-- sometimes the comebacks were so fast(especially by Lorelai) that it almost made my head spin! The acting is also teriffic-- Lorelai and Rory are a mother/daughter team made in rock-n-roll heaven and the supporting cast are each flavorful and delicious in their own way. After taking a complete weekend to view the entire 20 episodes plus pilot plus special features I found myself in a little funk and wishing that I actually lived in Stars Hallow and knew these people. Ah, if only life could be this witty, sassy and full of Gilmore ups and downs...
B0001WTUH6|5.0|Vampires vs Werewolves, one of the oldest novel ideas. As apposed to going the old route with cliched and tired hand-to-hand fighting scenes (Matrix Reloaded anyone?), they illustrate that the Vampires and Lycians have evolved to realize that they live in the 21st century and revealing themselves to the majority is a bad thing. Still holding true to the oldest forms of Vampires, they still require blood and are basically immortal. Truly an enjoying watch for a myth buff. On a final note, this movie is NOT a horror film like Vampire flicks of yesteryear, this is a more story driven, action film, similar to the recently released Van Helsing.
1592400876|4.0|There are many, many punctuation and grammar guides on the market.  People hungry for knowledge should read several - including this one.  There's nothing wrong with being entertained while learning! It's amazing - and wonderful - that a book on punctuation has caught the attention of so many.  It's also amusing to note that virtually all of the Amazon readers who excoriated the book wrote comments replete with grammar and punctuation errors.  Disdain the book if you must, but do at least read it first.
B000174LVQ|4.0|What a striking CD this is! It is easy to stand in awe of De Lucia when you listen to him with Al De Meola, but until you get down to him in his own element, flamenco, you just don't appreciate what a compelling and passionate musicians he is.<BR>This is not a set of fireworks, but more the smoldering  intensely passionate burning of a heart and soul dedicated to a sublime expression of the human heart. Acoompanied simply by the handclapping palmas and the singing of a small chorus, this is an intimate recording, not a big production showcase, and thus comes its seductive allure.<BR>Images of women dancing flamenco will whirl through your imagination. intercut with reflections on Spain's Sephardic and Moorish cultural vestiges. Soul music of the most sublime order! Throughout it is as though you do not even notice the craft and skill of De Lucia's fretwork, fingering and plectum; yet, in the end he has nourished your soul in ways you were unprepared for and unaware of. <BR>If you are an afficianado of flamenco, I can't imagine that you will find a finer exposition than this CD. If you have an avocation for world music, this is a master expressing himself with such power and grace that you must pick this up.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|\\"Love Actually\\" is a horrid film - poorly written, completely implausible, filled with chemistry-free relationships and gross manipulations that fall completely flat.<br />To point out every flaw would take longer than the 1,000 words, but as an example, the film starts with a narration - over shots of happy people in an airport - talking about the constant nature of love in a post 9/11 world.  Later in the film, a kid runs past airport security and the resulting chase is played for good natured laughs.  Other - a man buries his wife and a week later is told he should start dating again.  A mish mash of tone - one of the couples featured meets on athe set of a film where they are body doubles who simulate sex all day, while the path to true love for another couple is barricaded by her mentally challenged and violent older brother - and style - a dissolving marriage contrasted to a Penthouse Forum type fantasy - that ultimately adds up to 135 minutes of jaw-dropping inanity, this is a film that gives romantic comedies a bad name.<br />Beautifully shot though.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|I thought this album would be a good rocker just like &quot;get born&quot;, but the rest of the cd is just a re-hash of that song, or some really bad and stupid ballad that tries way too hard to emulate the beatles but falls short in a final desparate push every time.
0393324818|3.0|This book reads more like an overlong magazine article than a well-written book.  Michael Lewis is not a great writer, and his theme -- that baseball teams can be better managed by objectively weighting the contribution of various player attributes, such as on-base percentage and slugging percentage -- is informative but not earth-shattering.  As an Oakland A's fan, I gained some insights from this book.  But was it worth the $11 I paid for it? Not really.
B000099T2L|1.0|This CD sucks!!  Who told her that whining and screaming is singing?  Jay-Z got the right beats on some songs.  But, overall Beyonce CANNOT sing.  She won awards because there wasn't any competition at the time.  I guess any girl dancing like a naked go-go dancer would get one too!!
0393314804|5.0|Trainspotting could be the best book I've ever read. The characters are fascinating and the story is exciting. Highly recommended.
B00006CXXU|4.0|this album is pretty good..her voice is beautiful...<BR>i like &quot;impossible&quot; and &quot;Infatuation&quot; the most in tha album..!
B00003CXPD|5.0|This is a beautiful film, warmth, sensational, and it may even make you cry. The film also makes you feel complete: it starts with young Billy's kiddie jumps while he's making his breakfast, it ends with grown-up Billy's beautiful ballet jump while he's already a superstar ballet dancer performing the Swan Lake. The storyline is straight foward but the details between the father and son's bonding, the confusing friendship with Billy's sweet gay friend Michael, are very well done. Jamie Bell (as Billy) did an outstanding performance in his debut. Undoubtfully, his acting, his dancing, his enthusiastic performance, really make this film truely alive! Billy Elliot, FIVE STARS!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I'm a DJ i listen to mostly underground hip hop, like: Jurassic 5, Zion I, Blackalicious, etc. If I can dig this CD, You can. I thought it was a trip back to the 60's/70's and the music industry needed to re-live some of that criteria. Thats what Jet's doing, making paople realize that good rock was produced for a reason: not to kill, not to hate, but to capture love and having a great ass time wildin-out to some fast-paced rock-n-roll. Hell thats what this country's music was built on. And we need some Aussie's to tell us this?...damn is rock dead?..maybe thats why im in the underground hip hop scene. doesnt get blown to hell by media and record execs. peace.
B000089CJI|3.0|Tell you what, folks, the first time I ever heard the song \\"Such Great Heights,\\" I'm not kidding, I thought Kajagoogoo had reformed to make a new album.  Everything here is vintage, updated Kajagoogoo for 2004, with classic lead frontman Limahl back at the helm.  Sad thing is, it's not Kajagoogoo, but rather, the weak Postal Service, who do a bad Kajagoogoo imitation.  Save for \\"Such Great Heights,\\" this record comes nowhere near Kaja's 1982 classic, \\"White Feathers.\\"  Postal Service even went so far as to rip off the classic '80s ten-song format on their record.  Oh well, what can you do?  For true synth rock, check out White Feathers by Kajagoogoo, or any of the first three Duran Duran studio albums.  <br />On a personal note, this is my 200th record review, so I'm very honored for the support of everybody.  THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!!!!
B000002J2D|5.0|this is a great genesis cd with my favourite phil collins featuring the terrific songs follow me follow you and down and out.very highly recommended.five stars.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I've read a lot of the reviews below and quite frankly I don't understand where they're coming from. I really loved this film. <BR>The movie really conveys that feeling of loneliness and isolation which was intended by the director. Both character's are misfits, both are uncertain of their future, both have a false sense of superiority. The end result is this extreme alienation that the movie beautifully conveys. Many of the reviews below describe the film as pointless and boring. And I admit the story line is a bit thin, but &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; does something better than merely tell a story. It makes you feel, it makes you think, which is very uncommon of most movies these days.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I think so. And this one fits the bill. Several stories twine and intertwine throughout, and even those that border on the expected are played with such charm and grace -- as well as a few little twists that embellish the story -- that they are easily forgiven. Surprise cameos are a delight. <br />Among the extras on the DVD are a few deleted scenes, with commentary by director Richard Curtis. As a sidebar, he notes that the film originally ran closer to 3 hours, 45 minutes, but he had to cut 80 minutes or so to get the film into commercial length for theatres. Usually deleted scenes are best left that way, for any one of a number of reasons. However, almost without exception, the deleted scenes here would have, I think, added greatly to the fun of the movie. And in the end, that's what this movie is -- fun -- and a surprising pleasure. (Would love to see a cut that ran the full 3 hrs 45!)<br />Definitely not just a chick flick. Recommended without hesitation for all adults!
0060934719|5.0|Tristan Thorn's journey across the Wall is a beautiful lyrical tale of a young boy who vows to win his love by retrieving a fallen star from across the Wall into the land of Fairie only to find that the journey itself is more important than the object of his affection. Many surprises await him including a dwarfish aide, a flying ship, witches, princes, and unicorns and of course, a damsel in distress. The side plot of the Lord of the Stormhold and Tristan's though initially unrelated, coincide in the manner only the best of fairytales can, by fate, destiny, and love. The ending is a mix of happiness, triumph, and melancholy. Curiousity peaked yet? Good. No other spoilers needed.<br />To say that \\"Stardust\\" is \\"an outline\\" or in some way incomplete is to miss the essence of a fairytale. Young hapless human + journey + magical realm + good + evil + happy ending = fairytale. Suffice to say, Neil Gaiman's scores on all accounts in creating a successful tale and adds a bit more complexity for the adult reader. Overall  the plot, characters, and world ARE simple. The themes, however, are not: The journey is more important than the goal, the goal one desires in youth is not the same in adulthood, after a life-changing journey, how can one return home, and so on and so forth.<br />(...). Furthermore, with only one minor scene, it seemed superflous. But don't let that detract you from reading. \\"Stardust\\" reads like an oral tale that has just been written down for the first time. It carries the history and weight of a classic. Give it a whirl!<br />A+
0609610570|3.0|In the &quot;Introduction&quot; and the first chapter &quot;The Gap Nobody Knows&quot;, the authors did promise their book to be superior to most of the common &quot;leadership&quot;, &quot;strategy&quot;, &quot;corporate culture&quot; management books with its ability to explain and solve the universal problem of why business outcomes almost always fall short of those predicted under the grand strategic plans laid down by golden parachute protected American top corp CEOs. Though it is fluently written, it just resembles most of its competitors in any book store, except by an author coming from a big enterprise called &quot;Honeywell&quot; carrying an eye catching rare term named &quot;Execution&quot;.<br />Before I conclude my review, I would like to give you a brief summary of what this book is about.<br />To understand execution, readers have to keep three key points in their mind: 1) Execution is a discipline, and integral to strategy 2) Execution is the major job of the business leader 3)Execution must be a core element of an organisation's culture. The discipline of execution is based on a set of three building blocks that every leader must use to design, install and operate effectively the three core processes rigorously and consistently. The seven essential behavour of Building block I are: know your people and your business, insist on realism, set clear goals and priorities, follow through, reward the doers, expand people's capabilities and know yourself. Building block II is about creating the framework for cultural change whereas building block III is about having the right people in the right place. Meanwhile, the three core processes are those of making  links between people, strategy and operations.<br />Without prejudice, the above ideas are quite fundamental. However, I am not saying that this is a bad management book. After reading tens, if not over a hundred books of the same kind, I really cant agree that this book is exceptionally outstanding. Can be a leisure reading, but definitely not on the priority list.Can be a leisure reading, but definitely not on the priority list.
B000005JA8|1.0|How wonderful that there are some coherent one-star reviews to read, agitating against the nonsense!  Sort the reviews by &quot;most helpful&quot; and see what you find.  The rating is being artifically driven up by a crew of unskilled pranksters (which I suppose is appropriate considering the album itself).  Never mind this horrible mess of an album and listen to some real music.
1592400876|4.0|I am a stickler, also one who has delighted in collecting apostrophe atrocities [such as COON DOG'S FOR SALE], so I liked this book. I think it will appeal mainly to the choir to whom she is preaching, we who read it for reassurance as we glumly watch our language always sinking to the lowest common denominator, and then get told that such sinking is right and proper because that is the way usage is going.<BR>Ms Truss makes all this fun and zippy.  There are few who champion sticklers; it is good to know one is not alone.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|Pretty good considering that this movie takes place 85% of the time on a ship.  I thought they did a great job with the digital imaging and with the camera shots displaying the scope of the ships.<br />More importantly, I feel that they did a wonderful job displaying the relationships between men during that time period.  Obsession takes many forms for many different people.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Love Actually is a romantic comedy designed to make you feel good then forget about it right after you watch it.  It follows several people as they pursue love over the Christmas holidays.  All of these characters are somewhat related, but none of their stories really intertwine.<br />With so many stories to tell, it's like the movie shows the climax of several stories at once.  Even though there isn't time to develop characters, that isn't really noticed because the love stories take center stage over the lives involved in the stories.<br />Hugh Grant is the leader of the stellar cast and plays the British Prime Minister who falls for a staffer and gets to cut down the US and its buffoon president (a role in which he makes the US President look like a womanizing fool without paying homage to Clinton or Bush).  Almost every kind of love story is told and the movie magages to hold your interest for the entire two hours.<br />There is a lot of nudity and bad language, so kids shouldn't see this film.<br />This is a charming movie and I recommend it.
0156027321|5.0|Reviewing some of the reviews of this book (currently at about 870 entries), I wonder whether most of us readers really get to the point of this extraordinary novel. Most readers, it seems, have been so charmed by the &quot;survival&quot; story which is at the core of the book - that they too easily forget about the framework. The lifeboat tale is so captivating that you can easily take it as a seperate book. But it is not.<BR>Martel takes his time to introduce the characters at the beginning of the book. Criticized by many, this seemingly slow introduction is indeed crucial for the understanding of the story. Without it, nothing in the book would made sense. This is a book about belief, religion and also - it seems to me - about the ability of mankind of dealing with reality and its dependance on belief for survival.<BR>Ultimately, the key to understanding the whole is to be found on page 417, when Pi tells the second, more believable and dry-sounding story of his journey, and then says: &quot;Solitude began. I turned to God. I survived.&quot; There cannot be much doubt after all about what this means. This is NOT the story of a boy with a couple of animals on a lifeboat. But who ended up with God alone on a lifeboat. <BR>The great thing in this very carefully crafted novel is that you can make up your own mind about what it all &quot;means&quot; for you personally. For me, philosophically speaking, it offers a relatively depressing outlook. But the book is most certainly well worth exploring.
B00006RAKP|3.0|This CD is not one of the best I've heard from Elton. The CD is kind of bland with only a few well known hits, not exactly what I would call a greatest hits CD.He, for the most part, let his fans down with this album. There was never a variance of rhythms or beats in his songs on this album.The tracks sounded as if the lyrics were just changed for each song except for the occasional upbeat song. <BR>  But the CD does have its good parts. It is definetly an excellend CD for those nights when you are driving home and just want something peaceful to listen to. But it could easily put you to sleep. Definetly a good CD while you are trying to sleep as well. This CD is just not up to the caliber we have come to expect for both Elton's CDS and greatest hits CD's. He should have mized his love songs CD with this greatest hits CD. Putting the two of them together may have made this CD purchaseable.
B00012QM8G|5.0|We know this motion picture has been out for some time, it is an outstanding film about World War II and the Holocaust.<br />You are not going to need me to tell you how good this picture is, you should have already seen this. However, if you have not viewed this Picture, then you must see it ASAP. Buy it, rent it, borrow it, get it anyway you can. This is a must see motion picture that is a true story with great acting.
B000066C1N|5.0|While I must give in and confess that it's a movie made for everybody, what really made the flick standout above the rest was how the story was told - through music. Music is a powerful weapon and can add greater emotion to any scene of any movie. If done right, the movie will become an even greater experience after it reaches the climax. Luckily, a good friend of mine had a copy, to which I borrowed for a few days and listened. I came out of the listening sessions with an aching desire to check out more works of Bryan Adams. Bryan Adams, along with Award-Winning composer Hans Zimmer, collaborated to bring the movie to life through music.<br />But before I even speak of the music and how beautiful it can be for the ears, I'll explain the story behind Spirit - Stallion Of The Cimarron. The movie is an animated flick and tells the story of a Kiger mustang named Spirit, who runs wild and free on the Cimarron (New Mexico) wilderness with his family and is determined to make sure they are kept away from enslavement. Unfortunately, a group of soldiers discover and capture Spirit, thus forcing Spirit to be away from his family, as the proud horse is taken to a U.S. Calvary fort, where they attempt to master the proud horse. Sick of seeing his kind being treated in a bad fashion, Spirit escapes the fort with a new goal in mind - to return home and be reunited with his family. Along the way, he encounters new friends and old enemies, not to mention falling for a beautiful paint mare named Rain.<br />Whereas most stories that you see in movies are told through dialogue, the movie's plot is told through a different standpoint - narration. Matt Damon was hired to convey Spirit's thoughts to the audience. Though little dialogue is heard, the music is what really does that talking, as two musicians team up to deliver a solid, heart-wrenching performance, both vocally and musically. <br />Bryan Adams steps up to the plate and creates lyrics that gives the lead character a whole new dimension, adding more feelings on how the mustang feels when he is taken away from his family by strangers he never met in his life or how he feels towards Rain, the love of his live, not to mention his determination in returning home for good. Overall, as far as vocals and lyrics are concerned, Bryan Adams does a brilliant job in moving the audience and getting them surrounded with the atmosphere. <br />So if vocals and lyrics are superb, what about the music? The music is just as uplifting as the two elements combined. Hans Zimmer's role in the entire project felt like magic the moment the movie began.  Hans concentrated more on the orchestration, with Bryan pitching in by using acoustic guitars in several songs that helped to display Spirit's emotions during the flick. The instrumentals are also satisfactory, as they manage to let the atmosphere of that era grab you and take you to a different place. Some of the standout tracks are \\"Here I Am\\", \\"I Will Always Return\\", \\"Brothers Under The Sun\\", and \\"Nothing I've Ever Known\\", just to name a few. Those tracks should be given more than just one listen, since I can recall myself humming the tune for days. <br />In conclusion, this is perhaps one of the best movie soundtracks I've heard in years. It opened up my eyes to Bryan Adams and got me to seek out more of his famous works. It also made me realize that music is just as important than to everything else in a movie - without it, the movie won't succeed on its terms. Yes I know - this movie is a kid's movie and it's for everybody, but who cares? In the end, I tend to listen to music that moves me these days - Spirit did a wonderful job in captivating my soul. If you are an aficionado of music soundtracks, then pick this up. Though the movie was released in 2002, which was two years ago, if you think about it, two years later, the music can still stick to your head and never leave your memories for a while.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|Having not read the book upon which this film is based, I cannot comment on how closely the script followed the source material.  What I can say is that if the book was much like the movie, I'm glad I didn't read it.<BR>The cast is studded with fine actors, especially Jude Law, a personal favorite of mine.  However, \\"Cold Mountain\\" doesn't bring out the best in any of them.  Law's accent falters quite a bit, and his character is emotionally flat.  In all fairness, this is largely the script's fault, but that doesn't make it enjoyable.  Nicole Kidman's performance is passable in the first half, but quickly devolves into extreme over-acting.  Renee Zellweger's incredibly stereotypical character is over-drawn in both script and performance from her introduction.<BR>The real problem though is the script.  This movie has been made hundreds of times- usually better.  The couple has a brief, shallow, and virtually passionless relationship before they are separated for years, and yet they supposedly fall madly in love with one another.  Inman (Law) makes an unbelievable journey populated by stock characters and predictable adventures.  The way events unfolded for him as he travels from point A to B to C, always resulting in some kind of struggle, put me more in mind of a frustrating ten-year-old video game than a masterpiece of dramatic cinema.<BR>Characters in the film are all clearly and unequivocably divided into \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" camps.  While the \\"good\\" characters aren't very original, the \\"bad\\" ones are archetypes of comic book supervillains.  They are so supremely evil they make Hitler look like Lassie.  The \\"Home Guard\\" insanely decides to brutally slaughter anyone they can on the thinnest of pretexts.  This is ridiculous and unrealistic.  After all, everything they believed in was embodied by this small, southern hometown they were trying to protect, yet they went out of their way to destroy it.  A simple sense of self-preservation against the invading Union Army would have been enough of a reason to stay their hands.  The Union soldiers, briefly though they appear, aren't much better.  They attempt to steal food, commit rape, and all but murder an infant on a whim.  Of course these things occurred during the war, but such encounters are so common in war films that they seem hackneyed.<BR>The final mark against \\"Cold Mountain\\" is its incredibly long running time.  If a movie is good, I want it to be long.  But this one was so redundant and overbearing that I couldn't wait for it to end.  Inman basically has too many encounters, each one at its core the same as the last.<BR>This movie has been widely praised by critics and many fans.  Perhaps it is because the book was so well-received and lavished with awards.  If so, that must be clouding the critics' judgment on this awful film.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched this series as it exploded onto the Scifi Channel in the UK and was blown away by the whole thing. Acting, special effects, story lines, script and concept were all completely topclass. Joss Whedon's very uniquely quirky perspective really comes through in the dialogue and I loved it as soon as the first notes of the title song hit my ears.<br />Then much to my despair I find that some hair-brained individual with the about as much vision in his entire soul as a Mole at Fox studios has taken it upon himself to cancel it, no doubt in favour of reality TV, a curse which pervades UK TV as much as it pervades US.<br />It seems to me that the TV companies are determined to make programmes where all our thinking is done for us. By dumbing down television, infesting it with mindless reality programmes that are supposed to give us an insight into ourselves, they are merely hoping to make cheaper programmes that will keep us all occupied and thus make them more profits. I am in the same boat as many, my preference is rapidly leading me to pick up a book more often than I watch the constant diet of excrement that inspires not one single original thought or creative impulse on Television.<br />I have started to hear that a movie is being made, which I look forward to seeing. It is my sincere hope that this will kickstart the series again, because there is no doubt in my mind that it would be well deserved. <br />Good Luck with it Joss.
6304698798|5.0|Just a few remarks about this uniquely memorable film. One reviewer said it was opera. Right! Whoever heard of an opera that wasn't totally implausible and way over the top? It's a kind of comic La Scala, with a deadly cynical undertone. The director isn't directing a story; he's a composer, pulling out every stop in the libretto. Note the litany of crimes that Tuco is about to be hanged for: rape, bigamy, murder, extortion, dealing in prostitution ---- and finally, something really serious: playing cards with a marked deck!!  This tale may be long, and even sort of leisurely in a tense sort of way, but it is never, ever boring. You can't help feeling sorry for the few who don't get it.
0793518326|5.0|I have to marvel at the reactions of many Amazon reviewers to this book.  Here we have an attempt to transcribe nearly every sound put on to record by The Beatles offered at a very fair price and people are giving it one star ratings.  Meanwhile another Hal Leonard offering, The Beatles Complete - Volumes 1 &amp; 2, which is an arrangement for piano, guitar, and vocals bearing little resemblance to the original recordings receives nothing but positive reviews.  I understand that these transcriptions are not wholly accurate and the use of repeats often glosses over subtle variations in the actual recordings, but this is still a work of monumental proportions.  One must not lose sight of the fact that there were no original scores kept with the desired level of accuracy.  Any scores needed to come from transcriptions of the original recordings.  The fact that four musicians were able to sit down and reverse engineer complex studio tracks to this level of detail is impressive.  While these transcriptions are not perfect, they are quite good.  It would be easy to get the impression from reading these reviews that this book was so inaccurate as to be useless.  This is simply not the case.  I have owned this book for over 10 years and still find it remarkably useful.  I have learned a great deal about the construction of pop songs from this book.  I have been able to create my own arrangements using these transcriptions as a starting point.  I have even been able to create reasonable facsimiles of some of the original recordings using these transcriptions in a home studio environment.  I understand 3 and 4 star ratings for this book but anything less than that really seems like an overreaction to me.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|Ok, first things first, Em ain't a racist.  He was a pissed off teen on that song and something was up with his girlfriend (who was black BTW) so of course he'd do something he'd later regret.  If he was a racist would he be in a group full of black people.  Only people who say he's racist are haters, racists against whites, jealous, or blindy follow the gay magazine by the even gayer Benzino \\"The Source\\".  And another thing, Em didn't make D12, he wasn't even an original member.  Proof made it.  <br />On to the review.  The album itself is one of the better albums of 2004 IMO, but not up to par with College Dropout and Death is Certain.  It's also not as good as Devil's night.  There isn't as big of a shock factor in this as there is in Devil's night and some of the songs just get old and boring.  Songs like How Come, Good Die Young, and Get my Gun as well as others keep this a 4 star.  Now onto the Song by Song review.<br />1. Git Up (4/5) As much as some people seem to hate the song and Em's use of a children's song in his lyrics, I think it'd be a good party song.  Good beat and decent lyrics.<br />2. Loyalty  (5/5) One of the better songs on the album IMO.  It features Obie Trice and Everyone rips up their lyrics.<br />3. Just Like U  (5/5)  This is Bizzarre's single but don't let that scare you away.  At first I hated it and the chorus with the kids but I listened to it more and it turned out to be my 3rd favorite song on the album.  lyrics aren't that great but I love the beat and the flow.<br />4. I'll Be Damned (3/5) Decent song, nothing special.  OK lyrics but a good beat.  <br />5. Dude (Skit)  (3/5)  Skit leading up to My Band<br />6. My Band  (4/5)  Everyone's heard this and i got tired of it, but the first time I heard it I thought it was great.  Funny song with Good Lyrics and flow IMO.       <br />7. U R the One (2/5) Worst song on the album IMO.  Talks about girls and stuff and it's not one of D12's trademarks.  They don't really do a good job on this kind of song, stick with the faster paced stuff guys.<BR>       <BR>8. 6 in the Morning   (4/5)  Good song with a good flow, not much to say about it really.<BR>    <BR>9. How Come   (6/5)  Best song on the album IMO.  Talks about Em's beef with Royce and also about Kim.  Serious song with a good beat, flow, and lyrcis.  Rest of D12 tears it up to.<br />10. Leave Dat Boy Alone (4/5)  Good song but the southern drawl doesn't really work for Em.   <br />11. Get My Gun  (5/5) Great song and Funny, Em rips up his verse and the little intermission in the middle is funny.<BR>       <BR>12. Bizarre (Skit) (4/5)  Funny as hell when I first heard it but got old.<BR>       <BR>13. Bitch (5/5) great song and I'm really loving Kuniva's and Kon Artist's verse.<BR>        <BR>14. Steve's Coffee House (2/5) nothing special<BR>        <BR>15. D-12 World (4/5) Produced by Kanye West and its pretty good, not great but not bad either, good listen.        <br />16. 40 Oz. (4/5) Produced by Lil John I think, not sure though.  great party song and the video is great.  Not really feelin Eminem's try at a southern drawl though.  proof has the best verse.<BR>        <BR>17. Commercial Break (4/5) It's a Young Zee freestyle and it's really good.        <br />18. American Psycho 2 (4/5) Feat B-Real of Cypress Hill.  Good song but not as good as part 1.  Em's verse really makes no sense IMO.<BR>        <BR>19. Bugz 97 (5/5) Freestyle from the late, great Bugz formerly of D12.  This freestyle shows why he was an up and coming rapper before getting shot down.  RIP Bugz, you'll be missed.  be sure to pick up his freestyle album coming next week.<BR>        <BR>20. Good Die Young (5/5) 2nd best song.  All of D12 raps cept for Em.  Talking about when Bugz died and how much they miss him.  bizzarre is actually serious and I was really tearing up during Kuniva's verse.<BR>       <BR>21. Keep Talkin (5/5) Old song, a Ja-Rule diss.  Creative and Bizzarre's verse is kinda sick.  Really like it.<br />Well there's my review, 4/5.  Good album but not better than the first but if you liked the first pick this up.
0553208845|5.0|Just like anyone who is growing up, there are questions unanswered and paths that are unsure. Siddhartha, an Indian boy (turning man) who doesn't know just where he fits in, captures this moment in life perfectly. Along his journey he experiments with different groups to find the exact leader who can teach him what he wants to know and needs to know to reach a state of spiritual peace. After abandoning his best friend, he falls head over heals for the lady of his dreams, Kamala, who he thinks can teach him the art of love and forgets everything that he has been searching for. This part of his life brings him to a crossroad where one way, he can be with Kamala for the rest of his life, or go the other road and finish his quest for Nirvana. I don't really want to give away too much more of the plot because that is what makes this story so enjoyable, knowing that he could end up anywhere at any given time.<br /> I personally found this book to be an outstanding read. Only Hermann Hesse could pull off writing a 150 page book that has just as much to say as one three times its size. The writing was descriptive enough to keep your attention but not too descriptive to the point where you lost interest in it entirely (like most authors tend to do). Although we might not all be of the Eastern religion on our search for Nirvana, its still has relevancy to all of our lives in the way that we inevitably become confused on where we are going and what we are doing. Just as Siddhartha did, at the end of our journeys we too will all end up where we are planned to.<br />Although I found this book to be interesting it may not appeal to everyone. It's really lacking in action, and could be fairly slow to anyone who needs a bit of fighting thrown into the mix to pick them up every once in a while. But it definitely makes up for that in style.<br />I definitely recommend this book to everyone. It's a quick and very enjoyable and soothing read. It will keep you thinking about your future as well as keep you hoping to achieve your life goals just as Siddhartha did. Absolutely not a book to read just once, I know I'll come back and enjoy it for many years to come.as well as keep you hoping to achieve your life goals just as Siddhartha did.

0783240503|2.0|If I could somehow take my CD of Joseph and line it up with this video, I would love this video.  Joseph is excellent, but everyone else is only so-so.  Scratch that.  Everyone else is pretty bad.<br />Visually, this was fun to watch.  There's one good part in &quot;Joseph's Coat&quot; where the brothers (I think it's the brothers...) grab the bottom of the coat and twirl it around so the bottom half forms a color wheel of sorts.  The kids running up on stage is creative, but a bit cheesy.  The sets are fantastic, but clearly are designed to keep the movie grounded in its Broadway musical roots.<br />Also, it's difficult to explain in text, but the kids in the audience look dispairingly cheesy.  They have these fake smiles plastered on their faces and generally look dumb.  It would not surprise me to find that the kids choir was originally from a Broadway cast and thus accustomed to overaccentuating any sort of movement.<br />The Narrator is really not very good.  I can't explain why, but it just doesn't work.<br />Potiphar is fairly good, but he spends so much time speaking his lines instead of singing them that you hear very little of what sounded to be an excellent voice.<br />Jacob is weak.  Even if the character is an old man, the part deserves to be a fairly strong singer.<br />The first &quot;Poor, Poor Joseph&quot; (when he was tossed into the pit) was visually very amusing.  Very funny, but the Narrator singing it was still not great.<br />Donny Osmond is really the only character that seems to grasp that the movie should be presented as a movie, not an overly articulated and video-taped Broadway musical.<br />(Please understand that I'm mentally playing through the video as I write this)<br />&quot;Go, Go, Go Joseph&quot; was presented as an interesting disco party.  I'm not sure of the original intentions, but that scene was enjoyable.  The Butler and the Baker however were again let-downs.<br />The French accents in &quot;Those Canaan Days,&quot; although affected by all of the brothers and Jacob, were not very good.  There was a lot of non-French accent creeping in.<br />This video is no substitute for seeing it live.  I've seen it live twice by both a touring company and a local theater and both were far superior to this video.  If you want to listen to the music, I suggest the 1992 Canadian Cast Recording, which also contains Donny Osmond as Joseph.
1592400876|5.0|By Bill Marsano. This charming and useful little (209 pages) book, a surprise best-seller in England, offers short, clear, effective instruction for those who have trouble with punctuation--and a great deal of fun (I laughed out loud at least four times) for those who don't<br /><br />Lynne Truss sneakily addresses the former by way of the latter. She gives the punctuation-abled a lot of laughs at the expense of the punctuation-challenged, quoting signs, instructions and other items that can seem ridiculous--and even have their meanings made obscure or ridiculous--by poor punctuation. She's not mean-spirited about it, but she is pretty clear that although correct punctuation is something many people happily live without, not knowing how to handle apostrophes and commas and a handful of other simple marks is akin to lacking other basic but non-critical skills, such as tying shoelaces and telling time on a clock that has hands instead of digits.<br /><br />Besides--the instructions and explanations take up only about half the book, so now you're down to only about 100 pages. And the pages are small, too. Don't tell me you can't handle this.<br /><br />As for the rest, it's history and anecdote loosely wrapped in light-hearted prose. Truss is British and so is her book, so there will be a few references and locutions that give pause to Americans, but none I think are truly impenetrable. She has delightful stories about famous writers warring over punctuation: George Bernard Shaw hectoring Lawrence of Arabia, for example, and Harold Ross, editor of The New Yorker, at odds with James Thurber. My favorite chapter is on the semicolon, which is also my favorite punctuation mark. Truss quotes Gertrude Stein, who hated both comma (she called it &quot;servile&quot;) and semicolon: &quot;They [semicolons] are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a comma but they are a comma all the same. They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally within them thecomma nature.&quot; I have to hand it to Stein: She did a beautiful job of expressing her loathing and she did it with nothing more than the bare minimum: a pair of periods.<br /><br />I advise reading only one chapter a day, and for two reasons. First, Truss's prose style is occasionally too rich by half (and sometimes ungrammatical). Second, there are only seven chapters, and if you get as much pleasure out of this book as I did, you'll want to make it last.--Bill Marsano, a professional writer and editor, is a devotee of the suspensive hyphen.
B00000JLWW|1.0|The Titanic movie should never have been made. Because no one should remember the Titanic. 1912 (the year the overrated ship sank) was a bored year for America. Nothing much was happening so the papers spent time covering this shipwreck. Six years later the world plummetted into the worst pandemic ever seen---Spanish Influenza.40 Million people died of influenza in that outbreak. Hollywood listen up and make a film about the SI Pandemic. Unlike the Titanic it was important.
6305603847|5.0|pink floyd's dvd of THE WALL is a work of art that will blow the minds of those who watch it out the window. combining music and art was a stroke of genius. most people may not understand it, and probably never will, but the message is simple. BUY THE DVD AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF!!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|It is surprising that this movie calls many to debunk the very quality of the atmosphere and poetic lyricism of its structure by saying that Sophia Coppola essentially doesn't stay in the lines while coloring an original piece of art of her own making.  It never ceases to amaze me how we live in what is supposedly the freest country in the world and yet so many Americans are deathly afraid and even contemptuous of artistic freedom when they find it.<br />Is LOST IN TRANSLATION short on plot?  Yes.  Are several scenes in which the actors portray their characters improvised? Yes.  Are the actors playing real people in real situations making flawed but human choices?  Yes.  And I can't imagine the people who did not like the film for these reasons--the central ones that made me give this movie four stars--enjoying much of anything beyond the standard action movie fare, with its mind-numbing cinematic conventions that are older than dirt and half as exciting.<br />Sophia Coppola--daughter of the master Francis himself--has made a fantastic exploration into human emotion and the depth of human longing and love with this film, in the frame of today's paradoxically plastic and ancient Tokyo.  Scarlett Johansson gives a performance that belies her age, carrying the expressions of emotions that seem to have a wisdom about them in their intensity.  And Bill Murray's work is reminiscent of Miles Davis; understated, cool, ragefully/triumphantly quiet at the perfect times, emotionally detached in his representation of passion and excitement at others.  He deserved the Oscar nomination for this work, as did Sophia for an enigmatic screenplay that deceptively reveals as much realism as any Impressionist piece by Monet or any of the photography of Steichen.<br />You won't need to try and enjoy this movie with an open mind or anything.  Just see it without trying to control it, and watch what happens.  It is sweet--not like candy, but like Peppermint Schnapps; with a bite.  And it is beautiful.it is beautiful.
B0001US8FI|5.0|On the \\"Blood and Steel\\" documentary there should be some unseen footage of Lee on the set of enter shot by Anna Capri on super 8mm.This is the only reason to buy this again if you already have the 25th anniversary edition and Warriors Journey DVD.
B00013F35I|5.0|. . . or as close as you can get on dvd.  If you want to show somebody who's never been to one what a Bruce stadium show is like -- what it's actually like to be there -- you cannot ask for better than this.  I was at two of the Giants Stadium shows in the summer of 2003, and apart from the occasional references to Barcelona and some passing Spanish, it would be hard to tell this show from one in New Jersey.  Except, perhaps, that the overall quality of the performance does not flag for one moment from start to finish.  Play &quot;Badlands&quot;, the big sing-along number, for the initiate, which is followed immediately by &quot;She's The One&quot; with the ferocious backbeat.  Then play BTR, with the awesome reverse pan over the crowd.  The Boss will have a new fan for sure.  <br />As for the sound:  who are the critics kidding?  The sound at stadium shows is univerally atrocious.  The sound here is pretty good by comparison, imo.  No mushy booming bass.  Voices that can actually be heard and, for the most part, understood.  The only Bruce show I ever saw with decent sound was at the Meadowlands in 1980, when he opened the arena (literally), during the River tour.  You can get a sense of it on the Live! 3-disc album, especially the River and Independence Day.  At Giants stadium, by contrast, if you sat far enough back, there was an appreciable delay between the time you saw a motion on stage or the big screen and the time you heard it (that old bugaboo physics, light moves faster than sound); and if you didn't already know the words, you'd have been lost.  The sound on this dvd is far superior to any outdoor Bruce stadium show I've ever seen.  <br />This Barcelona show was so good, it's making me almost like most of the Rising songs.  I wish it had Sandy or Jungleland or Rosie like the Giants Stadium show I saw last July, but it's pretty good anyhow.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|it is malaguena salerosa by chingon(my mistake)...but bill's death song is Navajo Joe by Ennio Morricone....I Lunghi Giorni Della Vendetta which is translated is Long Day of Vengeance is played on Kill Bill I in the anime scene, specifically where the sword goes through O-Ren's father's head...still need help on the song that's on the kill-bill.com site(after you click KILL BILL 2)...it's also played during the Bill and Budd scene...thanks in advance.
B0001CNRS4|1.0|I'm always a bit wary of Amazon reviews because I've gotten some bad ones in the past.  This one tops them all in the &quot;what were you thinking&quot; category.<br />The fact that this movie has a 4 star rating all but makes it impossible to trust the masses.  This movie is so painfully, painfully, awful.  I feel sorry for anyone who subjected themselves, as I did, to this joke.  If I can sway one person from going through the same torture I did maybe it will be worth taking the time to write this.<br />This is the 1st review I've ever written, and I wouldn't normally take the time.  In this case however, I have to make an exception and warn you about the danger of this thing, whatever you want to call it.<br />Sure Jessica is gorgeous, and if you must rent this to look at her, just stare at the cover for awhile.  DON'T WATCH THE MOVIE INSIDE THE CASE!!!!<br />There...  I've done my part.  You have been thus warned.  What you choose to do from here I cannot be held responsible for.  Good luck.
6305897786|4.0|I want to call it an action flick, but the action is pretty restrained. Maybe it could be an apolyptic movie, but it's too secular. Instead, it's what Depp seems to do well: interesting, even exciting, but not very well defined.<br />The plot is straightforward enough: the Mystic Book is out  there, and Depp is tracking it down. He is stalked by agents unknown, death and destruction follow in his path, and I won't spoil the end (not that there are too many credible endings to choose from).<br />This isn't an effects-fest, but Depp holds my interest anyway. He's a lot more believable than most action heroes. For example, his character spends most of his time in libraries, so he's not a physically impressive specimen. Happy to say, he is never called on for feats of superhuman strength. He barely knows which end of a gun to point where - sure enough, his first attempt to act threatening with one fails comically.<br />The one false note was that Depp was always smoking and drinking around the precious books. Smoke if you must, but not where the smoke will settle into the centuries-old paper. Drink all you want, but not where there is the slightest chance of getting even a drop on it. The conservator wannabe in me shuddered every time I saw the movie's disregard for the artifacts.<br />I almost gave it three stars for being an ordinary action movie. I gave it one more star, though, for all the mistakes it doesn't make.
0671027387|5.0|Wow..what a great book this was.  Even though I liked Angels and Demons as well as the Davinci Code, I wasn't expecting to like this book as much as I did.<br />From the prologue, through the first hundred pages, all the way to the very end, I felt as if my eyes couldn't read the words fast enough.  A really great hook that's not fully revealed until more than a fifth through the book, characters that you can't get enough of, and some great action really make this a must read in my opinion. The book is definetly well named!
B00004YKUY|2.0|The only thing I can say to all you Steve A. lovers out there, is that you must never really have gotten into the FEEL of Journey's music.  This stuff has zero feeling to it.  It's cookie-cutter polished garbage for the most part.  Don't get me wrong, some songs are ok, and Steve A. can hit some notes, but that's where it ends.  This CD doesn't move me the way classic Journey did.  The only movement is running to the CD rack to pick something else out to listen to.  <br />And one last thing - if Neal and Jon wanted so much to move on from old Steve Perry, why is it that everything they do is so blatently Steve Perryish?  (albeit done very weakly).  <br />Save your money, and if you don't already own it, buy Captured instead.
B00005JKHN|5.0|This is my favorite of all the animated Disney films..... and I have reasons... it  was the first to be filmed in wide screen.... it was also made with a stereophonic score and it was stylish and artistic, not &quot;cartoon-like&quot;...... this Disney restoration is amazing however, and the film looks like I remember it when I saw it in 1959. The colors are brilliant and clear.... the blue is sky blue and the pink is true rose pink.... and every color has the subtile shades that they should have... obviously reproduced from the exsisting cells and background art in the Disney archives. The additional features are plentiful and fun, and the menus are consistant with the look of the film. There is a game section that uses rock and roll music for an intro and there is a modern interpretation of the main song by a pop group, but these are very minor concessions to modern maids..... on the whole, this is an incredible 2 disc package for anyone who loves the painstaking and time consuming art that these pre-computer animations now use. <br />There are several short subjects, including a biography of Tchaikovsky, &quot;Four Artists Paint a Tree&quot; and &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; which are all pluses and fun to see and take us back to 1959.  <br />Amazing!!
0790729601|4.0|... for &quot;Arnie's Action/Adventure.&quot; There's really not a lot to say after that. He's the good cop among bad cops. He's out to save the leading lady and, incidentally, the free world.<br />Lots of chases, lots of gunfights, lots of action, and the bad guys get their just desserts - just what I signed up for. Vanessa Williams is actually a pretty decent actress, but so good-looking that I had trouble paying attention. A few other lesser characters do their jobs well, and even the corrupt union boss gets to be a good guy.<br />I'll grant a movie three impossible things to get going, but then it should play by its own rules. This one goes slightly over budget. The &quot;EM gun&quot;, the mysterious plot device, launches a metal slug &quot;close to the speed of light&quot; (erk). The slug's impact on the human target picks him up bodily and throws him a dozen meters. For some reason, the slug doesn't just pass through the victim like a BB through butter. Also, its recoil doesn't throw the guy holding the launcher backwards, as I'd expect from an equal and opposite reaction. Well, I learned as much physics from Roadrunner as from Isacc Newton, so I'll let it go.<br />It's an Arnie movie. It's a pretty good Arnie movie. Still, it just an Arnie movie.
B000063WDH|4.0|This is an excellent disc.  For those White Stripes fans out there, the Black Keys-White Stripes debate is not worth getting worked up over.  The Black Keys are a much different band.  And seriously, if you want the low-fi, raw blues sound, you should be listening to the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.  (Yes, music like this was recorded before 1999.)  The Keys or the Stripes are good places to start, but check out JSBX and hear where this low-fi, raw sound really became modernized.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|For a movie that got such a raw deal upon its initial release it has since developed a loyal cult following that has championed the film to the point where the studio execs have allowed writer-director Richard Kelly to release a new Director's Cut this year in theaters.<br />This is a movie that really improves with age. Every subsequent viewing only deepens your understanding of the movie and makes you appreciate the complexity of Kelly's narrative. There is a lot going on in this film and every time I've seen it, I've noticed something new or seen something that made me think about it in a different way.<br />I first noticed Jake Gyllenhaal in October Sky and was immediately captivated by his performance in that film. He has since produced a fascinating output and diverse body of work. His performance in this movie is nothing short of excellent. He starts off as a confused teenager but Gyllenhaal gradually shows that there is so much more to this character than meets the eye. Is he crazy? Is he some kind of mad prophet? A time traveler? A visionary? A mixed up kid? All of the above? It's quite a soulful, thoughtful performance that is also funny and heartbreakingly tragic.<br />The whole cast is top notch: from ER's Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore to the always reliably Jena Malone and a surprise turn from Patrick Swayze playing a slimy Infomercial guru. More importantly, Donnie's family is so well cast, including Mary McDonnel as his mom and Holmes Osborne as his dad and, of course, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Donnie's sister (and also Jake's real-life one). They really feel and act like a genuine family with all of the little behavioural nuances.<br />As for the DVD, well, if you had any questions as to what it all means, listen to Kelly's audio commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal. While he doesn't explain everything, he does examine a lot of the themes and does fill in some of the gaps. This is one of the best audio commentaries out there for that simple fact. Best of all, he points out all kinds of images that were buried in the background that you don't notice the first few times. For example, as Donnie rides his bike home at the beginning of the film, Frank drives by him in his car. Or, the bunny motif that pops up throughout the movie. It is these attentions to detail that really give this film an added complexity and I'm very appreciative of Kelly for drawing attention to them in his commentary track.<br />The cast commentary is more of a free-for-all but fun to listen to and the many deleted scenes are very interesting to watch and fill in a few more gaps. It should be interesting to see how many of these are put back into the Director's Cut.<br />This is an incredibly original film that never insults your intelligence.

0792839730|4.0|This is a terrific film in many ways.  It is not entirely accurate in places (Redford crosses the river bravely, not the British)... it also suffers from an overblown and, at times, tedius repetitive &quot;military march&quot; music score that seems inappropriate for the scenes now and again..... HOWEVER.... it is truly entertaining, moving, and it is accurate enough to show how truly tragic war can be. The acting is first rate, especially the British actors, the Americans also turn in some fine parformances, particularly Gene Hackman.... the only weak performance is by Ryan O'Neil, who looks terrific, but seems too young for the part he plays and tends to walk through his part with one blank and static expression.<br />I did enjoy this film though, great action shots, superior sets, props, costumes, and gorgeous photography. Overall the film is a moving tribute to some very brave and heroic men in a fierce battle... and the battle scenes are amazing and vivid.<br />The look of my DVD is VERY GOOD. The print is not without flaws, but it is clear and clean and the sound is fully stereophonic. It is presented in true widescreen and the color was very natural. It is nearly 3 hours long and I had no trouble with my player reading the second layer smoothly. I would give this print and transfer an 8 out of 10. <br />This DVD is not expensive, and its well worth the money for anyone who enjoys great world war 2 films... and this rates among the best of those concerning the European Theater. A fine DVD and a wonderful evening of entertainment.
0671027387|5.0|Dan Brown keeps the plot moving at a blistering pace. The set up time for the next action sequence is short. The pause in action is just right, he gives the reader only enough time to catch his breath and then blasts off again. He does not get bogged down in endless sub-plots like Tom Clancy tends to do (although Clancy's plots are more plausible). You don't have to skim through Dan's book to try and pick out only the good stuff. In fact you don't want to miss a single sentance. It is all good.<br />I recommed it to anyone who is looking for a good thrill.
B00005JMEW|5.0|It's got fighting, interesting story, briliantly shot, outrageously violent, and amusingly funny. I remember rolling on the floor laughing when the limbs were flying and overthetop blood was flowing out like a firehose. It's intentionally exagerated, and this film, I will say, that it occomplished it's goal. \\"Kill Bill\\" centers on an assassin named only as the Bride (Uma Thurman), who was shot in the head on her wedding day by the mysterious Bill. Four years later, the Bride wakes from a coma to find out she's not only lost four years of her life, but also her child (she was pregnant at the time of the shooting). So she sets off in her quest for revenge, her quest to kill Bill. But before she can get to Bill, the Bride must first get through Bill's Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Let the body count begin baby yeah!!! Sorry I'm a gore hound. Anyway, the Bride exacts her revenge on anyone that gets in her way, we quickly realize that \\"Kill Bill Vol. 1\\" is a movie made by Tarantino for Tarantino. Body parts fly across the screen with glee. Buckets of blood spurt out of body stumps. And heads roll (haha...pun) all over the film. At the end of \\"Vol. # 1,\\" we're left with a great cliffhanger that makes you crave more. More blood, more action, come on let's go, this isn't finished yet. With this unusual introduction, it leaves the viewer wanting to see the next one, and that is good film making. Getting the viewer involved, entertained, and wanting more. This is gold.
B00003XACV|5.0|WOW WOW WOW WOW! <br />trust me....this albumn is far from disapointing.....<br />just listen on your own, picture the scenes from the film... and it will send you away on a magical adventure!
0743216458|5.0|This is one of the best books i have ever read in my life. It was wonderful from start to finish. I felt like i connected to these boys from Tocca training camp to the harsh winter at Bastonge. I felt there pain, there joy and all the other feelings these guys went through on there journey through WWII in the best light infantry unit in the world, Easy Company. If you havent read this book, buy it, its worth the money.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The guy at the top of the review list doesn't know s*** about s*** when he says MTV only plays him because he is white.  FAAAAAA!!!  First of all, paying attention to MTV in the first place is a qualification for not knowing what you're talking about, so basically---&gt;you've got problems.  Second...Eminem no skill? FAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!  Rhyme faster and better and with more variation in rhythm than he does....all while making it sound good, then hit me back buddy;).  Stop watching &quot;Cleaning out my Closet&quot; videos on TRL and go listen to Em's music (before he was &quot;HI! My name is...&quot;).  This is not to say his new material isn't good, but there seems to be a misconception among TRL-neo-junkies like yourself about Eminem's message and roots.  Thirdly...the Marshall Mather LP has the power to knock you the **** out with tracks like Kim and the Way I Am....seriously good music, not deservant of sub-intellect reviews.
B00008ADPF|2.0|Nickelback's The Long Road, the follow up to their previous hit album Silver Side Up, sounds as if it came to soon. The Long Road does have its highlights with the radio staples &quot;Someday&quot; and the raunchy Figured YOu Out,but when it comes to the rest of the album there's nothing there. Most of The Long Road sounds like their using the same song over and over, most of the performances are unispired and dual. A major disappointment when compared to Silver Side Up.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Having watched &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; several years ago and not liking it too much, Quentin Tarantino's films weren't too prominent on my radar screen until this film came along.  I would have to say that &quot;Kill Bill Volume 1&quot; has raised my opinion of his film making talents quite significantly.  This film is one that defies all the norms in an action film for me in that normally, for me to consider an action/revenge film to be a very good one there has to still be a fairly decent plot behind it.  Don't get me wrong here, this film has a &quot;decent&quot; plot behind it, it's just not one of great depth in so much that it is merely, &quot;they tried to kill me, I lived, now it's time to hunt them down and kill them.&quot;  It is that unorthodox script that leans heavily on corny and campy dialogue that makes it that much more entertaining.  Fair warning to those weak in the stomach though as the film also relies on a heavy amount of unrealistic gore that might turn even the strongest of stomachs. <br />Performance wise, Uma Thurman is perfect for this role, simply put, the tall and exceedingly beautiful blonde kicks some serious rear end in this film.  Other Tarantino favorites show up in this film such Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah and David Carradine, all performing extremely well in their respective roles.<br />Also worth mentioning is the score/music for the film, primarily produced by &quot;The RZA.&quot;  Between the score and some of the music provided by a band of three Japanese women known as The 5, 6, 7, 8's, all combine to further enhance the experience of this film.<br />The Premise:<br />As stated above, the premise for this film is pretty straight forward; Uma Thurman plays &quot;The Bride or Black Mamba,&quot; a former member of the Viper hit squad that wanted out but they didn't want her to go so they attempted to kill her but she only ended up in a coma.  Four years later, she's out of the coma and she wants her revenge...  What follows from there is a great action flick that touches on several genres besides the revenge film that leans heavily on Japanese sword happy action flick.<br />I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of films of this type and would also suggest it to those who, like me, might've passed on Tarantino films in the past; this film experience is well worth it.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-The Making of &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 1&quot;<BR>-Bonus Musical Performances by &quot;The 5, 6, 7, 8's&quot;<BR>-Quentin Tarantino Movie Trailers
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a good show, actually it's a great show. But then again, a lot of people say so. In fact they're probably right and I wouldn't disagree. <br />  First off, the writing is for the most part solid. All the character's have interesting quirks that pull and suck you in their world. For example, the genius/pyshic River Tam, on the run from the Alliance. Captain Mal Reynolds, a man hollowed out by war and loss, but still manages to get himself in trouble, with help from his crew members. Jayne Cobb, the crude and greedy mercenary, with a strange sense of loyalty. Inara Serra, the beautiful and mysterious Companion with a hidden past. Kaylee Frye, the joy and innocence of Serenity. Zoe, war veteran and steadfast first mate. Wash, the pilot; humor and dinosaurs abound. Simon Tam, the doctor, getting a glimpse of the real world for the first time. And Shepherd Book, a preacher with more secrets than a man of the cloth should have.  It's the world of Firefly, of Serenity. A great mixture of the old west with scifi elements.  <br />  The plotting is excellent, the stories again pull you in and never let you go. Firefly was smart, making you think about certain themes represented in the show, freedom, loyalty, and survival to name a few. Things that matter. The acting was fantastic, Joss Whedon couldn't have cast any better actors and actresses for the show. Firefly has memorable performances from Adam Baldwin, Nathan Fillion, and especially new comer, Summer Glau. Morena Baccarin, Alan Tudyk, Ron Glass, Jewel Staite, and Sean Maher were also a joy to watch.   <br /> The show had enough scifi elements, but at the same time remain realistic to some laws of science. The only thing that I didn't like that it was ended too soon before it's time. Had it been given time, better handle promotional wise, and a better timeslot; I am postive the show would flourished as it still continues to do so in the fandom. Just as Mr. Whedon's other shows became cult favorites, Buffy TVSand Angel. My only consolation is that I look forward in 2005 for the Universal motion picture, Serenity, featuring the whole cast from the show. And that it'll make Fox realize the gold mine it lost in canceling the show. I recommend the DVD set for anyone, the first episodes move slightly slow, according to some first viewers, but I assure you that it's worth your time and money, even though you might have to save up for it. Firefly was an example of Big Damn Good Tv, lost among the sea of filth of reality tv. A Big Damn Loss, make sure it isn't yours.
0920668372|5.0|This story was read to the children of our church during their time with the pastor on Mother's Day. He has read the same story every year since the book was published. It reduced the congregation to tears and no mother had a dry eye. It is one of the most beautifully powerful, yet simple, stories I have heard since The Giving Tree. It is purely about unconditional love. Nothing more.
0375751513|4.0|This book offers its readers a  chance to understand the meaning of true beauty and the reason why time passes the way that it does.  If you enjoy really good quotes that make you think, this is a great book for you.  It made me think of ideas and concepts that I had never thought about before.  Some reviews of novels say they could &quot;never put the book down.&quot;  But what happens when the book is over and it goes on the shelf? I would like to hope that, with this book, the wheels in my head will keep turning, and I will continue to think about the concepts it brought up, and apply it to my own life.  I think you will do the same if you read this novel by Oscar Wilde
0316096199|4.0|Lucky is author Alice Sebold's autobiographical account of the violent, brutal rape she experienced at the end of her freshman year at Syracuse University.  The first ten pages describe what Sebold recalls of the rape, which very effectively allows the reader to get a sense of young Alice's experience.  What follows is a detailed account of what happened next, from Alice's initial reporting of the rape and medical care to the reactions of her family and friends to the eventual trial of her rapist.  Sebold tells her own story in the same detached, unemotional narration which she utilized in her novel, The Lovely Bones, yet as with that book, the emotions clearly shine through her simple prose.  At one point, Sebold shared the following observation:  &quot;I was learning that no one--females included--knew what to do with a rape victim.&quot;  As the book continues, it is obvious that this statement applies even to Alice herself, as she struggles to figure out what to do.  Although she calls herself a &quot;successful rape victim,&quot; Sebold is unable to escape the traumatic effects common to so many survivors of this crime.<br />As a psychologist, I believe that some rape survivors might find support and optimisim in Alice's story, whereas others may be unable to relate to her particular experiences.  As a reader, I wanted to know more about how Alice ended up; to me, Sebold's 10-page &quot;Aftermath&quot; section seemed to be a rushed, inadequate conclusion to Alice's compelling story.  However, I still found this book to be a worthwhile read, especially given that I agree with Sebold's basic premise that one can experience horrible events yet still be blessed--I feel Lucky too.
0375703764|4.0|This postmodern, typographically chaotic novel is a monstrous book, both in page numbers and ambition.  It is the literary equivalent of &quot;The Ring.&quot;  As we learn in the introduction, Johnny Truant, a tattoo parlor employee, has come into possession of a trunk full of bizarre scraps of paper once owned by an old blind man, Zampano, now dead.  The papers comprise an exploration of a cult film called &quot;The Navidson Record&quot; and its sub-films,  documentaries about an ever-expanding house that's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside and which consumes the lives of anyone who enters its dark hallways or watches the tapes.  Johnny becomes himself obsessed with Zampano's papers and, in turn, with the Navidson house.  He is haunted by the beast he smells and the descending madness he had no inclination to stop.  The book itself is the melding of Zampano's papers, Johnny's footnote digressions into his own life and its troubles, and the debate among academics as they struggle to make sense of a film that probably never existed.  The result is a dark, wild, often hilarious, sometimes excruciatingly boring foray into the meaning of home, family, love, and self.<br />The structure of the novel is innovative, with Johnny Truant's story unfolding in footnotes  and in the appendices, while Zampano describes the film and the academics bicker over its meaning in the body.  The most riveting narrative thread in this novel is of Navidson's and others' descents into the smooth walled, dark cavern of the mysterious hallway.  The consequences on Navidson's marriage and on those he loves are devastating, and the reader is swept into both the horror and the need for hope.  Johnny's story is less compelling, especially as the house fades into the background and his story takes over.  The academic over-analysis is tons of fun - as long as you have the patience to get over the dryness to find the kernel it has been working toward.  For example, early in the book, Danielewski (in the writings of Zampano) provides a lengthy academic discussion of the myth of Echo and its scientific and literary significance, only to derail it with a Johnny Truant footnote telling the reader that &quot;Frankly I'd of rec'd a quick skip past the whole echo ramble were it not for those six lines . . .&quot;<br />Even more bizarre than the telling of Truant's tale in footnotes is the typographical methods used to visually evoke the house in the Navidson Record.  The words become their own labyrinth, with &quot;hallways&quot; of text enclosed in blue boxes; they sometimes inhabit corners only, or skip up and down the pages, one or two words at a time.  When the characters don't know which way is up, the reader is twisting and turning the physical book to read upside down and sideways.  You have to see the book to fully appreciate the visual hijinks Danielewski uses.  It can take a long time to read certain sections, only to find that you can flip through several pages with just a glance at each.<br />Despite the suspenseful plot, HOUSE OF LEAVES is anything but a quick read.  Its satisfaction is derived more from its individual parts than as a whole since it ends, to paraphrase T. S. Eliot, not with a bang but a whimper.  I recommend this for patient readers and for those who delight in experimental turns in fiction.Danielewski (in the writings of Zampano) provides a lengthy academic discussion of the myth of Echo and its scientific and literary significance, only to derail it with a Johnny Truant footnote telling the reader that &quot;Frankly I'd of rec'd a quick skip past the whole echo ramble were it not for those six lines . . .&quot;<br />Even more bizarre than the telling of Truant's tale in footnotes is the typographical methods used to visually evoke the house in the Navidson Record.

B000021Y77|4.0|In Tom Tykwer's film, Run Lola Run, we are confronted with a main character that struggles to find her place between the two distinctions of feminist and feminine.  The film, which is segmented into three different scenarios, starts off by portraying Lola as a female hero.  She breaks the stereotypes, and does not reflect the Hollywood ideal of a female heroine.  Her clothes are ragged, her hair is a mess, and worst of all, she does not glisten but actually sweats.  The Hollywood heroine, on the other hand, would be wearing high heels in all of the fight scenes, never break a sweat, and always be sexy and perfectly put together.  The cinematic gaze, as refered to by film theorist, John Berger, depicts her as a super human action hero.  She can see the future, run far distances in almost no time, and she has the power to change certain events in time.  The cinematic gaze is usually used to objectify women.  In Run Lola Run, however, it is used to set Lola apart, and show what a woman can be capable of.  Tykwer's progressive feminist representation of Lola falls prey to stereotypical femininity in the last scenario.  Mani, her small time crook of a boyfriend, whose life she is trying to save, comes through in the clutch. He does not even think of what Lola has gone through in an attempt to help him.  Tywker ends the film with the man saving the day.  This strays from his critique of \\"the Hollywood heroine\\" that had been a blaring message in the first two scenarios.  All of Lola's efforts have been trivialized and she is shown as powerless and speechless.  Mani acts as if he had the entire situation under control the entire time, and reduces Lola's role to that of merely a supportive and concerned girlfriend. The film ends with a segmented shot of Mani and Lola's interlocked hands.  This is a perfect example of Foucault's idea of the micro physics of power.  Ingeborg Majer O'Sickey includes this idea in her discussion of Barbie Magazine.  It refers to the manner in which a body can be fragmented into discrete parts in order to display power.  In this last scene in Run Lola Run, the fragmented shot of their clasped hands, turns Lola into a powerless and submissive girlfriend. She no longer is able to be defined independently.  Mani does not need her, he simply has her a a trophy to be displayed.  This movie shows us that as far as we think we are progressing as an equal society whith women who are respected, we have a lot of work to do.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Actually, &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; could have been an ordinary romantic comedy.  The story is not a surprising one, because it is a romantic comedy, of which ending we all know before the film starts.  But the point is, it is an enjoyable, and in a sense, quite a unique film thanks to the two great leads -- Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson.  And greatness in that order.<br />Jack Nicholson's chracter Harry is a successful businessman who made his fortune in music industry.  He is 63 years old, but makes it a rule to date only a girl below a certain age, like, 20.  And now, he is happily having a fun with beautiful Marin played by Amanda Peet.<br />But now, in a quiet seaside house, he meets someone who might or might not make him bend the golden rule of dating.  Interestingly, it is the last person Harry himself expected to fall in love with ... Erika, who happens to be Marin's mother.<br />The comlication goes on when Keanu Reeves's character as a dosctor steps in, but &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; belongs strictly to these experienced veterans who know how to infuse the life into the formulaic characters written by director Nancy Meyers.  In spite of the predictable nature of the story, she knows the way to induce the stars to deliver the best as in &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; or &quot;What Women Wants,&quot; and it is a pure delight to see the talented actors doing what they can.<br />In fact, Diane Keaton, even about 25 years after her Annie Hall, shows the natural charms that would convince us that a mature woman like her can easily enchant guys like Jack Nicholson, and some would be amazed at her decision to let the film include (brief) nudity.  Speaking of nudity, Jack also reveals some part of his body in a hospital, in a quite hilarious (or to some, embarrassing) way.  Still, he is thesame Jack Nicholson, which means he lost none of his charisma even in his 60s.<br />The supports include Frances McDormand and Jon Favreau, but unfortunately, their characters are virtually forgotten in the second half of the film, as if cut from the final version to make room for Keaton and Nicolson.  It is quite regrettable that we miss the conversations between Diane and Frances as sisters, which would be another fun to hear.<br />Like &quot;What Women Want,&quot; this romantic comedy is sustained by the leading actors' pleasing and deft performance.  It is simply a delight to watch them Keaton and Nicholson.
B00006IU73|5.0|In the past few years, my long-dormant interest in progressive rock has been rekindled by a spate of masterful releases from all over the prog map. In Absentia is one CD that was originally recommended to me as I began to build a modern prog CD library. Though Porcupine Tree was unfamiliar to me, I bought it without hesitation and liked it instantly. But since I was acquiring so much new music and there was so much to digest, it sat in my rack forgotten until recently.<BR>Occasionally, I go through my CDs to see what I hadn't heard in a while. Recently, I did that and when I spied this, I grabbed it and put it on. I liked it so much this time around that I played it for days on end. There is not much more I can add to all the hosannahs already showered on this recording. I like the whole thing. My favorites are the hard-driving Blackest Eyes, Trains, the Crosby, Stills, and Nash-like harmonies of Lips of Ashes, The Sound of Muzak, Wedding Nails, and Heartattack in a Layby. <br />Steven Wilson and company show with this release that they merit a place in the upper echelons of the prog genre. These guys are nuanced, they explode where necessary but they can also play with the most exquisite precision and delicacy where the song demands it. Porcupine Tree definitely sets a new prog-rock standard with In Absentia. I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in progressive rock or to the merely musically adventurous. You won't be sorry you bought it.
B000148KK2|4.0|A departure, but a welcome one.  It's brave of her not to give in to following a proven formula, and experiment with other formats, especially in a time where singing standards seems to be the surefire way to make it (could list several of the fresh crop of artists here).  Rather than simply filling an album with empty but catchy tracks, she has stressed harmonic and lyrical content, resulting in a record that keeps on giving - I find something new in it at each listen.  Plus, her piano-playing is far better than the previous albums, almost (though not quite) coming close to seeing her live. I'm witholding one star for some of the Krall/ Costello compositions that sound somewhat awkward as performed by Diana, but I have high hopes for their future collaborations.
B000066C87|2.0|The good news is that the movie had a good cast,the bad news,the story itself.I was upset Helen Mirren wasn't given more time in the movie.When it came to the sex scenes,watered down.The police detective in the movie is even worse than Peter Sellers charcater in the Pink Panther movies.I even had a hard time getting into the story.Only the Cazalets had the best sex scenes and there are other British movies with better storylines.

0064400557|5.0|Charlotte's Web is perhaps the best piece of children's literature that I have read to date.  I won't rehash the plot here, as many reviewers have done that already (and most of us know it, anyway). Instead, I will say that Charlotte's Web has what most children's books lack now, and that is a true literary quality.  Most of what is marketed to children is dumbed-down, non-thematic, twaddle.  Charlotte's Web avoid's all of those pitfalls.  Instead, the prose is lyrical in it's simplicity.  It has strong themes that deal with death in the real world, and growing up and beyond childish things.  None of the characters are 'bad', but rather it is fate that is fought, the fate of a pig destined for Christmas dinner.<br />For parents who are seeking something meaningful in their child's literature, and especially for parents who are looking to accustom their children to good, wholesome literature (instead of twaddle), Charlotte's Web will fit the bill perfectly.  Homeschooling parents, and all who enjoy expanding their children's vocabularies, will also appreciate the many words that are used and defined throughout the story.<br />And, lest I forget the most important issue of a review, my five year old boy LOVED this book.  He's still talking about it some time after we finished reading it.  Parents concerned about the death of Charlotte should give some thought to whether or not their child is ready to have that included in the story.  My five year old wasn't particularly disturbed by it.  My feeling is that most wouldn't be, however, very sensitive children might do better to wait a year or two more.
B0000648WZ|5.0|The few connections to Heinlein's book were well done (the political idea that citizenship should be earned, not doled out based on where you happen to be born; the lack of body image taboos...).  I've read all but a couple of Heinlein's oldest works, and where the movie exerted some effort it did a fair job of representing his views.<br />But the movie doesn't really connect to the book very much, does it?  What this movie is, is a Die Hard-esque romp through space with lots and lots of action, some overacting worthy of Shatner and Takei, and heroism like you'd see in a comic book.  Fun, lot's of fun.<br />My only quibble is with the choice of what scenes to delete.  The DVD's deleted scenes included two Carmen scenes (one with Rico, another with the pretty-boy pilot) that added some depth to her character, and would have changed the audience's reaction when she got in trouble later.
0060730552|4.0|&quot;Touching the Void&quot; was very well written.  The story itself is compelling and the man who lived it (Joe Simpson) is a perfect example of how the human spirit transcends even the body's own limitations.  However, I completely agree with the other reviewers who said that it was written using far too much detail.  You really should brush up on your mountaineering knowledge prior to reading the book.  Look at pictures of crevasses and mountaineering gear so that you'll better be able to picture Joe's narrative descriptions.  Because Joe constantly mentioned every single little movement he made and the accompanying emotions that went with it, the book drags a bit throughout. That said, it was the (at times) painfully micro-attention to detail that ultimately made this book compelling.  By the end, I was on the edge of my seat while my heart felt like it was pounding a mile a minute. The epiloque should have or could have explained the fate of Simon Yates a bit more.  Overall, this was a great book!!
0312995423|2.0|This book was very disappointing! My friend, who happens to live in Seville, recommended it with rave reviews. But, as I was reading it, the characters and the plot became very unbelievable, if not ridiculous. The main character, supposedly one of the smartest people in the country, came across as totally clueless and extremely slow witted in most situations.     Also, the way Brown described the cathedral and the tower of Giralda in Seville was way off! It does not have stairs leading to the top, it has RAMPS! When it was first built they used to ride horses to the top of the cathedral tower, so they built it with ramps instead of stairs, and as you walk up the ramps, it is impossible to see below becauase the middle is not hollow. I know, I walked to the top of it! Look it up on WIKIPEDIA.     In any event, the book is a disappointment and I would not recommend it to anyone with an IQ above 95.

B000089QEN|3.0|This was a much touted mini-series which I missed on TV and  have now watched on DVD. I had high expectations. They were not realized, but by no means can one say that the show is a failure or even a waste of time. No urge to fast-forward here....<br />Yet..... there is a flatness about the whole production that keeps the emotions, the humor, at arms length.  Becky Sharp remains the same, looks the same, inflects the same from beginning to end.  The direction reveals no development, no nuance..... certainly charming rapaciousness is more varied than we are shown here. The script is not particularly memorable.<br />BBC production values are top-notch except in the repeated use of extreme closeups to mask a penny-pinching budget..... the Belgium battle segments are particularly cheesy...... but overall, things are shot handsomely, and some visual commentary is downright witty e.g., pigs crossing the frame as we approach the Crawley manor. The music score, hilarious and anachronistic, is rather refreshing.<br />This is nowhere as exhilarating a show as the BBC's Pride and Prejudice. Which leads me to the odd realization that perhaps the better writer for Vanity Fair would have been Balzac.  Now.... why doesn't somebody do something with his stuff..... Lost Illusions, for example.  There we have meatier stuff.
0689835604|5.0|When our daughter - now 28 months - was much younger, we starting saying \\"where's your belly button?\\"  We thought it was so cute that she would point to it, or lift her shirt to show everyone.  <br />Unfortunately now our daughter seems to be almost obsessed with it.  She sucks her finger and plays with her belly button when she's bored, tired, etc.  It doesn't help that it's a little bit of an \\"outie.\\"  Now we tell her to leave it alone, but it does no good. \\"sigh\\"<br />Just beware of making too big of a deal about the body parts! LOL
B00006CXXU|1.0|I bought this album on thinking there would be Great singing as on her self titled Album.Instead I found poorly written music a lot of shouting and only one really good song with a singer and that's &quot;Its Impossible&quot;.&quot;Beautiful&quot;Is a good message but the music isn't up to it.This isn't a good &quot;Listening To&quot;Album this is performing on stage music.I love Christina's Great Voice.This is not up to the Quality of music she should be singing.I understand she strained her Vocal Chords well this album is certainly why she did&quot;Its a whole lot of shouting going on&quot;.I sent my &quot;Stripped&quot; Album to file 13 as Trash.But I'll continue to listen to Christina Self titled Album and hope her next work will do more to showcase her Great Voice if she has one left after all this shouting on Stripped.
0375758992|3.0|For some time I've heard many good things about DON'T LET'S GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHT, Alexandra Fuller's memoir of growing up in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) circa 1970's in the midst of civil war and political instability. As a result I didn't hesitate to search for a copy for myself to enjoy. I was enthralled by Fuller's ability to make the wild African landscape come alive with its varied smells, touches and sights. There were many passages in which I felt transported to the Rhodesian rugged and often-inhabitable landscape. But I became increasingly saddened how Fuller's narrative revealed her family's poor treatment and racist attitudes towards Africans. The structure of this memoir enabled Fuller to include retrospective thoughts about her childhood and how her family, especially her mother, continued to possess racist attitudes towards Africans. Her failure to address these concerns bothered me immensely. The history of Rhodesia is rifted with decades of minority white rule and violence towards Africans who stood up for their rights. Only recently have Africans been granted land rights as they are entitled and whites have been asked to leave. It is indeed sad that Fuller never made friends with native Rhodesians (except her family's servants, of course) and that her vision of Africa includes only non-human qualities. What a world she missed out on. I really wanted to like this memoir but the racism and bigotry left me with a sour taste in my mouth. 2.5 stars.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|\\"Master and Commander\\" is a beautifully photographed epic with characters worth our sympathy and an epic story that doesn't rely too heavily on plot manipulation. It's an old-fashioned, exciting, smart movie.<br />Russell Crowe turns in another great performance, up there with his work in \\"LA Confidential\\" and \\"The Insider\\" (I didn't care for his Maximus in \\"Gladiator\\"). As Capt. Jack Aubrey, Crowe exudes authority and often explodes with unexpected wit (I love the joke about the lesser of two evils). He is more than enough reason to see this movie.<br />Paul Bettany is also terrific as Dr. Stephen Maturin, Aubrey's more intellectual friend/advisor. Why both of these guys failed to pick up at least an Oscar nomination is beyond me.<br />The movie is enjoyable, well written and tautly directed. Why doesn't it rate higher than 3 stars? Because, in the end, it feels a little too Hollywood, a little too formula, a little too \\"safe.\\" This isn't exactly the edgiest of movies, and I have no argument with \\"The Return of the King's\\" Best Picture win. This is a fine movie, but wow, it's so very conventional.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I went into Big Fish with high hopes. I love Tim Burton movies. He has an amazing imagination, which is lacking in many directors today. Directors like Roland Emmerich, Renny Harlin, and of course the big one, Michael Bay. These directors only use special effects and big explosions, while the story gets lost. Meanwhile Burton's genius is that his beautiful visuals compliment his stories. So as the curtains rose, and the theater went dark I was overcome by a childish glee. Then to my disdain, the lights came back on, then went on, and off about 15 more times before the movie finally started. But what a movie it ended up being.<br /> Big Fish tells the story of a young man trying to sort out the facts and lies that his father has been telling him for his whole life. As the story opens Will Bloom (Crudup) hasn't spoken to his father in almost three years. He got tired of listening to his tall tales, but when he gets a call from his mother (Lange) telling him that his father doesn't have much time he rushes down as a latch ditch effort to learn the facts about his father. Albert Finney plays Edward Bloom, a man nearly confined to his bed, trying to get his son to accept who he is. The majority of the film is told through flashbacks, showing the amazing life that young Edward Bloom (Mcgregor) has lived. From giants to circus, from war to salesman, the film gives you the glimpse of a life as Bloom sees it. Is it true? Is he lying? Or is he embellishing the facts? Who knows and who cares.<br /> The actors in this movie shine. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are absolutely charming in this movie. You want to believe his stories, and you can see why others do. The convincing shed their accents and pick up a southern accent without you really noticing. Other notable performances include Jessica Lange and Helena Bohnam Carter. But another surprise would have had to be Lohman. This was the first movie I had seen her in, and I was amazed. She is extremely talented and even withthe limited screen time she was given manage to catch my attention. <br /> Now on to the inevitable visuals. Everyone knows of Tim Burtons visuals. Heck he has made it a trade mark., now known as Burtonism. This movie surprised me in the aspect that although very visual, it was the least of all his movies. What stood out to me? Well the town of Spectre along with the path to get there. It was a beautiful town, which represented Heaven on earth. Another notable section was the circus, where time froze while Ed Bloom saw the women of his life. The screenplay by John August captures the beauty of Daniel Wallace's book while expanding on it. The screenplay looked tailor made to be directed by Tim Burton. Which brings us to the score which was beautifully written by Danny Elfman. I have gotten so used to his dark and moody scores that I forgot how brilliant and light some of his scores can be. This is one of the best, compliments the movie perfectly.<br /> So when the lights came back on after the movie was over I was smiling. My imagination was just blown away again by Tim Burton.    I was talking about the movie with a few friends after we got out of the theater and they noticed the same reaction from the audience as with me. I remembered being afraid when I sat down originally because it was the late showing and the audience consisted of teens. I was expecting a lot of dumb comments but they were as blown away as I was. Even now a few months later as I watch it on dvd I still can't stop smiling at how much I like this movie. This is a movie for everyone.
0743454529|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is a thought-provoking story that is truly original and cements Picoult as a master in her own league.<br />A young girl is made to accept adult situations as a child and is expected to take on the responsibility of &quot;keeping&quot; her sister alive and well. This pressure manifests itself and is the plot for this explosive story. The family bears the brunt of the fall out. You must read this to see what happens when it's all said and done!
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card is a genius.Ender's game is a great book and never slows down.this is more exciting than harry potter and his dark materials.this is a great read even if you are not a sci-fi fan
B00007BKVC|5.0|This is definately Ridley Scott's best film to date.  Thema and Louise may be one of the most popular chick flicks, but you do not have to be a woman to like it.  This film is the absolute perfect movie to watch with your best friend.  The way that Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis take you into the lives of these two friends is amazing.  On their jouney they encounter lots of characters including a perverted truck driver, and a young drifter played by Brad Pitt.  The movie all in all is good, and I would definately give it two thumbs way way up.
B00008US8R|4.0|I LOVE this CD! It took a while to grow on me, but now I love it! Amy Lee's voice is just amazing. It sounds so pure and angelic. Below I rated all of the songs on Fallen.<br />1. Going Under - 4/5<BR>I love this song but i loved it more two months ago. This song gets  really old fast. Amy's voice is great though! <br />2. Bring Me To Life - 4/5<BR>Again, I kinda got sick of this song too...but's its still a good song.<br />3. Everybody's Fool - 5/5<BR>I never used to like this song, but now I LOVE it! I can relate to the lyrics.<br />4. My Immortal - 4/5<BR>This is a VERY sad song. I almost cry whenever I hear this song (yeah, yeah, i know, I'm a wimp), but seriously, the lyrics are so deep. It's amazing a 15 year old wrote this song.<br />5. Haunted - 3.5/5<BR>Okay, I admit, this is a creepy song. So what? It's still acceptional. <br />6. Tourniquet - 4/5<BR>This song is about suicide, and its fairly good, (i love the guitars), but the chorus fails to impress me.<br />7. Imaginary - 2/5<BR>I do not like this song. I find it very boring and the lyrics are immature.<br />8. Taking Over Me - 4/5<BR>I like this song. I can relate to these lyrics as well.<br />9. Hello - 1/5<BR>i hate this song. it is detestable and boring.<br />10. My Last Breath - 4/5 <BR>Like it...not much more to say<br />11.

0792165020|5.0|Anthony Minghella is a true magician.  He turns the best books into the best movies.  He is awesome.  Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, and Cate Blanchett come together in a smart ans classy thriller that will blow your mind.  This is one of the best assembled cast I have ever seen in the movie.  The film is seductive and thrilling.  It reminds me of the old movies of the 1960s.  I highly reccomend this film.
B0001GL3KE|4.0|I was not expecting much when I saw this last night, based on reviews upon the movie's release. I was more than pleasantly surprised. <br />Not every storyline has verisimilitude; some of the humor is sophomoric (not a problem for me). Yet I thought it explored all types of love -- the romantic ideal (Liam Neesan's story line), the unrequited (Keira Knightley), familial (Laura Linney), sexual (the guy who goes to Wisconsin), the long-term fraying relationship (Emma/Rickman), the improbable (Hugh Grant), the pure-of-heart (the two body doubles), love-between-friends (Billy) and the redemptive love (Colin Firth) -- with a seriousness and a real-ness (aside from the sometimes hokey plot devices). <br />(...), I saw a truthfulness in each of the storylines. I could directly relate to several of them. I can't believe that anyone who has known some sort of love couldn't do the same.<br />The acting was very good across the board, the writing was top notch for a major commercial release, it was never boring for two and a half hours, and it blended the comic with the serious in a way that never felt forced to me.
B00003CXFV|5.0|Erin Brokavitch is one of the best &quot;true to life&quot; movies I have ever seen.  Julia Roberts gave the performance of her career in this film about a young woman who strives to save a dying community and still handle three kids ans a relationship.  The other performances that were played really well were the roles of Aaron Echeart and Albert Finney's.  The movie also has a good score and soundtrack.  The film is definately one of the best films of the 2000s.  I highly reccomend this film.
B00005JM02|5.0|An overprotective father - Marlin - tries everything he can to hold onto his only son Nemo.  Nemo being a young fish, wants to explore the unknown ocean while his dad would much rather have him buy his side at all times.  When Nemo disobeys his father, he is caught in a net and taken away only to be placed in a fishtank with other fish.  Marlin, accompanied by his new absent-minded friend Dory, sets out to find his son.  While Nemo and his tankmates scheme on how to get out of the tank before he becomes the dentist's niece's new pet.  This film was very, very well done.  No matter what age you are, I think you'll appreciate this film.
B00004R99J|4.0|After the phenomenal successes of Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and the awesome The Lion King, the Disney animators brought us Pocahontas.  The film was good and is a definate Disney must.  It may not have instant fame or that classic appeal like the past films have, but it will be remembered.  The film has music, and beautiful artwork, and the voice talents are good too.  All in all it is a Disney movie worth seeing.  I definately reccomend this.
B000001ELP|3.0|Kiss's &quot;Music From The Elder&quot; is a good album.  It is also very different from what they did during the 70's when they were the supergroup of the decade.  By the time the 80's came around, Kiss was a different band and like all bands do, they changed.  Was it a change for the better?  Probably not at the time.  &quot;The Elder&quot; is Kiss's most obscure album and is looked upon as a wrong move in thier long career.  But, if you are a Kiss fan, you need to buy this album.  Thier are a lot of good tunes on it.  I highly reccomend this album for Kiss fans only because real Kiss fans will appreciate it's diversity and originality.
B00003CXCT|5.0|first off, i never even really liked the star wars trilogy (4-6). sure i enjoy them now, but that's b/c i like the newer ones (yeah yeah... i know you all think they stink)... but after reading some of your posts, i just couldn't help myself... i mean, what world are you people living in to think that these movies are YOURS? honestly? sure lucas can do whatever he wants to do with them because they are HIS movies. man, i'm sorry your lives are so empty and that the only substance you seem to have is due to these movies. did they really change your lives? people!? folks!?... calm down! there's more to this world than lucas bashing websites and star wars conventions (which is pretty hypocritical if you think about it... you guys hate lucas for what he's done yet you still support him. i don't get it. probably never will... i'm not into RPG games or magic cards... and i have a girlfriend).<br />look... just try to enjoy them as movies; that's all they are. if you guys want to whine about something, at least make sure it's about something of substance... otherwise just stop... put down the ho-ho's, the light saber toys and for god's sake, take off that darth vader helmet! you look silly! <br />everything will be ok, kidos. we'll work through this....<br />(...)
B000068PQ7|5.0|Since this album has been praised enough, I'll just respond to a few criticisms of it.<br>Gene's version of &quot;Tears of Rage&quot; may have similar drum rolls but besides that it is very different from The Band's version. It is more upbeat, and at the same time more mellow. The Band's version has a more soul/R&B sound to it, Gene's version has a more folk/country sound. <br>It is true that the album has very sparse, simple arrangements, and that was clearly intentional. I can understand how that could be annoying to some, but clearly it works for a lot of us, myself included. Perhaps it would have been a five star album if said arrangements had been a little more creative, and if all of Gene's lyrics were as excellent as he was capable of. What makes songs like &quot;Set You Free This Time&quot; great is that the lyrics seem really obtuse and complicated, but when you listen closely, it's pretty clear what he's saying. Some songs on &quot;White Light,&quot; such as the title track, sound amazing, but when I listened to them again, he just didn't seem like his lyrics went anywhere.(&quot;The communion of the forces take delight/With the fear that no tongues may read nor write/White Light&quot;)   You get the feeling that the musicians were all very relaxed when they made this album. For better and worse, that gives it a relaxing vibe- like a bunch of guys camping out in the California desert with their instruments. It's a good feeling, but, if you're not in the right mood, you can only take it for so long.   <br>It's hard to find sound clips of this album anywhere, but if you search for it, you can find a website dedicated to The Band, which has a clip of Gene's &quot;Tears of Rage.&quot;<br>Like Bob Dylan, most of Gene's songs aren't built around riffs, they're built around chords, lyrics, and occasional solos. However, unlike Dylan, Gene's songs usually have more than 4 chords, and his singing is more melodic.<br>There's no guarantee you'll like &quot;White Light&quot; just because you like the Byrds but if you like the Eagles, Neil Young, Bob Dylan (&quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; and &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; in particular), or Beck's &quot;Sea Change,&quot; this might be worth checking out.   *note: I initially gave this five stars, but changed my mind and was unable to change it when I edited the review.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Recipe for &quot;Love Actually&quot;:  Pull out every hackneyed cliche in the book, mix in some sappy, syrupy-sweet stock &quot;chick flick&quot; situations, add a lot of bad writing in which the characters all attempt to sound cute and clever, and WALLA!  You get one of the most insultingly bad romantic &quot;date&quot; movies ever made. Nothing in this movie makes any sense, and nothing in it could ever really happen...  it's escapist fluff.  Nothing wrong with escapism, but this goes too far.  There were a couple of funny lines and some situations that were potentially interesting (yet fell flat), but overall it was a complete waste -- not only of my time and money but of the acting talent assembled in the cast.  I give it five pieces of dung.
0316666343|3.0|To people who's reviews claim how horribly written a book is but can't manage to spell words correctly (it is character, not charachter) or form grammatically correct sentences.  <BR>No, this may not become a classic.  No, it isn't the best book I have ever read.  It is interesting, thought provoking, and gives an interesting point of view on the issues of death, the afterlife, and the different ways people deal with tragedy.  Read it if you like.  I enjoyed it.  But you don't know me so decide for yourself.
0316921173|3.0|... a fact that is confirmed by the amount of time Wallace has apparently dedicated to proving that point. I wouldn't so much call this book a novel as I would call it an essay disguised as one. It is generally quite difficult to empathize with the characters in the book when most of them are used as vehicles for Wallace's observations. This book is extraordinarily self indulgent. I could not finish reading this book without getting the feeling that its aim was to entertain its author more so than its reader. This is not necessarily bad. Wallace's observations (largely focused on domestic and drug abuse) are often witty and insightful. However, for over one thousand pages of dense reading, I was hoping for more &quot;jest&quot;.
0156029065|5.0|Yes, yes of course this novel isn't for everyone, and I must confess that I had a bit of a lark composing the negative reviews in my head that I was sure this lush novel would receive after reading it.  In general, I was spot on.  See here, if you don't enjoy immersing yourself in the arcana and minutiae of the Middle Ages, if you don't enjoy taking off through the picaresque pages of a book as if upon a fiery charger bent on some epic quest, regardless of the exhilarating fact that you don't quite know where you are heading, than this book is not for you---Neither is the classic, Don Quixote, I might add---But if you do enjoy such adventures, saddle up with ye olde lance in hand and prepare for a richly imaginative trek.-I might also add that I found the story of Baudolino's love for Hypatia quite beautiful and moving in its own right. 5 Swirling stars!
B0001E7LQG|4.0|One of the best films of the year, this film concerns a successful hip hop record executive played by Jack Nicholson who dates many younger women.  One weekend he goes to the Hamptons with one of his young finds and meets a woman who is more his peer in terms of age, intellect and  accomplishment, mother of his young date, a successful playwright played by Diane Keaton. There are many delightful scenes including one dinnertable conversation in which Jack claims to have been engaged one time &quot;to Diane Sawyer.&quot;  Eventually Jack has a heart attack and is cared for in the hospital by a doctor played by the young Keanu Reeves, who subsequently begins to romance Diane, also. The whole movie is quite light-hearted without many somber moments and ends up in Paris.  I rate this among the top 5 films I have seen this year.
0316666343|4.0|I read a wide variety of authors and genres.  I was surprised at how engaged I was in this book.  It is a great idea and one that I have not come across before in terms of story telling.  The story itself will rip your heart out if you are a parent of a young girl.  This is not on my top ten all time favorites but I frequently recommend it to people who like to read and are looking for something more original than what you'll find on the NYTimes best seller list.
B0001I561E|5.0|This is by far my favorite Disney/animated movie.  I first saw this in the theaters and was awestruck.  Hurry up already!!
B00005JMFQ|1.0|It was humiliating enough knowing I was scammed into \\"actually\\" watching this thing, but this was one troublesome movie.  I know it was also critically acclaimed and it even won some awards for comedic screenplay at the Golden Globes. Here are a few things about a little film I like to call, \\"Actually...It's A Mess\\"<br />1.  Could there be any more characters in this movie?  There are so many people falling in love here that (on two occassions) they simply forget about them and bring them back into the story over an hour later.<br />2.  Nice stereotype of the US President.  He's southern, he's drunk, he's a womanizer.<br />3.  The guy who moronically proposes to the Portugeuse woman at the end....what was his deal?  At the beginning we see him get out of bed with his girlfriend or wife to go write a book and then he falls in love with a woman he can't even communicate<br />with just because he sees her in blue panties on a dock after she ruins everything he's written?<br />4.  Alan Rickman?  Umm...he's married, he flirts with his secretary twice in the movie, he's married.  He buys a necklace from Mr. Bean.  Emma Thompson (his wife) suspects he's cheating but absolutely nothing is resolved.  Are they together, are<br />they not?  She cries at a school play and then kisses him and says she's happy to see him at the airport.  Huh?  And the last time we see his secretary is when she opens the door in heart patterned underwear for the Prime Minister.  What a disaster.<br />5.  The American girl who is in love with the guy who talks like Ingrieke Iglecias...what was up with that?  We're tortured having to listen to her talk to her boss about<br />how much she loves this guy.  Finally, we're spared from the agony and they dance, disrobe and lie on the bed...then her braindead brother calls and calls again.  The story is thankfully put on the backburner as they sit by the bed before she goes to the hospital.  The last we see of it is her at her work desk and saying good night to Ingrieke Boy late at night.  She cries.  What the f??<br />6.  Talk about a completely useless character.  Her brother sits in Santa hats and tries to punch her when she sees her.  It makes no sense because her relationship problem isn't resolved.  If it's a love story and she can't fall in love because<br />she has to look after her mentally ill brother and talk to him over and over and over again on her annoying cellular phone, there really isn't a point to that situation, is there?<br />7.  Hugh Grant is a likeable enough fellow.  My problem with him is that he plays every character as the same guy.  I was embarrassed for him after he danced to The Pointer Sisters.  I also thought him telling off the US President at a Press Conference had virtually nothing to do with his character....at all.  That was a cheap shot at the United States.<br />8.  Liam Neeson's ugly kid.  The kid was a little weasel who never combed his hair.  There's no way anyone would find him remotely interesting or attractive. He dresses like a homeless orphan and it would be nice to think the kid could think<br />of his mother who just passed away as opposed to some Alicia Keyes looking bimbo.  When you look back on it, he wasn't even sad at his mother's funeral.  He was thinking about the American girl.  Also, good parenting allowing him to run through a security checkpoint, Dad.<br />9.  The kid ran at least six miles to get to the gate, even though he had no way of knowing what airline she was flying or what gate it could have possibly been. Why is it that once he's brought all the way back to his father, the American girl<br />is right behind them and she kisses him?  Her flight was on a final boarding call in the first place.<br />10.  Claudia Schiffer can't act....and she only had one line in the entire movie.<br />11.  The whole English Girl marry's black Englishman attracted to black Englishman's Best Man was completely ignored.  He confesses how he feels for a married woman. She's touched.  They forget about it all for fifty minutes.  They come back to it<br />and he writes down a lot of really dumb messages on large poster board paper.  He was holding all of that stuff in his arms.  Wasn't he taking a huge risk that his buddy (black Englishman) might actually open the door?<br />12.  Finally, mercifully, what in the \\"Hell\\" was going on with the two people insinuating sexual intercourse and oral on that stage/set?  That really made no sense and then they kiss at the end and she says, \\"All I want for Christmas is you!\\"  ?????????  This whole scenario epitomized what I thought of this<br />drab, English film:<br />'Actually'...It's A Messd.  They forget about it all for fifty minutes.

0385507755|5.0|You think it's bravado.  You think he's lying.  You think it's a bunch of bs.  Whatever.  The book slapped me in the face and took me by the shoulders and shook me and said \\"stop being a damn victim of everything and stop using.\\" Period.  And I have.  Still, not using. Nor will I anymore.  I've read just about all the addiction books out there, memoirs, done 12 step, rehab, all that.  This book did it for me.  And any addict or alcoholic who is serious about living differently and changing their life will realize that Frey doesn't write his story to brag, or tell the world how bad-ass he was, or how much he used and how many people he terrorized and how cool he was because of it.

B0001HAISG|4.0|\\"Peter Pan\\" flew into theaters last December. Its flight was short-lived because family audiences seemed to show little interest in yet another telling of the century old story. It's always difficult, though, to figure out why good movies like this one fail [or why bad ones succeed]. This version - to me, the best one ever made - doesn't hesitate to show the darker side of the tale. <br />We all know the story. Wendy Darling and her two brothers are visited by a boy named Peter Pan, who lives in Never Never Land, where adventures are endless and where children never have to grow up. The three siblings decide to go there with Peter. Being children, they don't think much about the consequences of their actions. These include how much they will be missed by their loving parents and odd it might be to be forever young. <br />I love how dreamlike Never Never Land is portrayed here. Maybe it was all a dream Wendy had, maybe not. She has, after all, a vivid imagination. I like how egocentric Peter is, how much a master of his domain he is - and, ultimately, how lonely and sad he is. I like how Capt. Hook relates to Peter, how much alike they are. I admire how the fairy Tinkerbelle is portrayed as a willful, deceitful being who will do anything to get just what she thinks she wants at the moment only to reverse herself when she realizes that what she wants is not what she needs. <br />This is a thinking person's \\"Peter Pan\\". Not, I suppose, what our audience wants now.

B00009P1O5|5.0|There is a certain segment of Neil Young's fan base that is in it primarily for the decibels.  They want to hear \\"Hey Hey My My\\", not \\"My My Hey Hey\\".  They want Crazy Horse, and it better not be `Greendale'.  While I share their passion, I do have a corresponding affinity for much of Young's kinder and gentler fare, such as `Comes a Time'.  There does come a time, however, when the mood strikes for something striking, and nothing can strike that chord like Neil's `re.ac.tor'.  In that sense, this may well be Neil's most underrated effort.  Indeed, it is not difficult to find people who would place this disc in an inferno, creating a disc.oh! in.fer.no!<br />`re.ac.tor' is an explosive chain reaction (since there is no song called `re.ac.tor' on the disc, one must speculate on the significance of the title, including it's syllabled graphic style, and absence of capital letters, which may symbolize being broken down to essential elements; the song titles receive the same curious treatment).  The cover is odd and striking, a bold red sideways pyramid flanked top and bottom by black panels.  I suppose it conveys contained, yet invasive heat, another good analogy for the aural content within.  The 1981 release of `re.ac.tor' followed the 1980 release of Young's `Hawks and Doves' almost one year to the day, another album with a similarly simple yet symbolic cover, a large white star surrounded by blue background.<br />While `Hawks and Doves' embraced a patriotic theme, `re.ac.tor' embraces everything hedonistic.  Drugs and rock open things up in `op.er.a star'; \\"women\\", \\"booze\\" and \\"a pleasure cruise\\" are the tangible elements in `surf.er joe and moe the sleaze'; `t-bone' is a rambunctious 9 minute raging blues on having what you need, but not all you want (for some odd reason Neil decided to print all 6 verses from `t-bone' in the liner notes, all consisting of \\"Got mashed potatoes.  Ain't got no T-bone\\"); `south.ern pac.i.fic', `mo.tor city', `rap.id tran.sit' and `shots' are angry rants on aging, Japanese imports (Neil really has a thing for cars, especially old ones, eh?), New Wave rock, and war, respectively.  Even though I'm from the `mo.tor city', my favorite in the bunch is the wildly entertaining `rap.id tran.sit'.  Funny how a `60's rocker put together the best New Wave song the New Wave ever spawned.<br />You don't have to be a hedonist (in most respects) to enjoy this album.  You do have to be motivated to indulge in loud, bare bones rock and roll, however.  In the middle of the set Young offers `get back on it', a fast paced two minute ditty that serves as a bit of a respite from the aural assault blasting out  on either side of it.  Yet it still captures other elements of the disc... it's rather irrelevant lyrics pass the time as Young just has fun with the music.  He sings, \\"I might be late comin' though.  I got some things I gotta do\\".  We know, Neil.  Nice to hear you getting it out of your system.

0156012197|5.0|'Little Prince' is a marvellous book presenting a valuable view of life and human nature written in a childish fable style. Antoine De Saint-Exupery succeeds in being unostentatious in presentating his point of view while some other authors tend to be more insistent in trying to teach their readers. On my personal point of view this book holds lots of lore that could be adopted by humans to preserve their humanity. I was so astonished by this work that re-read it for second time immediately after finishing my first read. And I think there is no piece of text that is not meant to be interpreted by the reader in more abstract way. The uniquiety of this book for me is that it will probably appeal to a child although will be interpreted in a totally different way. Furthermore - it could probably be interpreted in a different way by every person who reads it. And that's a thing that cannot be achieved easily.<br />Written more than 50 years ago during World War II, messages that this book holds can be related to nowadays world without any modification. And I'm sure this will not change after another 50 years.<br />There is some magic in the character of Little Prince - he behaves like a child, he is pure like a child and thinks and acts firstly as a human being. In his presense adults acting in a reasonable way, conforming to society invented unnatural criterias look funny and incomprehensible. I noted that there was not a single character in the book that was evil in nature, although some of the characters will hardly wake up possitive attitude in the reader's mind. And every character represents something - be it human characteristic and chosen way of life (all inhabitants on planets Little Prince visited before coming on Earth) or an inevitable point in life cycle (the snake could be interpreted as the death) or simply what your minds wraps around the character. A metaphor I found very worthy (one of the many) is that of the unique rose. The Little Prince finds uniquety of his rose through the cares he has put for her. Also the water that the narrator and Little Prince find in the desert after a tough wandering and retrieved wistfully. That water was some kind enriched when finally reached. Or the simplicity of the Little Prince's planet compared to the complexity of the possessions on planet Earth. And that fact opposed to the love and devotion Little Prince feels to his home planet... I can go like this till I cite almost everything from the book.<br />This piece of literature art is brief in words, but possesses concentrated content rich in meaning. A must read book.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is simply put - a prodigy.  He's been used by Jay-Z and the Rocafella camp to produce such hits as &quot;Izzo&quot;, &quot;This Can't Be Life&quot;, &quot;Champions&quot;, and one of my personal favorites, &quot;Never Change.&quot;  He's even gone outside of the ROC to do &quot;Stand Up&quot; for Ludacris, and &quot;Get By&quot; for Talib Kweli.<br />But now, it's Kanye's time to shine.  Kanye's been long overdue for this CD, but he was smart about when he wanted to release the CD.  Kanye's been workin on this CD since 1999, and by 2003, his name was heard everywhere.  So he sat on it and waited for the perfect time - opening quarter 2004.<br />Damn did he make an impact with this CD.  From &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; to &quot;Through the Wire&quot;, Kanye used samples, snares, tight hooks and his own ingeniousness to produce a masterpiece of a rap album.  If this is the direction rap is heading in, than God bless you Kanye.  Thank you for a great album.
B000002INR|5.0|The first time that I heard Skid Row was when i was downloading music that I though my brother would hate onto his computer. The first time that I heard 18 and Life to Go and I Remember You I fell in love with Sebastian Bach's vocal delivery. I continued listening to these two songs until I decided that I needed to get the actual album. I got the CD and found that the rest of the songs were just as good as the two songs that got me into the band in the first place. <BR>Basically this album does have some superfluos filler materail but it is overall a very worthy album. This album features some very formidable guitar solos and superb song arrangements. Even when a song has inane lyrics it is still listenable because the musicianship is very good. Furthermore this is one of the less cheesy hair metal albums. On it is none of that Cherry Pie or Every Rose has it thorn Crap: only powerful rock music.
B00006879E|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this album, because though I loved This Love and Harder to Breathe from hearing them on the radio, I thought that type of song would be repeated for 12 songs to make an album much like one by Nickelback or 3 Doors Down, where the songs all basically sound the exact same.  Not the case here.  Maroon 5 hits all kinds of different songs, from fun rock/pop songs like Harder to Breathe and This Love, to more rock-ish songs such as Shiver, to ballads such as Sunday Morning and Must Get Out.  Overall, I really enjoy this album, not one of my favorites of all time, but definatley worthy of five stars.  They are very good in concert too, so if you like live music, definatley grab this CD and see them live.  To break the album down song by song:<br />Harder to Breathe - I'm sure you all have heard this song on the radio, which is why you are looking into this album.  One of the more rock songs on the album.  Fun, upbeat, and I really like the guitar work on this one.<BR>This Love - again, I'm sure you've heard it.  Very cool chord progression at the beginning of this song, use of diminshed chords is very interesting.  Probably the most poppy song on the CD, but kind of unline the rest of the CD.<BR>Shiver - starts off kinda slower, the main guitar riff is pretty darn funky.  The whole song is pretty funky, and at the end the solo is rockin.  This song was my favorite when I saw them live.  They really rock it out.<BR>She Will Be Loved - this song took a while, still not one of my favorites, but its a pretty decent tune.  A slower tune, but fits well in this spot.<BR>Tangled - another funky tune, a little bit slowed down from Shiver, but still a pretty cool rock tune.  Not as catchy as the other songs, but still a very good one.  Synthesizer is pretty darn cool in this song.<BR>The Sun - sounds a lot like Tangled, I would compare the similarity between these two to the similarity between This Love and Harder to Breathe, same basic idea used differently intwo songs.<BR>Must Get Out - a bit of a slower song, I think this is one of the nicest songs on the CD.  Very cool tune in the chorus, and the lead singer's voice really comes out in this song.<BR>Sunday Morning - my favorite song on the CD.  Intro is dominated by the piano, nothing very complex, but its cool to hear, and it fits real well with the song.  The chorus of this song is great.<BR>Secret - doesn't really stick out much, I am not a huge fan of this song, but its not a song I skip.  Not bad, just not overly special or memorable.<BR>Through With You - another funky song, guitar riffs in this song are pretty cool, and the synthesizer is really well used in this song.  Its apparent, but not annoying, so it does the job well.<BR>Not Coming Home - a live version, gives you a preview of what they sound like live.  The guitar riff from this song is very memorable, and is very funky.  The effects they use on the guitar are really cool in this song.<BR>Sweetest Goodbye - not exactly the best way to end the album, I think this song would have been better within the context of the album if it was switched with Must Get Out, but its still a good song.  Starts off kind of weird, and sounds like a typical pop song, but gets into the guitar in the chorus, and is a pretty cool song.<br />Overall, a good album, definatley recommended.
B000003CMB|5.0|As many others said, this is the definitive Allman Brothers album, although I think it is on par with Eat A Peach For Peace, and also the definitive live album. There is very little singing on the set and although Greg Almman's voice is definately not bad, the band's best performance is instrumental. Greg does however add a needed touch to the 22 minute long Whipping Post. Duane Allman and Dickey Betts both deliver soaring guitar solos, unsurpassed in the jam band genre. (Although some jam bands like the Liquid Tension Experiment are more technical than the Allman Brothers, they lack the soul that went into the creation of this music.)Every instrument on this album addds to the sound of every other in a way that is oh so very hard to do without studio producing. If you buyu this album than have it be for nothing else but the amazing instrumental harmonies that the Allman Brothers are capable of. Ooh and buy it for the blues, white boy blues are always funny and in this situation even good.

0140386335|5.0|This great, funny, and exciting story is both for the young, the old, and those with great imaginations. Michael Ende has done a fabulous job crafting this unique tale of a young school boy, Bastian Balthazar Bux, and his adventures to Fantastica, a secret world where he has to help the very ill ruler, The Childlike Empress. Bastian meets several people and animals that help him through the fantastic journey in Fantastica. Bastian sometimes finds himself \\"in\\" the book, literally! He finds out that he actually is in the land of Fantastica. Bastian, usually bullied, is now in his own special land where people look up to him. He learns many of life's lessons. This book really gives a feeling of being in Fantastica and the descriptions are so real, it is almost like the reader is right there.
B000002UJQ|2.0|The few dissenters who can't believe the hype this album got are bang on  - this is one of the most overrated albums that I can remember.  A good album, but not great ... and definitely not of &quot;legendary&quot; status as some would have us believe (and yes, I did give it the compulsory 10+ play-throughs on the CD player).  Their previous album, &quot;The Bends&quot;, is a far, far superior album - no question about it.<br />If you are looking for &quot;Album of the Year for 1997&quot;, I would suggest looking past this album, and on to Catherine Wheel's &quot;Adam &amp; Eve&quot;.  There is NO comparison - listen to each album 10+ times, and I challenge anyone to disagree with me on this.
B000002TYX|5.0|This is the first 2 CD set of the three part Beatles Anthology on CD. It provides the listener with great insight into and enjoyment of the very early Beatles' work as well as a great recording of a concert they did in Sweden just as they hit true stardom in Great Britain. There is a beautiful booklet some 46 pages long with photos and information about the recordings. The wonderful thing about the Beatles Anthology CD set is that the listener and fan can hear and read about the evolution of such songs as One after 909 (which wouldn't get released for six years after the versions you will hear on this CD set). There are recordings with the Beatles using different drummers as they searched for a drummer or on one occasion when Ringo was sick and couldn't play. I would strongly recommend this and the other two Beatles Anthology CD sets for the Beatles fan who truly wants to know the evolution of the Beatles sound. A must-have!
0743455967|4.0|&quot;On Writing&quot; is divided into two parts - the first part is an autobiography, the second part is the part on writing per se. Part 1 consists of 112 pages, and part 2 consists of 199 pages. On top of that, there's some forewords (actually three), the story about Stephen King's accident and the recovering part of it, an example short story with critisism, a recommended reading list, and finally a competition winning short story.<br />What distinguishes &quot;On Writing&quot; from other books about writing is the personal style, in which Stephen King doesn't care about the formality of writing; he is more concerned with the reality of what it is to be an author. Somewhere he gives some advice as to how many pages one should strive to write each day if writing is to be taken seriously. He also says that it's neccessary to write each day of the year, and to read an awful lot, to keep the inspiration coming and the writing style clean and polished. King also writes about techniques: conversations, splitting the text into paragraphs, and other similar useful, practical, and essential techniques every writes oughts to know. Some of the advise is a bit off-topic, and the writing is also a little to confused, but that also makes it less tedious to read.<br />The book is only useful to beginning writers; the tips are simply to obvious for someone who have been writing for more than one year. And I don't agree with all of the advise, but that's also the point: sort the relevant tips out so that it fits your needs. Overall, I think the book is based too much on personal experience, though it's nice sometimes to step out of the formality of step-to-step guides or whatever's out there.
0385484518|5.0|If you have not read this book, you should!  Life is the most precious gift that we all have to share.  In this book, Morrie makes a choice to share his.  He does not want to be remembered as this broken down old man that left nothing behind.  He wants to be remembered as a teacher and a giver.  It's what all of us aspire to be.  If you hate reading, get the movie with Jack Lemon and Hank Azaria!  It's worth the few bucks!
B00005K9LK|5.0|This is quite simply the best Judas Priest record in the middle of their prime (1980-1984), and no hard rock/metal collection should be without it.  With the remastering, this is perhaps their best sounding record.  Every facet of metal music is represented and executed flawlessly - the speed (\\"Screaming for Vengeance\\", \\"Riding on the Wind\\"), the gothic (\\"Devil's Child\\"), the sexual (\\"Pain and Pleasure\\"), the sci-fi (\\"Electric Eye\\"), the political (\\"Bloodstone\\"), the pop hits (\\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\\"), and the ballads (\\"Take These Chains\\", \\"Fever\\").<br />The remaster also contains two bonus tracks, as do all the Sony remasters, but unfortunately the song choice is not exactly apropo to the particular record and very little insight is provided in the liner notes.  \\"Devil's Child\\" is a live version from a 1982 Memphis show - the DVD of which will be released with the 'Metalogy' box set (2004).  (FYI:  From the same show, the live version of \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" is on the 'Priest Live' remaster and \\"Bloodstone\\" is on the 'Ram It Down' remaster.)  \\"Prisoner of Your Eyes\\" is a studio outtake from the 'Turbo' sessions (1986) - a ballad that was originally written for a Julio Iglasias duet.
B000066NW0|5.0|Well its cool to see so many jealous ppl writing bad comments on Avril. Humans who aren't jealous wouldn't leave such bad remarks about her instead would just not leave anything behind to even get associated with the person. Well Avril isn't god, but for starters, she has got it! Doesn't really matter whether she's really that good or not, I think in the entertainment industries, what makes you so great is ability to get ppl's attention both positive and negative, as long as you get to do that, you've done it cause that's entertainment. When nobody's talking bout you, that's dangerous! Every publicity is good publicity be it bad or good news bout them. After all, these types of publicities are free from the public, saves the record company millions of dollars in generating more news, when you talk about her with friends...bad or good, you make her come alive dudes!! Thumbs up to avril, she's hip!
B00005K9LN|5.0|If you bought only two Judas Priest records, they would have to be 'Unleashed in the East' (1979), 'Screaming for Vengeance' (1982), and this 1980 debut of the most successful line-up, including Dave Holland on drums and Tom Allom as producer.  There is no filler here, and Priest does a great job of actually executing the intent of 'Stained Class' - to create a complete heavy metal record covering all the subgenres - pop metal (&quot;Living After Midnight&quot;, the first bona fide hits and videos), goth (&quot;Metal Gods&quot;), speed (&quot;Rapid Fire&quot;), and supreme riffs (&quot;Breaking the Law&quot;, &quot;The Rage&quot;).<br />As for extra tracks on this remaster, there is an excellent live version of &quot;Grinder&quot; from a 1984 show.  But the studio cut, &quot;Red White &amp; Blue&quot;, an outtake from 'Turbo' (1986), is sorely misplaced here.
B0000B1OFL|1.0|Whatever your thoughts on the original movie, last year's The Italian Job has very little in common with it, only referencing the former once when talking about car chases.  If anything, this seems to have been influenced by Ocean's Eleven more than anything else in it's efforts to be achingly cool.  Unfortunately it just doesn't succeed.  The plot is minimal, but that's not really the complaint given the fact that you don't go and see this kind of film for the plot.  You go to see it for the action, and here's it's pretty stinted and unexciting.  The direction is so sloppy that virtually no tension is built up in the various heist sequences, and the beautiful Venice backdrop is barely utilised at all.  More importanly, the return of the Mini chase sequence is distinctly lacklustre.  In recent years both The Rock and The Bourne Identity have given us much better car chase scenes, and this one really falls flat.<br />In many ways it's a shame this isn't any better, because its cast really is superb.  If you can forget about the wooden star quality of Mark Wahlberg, then you've got Oscar-winner Charlize Theron and Oscar-nominee Edward Norton is supporting roles.  Unfortunately both actors aren't given nearly as much screen time as you might like, Norton's role amounting to little more than a cameo.  Contractually obliged to take the role, this is least distinguished role yet, a shame given the fact he is such an astounding talent.  Anyone wanting to see him in better roles would do better to check out American History X or 25th Hour.  Perhaps surprisingly, the best performances come from the minor players of the crack team.  Seth Green really hits his stride here, capitalising on his Austin Powers and Buffy fame to give the few laughs the film contains.  Jason Stratham is also very good, though his persona from Snatch may wear thin before too long.<br />Like I said, the main problem with The Italian Job is that it's so boring, overlong, cheesy and unexciting.  There are heaps better action movies out there - Speed and True Lies spring to mind - and as far as heist movies go, Ocean's Eleven, and even the uneven The Score, have this beat.  This is bland anodyne Hollywood stuff, and it's particularly offensive for its waste of good talent.re heaps better action movies out there - Speed and True Lies spring to mind - and as far as heist movies go, Ocean's Eleven, and even the uneven The Score, have this beat.

B00005R62K|4.0|From the pentultimate heavy metal band, you might be suprised that the first three records (1974-1977) were not your typical &quot;heavy metal&quot;.  However, it was the fourth record,'Stained Class' (1978), added a big dose of distorted guitars and a lot of the lyrical mythology associated with metal music.  The only exception is the seemingly pop-ish Spooky Tooth cover, &quot;Better By You Better Than Me&quot;, although the song has taken on a sinister life of its own as it was the subject matter of a lawsuit in the late 1980s where the parents of two teens alleged that it contained a subliminal message (&quot;Do It!&quot;) that caused their children to commit suicide.  Perhaps that is why this song (long out of the live repetoire by the last 1980s) was, almost defiantly, added back to the 1990 tour setlist - as reflected in the live version included here.  (FYI:  Another song from that 1990 LA show, &quot;Leather Rebel&quot;, is included in the 'Painkiller' remaster.)<br />The other extra track, &quot;Fire Down Below&quot;, is an outtake from the 'Ram It Down' sessions (1987) that is actually one of the better studio songs added on this remasters series.  The quality of this and the live cover tune means that THIS reissue is worthy of 4 stars.
0156027321|3.0|I have to start by saying that I didn't finish Life of PI.  Rather, by page 200 or Chapter 57 (as in my edition of the book) I made a terrible realization:  Two-thirds of the way through and I didn't care if Pi made it off the lifeboat or not.  In fact, I was rooting for the tiger (or the orangutan, or the hyena, or the crippled zebra) to do me a great favor and make mincemeat of Pi.  Facets of the book are enjoyable.  I have a new interest in learning more about the Hindu religion.  The concept of a boy being a practicing Hindu/Christian/Muslim is also a smart theme.  I wish Martel had leaned more toward the struggle of a boy trying to find his way in his native land under scrutiny from his 'Wise Men' rather than marooning the protagonist in the middle of the ocean for the second act of the book.  And yes, I have examined what it meant metaphorically for this to occur and it simply didn't work for me.  But in Martel's book, the biggest flaw is that it can't just be an ocean, the ocean has to be blue and mirror-like and tossing and full of white caps and shark-infested and deep and mysterious and blah and blah and blah.  The author's overly descriptive nature (excuse me if I fail to care about the physical characteristics of a rope) of EVERY thing, person or idea Pi encounters makes for a long, boring, frustrating read.  Martel's adventure is a prime case of a good idea gone awry, sent to die a drawn out death by means of toxic filler.  This book could have been so much more, if only Martel had allowed it to be much, much less.
B00005R62N|5.0|This classic is easily the best live record by Priest and arguably one of the best in the heavy metal genre.  I use the term &quot;live&quot; because most of tunes sound better here than on the original record (&quot;The Ripper&quot;, &quot;The Green Manalishi&quot;) and there has always been a lot of speculation about the degree of studio tinkering.<br />For U.S. fans, this record meant an introduction to tunes from their second record (then only available on import) - 'Sad Wings of Destiny', as four of the original nine tracks were taken from this record alone.  However, with this remaster, we are now treated to four additional tracks that could not fit on the original record - &quot;Starbreaker&quot;, &quot;Rock Forever&quot;, &quot;Delivering the Goods&quot;, and &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot;.  For this reason, I have to say that this is the best of all of the recent remasters.
B0001WTWCO|4.0|This movie is brilliant- one that fits with the novel almost perfectly. The actors shine, the pictures are wonderful. It is a believeable movie with no fake acting. This makes the experience incredible. Worth seeing, and buying. A+ and recommended to all! A must see!
B00000K0DQ|4.0|What I liked the most about &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; is the fact that it shows the issue from the death row inmate`s view. the film is not obviously in favour of one side,the murderers as well as the victim`s families point of view.<BR>it is very emotional, especially the executionscene.<BR>&quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; also leaves much space for your own thoughts and I can imagine that it may change people`opinions about the death penalty, or at least make them think about it.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Unlike most movies, Life Is Beautiful has managed to mix romance, comedy, and incredible sadness and coming out with an amazing film!<br />In the start, we meet a young Italian man named Gweedo. He and a friend move to the big city and move in with his uncle. On random occasions, Gweebo unexpectedly bumps in to Dora, a schoolteacher. This develops in to a budding romance, and they eventually get married ad have a son, Joshua. This is where the sadness begins. On Joshua's birthday, he and his father are taken away to a concentration camp, and his mother talks her way in to, not wanting to be separated from the rest of the family. Joshua, not knowing where they are going, becomes frightened, and Gweedo, in an attempt to calm him, Gweedo invents the story of 'The Game'. In The Game, whomever gets to 1000 points first wins a tank (Something that Joshua really wants). One of the best ways to get points is to remain hidden from the Nazis.<br />This was a very well made and thoughtful film, and in the end, you will truly believe that Life is Beautiful!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This is a different movie, but worth watching. Murray's unique sense of humor makes this special, but other characters are weak. He needed another top box office star with him in this one.  A lot of good but a lot of mixed moral messages in this one.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|makes you really want some sake..<BR>no seriously.  have you ever met someone who has always remained a part of your life, he or she is now out of your life not because of something that happened badly just that they were a temporary part of your life, maybe they were a drifter, maybe it was a punk, maybe you were on vacation, maybe , i mean it could have been so many things, maybe even someone you knew in school.  someone you never saw again and probly didnt even know their last name or home phone number.  weve all had atleast one of those.  <BR>for these two its no different.  their both people who arent exactly satisfied with their lives and then they meet eachother and they fill apart of one anothers lives only to be separated jsut as they always knew they would be in 1 week so they simply get as much of one another as they can to hold on to for a lifetime.  bill murray and scarlett johanson are perfect in this movie but i will say that this movie is not for the dim witted or someone who doesnt want to watch a movie where they have to think about their own lives deeply to feel anything from it by knowing what these 2 are going through and why they do things that they do.  the people ive known that hated this movie i never took seriosly due to the fact that they believed &quot;dumb and dumber&quot; was classic entertainment so dont believe every piece of negative feedback to this movie.  its worth the money...
B000002UD0|5.0|While this may never be counted with Plastic Ono Band and Imagine as his best solo albums, it is certainly the one I listen to the most. (Which is a lot, I love John). The reason? Even if the songs are not as consistant or melodic as on Imagine, or as raw and groundbreaking as the Plastic Ono Band, it is, as far as I am concerned, the most honest and emotionally stirring. Sure, the prduction is dated and overdone. There are a few joke tracks, showing that John probably didn't take this album that seriously.  And sure, it was an album made so that he could recieve an income (Beatle assets were frozen at the time). <BR>But now for positives - John's voice is in top shape. The lyrics are in top shape, and so are the tunes. Most importantly, John was in the middle of his 'lost weekend' period, he had been kicked out by Yoko and was drinking himself to death with Keith Moon and Harry Nilson. The pain that comes through this album is absolutely sincere, honest, heartfelt and pure. If John was leaning too much towards politics on the first three of his solo albums, and Mind Games was a bit sub-standard, this album shows John at his most human - sort of like what he was doing in the Beatles during his 'fat elvis' period on songs like Nowhere Man, Help, I'm only sleeping, I'm a loser, Strawberry Fields Forever.<br />Going down on love - Begins the alum by giving an overall picture of John's life at that point (Won't somebody please help me, you know I'm drowning in a sea of hatred)<br />Whatever gets you through the night - pop song which got him his first american no 1. Elton John does harmonies and piano.<br />Old Dirt Road - Another pop tune co written with Harry Nillson. <br />What you got -Underrated rocker. I love it. I love his screaming vocals and the pain he expresses. 'YOU KNOW ITS SUCH A DRAG TO FACE ANOTHER DAY!' <br />Bless You - A love song which deals with his seperation with Yoko at the time. A weird feel to it...kind of loungy. I like his vocals once again...I don't know why I prefer his voice in 1974 more than on any of his records, even more than on Beatles songs. <br />SCARED - Honest, powerful, bluesy and depressing. You can just tell that he's genuinely scared. Notice the line 'Talk about love and peace, just don't wanna see the red raw meat'<br />#9 dream -  the other single, a beautiful tune, a lot of production that works, for a change. Very surreal, sort of like Across the universe.<br />Surprise Surprise (Sweet bird of Paradox) - I love this too. A more postive kind of tune, about finding new love...in someone other than Yoko! <br />Steel and Glass - Another fantastic track. A cousin to 'How do you sleep', John's vicious open letter to Paul McCartney on Imagine, except this time it's not really clear who he's running to the ground. Allen Klein? Or himself? Probably both. <br />Beef Jerky -  uh, an instrumental. Nothibng special but it's fun to listen to I guess. <br />Nobody loves you (When you're down and out) - Like Scared, another sad, reflective, and beautiful ballad. A lot of disillusionment about his place in life. 'All I can tell you is, it's all showbiz'. <br />Ya ya - Just a quick cover, with his son Julian on drums. <br />Overall? There's a ton of powerful songs on this album and the big reason this isn't cherished like the other albums is a) a little bit of filler and b) dated production. Still, it's only dated in a stylistic way. There's no problems with sound quality. <br />If you love John Lennon, get this. You'll love him and miss him more.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|i can't believe anyone gives this cd good reviews.  em is the only one on this cd worth listening to.  the rest of the guys in d-12 are TERRIBLE.  let me say it again so you guys actually get what i'm trying to say....

0156027321|5.0|This novel showed an intriguing introspection of a mature adolescent's life.  Pi Patel is he intelligent son of a zoo owner living in Pondicherry, India with his mother and father.  Pi spends most of his time at the zoo; it is the only place he is accepted by someone or something and he able to think there without being interrupted.  As the reader you are told alluring stories of how animals behave in their new habitats and how various animals interact with each other.  In the story we grow with Piscine Patel through his life until an event that will completely change his life forever.<BR>     Pi is an interesting sixteen year old Hindu child that is now a practicing Christian and Muslim.  He is moving with his family to Canada along with their zoo animals.  Boating through the Pacific Ocean to Canada the Japanese cargo ship they are on sinks.  Pi is left by himself on the life boat while his family is still sleeping in the cabins and all of the zoo animals are trapped beneath in the cargo area. Pi is the only human who makes it alive safely and along the way he is joined by a wounded zebra, orangutan, spotted hyena, and Richard Parker, the 450 pound Bengal Tiger.  Struggling through the incoherent, stark black nights and 227 unbearably long days we are swept into the adventures created within his psyche the struggles of his unexpected journey, and the myriad of thoughts spinning through his head.  For instance, Pi often thinks that everyday will be the day he will be rescued, everything will be perfect, his family will join him on the boat along with Ravi his best friend, and they will then move about their lives. Pi is afraid of the nights.  He doesn't know if there will be a ship that will pass by and if it does, will it see him.  One by one, these animals are eliminated off of the rescue boat and all that is left is Richard Parker and Pi.<BR>     This captivating novel makes you want to keep on reading.  I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who likes athought provoking and audacious plot.  The book can be at times, slow moving, but without the details you wouldn't completely understand the climax of the book.  Besides having a completely engaging story line, there is also a great deal to learn from this book.  Martel understands and tells us about animal behavior, the importance of how the habitat must be thoroughly perfect and similar to the old habitat, and the way the food must be placed and served or the animal won't eat it.  Not only that, but there is much more to learn.  Religion is a major key in the conflict of the book.  The reader is presented with the different religious philosophies and how some of the beliefs of Pi differ from his beliefs and this is why he practices so many religions.<BR>     The end of this novel is simply the best part.  The way that Martel wraps up the ending scenarios is very periodically done.  Without the knowledge of survival, religion, and even the smallest amount of enthusiasm, Pi Patel never would have survived his long journey.
B0000013GT|5.0|If you were looking for an album that was thoughtful and moving, you wouldn't generally buy a rap album, but this is some beautiful music dudes and dudesses! It is certainly the most thought provoking hip-hop album I have ever heard. Songs like 13th floor and Millenium are simply timeless. <BR>'Some things gotta change, sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to the rain, like memories of yesterday'. <BR>There is eroticism too- 'Im fascinated by the way your nipples poke at me through your blouse'.<BR>The only thing better than the deep (yet unpretentious lyrics) are the tremendous, soulful hooks, which combine great vocal harmonies with an organ or a piano say.<BR>The three best times to play this album are; Driving alone at night (but watch not to crash with relaxation!), when hungover (when profoundity and sensitivity is heightened), or at the end of a hot party or night out. One cant say that ATLiens is the best Outkast album, because there is not a best Outkast album, that is the brilliance of the group- that there is an album for each mood. Yet this is hip-hop and music at its' best.
0393324818|5.0|Any veteran fan who is not a stat-head, will not agree with everything written in here.  However, it is fascinating to consider.  Beane is no hero, but certainly a hell of a GM.  I'm fascinated to see how DePodesta does in LA with a bigger payroll.  The book is at it's best when describes the stories of the players--Scott Hatteberg, Jeremy Brown and the trades (the chapter on Rincon is classic).  It slows down when Lewis falls too much into his financial/math background.  Still, anything that challenges the prevailing wisdom (I particularly loved the scene where Beane goes nuts on Art Howe for the lefty-Lefty, righty-righty bullpen match ups--it is one my own pet peeves) is worth 5 stars.  Guys like Bill James get their just due.  Overall, it is a fanastic read.  Besides, anything that upsets that blowhard Joe Morgan this much MUST BE GENIUS!
6305841861|4.0|Not quite as genuinely scary and bizzare as Evil Dead I, but more polished and humorous.<br />I was surprized by the picture format in this DVD. Like with Evil Dead I the movie doesn't seem to have been shot in widescreen.  You can select widescreen or fullscreen when viewing it, and are made to believe that the widescreen version has more picture at the sides and that the fullscreen version has been matted at the sides to fit a regular TV screen; but when viewing the movie it is actually the other way around!!!! The widescreen version has nothing added to the sides, and has been matted to the top and bottom to look like a theater film. So don't be fooled by this lame sales-trick! You get more picture when watching the fullscreen version!! (Both versions have the same excellent sharp picture quality.)
B000008LH5|4.0|A Ten Years After concert is so energetic and intense, that it is hard to believe that were doing the same basic show for a decade. The core songs were always the same:  I'm Going Home, I Can't Keep From Crying Sometimes, Help Me, Good Morning Little School Girl and the Hobbit.  It was what they did in 1970 and what I saw them do in 1976.  That took up over an hour of the show.  That left time for about three other songs, which would come from the latest studio album.  <br />This album was originally released as 2 LP's and was over 80 minutes long.  When it was released as a CD, they removed one track, the Hobbit.  I don't know if you can get a complete double CD of this album.  I haven't seen one.  The Hobbit is basically a drum solo with a nice guitar intro.  As drum solos go, it isn't bad.  But, I am not a huge fan of drum solos.  <br />This is a great album, but I would get Live At The Filmore East instead.  It has all the core songs (including the Hobbit), plus great versions of Love Like A Man and 50,000 Miles Beneath My Brain.  <br />Recorded Live is a little more polished than Live At the Filmore East, because they have been playing the songs longer.  But, there isn't that much different between the performances.  Recorded Live does have three different songs:  One Of These Days, You Give Me Loving and Choo Choo Mama.  One Of These Days is great, You Give Me Loving is fairly good, and Choo Choo Mama is fairly worthless.<br />If you already have Live At The Filmore East, should you buy this one also?  It all depends on how rabid of a Ten Years After fan you are.  One Of These Days almost makes this worth getting on its own.  Then you get to hear slightly different versions of all the core songs, which in some cases are better here.<br />I'm Going Home is also available on the Woodstock soundtrack.  I think that is the best version.  I Can't Keep From Crying is on the Isle Of Wight soundtrack and that is my favorite version of the song.  Al Kooper, who wrote ICan't Keep From Crying remarked that the residuals allowed him to buy a car (a VW).
B000066NW0|1.0|Jealous? Not really. Just puzzled and deeply annoyed.<br />I can't answer for others, but what annoys me is that there are LOTS of other, far more talented people who will NEVER get the promotion and publicity they deserve. (And I'm NOT talking about myself or any members of my family.) When someone with no discernable talent whatsoever gets this kind of insane saturation promotion by the record industry, it's a fair question to ask why. There are girls at my local high school who can sing and dance and play guitar much better that Avril can. So, like an earlier reviewer asked, WHY HER?
0060536969|4.0|Jack Forman used to run a program division at MediaTronics, supervising a group of young and talented computer programmers. After Jack's division's source code had been stolen, his boss Don Gross put him in charge of security. But then Jack found out that certain &quot;irregularities&quot; took place at MediaTronics and, advised by his attorney Gary Marder, resigned from his job and became a &quot;househusband&quot;. Now he is coping with all the chores at home, looking after his three children.   Jack's wife Julia works for Xymos Technology, developing technology in what the company calls &quot;molecular manufacturing&quot; or nanotechnology. Since she is the vice president, she is not often present at home.   The plot starts picking up when Julia is severely injured in a car accident, the circumstances of which seem rather mysterious. At the same time, Jack is asked by Tim Bergman to take a consulting job with Xymos. But when Jack joins Xymos at an isolated, sate-of-the-art facility in Nevada, he soon discovers that the technology the company is doing research on is far from flawless...   Perfect suspense combined with lots of technology, this is one of Mr Crichton's most entertaining novels.   George Wilson reading &quot;Prey&quot; is a remarkable performance. I highly recommend this audiobook.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Okay, it took me all these days to write this review despite the fact that I bought the album the day it was released. Yes!! I'm your perfect avid Maiden fan!!  Iron Maiden, as a band have come a long way now. They have always tried to expand their music-never scared to experiment and invent new forms of what they do best-create beautiful music!!  When Bruce came back to Maiden and released \\"Brave New World\\" within such a short span of time, I was overwhelmed. In my humble opinion, \\"Brave New World\\" is the best Iron Maiden album ever. It was beautiful, it was new stuff-the kind Maiden had never released. Well, to be honest, Brave New World continues the legacy of albums like \\"The X Factor\\" (I really don't know why it's not popular. It is such a great album and Blaze Bailey is a good singer), but with a major improvement with Bruce on the vocals.  This time, considering how Iron Maiden had so much time to write new music, I expected a brilliant new album-something comparable to \\"Brave New World.\\"  However, I find that this album is almost like its predecessor-almost. Its not a killer like \\"Brave New World\\" was but is one of the good Iron Maiden albums and one of the best Heavy Metal albums ever made.  The songs are beautiful (check out the intro on \\"No More Lies\\". I bet  it's one of the best examples of excellent guitar-work). All of them heavy and melodious. If you like the NWOBHM genre (of which Iron Maiden were one of the pioneers), you will love this album!!  What's bad is the production. It is a heavily compressed album which almost kills the music by distorting it brutally. I mean, you can hardly hear Nicko's excellent drum-playing. Maybe the record companies want us to get used to bad-sounding CDs so that they can forcibly push SACDs and DVD-Audio discs on us. This is bad, but there is nothing we cando about it.  Overall, this is an excellent album. A must-have for any Iron Maiden Fan.  Up The Irons!!

B000005KQT|5.0|Beginning his career performing his masterful harmonica playing in Muddy Waters' band, Little Walter broke out on his own with his 1952 hit &quot;Juke.&quot; From there Walter's amplified sound (which he originated) became a common entity of Chicago blues. This best-of collection selects the cream of the crop from mostly Walters 1950's sessions recorded for the Chess label; revealing him not only as a divine harmonica player, but as a skilled songwriter as well.<br />Included on the album are classic numbers such as the bouncing rhythm of the aforementioned &quot;Juke&quot;, the wailing harmonica of &quot;Blues With A Feeling&quot;, and the hopping &quot;My Babe&quot;, a song penned by the great Willie Dixon, becoming the biggest hit of Walter's career in early 1955.<br />In addition, three photographs and six pages of insightful,well written notes by Billy Altman are included. Although a few noteworthy numbers are absent, this collection remains a fine testament of one of the founding fathers of Chicago Blues.

B0000009XP|5.0|While Guy's last album was an all star jam recorded with long time musical partner Junior Wells, featuring Eric Clapton, Dr. John and the J. Geils Band, this album returns the focus to Guy's raw, nearly out of control guitar playing and soulfully gutwrenched vocals, without any studio musicians or special guests, garnering it his &quot;cut loose&quot; album. Guy displays his brand of Chicago blues with the rhythmic force of his own touring band including brother Phil Guy on rhythm guitar.                                                          <br />This album finds Guy in top form as he performs hard hitting blues numbers with a live feel, like the thumping &quot;I Smell A Rat&quot;, where he vents his frustrations with relationship infidelity; i.e: &quot;I smell a rat in my house, I believe he's walkin' round' on just two legs.&quot; As well, Guy delivers a feverish rendition of &quot;Stone Crazy&quot;, a song which he recorded for the Chess label in 1961, though on this album is re-titled &quot;Are You Losing Your Mind?.&quot; Additional tracks like the upbeat funky rock of &quot;You've Been Gone Too Long&quot; and the sorrowful vocals of &quot;When I Left Home&quot; are some of the best on the album. Throughout the album Guy yells and moans, seeming to fly into fits of joy and sorrow between guitar breaks, leaving one with the impression of a man possessed, or totally consumed by his music. Maybe both.<br />&quot;Buddy Guy, Stone Crazy!&quot; captures everything Chicago blues is supposed to be - raw, soulful, and energetic - proving Guy to be one of the most charismatic and passionate performers of the blues genre.
0451457994|5.0|I remember being captivated by the film when I saw it on cable. I'm too young to have seen it in original release. I remember also being completely baffled by it. I stayed up all night trying to figure the movie out. I wished there were a class I could take so that someone could explain the darn thing to me. <br />That summer after seeing the film, I read the book. It explained a great deal. It works well with the movie as Clarke and Kubrick collaborated. I think 2001 is Kubrick's best film.<br />Flash forward about 3 years. I enrolled in college as a Film Studies Major. My very first class showed a film print in the correct aspect ratio of 2001. And we got a lecture about it (not my last one either). So, if ever a book/movie inspired me or shaped my life, it has to be this book.
1577311523|1.0|Author has over-simplified and compromised the essence of spirituality<br />When you claim well documented prior spiritual thoughts to be your own it only diminishes your credibility.  I wish Tolle provided appropriate references - such as the Upanishads, the Gita, the Kashmir Shaivism, the Dhammapada and the Vigyana Bhairava Tantra - the first sutra of which documents the meditation technique of focusing on your breath and moving along with it minutely without falling behind or moving ahead - the idea is to discover the gap between pran (incoming breath) and apan (outgoing breath), this technique was used by Buddha for his enlightenment.  Enlightenment means complete dissolution of the ego -not the refinement of it -- so when I see Tolle trying to pass this stuff as his own - it just takes away of his claim of being enlightened.  Tolle regurgitates in verbally articulate manner spiritual gossip or as another reviewer put it a rather funny manner superficial \\"Hippy-Dippy wisdom\\".
B00005JKC3|2.0|The Hulk is a bad movie.  It has all the necessary elements to be good, but instead it goes awry in a number of ways.  The special effects are good, but overused, the cast is effective, but campy.  The story follows the original in a way, but doesn't realize that the material needs to be lighter in nature.  In short, this is a misfire that results from everything being just a little off.<br />David Banner (Nick Nolte) has a son, Bruce whom he injects with a chemical he is working on that is supposed to allow him to fix himself when hurt or regenerate limbs he loses.  Later, he is fired from his job in the military, and sets off a nuclear explosion.  His son is home and survives the blast.  Later he is exposed to a large amount of gamma radiation and develops the ability to turn into the hulk when provoked to great anger.<br />There's much to get upset about.  His ex girlfriend (Jennifer Connoley) still works with him in the lab (he does the same thing his father used to do)  Her father (Sam Elliott) was the man who fired David all those years ago.  Now he wants to use the Hulk as a military weapon.  Throw in Josh Lucas as a two fold jerk.  He not only wants to date Connoley, but he wants to use the DNA of the Hulk to develop his own creature for his company.<br />The CGI version of the Hulk is almost humorously campy.  He leaps all over the place and destroys buildings like they're not even there.  This would not be so bad if it were not so obvious that it is fake.  I will give the creature this.  It looks more like a mutant than the original series, which simply featured Lou Ferrigno with green paint.  The problem comes from the fake look of the action.  Also, director Ang Lee looks at this material all wrong.  Instead of it being a fun, entertaining look at a fantasy hero, this film is sullen and serious.  Nick Nolte's speech at the end is so over the top it's amazing.  Lee's previous &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot; could have been more serious, but ended up being light and amusing.  This is awful.  Compare it to SpiderMan and you'll see what I mean.<br />Finally, the movie is way too long.  This should have been 100 minutes tops, not 140.  It takes us 45 minutes to meet the Hulk.  Why show us a helicopter flying Bruce to the lab for 3-4 minutes?  I'm serious.  The helicopter just flies along.  Why?  At 100 minutes this would have been tight and watchable.  As it is, you'll barely make it to the finish.  The Hulk could have been really good.  Hopefully the sequel (I'm sure there will be one) will understand the shortcomings of the original and get it right.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I've been waiting so freakin' long for the Star Wars Trilogy to be released on DVD!  The added scenes in the special edition don't bother me as much as they do other fans, but that's probably because the special edition was the first version I saw.  I agree that both George Lucas and Speilberg have made dumb decisions about going back and changing their movies.  Still, at least when Speilberg had all of those really lame and unneccessary changes made to E.T., the special edition DVD came with the new version AND the original one.  To me, the problem with George Lucas is that he's so in love with the wonderful CGI shots that are in movies that he almost completely relies on them.  CGI's can make movies better, but they don't make movies.  All that being said, I'm glad that these movies are finally going to be released on DVD.  I came onto amazon.com to search for movies that weren't out on DVD and contribute my vote to have it released.  The star wars trilogy is the first thing I searched for, and I was shocked to see that it is finally being released on DVD.

B0000C8AVM|5.0|This isn't just one of Bob Dylan's best efforts; it's one of the best albums ever recorded by anyone.  The lyrics, the tunes and the arrangements come together with what every masterpiece has: a feeling of inevitability, as if there's no other way they could be.  And I say that without even being a Bob Dylan fan.  If you don't know this album, you can't have a complete understanding of rock music.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This film does bitter sweet and introspection and character growth very well.<br />For all you idiots who just gave this ONE STAR and said there is no plot I have three words: GO TO COLLEGE. In college, you will have the option of taking a course on creative writing. In this class, if the teacher is any good, you will learn the difference between mass-market popular fiction and true art. Need I make connections to film?<br />Many others have given good reviews, so I will not re-hash over the pros and cons. I will simply say this: the movie was good, with a few minor flaws (cliched poking fun at r and l mix-ups, the one instance of nudity..), and one MAJOR flaw: THE HUSBAND PLAYED BY GIOVANNI RIBISI IS TOTALLY AN UNBELIEVABLE CHARACTER, and even more unbelievable is how Johanssen's character would have ever married him.<br />I liked the tender, open-ended ending. I personally believe that this film is about a turning point in the lives of both Murray and Johanssen's characters. Enough said. 4.5 stars!
B00005QZWI|5.0|In this world, there exists a handful of human creations so epic, finding words for such things almost seems a way of devaluing the work. Unfortunately, as this soundtrack is one of them, we have but no choice other than cave in and write. If we do not, it would essentially be as if such grand feats were never accomplished in the first place.<br />To keep the review to a moderate and digestable length, there will be no specific documentary of each period instrument, harmonic change, melodic theme, and relation of how the audio translates to supportive information for the visual cinematic cues. Just know that 1) there has been a supremely creative effort to have very specific instruments enhance the mood and storyline, 2) a new and surprisingly fresh (though ironically reminiscent of a time long ago) chord change awaits the turn of every corner, 3) the carefully constructed (while non-academic) themes seem to come alive in a character every time while on screen, and 4) the music for each respective scene is so powerful in the film, it convinces the audience - if subconsciously - that there is indeed no other choice of sounds other than the precise ones that have been chosen and printed to film and cd forever. Don't get me wrong, there are also items # 5-infinity which we'll omit for interest of time.<br />Ladies and Gentlemen, Howard Shore is a living legend and genius to the fields of both musical composition and speaking to the soul. With all of the aforementioned elements, he has done what perhaps Professor Tolkien himself would bow down to: he has taken the ridiculously detailed blueprints for a whole different world, and created the same world all over again, in the form of auditory stimulation. The laborous contriving of entire ficticious languages are masterfully superimposed as thunderous choirs, on top of what sounds like a 10,000 piece orchestral behemoth soundscape.<br />From the characteristic playful music of the Hobbits to the hellishly heavy thunder ofMordor itself, this soundtrack will take you through an emotional journey of its own when you have nothing to watch along with the music. The way the themes cross moods and reappear reincarnated at later locations, in different forms, proves an intuitive influence at work in Shore's mind- much from Bach and Beethoven themselves, but not just in the traditional sense. Much successful experimenting with all musical elements make the resultant cd unpredictable and largely enjoyable all at once. Although anyone can appreciate this soundtrack, I do maintain that a firm knowledge of the literary masterpiece &quot;The Lord of the Rings Trilogy&quot; will augment the listening experience beyond belief. To love the story, as I do, blows it through the stratosphere.<br />A word should be put in for Enya as well. Whereas many soundtracks are comprised of an agitatingly asymmetric combination of composed music and [category: other], &quot;Fellowship...&quot; just can't seem to do any wrong. Indeed, when watching the movie, her passionately moving &quot;May It Be&quot; feels right at home with everything else. It was smart to include a derivation of one of the score's main themes as Enya's own melodic inspiration. Her music, too (represented by two pieces here), is masterfully executed and produced. Whoever included her made a wise call as talent/booking director.<br />Howard Shore, and all involved, deserve more than can be offered in any tangible reward. The three movies/soundtracks as a whole will have taken a few years out of everyone's lives who were dedicated to the project, and those years shall go down as a triumphant landmark on the achievenment of mankind, as opposed to a vague haziness of wasted time for each individual. Howard Shore and director Peter Jackson have done more in three years of their lives than what most hope to do in a lifetime.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|If you've only seen the recent episodes of Gilmore Girls and didn't see the first two seasons, then you are missing out on 43 of the finest episodes in television history.  This boxed set contains the first season which was truly wonderful (although the second season was even that much better, striking just the right balance between whimsy and sentiment).    Nevertheless the first season is a gem, capable of being viewed as a self-contained story in its own right.  More than any other season in the series, the episodes from the first season display a level of craftsmanship and directing that are rarely seen on television, particularly network television.  Many of the episodes are like five act plays, intricately constructed and choreographed.  Witness the cooking scene in the first episode, or note how both the first and last episode conclude with Yo La Tengo's \\"My Little Corner.\\"  Perhaps because the renewal of the series may have been in doubt, the season builds to a dramatic climax in the season finale that brilliantly works both as a finale and as a springboard into later episodes.    Gilmore Girls combines witty dialogue, comedy, drama, sentiment, quirky characters, social satire, and even a little bit of the surreal with an ambitious directing style more often seen in cinema than on television.  At its best (i.e. its first two seasons), it is a kindred spirit of \\"Northern Exposure\\" that carries the torch of inspired writing about unique characters living a kind of idyllic, literate, Bohemian existence.  Stars Hollow, like Cicely, is the kind of place and lifestyle you dreamed about living in when you were young and idealistic, and allows you to return to those ideals and live them vicariously through Lorelai, Rory, and the rest of the colorful characters of Stars Hollow.

1592400876|5.0|(Notice my use of an exclamation mark!)  As a life-long stickler in regard to spelling and punctuation, I was eager to read this book as soon as I heard about it.  Lynne Truss's hilarious prose, and at-times diatribe against the ignorant who abuse our system of punctuation, is well-written and peppered with humorous sketches that detail the plight of our periods, commas, semi-colons and apostrophes.<br />Thrown in with her stories of punctuation-gone-wrong, are the straightforward rules for using the various symbols that enhance our reading and writing.  Now, admittedly, some of these rules aren't straightforward and can confound even the most dedicated grammarian.  Yet Truss lays out the rules with simple and laugh-out-loud examples.  I found myself laughing along with her stories, because they were so familiar to me as well.<br />Punctuation, as well as spelling, is in a sad state of affairs in our present times.  I cannot read anything without a critical eye and always find numerous mistakes that should have been caught.  Yet if our youth aren't taught how to correctly use punctuation in the first place, how could they know how to fix it when it's wrong?  Truss sees some hope, some light at the end of the tunnel, and it lies with those of us who are sticklers for correct usage.  If we arm ourselves to combat ill-usage, perhaps we can change the tide.<br />This book is not for everyone.  If you don't know when you should use a semi-colon or a colon, than you most likely won't find this book funny.  Informative, but not funny.  And if you don't go into a blind fury when you see a &quot;Truck's Only&quot; sign in a parking lot, than this is not the book for you.  Or perphas it is, because you might learn something.  It couldn't hurt.
0451169514|5.0|Stephen Kings IT is hands down, bar-none, without question the scariest story ever written.  Any story where the mere description of the monster is terrifying is going to be good, but Pennywise the Clown unquestionably THE best villain out of any work king has ever made.  I challenge anyone on Earth to read this book in the bathroom and then go near one of the drains in the room, because it will not be a pleasant mental expierience.  The supporting characters are all great, but the best parts of the book are the interludes and other side stories about the havoc Pennywise caused in Derry over the span of 200 years.  This book also single handedly will make every clown you see for the rest of your life not only not funny, but even a bit creepy.  Parents be warned however, I think every kid should read this book over and over again (I first read IT when I was 9), if you let them read IT, IT will give them nightmares for a long long time.  I know IT gave them to me.  As a matter of fact, IT still does.  Everyone buy this book, and keep buying it so we can get a full length remake of the IT movie, with some Peter Jackson type production value.
0060537639|1.0|I had previously seen museum gun collections showing dates of 1300's for many European guns. Therefore, I knew outright that the fellow writing this book was obviously all wrong about Europe being gun-free in the first few decades of the 1400's. And during the 1420's there was a truly-fine Muslim civilaztion in Spain as well as Byzantium's accomplishments (which also included amazing architecture and a strong, literate government with many different bureaus more than a match for China's government at the same time). Europe was often an actually outstanding and advanced place to live in the ealy 1400's contrary to all the author tries to make us believe otherwise. Why this man wrongly wants us to believe China was such a better place shows how either badly informed or sneaky or deranged he is (or all three).
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|The dialogue did not support the story or plot.  I found it boring and cliched retelling of the father-son who don't understand each other story.  I didn't enjoy the movie much, except for the funny bits.<BR>I like Tim Burton's work, but found this movie silly.<BR>I would not recommend this film very highly.  See Last Samurai instead.
B000089RVX|2.0|First of all, before I go any further, I have to say that this review in NO WAY is downing Evanescence and their music.<br />Personally, I don't really care for this band to begin with--BUT I am NOT one of these &quot;metal-heads&quot; who are pissed off that this band is more popular than their underground &quot;slit my wrist&quot; and &quot;everyone hates me&quot; bands.  I am also not one of these people who do not like this band because they are &quot;Linkin Park rip-offs&quot; and all that bull crap. To you people, I say shove it and go whine to someone else.  I simply just do not care for this band very much--and I will leave it at that.<br />While I did enjoy a few select songs and there is some definate potential in this band as far as talent goes (I'm not saying that this band has phenominal talent--far from it--they don't have THAT much talent, but they most certainly have SOME talent)this CD definately was not just another &quot;pop hit made famous from the overrated MTV culture&quot;--there is, I admit, some truly good work on this CD. The guitars are nothing too special, neither are the drums or bass, BUT--the lack of &quot;phenominal&quot; talent does not stop them from writing some powerful and overall good songs. I am willing to bet anybody: give this band a few more years to &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;become better at their musical abilty&quot;, and you are gonna have a truly kick ass band within a few years (hell, I will probably even like them more) <br />BUT....BUT....BUT...this so called &quot;band&quot; has some commercial and publicity issues that they should address and fix: and her name is Amy Lee.<br />Now, I am not saying that it is wrong or stupid for a woman to be singing in a hard-rock band (hell, it's something new and sounds half-way decent, run with it) My main issue is that when I see Evanescence anywhere, there is no &quot;Evanescence&quot; but instead there is &quot;Amy Lee with a few underrated musicians&quot;.  And if you really look closely into the commercial aspect of the band, you will see what I am talking about.<br />I mean, look at the CD cover. That explains it all right there.  On the front is a picture of Amy Lee--and ONLY Amy Lee. And as you flip it over to the back of the CD to read the song titles, you conveniently see 3 guys standing there and you go &quot;Oh, there's the rest of the band, on the BACK of the friggen CD.&quot;  And that doesn't just start with &quot;Fallen&quot;--take a look at all of their singles and import CD's--EVERY ONE has a picture of Amy Lee on the front--AND ONLY AMY LEE!!!! Now I am a true music fanatic.                           I have over 300 CD's in my collection.  I am also a drummer in a band myself. And where I come from, and what I've learned from listening to and being in bands is that if there is a &quot;band&quot; then credit should be given to the &quot;band&quot;. Not only the lead singer.  And, sadly, this is where Evanescence seems to be lost.<br />The talent is not in the powerful vocals, meaningful lyrics, and half-way decent piano playing.  The talent is in all of those things PLUS the guitar work, bass lines, and drum beats put together. Without those, there is only Amy Lee--which I can tell you right now, if it was her on a solo career, she would be compared to a dark image of Michelle Branch or something.<br />As far as the &quot;band&quot; goes, and the songs that are on this CD, it's really nothing THAT great. It's stuff we have all heard before, just with a female vocalist. But that doesn't make it bad. Just not completely original.  But like I said, this band shows definate potential for the future, they just need to find their true talent--and most of all, tone down Amy Lee's publicity and give more credit to the band as a whole.<br />Overall--decent effort, keep up the hard (and sometimes good) work.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I bought this two disc set long before it was released. After I finally recieved it in late April, I can honestly say that Marillion has done it again.<br />There is nothing like listening to the music and absorbing the brilliance of each song and the album as a whole.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|I just got done watching the movie adaptation for Disney's &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and enjoyed it immensely. I've never been a fan of the animated version but I absolutely loved this recreation of the classic story about the adventures of Peter Pan, a boy who refuses to grow up, the intriguing storyteller and mother to the lost boys, Wendy, his pirate nemesis, Captain Hook, who seeks revenge from losing his right hand, which was fed to a crocodile that has since then continued to follow him with a ticking clock inside, wanting to taste more, and of course the magic that is Neverland. However, this new edition doesn't just focus on the greatness of staying young forever (or until you die) but it also shows the sadness of it too, giving this film more substance and meaning. It's definitely geared toward adult audiences who take pleasure in enchanting fantasies, like me, but it's certainly suitable and fun for the whole family.<br />Although this is based on the popular animation they are similar in plot yet details are slightly altered, giving this several interesting twists so that your uncertain as to what is going to happen next. The beginning even takes place before Nana (the dog nurse) captured Peter Pan's shadow, which I found to be very clever as I always wondered how that happened... Tinkerbell was dazzling as the jealous faery, the sets, or rather special effects were all magnificent, and the entire cast was superbly chosen. This is, in my opinion, one of the better films to come out of 2003 so come be a kid again and enter a world that shall bring that to the surface... That is until you wish to return home.
B000002JSZ|5.0|I gotta tell ya i was a little unsure when the cd started playing cuz it took me by suprise very different sound for the band but it was totally awesome simply because AC/DC tried something different and i loved it they tried to make each album different from the previous and that they have done . Sure it doesn't sound as wonderful as Highway To Hell or High Voltage or Back In Black but you can't sit there and say it sucks because it sounds different not at all Bon Scott is gone and isn't coming back sure he was an excellent singer and performer and he highly missed but i feel Brian Johnson was an excellent choice to replace him and carry on the band . If you want every album to sound the same you might aswell just buy one cd and never buy another one again but you will be missing out and very close minded open your eyes and see that this band is still rockin today and still is one of the most successful and true rock bands that ever lived . I give this cd five stars because it's a unique sound from AC/DC .

B000089RVX|1.0|Okay, I have very few things to say about this album.<br />1) It sucks. I'm not just some pissy nu-metal hater (well, I am...), I've heard the entire album several times. It's talentless, vague and radio-friendly garbage.<BR>2) Evanescence only wishes they could be what Lacuna Coil is. If you really like Evanescence, check out Lacuna Coil--you'll be pleased.<BR>3) And now the only rewarding quality of this album--Amy Lee is pretty hot. But you don't need to buy the album for that... there are pictures online for free. Yay. She may be a talentless horrible person, but she's got nice cleavage!

B00006CXSS|5.0|Back in 2002, I was in a store purchasing Saving Private Ryan, I saw a boxed movie called Band of Brothers. I briefly scanned over it and put it back thinking it could neverbe as good as Saving Private Ryan, so I didn't buy it. I watched the special presentation of Band of Brothers on the history channel and realized I was an idiot not to have bought it back then. The movie stands with the standards left from saving private ryan, and was well made. The realisticness an similarities of Saving Private Ryan including the historical flow of events were very accurate to reality of WW2. Also the history channel edited a lot of material out and it was still great, just think of how much better it would be with the unedited version.
B00004XPPB|5.0|It is really hard to describe this movie, but I will try. According to Joseph Pistone, this movie is about 95% true. This movie is based on the experience of Joseph D. Pistone. In this movie he is played by Jonny Depp. Joseph worked undercover in the Mafia for 4 years, for job in the FBI. He was actually told to \\"whack\\" a guy, which is basically getting in the mob. But the FBI takes him out for his own safety. He gets into the mob, by telling \\"Lefty,\\" who is played by Al Pacino, that a ring he was given is a fake. The scene in the basement, where they are cutting up the bodies of some of the bosses, they just \\"whacked,\\" is actually real.  In the end of this movie, you see \\"Lefty\\" going to get \\"whacked.\\" In real life, \\"Lefty\\" was picked up by the police just before that happened. I recently met Joseph D. Pistone, at a book signing for his book, THE WAY OF THE WISEGUY. He is very nice person. He said for doing this undercover work, he was given $500 (before taxes that is).
B00005JMEW|5.0|The guy is very creative in displaying a story in a very original structure and media.  Kill Bill is a cult movie fan's greatest dream come true.  Everything is in there from good old Western Coybow movies to the cinema of the east slapped together.  For the sterotypical &quot;white&quot; person who only consumes the blockbuster hits of what ever popoular trend is out, this movie may appear silly or confusing to a degree of laughter.  Thats the beauty of this movie, it shows us which movie watchers are out there.  In the theaters I caught a lot of white people laughing at the asian sequences of the film and they were also dumbfounded by the special appearances of the actors from Wild Zero, Ichi the Killer, Battle Royale, and Suicide Circle to name a few.  (i was hoping to see Tekashi Kitano) The only special appearnce of a star they would know is &quot;David carra..whats his name...? the guys from that Kung-Fu show...yeah.&quot;  A lot of people failed to see the element of honor that was displayed in both films between characters which was a very beautiful element.  The action sequences were directed very well so that it made up for a lot of the actor martial arts flaws such as akward positions and hyper extended punches, so there are little moments killed.  <br />One sad thing though is that Kill Bill Vol.2 had a trailer for the 2002 film HERO, which is now going to hit theaters here that did it injustes.  They stated that the movie was presented by Quentin Tarantino, but I've overheard many reactions of people thinking that it is directed by Quentin Tarantino rather than the truth (Zhang Yimou).  Plus the trailer gave the art film a false representation of an epic war film, many may be disapointed.  So are movies like Kill Bill building bridges with Hollywood and Asia or are they just going to jokingly stereotype Asian films and cuture in an unfair way?  Fans and crowds shall tell in time.  <br />Oh and by the way, I don't want to sound like &quot;white&quot; people are not cool, I use the term &quot;white&quot; for the typical stereotyping day by day american.  As far as stereotypes go, sometimes people enjoy becoming part of it and making it obviously true.  I look forward to one day the stereotypes are non existant and everyhting in around our lives is understood for what it is and not what it looks like on the surface.
B0000541AM|5.0|One of the most horrifying experiences I've ever had in my life was playing the English langauge version of this DVD at my club in TOKYO and suddenly a bunch of customers doing the WARRIORS... COME OUT AND PLAY-AYYYYYY... WAHHHHHHHRIORS... COME OUT AND PLAY-AYYYYYYY... thing, even with the bottles... in Japanese... aside from being strange though it made one thing clear...  Even in Japan, where action type films and animation are taken very seriously, THE WARRIORS is considered a classic... Though its true that the DVD lacks many extras (*commentary would have been great, or even alt takes, deleted scenes, making of info, or even the news reports about the &quot;riots&quot; and controversy the film ignited) the fact that you can actually watch your favorite scenes at the flick of a button even without many extras, makes the Dvd well worth the purchase... (*Can youuuuuuuuu dig it !)  - - Though I'm still disappointed that dispite all the ridiculous gang get ups and uniforms they didn't have a gang dressed up like Orthodox Jewish Rabbis or Ballerinas... The Riffs, Lizzies and Turnball ACs more than made up for it... not to mention the rockin' soundtrack.<br />The Warriors is more than just a film... like THE WALL and ROCKY HORROR its just one of those late night films you watch with your buddies over... and over... and over... and over again... (or even annoy them by quoting from whenever the opportunity arrives...)<br />If you dig this film, keep your fingers crossed and pray that the late 70's (or was it early 80's) NYC gang documentary &quot;120(?) Blocks from Tiffany's&quot; eventually makes it back to print !
B000001DWG|4.0|This is typical early Grunge style, by artists who didn't know at the time that they were the precursor to Pearl Jam.  It's an underrated CD.  If you enjoy early Grunge, or want a complete Grunge collection, this one is worth a serious look (listen.)  Talent so often comes across so much more effectively before it becomes neck deep in commercialization.
0618526412|4.0|After hearing everyone's glowing reviews, and being so excited to start reading this book- after reading Part 1 of this book, I was ready to give up.  However, I'm glad I picked it up again a few days later &amp; finished it.  Still, the book was not quite what I envisioned, and it does not make my list of favorite books.  But I realize I'm not much of a &quot;classic novels&quot; reader, so that probably had a lot to do with how I felt about this book.<br />I enjoyed the premise of this town full of misfits; a drunk, a bar-keep, a teenage girl who's an outsider, a deaf mute and a repressed black doctor- all of which who made excellent characters.  And once the stories of these people really got going, in part 2, I was enjoying the reading.  It's just that part one really sets the stage for each of these characters, so it's not very exciting reading.  And also, it took me a while to get into Carson's writing style, which is a bit unique- for instance, there were times when her sentence structure was kind of backwards.  I'm not sure if this is because that's how they spoke in the 40's, or if it's McCullers's dialect.  I will say that this book did have some very poetic thoughts and prose.  There were several profound things, and it made the reading all the more worthwhile.<br />I do recommend this book for reading- just with the warning that part 1 is slow going, but if you make it that far, you'll be rewarded in part 2 &amp; 3.  I don't want to give anything away about this story, so I'll leave it there.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|hi, I am an international student in NY. Gilmore girl was really great. It is full of warmth. I watched all episodes over two days. I'd like to know when WB releases the 2nd season.

1878424114|5.0|This was a first book i read by deepak chopra &amp; I just loved it.<br />Language is very easy to understand &amp; conviencing.7 laws are <br />explained very well.i liked the law of potentiality but I think <br />some more explaination needed on law of 'Dharma' Because this is <br />very important to understand one's life purpose on earth.<br />Another thing made it intresting is you can practice these laws <br />on seven days of week.One law everyday.Thats great &amp; easy to <br />practice.<br />I think price is low compared to its content.
B00006RINF|3.0|Don't get me wrong, 3? stars is a good rating seeing as there are only 5 possible stars. Before I say anything else, can people just stop putting Evanescence in Lacuna Coil reviews. They have nothing to do with whether Lacuna are good or bad. Secondly, Nighwish is my favourite band, do NOT bag them just to say that you like Lacuna Coil. Who cares if they are goth or not...they sound amazing. Onto Lacuna Coil. If you ever get a Lacuna Coil CD, this is the one you should get. I gave it 3 because all their songs generally sound the same. I was listening to it and 20 minutes into the album I couldn't really tell if it had changed song yet. This isn't to say that this is a horible album. Heaven's a Lie is a great song...they just need to expand their song style. However, for such a talented band, that shouldn't be a problem. They are, after all, a fairly new band.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The Matrix Reloaded is a great film, no matter what people are saying. Of course it had to follow up to one of the greatest films of our time, but essentially it is a good film if you go into the theatre (or wherever you might watch it) with not huge expectations like I did. The Matrix Reloaded is the continuing story of Neo and Co. coming back to once again try and defeat the machine world and save Zion. With Neo, now knowing his full potential, it shouldn't be much of a problem defeating the machines and saving Zion. This is part  of the trilogy of the Matrix and a highly suggest watching the first one before touching this one. <br />Anyways this movie has some great action sequences. There's actually a whole scene on the highway (which was a hgihway made specifically for this movie). The action is alot more intense then the first one, kind of like how LOTR: the fellowship had alot less action then LOTR: The Two Towers. In the movie you'll see some character devolpment, but not much has changed between the characters. Neo and Trinity become as intimate as they've ever been with a whole scene dedicated to, them (a very much unnessecary scene). You meet Niobe a commander of a completely diffrent ship (sorry I forgot the name of the ship) and you find out that she and Morpheus had previous relations (not to mention that she is going out with Mopheus's boss). All in all, not much character development is done. Keanu Reeves is still dull at times (you know those dumb questions he asks with absolutley no life \\"what happens if i fail\\" \\"what if im not the one\\".) <br />This movie is, in my oppinion a great follow up to an already amazing movie. While The Matrix is a classic, The Matrix Reloaded will be known as the movie that not only built on \\"The Matrix\\" but made the series' alot more intresting. Overall a definite rent, and a possible buy.
B000055Y0X|5.0|What kind of movie. Brilliant, demential, cynical, dynamical, perfect, ironical with a dazzling script, excellent camara direction and a superb cast.<br />If not for Kind hearts and cornets (1950) this would be the greatest black comedy ever made.<br />Kubrick broke all the previous forecast and established this film like an authentical landmark.<br />Sellers in his best triple performance.  George C Scott and Sterling Hyden are really amazing.<br />A MASTERPIECE.<br />What are you waiting for acquiring it?<br />Mein f&uuml;hrer I can walk!
6305903182|4.0|Scream 3 is the final chapter of the Scream series, and it finally concludes one of the greatest Horror movie series' ever in my oppinion. This Scream includes the survivors of the last Scream which include Sidney (Neve Campbell), Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox)and old Cotton Weary. At this point in the series' Sidney is out of school and lives with her father, isolated from civilization. She has taken on a new name and works as a person who gives advice to people in need of it. Dewey has become an electrical technician and is now working on the set of Stab 3 (which is based on the first 2 movies but is completely fictional to what really happened). Gale is now a talk show host, and Cotton is also a talk show host for a show called 100% Cotton. After one of these people die (trying to make this spoiler free) Sidney once again realizes that she is not safe. She wonders what will happen if the killer ever finds her. After a call from the new killer Sidney is frightened and after a few daus comes down to the Stab 3 set to find out what's going on.<br />The new killer has decided to kill everyone involved in the Stab 3 movie in the order that they die in Stab 3. The problem is that (hopefully) his plan will be foiled by the others (Gale, Dewey, Cotton or Sidney).<br />Screa 3 goes back to it's roots. It goes back further into the life of Sidney's mother and her secret life. It goes more into Dewey and Gale's relationship, and it is (in my oppinion) the scariest of the Scream's. The great thing about Scream 3 is that it doesn't follow the same formula as the other Scream's while still not taking itself seriously enough (remember shoot em in the head or they won't die and they'll be super human! haha). This is in part to the change of writers in the movie. Kevin Williamson doesn't write in this movie but produces the movie instead. I think it was a good change of pace for the Scream movies, and made this one the perfect way to end the series'. <br/>So overall Scream 3 is a great movie, and is a definte buy if you've seen the first two. But it's not exactly like the first two. The movie foccusses more on Dewey and Gale then it does Sidney, which those who saw the first two know that, that wasnt like the last few Scream's. Overall great movie - should definitly get with the box set.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I am not a Wilco fan.  I've listened to most of their pre-YHF albums, and though they were nice, nothing struck quite like this album, which in and of itself, took a while to penetrate my mind.  <br />While the comparisons to Radiohead may be tired at this point, they are still apt, even if they're only superficial.  The bizarre noises, unconventional song structures, lyrics that pin down the zeitgeist in very strange ways, etc.  YHF is akin to Wilco's own &quot;OK Computer,&quot; where the sounds of their past, while still present, are shifted left of center, and in some cases into inter-dimensional wormholes feeding spilling directly into the place in our chests where we feel longing and nostalgia.<br />While none of the Wilco guys are &quot;great musicians&quot; in the progressive rock sense of the term, they are all true artists, and I think Jeff Tweedy is amazingly gifted.  That was confirmed when I saw &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot; and his solo acoustic outings in that film.  He sings from the heart.  <br />&quot;I would like to salute the ashes of American flags...&quot;  <br />Also, has anybody ever noticed that he sounds strikingly similar to Jerry Garcia at times?
B00009NH5W|4.0|If you remotely like any of his previous works (maybe with the exeption of Flesh/Fish) this should be in your collection.  Every song is solid from beginning to end, with some truly exceptional poppy and/or funky gems.  TTD also has one of the best and most distinctive voices in popular music.  Its a shame (but predictable) that someone this good isn't more popular. I hope he tours to support this.

B000002ILG|1.0|This is typical hairband stuff that started being mass produced in the late 80's and nineties.  Slick production but nothing original or truly noteworthy here.  If you like this check out Winger, Slaughter, Poison, Skid Row.  Once any form of music becomes mainstream it is inevitable that the clones will come in droves.
0684830515|5.0|In high school, I went through a stage where I read a lot of Hemingway, and I really didn't like any of it. I kept reading it, though I don't think I ever understood that little masochistic streak. Now, after returning to Hemingway with this novel, I think I see a little more clearly. Hemingway's &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is such an accomplished look at the lost generation, and I think the experience of those lost searchers really parallels in so many ways the experience of my generation (and probably that of every subsequent generation). This novel really resonated with me.<br />It's the story of Jake and several other moneyed expatriates who wander through Europe trying to forget their despair and trying to hide from their unhappiness. They wander through meaningless episode after meaningless episode, though at times, there are luminous moments where the characters truly connect with one another (during the fishing trip and when Jake and Brett are together), and you see what might have been or what could be if they could only break out of their current empty existences. The Sun Also Rises is a poignant, heart-breaking work with an abundance of meaning for today.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is a beautiful live action movie of Peter Pan. I was simply thrilled and amazed as to how the story came to life. I honestly can not think of any complaints. Every one worked well with each other.<BR>The special effects are great. There isn't too much but just enough and even the back ground music is riveting. Highly recommend for a Peter Pan lover.
B00005Y7L4|5.0|Battle Royale might be perceived as another Kill Bill, a &quot;Survivor&quot; mockery where it showcases a bunch of students battling each other to death in style. Well, quite the contrary (despite my misleading title). Chiaki Kuriyama (Gogo in Kill Bill) fans will be disappointed here since her role here was akin to being a cameo, although she excelled in her brief part. Not surprisingly after the success of Kill Bill, the name &quot;Battle Royale&quot; lingered among die-hard movie fans. Here, Kill Bill fans will realised that it's quite a different movie.<br />George Orwell speaks of the dangers of totalitarian governments and &quot;political correctness&quot; forced to the masses. The movie Equilibrium was such an example and although &quot;Battle Royale&quot; may seems like it has no relevence to Orwell's 1984, it still depicts the destruction of a group of people under hands of a regime hell bent on forcing their &quot;political correctness&quot;. The first deaths already occured even before the commencement of Battle Royale when the character Nobu tried to rebel against Kitano sensei only to have to be blown off by the necklace stuck on his neck. And sensitive, discerning viewers will watch in horror as the students run around the battlefield like mices in lab experiments, killing each other in various de-humanizing ways, often against their whims. To add more surreal feeling to the movie, you should watch how the training video girl explains the rules of Battle Royale with such childish enthusiasm, and the way sensei Kitano announces the casualties of Battle Royale in casual, and at times cheeky manner.<br />Battle Royale, as I said, is a mockery to &quot;Survivor&quot;, where we often see reality show contestants lie, cheat, and deceive their way into victory. In this movie, reality show is a minefield where fiddling around could mean instant death. One striking example is the lighthouse scene where a normal meal with comrades becomes a bloodbath because agirl ate a meal that was supposed to poison Nanahara. Distrust and emnity from beginning exploded into a grudge fury, and you don't need to guess what happens next.<br />Overall, it is one of the best movies I've ever watch, with all-around decent acting by cast, grippling, yet consistent narrative, and a great soundtrack. The use of classical music complimented with occational pop and rock is great, although my only gripe is the use of &quot;Dies Irae&quot; from Verdi's Requiem not dramatic enough. <br />P/S: For fans curious of Battle Royale II (a.k.a Requiem), it isn't the a Battle Royale at all, instead a Japanese Saving Private Ryan (with even an Omaha Beach re-depiction scene!) film where a bunch of students are forced to an island to annilate the terrorist leader Nanahara, a survivor of Battle Royale who waged war against all adults.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I love this movie. It's one of the few movies I saw when I was younger. That reminded as it was when I saw it years later. It's such a great movies ( mostly for girls I guess. ) However, it's such a fantastic world. It has beautiful back grounds and wonderful characters. I think it's something easy for kids to get interested in.
B000002LEM|4.0|OU812 is the best, most diverse collection of VH tunes in the post-David Lee Roth era (although the mix isn't the best).  &quot;Cabo Wabo&quot; finds Hagar surfing atop one of Eddie's better riffs.  The song has one of the more memorable solo breaks the band has done.  &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot; is a classic.  People who don't even like hard rock know this song and sing along when it's on the radio.  &quot;When Its Love&quot; is a good, if predictable pop / rock anthem.  &quot;Feels So Good&quot; is a bright, boyant pop tune with a scorching solo reminicent of &quot;Unchained.&quot;  &quot;A.F.U.&quot; finds the band playing spontaneously in what sounds like a jam session.  &quot;Mine All Mine&quot; is an unsung classic in VH's catalog that has resurfaced in concert several times since this tour.  One of the few Van Hagar songs that finds Hagar writing thoughtfully and insightfully about spirituality.  &quot;Black n Blue&quot; is classic VH rock and &quot;Sucker in a 3 Piece&quot; is a rocker with a &quot;Panama&quot; beat.<br />I read in an interview that Eddie VH wanted to name this album &quot;Rock n Roll&quot; rather than &quot;OU812.&quot;  And it makes sense, because that's what this album is, purely and simply, rock n roll.  If you like rock n roll played with originality and style, you'll like this album...the last great VH album before this great band began their descent into predictability, and ultimately, mediocrity.
B00005J6UP|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies ever. You really get the most in this one disk set. You get an awesome commentary ( I've never seen a commentary like this before. ) More information then you ever wanted to know. about the cast, and other special features. Really great film for any one who loves Pirates of the Caribbean.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty, directed by Sam Mendes, is a film about a white, suburbia middle class family and the different ways that each character perceives beauty to be. <BR> Lester who is the protagonist of the film, is characterized as a middle-aged white male. His wife, Carolyn is a realtor, who is more interested in material things of life and obsessed with pruning roses, rather than having a normal relationship with her husband, whom she looks down upon. His daughter Jane is a young high school girl who feels insecure, and lacks self-esteem, which cause her to frown upon herself. <BR> Jane's next-door neighbor, Ricky is used as a tool by Mendes to show us the beauty of everything in the movie through the lens of his camera. Ricky is the surveyor for the most part in this film because he is able to see things and people beyond just their outer surfaces. Ricky thinks that Jane is more beautiful than her best friend Angela, because he feels that beauty is not something that is artificial and is materialized on the outside, but that it is something much deeper than that. <BR> This film also makes obvious to us that there are stereotypes present in this film, which are the stereotypical housewife of Ricky's mom, Barbara. Barbara is the kind of wife who will stay home and cook dinners, make you loads of breakfast in the morning, and do anything to make you happy. She seems somewhat repressed and in her own little world, this is probably because of her submission to her domineering husband. Due to this, we might think that she actually isn't in her real state of mind and don't know if this is really her personality. <BR> Angela is thought to be a sexual icon in this film. She is the blond hair and blue eyes, picture perfect woman in this movie. She is afraid of people thinking that she is ordinary and dreams of becoming a model. Angela is being surveyed throughout the whole film and knows it, and so she becomes an object of society and what they want her to be. She doesn't mind being viewed, in fact she is very conceded.
B000063UR2|4.0|This is an interesting movie. It's with Mia Sara as Lilly. A girl who accidentally looses the unicorns ( in a way ) to the world. It's a very beautiful movie. I love the dress that Mia Sara wears in it .<BR>It's a different movie fantasy wise and it's really good to watch every once in a while.
0393312836|5.0|i do not understand how people can call this \\"frustrating\\" after page three it all makes sense. and as for \\"glorifies violence\\" i suppose you did not read the last and final chapter, wich is all about young alex changing his ways and chosingly stopping all his violent acts so he may start a new life and have a son. even though i knew certain parts in advance (the films alex is forced to watch) it was still very interesting to hear the way it was described. and as for \\"if anyone else had written this it would be considered pornography\\" Burgess was actually not that famous when the book was published, it was this book that made him famous. I hope one day someone will make a film more like the book than stanley kubricks version (all the main charactors in the film look 30 as opposed to 14) all in all this is a great book and i believe that everyone should read this at least once in their lives.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A friend of mine told me about this show.  I had never heard of it, but he said if I bought the DVD and didn't like it he'd buy it from me.  So I bought it.  I started watching the first episode and I was hooked.  I ended up watching all 14 episodes in a 24 hour period.  The cast is amazing.  Every character is lovable and well written.  The directing is also outstanding.  This is a must have for any sci-fi fan.
6305603847|5.0|on the surface this is a trippy pink floyd movie with no plot but if pay attention you can notice strong anti-war/pro-peace themes in every frame. the animation is amazing and probably some of the most beautiful animation ive ever seen (and im a bit of an animation buff)wether you watch this for the anti-war themes or just 'cause you're high out of you're mind, you have to admit that this is a great film with som amazing and powerful images.
6304362498|4.0|\\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" (1984) was a book, now infamous, published in 1949.  Some people thought it was about Russia, but it is actually a work of fiction of what George Orwell thought the future could become, not spacificly the year 1984, but any year afterwards.<br />  What really sends shivers through your spine, just like [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] was a \\"prediction\\" that many technical devices and space technology and use of computers portrayed in the film have come true.  \\"1984\\" also has some \\"predictions\\" that have materalized before our eyes.  Giant-monster screens, high-definition television, plasma tv sets for the wall.  Even the phrase \\"Big Brother is watching!\\" is commonly used.<br />  Winston Smith's (John Hurt) daily routine is getting up by an alarm, exercise, go to work, listen to \\"Big Brother\\", go home and more \\"Big Brother\\".  Inside your home, you must be in sight of the big screen.  Big Brother's face is constantly there, but no one as ever met him or seen him anywhere.  You must listen to what Big Brother is saying at all times even when you are outside his voice is heard.  If you are not in sight of your screen, you will be told to get back in sight. There are no drama or comedy programs.  Just real life.  You can exercise live and you can see an arrest made live. No music programs.  At work, Winston has a little t.v. on his desk because Big Brother must be seen and heard.  Winston's job is to re-write and proofread past and present history.  Articles are condensed in one sentence if possible.  \\"Doublespeak\\" is used.  Words and other information is altered.  Even two words can be condensed.  When Winston is finished, the original, historical and valuable piece of information is destroyed forever.  Similar to [[ASIN:B0013LL2Z2 Logan's Run]] (1972), book published in 1967)], everyone must gather into a giant room, there is a big screen of Big Brother there.  People usually scream at the screen with \\"his face\\".  Others are quite serious and quiet.  You must live by Big Brother's orders or else.  Winston wants to get out. To see if an outside exists.  He has once heard of a land without Big Brother.<br />  Richard Burton plays \\"O'Brien\\".  This was Burton's last film role and he died during production, ironically in 1984.  Bob Flag is the face of \\"Big Brother\\".  After viewing this film, you might realize how close we might be to Orwell's story.<br />  As long as their is a President of the United States, a Queen or King of England, and His Holiness the Pope, this \\"1984\\" story will never fully happen.<br />  I highly recommend any edition of the book, \\"1984\\" by George Orwell for excellent reading.<br />  A film version of \\"1984\\" was also made by the British in 1956.<br />Richard Burton died in 1984 after filming for \\"1984\\" was completed.ce\\".

B00005Y7L4|4.0|i really liked this movie, but i was a little dissapointed in some things they took out that seemed incredibly important to the plot(most notably shuyas hatred for the government and his love for rock and roll, and NO mention of bruce springsteen?) also they took out same deaths i was really interested in seeing, the homosexual kid who gets tricked into making his own head explode, and the scene where the kid with the crossbow trys to rape the track runner is very tamed down (in the book she gouges out his eyes and shoves an ice-pick down his throat) also the whole movie seemed to move WAY to fast, the turned a 600+ page book into a 111 minute film. they also removed the mitsuko rape scenes (wich i would understand if this was an american movie but dont you only have to be 14 to be shown nude in japan? well maybe thats just a rumor i heard somewhere) in short i geuss i expected it to be much much more graphic and explicit than it was.perhaps oneday they'll release one closer to the book, and is about 3 hours so they can really catch the charactors the way the book did(some of the students weren't even mentioned in the movie) also i was pretty dissapointed by the ending, i expected the big car chase, and the pencil going into the teachers throat.but if you just wanna see a cool movie than i would strongly reccomend this.

B0000DD7LC|4.0|I like You Don't Know My Name and If I Ain't Got You best, the rest is average.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Muse is one band that I have been listening to for years. I have always wondered why they haven't made it big in America. They are one of the top ten rock bands in England. They haven't played much in America but are right now. They are heavy rock and melodic. Much better than a lot of fluffy rock that is passed off over here. &quot;Absolution&quot; may be a good introduction to them as any. The songs are impressive. Right away we get to the expansive sound of &quot;Apocalypse Please.&quot; Matthew Bellamy is a talented songwriter, musician, and singer. &quot;Time Is Running Out&quot; is a slow rocker, which has new depths for Muse. Much of the album is about time and coming to the end of something undefined. &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; is about as hard rocking as it gets. They have quite a number of ballads too. This is a great record. No song is unnecessary. It may be Muse's OK Computer. That's why we must all have it. Get it today.
B00005JM02|3.0|After reading all the absolutely gushing reviews on Finding Nemo, (and weeding out all those who simply insist on rewording the back of the box), I have to admit I was somewhat dissapointed with this movie. I agree with the other review about some scenes being a bit disturbing (in implied violence) for very young children, and that the animation is top notch. However, as a story, I found it to be faily predictable (although I'm sure kids would like it). The genius of a lot of these animated movies is that they are simple enough for kids to like them, but contain enough obscure references and &quot;wink-wink&quot; moments to amuse adults. There were just not enough of these in this movie to keep me entertained. I can only remember about 3, and they all came in the latter 1/2 of the movie. The first 20 minutes actually had me asking, &quot;where is this movie going?&quot; Add to that the fact that I hadn't laughed once in that time frame, and I was thinking of heading to bed early.<br />A decent movie, but nowhere near as amusing as A Bug's Life or Toy Story.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|Weezer was formed in 1992. Two years later after Kurt Cobain died, Ric Ocasek produced their first record. Once people saw Rivers Cuomo every geek in the world wanted to play guitar. People heard &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; and &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot; and a new age was born. Weezer had the hits. They toured the world and Geek Chic was invented. They took off some time to finish their degrees at Harvard. Life on campus was lame. They got back together to record another album. This gave life to KROQ. More creative videos followed. More tours with No Doubt. Cuomo went back to Harvard. Soon their new album was released with the anthem &quot;Hash Pipe.&quot; Who couldn't relate to that? What else does one do at Harvard? More band members came and went. There are about one hundred members of Weezer. The fourth album was made and The Muppets joined the band for a while too. This band was one of the great bands of the Modern Rock era. This classic CD and DVD prove that. They were the edge. Weezer is the king!
B000066NW0|5.0|I personally love this CD. A lot of people get bogged down on Avril's image. But personally I could care less if an artist sings in bunny slippers. What matters to me is the quality of the music, and how I can relate to the lyrics and songs. And I relate easily to her songs. They aren't too focused on one thing so I think a lot of people will be able to relate and enjoy them. So, listen to the samples and decide for yourself! :)
B0001US8FI|5.0|I own the previous release (ASIN: 6304981635) which was excellent. <BR>There do not seem to be many differences between the two versions except this being a 2 disc version (the previous release was a DVD18, or dual layer / double sided disc) Or does this one really have an \\"All-new digital transfer\\"? Because the previous transfer was very nice already. Anyway, the quality of this movie, and the extra's, are a must-have.
B000069AUI|5.0|You can probably count on both hands (and then some) the number of bands during the past decade who have been annointed as the next U2.  U2's unique brand of heartfelt, emotional songs are difficult enough to replicate for one album, let alone an entire career.  Thus, few bands who have been given this distinction ever live up to the hype.  However, after the release of their first album, &quot;Parachutes&quot;, people began mentioning Coldplay and U2 in the same sentence.  With the release of &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;, those comparisons are are being made more and more and are, I believe, accurate.<br />It is rare indeed when an album comes along that can, from start to finish, bring you through an entire range of emotions without ever feeling contrived or insincere.  And had this album been made by practically anyone other than Chris Martin and Company, perhaps it *would* sound contrived.  However, as Martin sings &quot;Give me love over this...&quot; in opener &quot;Politik&quot;, there is no doubt about his sincerity here.<br />Musically, &quot;Rush of Blood...&quot; is as elegant and pristine an album as you are likely to find.  The styles here run the gamut from louder, guitar-driven pieces, to quiet, plaintive ballads, to folk-tinged acoustic numbers.  Shimmering walls of guitars, perfectly-placed piano chords, and well-constructed songs all come together here, blending seamlessly from one track to the next.  &quot;Clocks&quot;, with its simple yet well-laced piano riff, is the epitome of mournful alt-rock.  &quot;In My Place&quot; is a stunning ballad, while &quot;politik&quot; and &quot;God Put a Smile on Your Face&quot; show that the band is capable of turning out more than teary-eyed ballads.  &quot;the Scientist&quot; is a terrific tune but perhaps goes on a bit long.  The true star of the album, though, is the closer &quot;Amsterdam&quot;.  It begins exceptionally quietly, with only Martin and his piano.  Gradually other instruments come in, until the explosive coda where, when you are truly *listening* to the song, time seems to stop and all seems right with the world.  It is THAT good.<br />What truly sets this album apart, however, are the lyrics penned by Mr. Martin, and his heartfelt delivery of them.  Martin's songs bring out a variety of emotions:  warmth, mourning, longing, etc.  And though he is no doubt writing from personal experience, he writes in such a way that the listener can so easily relate to it that they feel the song is about *them*.  Truly good songwriters have a knack for doing this.<br />So what we are left with is a lovely, cohesive album that places Coldplay suqarely on the path of being one of rock's all-time great bands.  Whether or not they will be able to sustain it is, of course, open for debate.  But fo rnow, at least, they have staken their claim as one of rock's most sincere and emotional bands.  Don't pass this one up.
B00000257O|3.0|Compared to Hancock's last three records (headhunters, thrust, and man-child), Secrets seems to show itself as being less creative and energetic.  It still has a lot of funk to it, but for the most part the album is toned down and a bit bland at times, leaving you with repetitve parts you wish would shift.  The album is good, but I would pick up any of his previous three albums if you don't have them.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I had mixed feelings when I went to buy this cd. I had a feel listens to it, they've kept the formula that they've used in creating Hybrid Theory, now they used the same formula to create Meteora. All the songs have the same structure: Intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, final chorus. with a few exceptions. Here are the track descriptions:<br />1. Foreword - Typical opening to an album, i like the way it connects to the next song (-/10)<br />2. Don't Stay - Awesome opening song, very angst but manages without cussing, he talks about times where needs to be alone 10/10<br />3. Somewhere I Belong - The song that got me to buy this cd, it's also the first single, it features an interesting sample and a chorus that's really memorable, but it starts getting repetitive near the end of the song. Very good. 10/10<br />4. Lying From You - Another very angst song, with rapping in the verses with an authentic sample that sounds really chinese. The screaming in the chorus really tells you he's in pain, but there isn't any real melody in the chorus and guitar chords don't fit. Still a good song though. 9/10<br />5. Hit The Floor - This song fights you! Straight rapping and screaming in this one, the beat of the rhythm guitar plays against the beat of the drums, which make this song different from the other songs. It's gets repetitive near the end, not entirely to my liking. 8/10<br />6. Easier To Run - Wow, what a beautiful rock ballad, this song starts off with the chorus. This is a slow song, with a unique drum beat. Very beautiful verse, the chorus is good but it could be better though. My 2nd favorite song, and could be a potential single. 15/10<br />7. Faint - The heaviest and fastest song on the album, this is the second single. After you listen to it once, you'll be feeling:&quot; what the hell has just happened?&quot; It looks like as though they were trying to rush this song through, leaving you with a lasting impression of the song. 9/10<br />8. Figure.09 - Aslightly slower song than &quot;Faint&quot;, but still angst. A suitable song for a fight scene, awesome rapping in the verses. But not memorable enough to reach excellence. 9/10<br />9. Breaking The Habit - Something very different for LP to do, reading the booklet inside the case, it took them 6 years to make this. And listening to it, it's really refined and brimming with Chester's soaring vocals. A really well-thought out chorus, very mellow and moving. 10/10<br />10. From The Inside - This song has just became the fourth(and possibly last) single. The verse and chorus just flat out rocks, screaming bridges as usual. But yet again, it gets repetive near the end. My 3rd favorite 10/10<br />11. Nobody's Listening - Just flat out rapping on this one, the guitar can only be heard the chorus, but barely. If you're into rap, this song is for you, it's very suitable for breakdancing parties. However, it just doesn't suit me. 7/10<br />12. Session - The &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot; of this album, only Mike and Joe were involved in the process of making this, very nice instrumental. 9/10<br />13. Numb - The best song on this album, the third single. Words can't explain how awesome this song is, very good conclusion to the whole album. And it's only LP that can create a song as good as this. My NUMBER ONE favorite song on the album. Intensely moving. 20/10<br />This album is for all you LP fans, get it if you haven't already. You will not be disappointed!
0316666343|2.0|The Lovely Bones is a stroy told by a girl who is in heaven. This heaven is no ordinary heaven though. It is her own heaven and it is changed according to her own desires. While in heaven she tells her story from the past but the story also takes place at the present.<BR>  <BR>  During the story Mr. Harvey, the killer of Susie goes about his evil deeds. During the book you find out how evil Mr. Harvey actually is. You find out about his past and how he comes to getting caught.<br />  The suspense in this book is not that great. Most of the book is just the neighbors trying too prove Mr. Harvey killed Susie. The book all in all was pretty lame. There is not enough action during the book except in the beggining. I did think that it was clever how the author set the opening paragraph for the story.
B00003CXA4|5.0|Never before have I seen such a powerful work of art. It made me forget the finesse of the technological masterpiece, an advanced Macintosh computer running MacOsX, which delivered the breath-taking scenes in vibrant colors with soul-stirring sound effects. Instead all that stood in my mind was the movie and movie alone. This was a radical change in thought for a person like me who is a avid technology enthusiast. Never before have I been so involved in the scenes of a movie. Every scene and every peice of sound hits the nail right on its head with a powerful strike of the hammer. I must appreciate the dedication of the team and their quest for perfection. Years of their work has produced this masterpiece which mankind can cherish for the eons to come. This certainly is one of the best creations of collective human intellect of superlative degree. The story of the life of a great soul in a soul-conquering work of art.
B00004XONN|5.0|As a person who has listened to a LOT of electronica, I am bothered by the few posts that claim Radiohead had stepped beyond their boundaries, that they are rock artists and they did a sub-par job producing the electronica elements of Kid A. Well, that's just a bunch of crap.<br />Idioteque isn't brilliantly produced, but it works for the song. Same with Treefingers. It all has a place. That's the thing with this cd, it is not something you can skip around through. Without Treefingers, the beginning of Optimistic wouldn't rock so much. It's the little break they give you to collect your thoughts.<br />And if you doubt Radiohead's production, listen to the end of In Limbo if you want a taste of their skill at producing.<br />Now onto the review:<br />Kid A is perhaps the most complete CD I have ever heard. (Up there with my favorite cd of all time, Tales of the Inexpressible by Shpongle) It's hard to really explain it, but if you have an open taste in music, I suggest you give it a few listens. It truly is amazing music, and I don't know where you guys are getting &quot;pretentious&quot; out of it; if that's how you interpret it, I feel sorry for you. I've heard pretentious music and this is not it. In fact, is one of the more subtle albums I've heard.<br />Just give it a few listens. If you don't like it, oh well!
0316666343|5.0|The main character and narrator Susie Salmon is a young girl murdered in the early 70's.  As she looks down on earth from her gazebo she explains her death and the life of the living.  Susie is too occupied with the living to move on to \\"her heaven\\" with her past family members.  All Susie wants to do is watch her family, friends and her killer live their lives.  As her death gets more and more publicized many different characters in the book become interested in this mysterious story of a girl.<BR>  The Lovely Bones is a suspenseful book, and has you guessing till the end.  This book is also heart filling and shows how death effects everyone and thing around you. Alice Sebold uses great passages to describe death and how people react differently to the emotions that come with it. This book makes you think and understand death more. I recommend it to everyone.
B000002I27|4.0|If you look at the copyrights on the songs, most of these were written about the same time as their debut album, The Doors.  A casual fan might say that the later album had all the hits, but a true Door's purist will most definitely concede &quot;Strange Days&quot; as being close to perfection.  Overall this album will mesmerize you with the dark, gloomy, and brilliant lyrics of Jim Morrison.  Starting with the ethereal &quot;Strange Days,&quot; Morrison's vocals shine on &quot;Moonlight Drive,&quot; the minor hit &quot;Love Me Two Times,&quot; and the eerie &quot;You're Lost Little Girl&quot;, one of Ray Manzarek's favorites (See Disk 4 of The Doors Box Set). Not to be out gunned by &quot;The End&quot; on the previous album, &quot;Strange Days&quot; ends with the eleven-minute &quot;When the Music's Over&quot;, the often featured closing song in many Doors live shows.  If you even partially like the Doors debut album, &quot;Strange Days&quot; is a required follow up.
0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was an unbelievable astounding book. This novel written by Steven Chobsky deals with and touches on all of the everyday things that a teenager goes through. He writes the story through a series of letters from the main character Charlie. I am still currently in high school, and I could relate to 90% of the stuff that Charlie, Patrick, and Sam were all going through. Charlie, the main character, falls head over heals as a freshman with this girl Sam, a senior, his best friends sister. Charlie deals with having gay friends, a girlfriend he doesn't want, and worst of all... having loved and lost. <BR> In one scene, Charlie, Patrick, Sam, and Charlie's current girlfriend Mary Elizabeth, were all sitting, playing truth or dare. Patrick dares Charlie to kiss the prettiest girl in the room. Even though Charlie was sitting right next to Mary Elizabeth he proceeded to get up and walk to the other half of the circle where Sam was and kiss her. Mary Elizabeth left the room with tear-glazed eyes, and Sam cursed Charlie out, and then followed her friend in the bathroom. <BR> I like how the book really came down to the average teenagers perspective. This covers so many hot issues that it makes the book very appealing to a person of any sex. <BR> I did not like however how some parts were repeatedly told just indifferent ways. I also thought that some of the letters were just a waste of time because they didn't talk about anything related to the plot. <BR> Even though there were a few drawbacks, the book was still interesting and a good novel. I would defiantly recommend this book.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|We Gilmore devotees should make it one of our missions in life to enlighten the masses to this gem of a TV show. Great writing, superb acting, sharp dialog, great cinematography...what more can one ask for. This is one show that does not ever talk down to its audience. It's remained true to its intent from its inception...the story line builds on itself faithfully. With regard to characterization, there's never a misstep.<br />The DVD set (at long last, and by the way, when does seasons 2, 3 and 4 follow?) is a great value. I know many mother-daughters share in faithful Tuesday night viewing of Lorelai and Rory, I purchased this to 1) get caught up since I missed the first season, and 2) in ten or so years, share it with my niece. And by the way, will the Screen Actors Guild AND the people who run the Emmys take another look and right a wrong -- and please recognize this show for its incredible lead actresses and writing?!? It does not get any better than this.
0060730552|5.0|Touching the Void tells the story of two mountaineers attempting the first climb of Siula Grande, an isolated peak in Peru.  It goes through the usual details of the expedition, with all the preparations and the thrill of reaching the summit after a tremendous effort, until, on the way down, Joe Simpson, the author, falls and breaks his knee.  Simon, his partner, tries to lower him down the mountain, but reaches a point in which he can no longer hold Joe's weight and so he cuts the rope, letting Joe fall into a crevasse.  And here the real drama begins..<br />This is an intensely personal story, in which there is a strongly psychological aspect, both to Joe, trying to survive after falling into the crevasse, and to Simon, going over the guilt of having cut the rope.  Joe's ordeal is amazing, with a broken leg and left for dead; he makes it through miles of glaciers and rocks to make it back to camp.<br />Overall, it is a very well told story.  My only comment is that the ending is a bit longer than it should be.  The authors gets the reader very animated about his prospects of survival, then starts some long winded descriptions of a lake or of rock; i just had to skip a couple of the paragraphs to get to the punchline.  I highly recommend it to someone who likes mountaineering or survival stories, this is one of the really good ones.
B000003TA4|5.0|When I brought home Nevermind a few months ago and popped it in, my first thought was &quot;how did I go 20 years without this?&quot;  Yes, maybe I was living in a cave... I am 22 and am a reasonably new Nirvana fan.  This album is absolutely superb.  Everything from the first line of &quot;Smells like teen spirit&quot; to the last line of &quot;Something in the way&quot; sounds fantastic.  Come as you are is awesome, &quot;In Bloom&quot; is awesome, &quot;Lithium&quot;, &quot;Lounge Act&quot;, &quot;Polly&quot;, they just have a great sound and lots of energy.  A must have.
B00006JKOM|3.0|This album is not up to par with Jetrho Tulls' previous releases (Aqualung, Thick As A Brick..etc.)&quot;Quizz Kid&quot; is a cool song with great lyrics and jammin'. &quot;Crazed Institution&quot; is a fairly good song but gets old after a couple of listens. &quot;Salamander&quot; is a decent acoustic work by Anderson but just never appealed to me. &quot;Taxi Grab&quot; is a great song with a very catchy riff and melody. &quot;From A Dead Beat To An Old Greaser&quot; is just a filler in my opinion. &quot;Bad Eyed 'N' Loveless&quot; is a forgettable piece of music I always skip over. &quot;Big Dipper&quot; is a great song with the classic Anderson flute standard. The title track is a great song and it alone gives this mediocre album 3 stars. &quot;Pied Piper&quot; is another filler in my opinion. &quot;The Chequered Flag&quot; is my favorite song mainly because it's just beautiful. But out of it all, this album is basically hit-and-miss.
0140386335|3.0|The Neverending Story, by Michael Ende, is a wonderful departure from the ordinary, and a classic childhood fantasy story, with imaginary creatures, and a child's utopia turned to a dystopia. This story brings you into the world of Bastian Balthazar Bux, a below-average student, with an above-average weight, and few friends. He encounters a crotchety old book seller, and finds himself stealing a book right from under his nose. <br />The book is The Neverending Story, about a seeming wonderland, a story of stories, but this wonderland has a problem. It is being eaten away by nothing, and only one person can stop it. Bastian feels himself getting sucked into the story, literally feeling everything the characters did, and hearing them, and finding that they hear him, also. Soon he is entirely in Fantastica, and you, the reader, follow him through his adventures there. <br />I found this book to be very exciting, and although it seems childish, it is interesting, and has you believing in fantasies once again. I love some action and mystery in novels, and although this is not your typical action or mystery story, it does involve some mystery, and much action and suspense. It is a fascinating twist on the existence of magic and fantasy creatures, and what happens to a story once it is read. <br />The only complaint I have about this novel is the lack of maturity. The novel is a sweet one, and brings back old fantasies, but it lacks a sense of maturity, which to me is a little frustrating. I got easily frustrated near the end of the novel, when Bastian is having a hard time, but is portrayed much less like what I believe anyone can quite relate to. Also, the story got a little tedious at times, when the action simmered some, and nothing was really happening. After getting through those sections, though, the book more than made up for it with action-packed segments. <br />I would suggest The Neverending Story for anyone who wants an adventure, a fairy tale, and much fun throughout the story. This book is charming, and I really enjoyed it. You will definitely enjoy the silly antics of a child's imagination, and the adventures of a child learning the value of friends and family as I did. I would definitely say it's a book worth remembering.
0060523794|3.0|`Now before getting turned off from the stars, let me just say this: the rating reflects, for the most part, my personal connection to the book. The book itself, as well as the author, is very nice. The writing, and style of, is also nicely done. However, the writing may set you off if youfre a gslowh individual such as myself. Most authors, when writing about business, generally use the expression grepetition, repetition, repetition.h Gerstner on the other hand is very straightforward and`` doesnft repeat as much as other authors. Again, this is not bad; I however, donft care for it.<br />The subject matter is very well organized and easy to pick up, even in cases where you need to look up a quote. The first part, entitles gGrabbing Holdh mainly talks about the background to IBMfs problems and the effects. Part two, gStrategyh is well, self-explanatory. Part three, gCultureh talks about corporate culture inside and outside of IBM. Part four, another self-explanatory piece,`` is gLessons Learnedh. Lastly, you have the Appendices.<br />While reading this, I found that this was not all about IBM. A lot of it wasnft about large corporations at that. What I did notice was that a lot of saying, quotes, teachings and the such, could also be applied to other fields of life, both in and out of business. I use the comparison to gPoor Richardfs Almanach a lot, but it seems to fit and describes it quite well.<br />Again, this is not a bad book, not at all. Personally,` however, I had a few problems with the writing and such, but I do recommend it as a good read.

B00009V7RF|5.0|This album is great from start to finish. With all the tracks mixing into each other gives the feeling of a non-stop party anthem cd. Honestly, they could release any song on this album and it would go straight to number 1 in a day. The only bad thing about this album is that Hey Mama is not the video version. The one on the cd is good too though, with cursing on it. Basically, if they make another album like this one, they will be around for a long time. I Love Y'all

B00004WGY9|4.0|The editorial review of this CD reissue touts &quot;non-album A and B sides only to be heard on PC or Mac.&quot;  Similarly, the AllMusic Guide claims that &quot;the 2000 reissue contains a slew of extra tracks and B-sides, making it the version to find.&quot;  Well, having picked this up with great expectations, I've made my way carefully through all of the PC content, and there are NO non-album tracks to be found on this disc.  There is an electronic discography that includes cover art images, track listings, and lyrics from various early Dexys singles, but not a note of additional music.  So, if you're planning to pick this up for the original music, the remastered sound, or the videos, you won't be disappointed.  But that's all there is to it.  If anyone can find extra music on this release, I'd love to know how to access it....
B0000CDLA7|5.0|The only album in the world that comes close to this one is Metropolis II.<br />I strongly agree with the new DT album because it brings a much needed breath of fresh air. I've been a DT fan since I can remember and I do not believe that they have betrayed their old style. They just say it in a new and kick ass way.
B000021Y77|4.0|The main formula for Run Lola Run is \\"Time is Money.\\" Time is arbitrary in the same way that space is- it means nothing if you don't put anything in it. In this film, the viewers are confronted with a \\"heroine\\" that when not satisfied with the outcome, chooses to \\"do-over\\" her life, or only 20 minutes of her life. Lola is not the typical Hollywood heroin, always looking prim and proper; she gives off the more realistic side when confronted with an intense situation. Lola shows that the smallest decision can change everything from then on. Throughout the film, she takes on the so-called masculine role and takes action rather than crying and waiting for someone else to take charge. But when those 20 minutes are up, it seems as though her female lead crumbles and she once again takes the feminine role in the relationship. It seems questionable that her heroic attributes are only due to the framing and digital weaving of the film rather than the actual character. Overall, it was interesting to see a different side of femininity and the effects in which it had on the viewers.
B00004STPT|5.0|This score is quite possibly the most fitting for a movie, as well as the most emotional one I've heard.  I absolutely love this CD.  I absolutely love &quot;Sorrow,&quot; &quot;The Wheat,&quot; and &quot;Now We Are Free.&quot;  I recommend this to anyone who loved the movie, loves powerful/emotional songs, and anyone who has an open ear to this kind of music (neo-classical I'd say) and hasn't seen the movie (check out the DVD if you fall into this category ;) ).  Wonderful CD.  Much love.  A+

0316666343|2.0|This book takes place in a small town in the 1970's. It's about a young girl who is mysteriously killed and everything that comes after. The main charecter, Susie, is telling the story from heaven. She just sits back and watches everyone on earth. In heaven she gets everything and anything she wants. As Susie watches he murderer get away and her family fall apart, she realizes how much she misses her friends and family. After ten years it finally happens her family is all back together. Her mom left then came back later and now the family is coming together again. Now everyone can finally move on with their lives and get over Susie's death. Over all I thought that this book wasn't very good. It was exciting in the beginning then just trailed off into other topics and got very weird. Basiclly I would'nt recomend this book to anyone. It was a waste of time.

B000002UB3|2.0|A nice try to capture some of the former magic, but only George gives us anything close with Something and Here Comes the Sun.  Actually, &quot;Let It Be&quot; is the better of the final two albums, but either of the two is much more enjoyable than the White Album.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|If you're reading this review, chances are you're already a fan of the show, or shopping for a fan.  If you're either, this DVD is well worth your hard earned cash.  <br />I bought the DVD for my fiancée, who is a big fan, and she hasn't stopped thanking me yet.  She was amazed at how much she forget from the old episodes, and how well they stand up four years later.  We got the DVD less than a week ago, and she's watched most of the episodes twice already.  We searched the net in vain for any release date for a second season DVD, because that will certainly be a pre-order as well.<br />If you're like me, shopping for a fan and/or live with one, you'll find that the show is incredibly well written, never insults your intelligence, and you'll enjoy the episodes you do watch.  The quality on the DVD is fantastic, too.  You'll notice the difference from the broadcast quality.<br />Most of all, buy this DVD so that they DO release the second season -- you'll make my fiancée (and therefore me) very happy. :)

1410102033|1.0|As literature this book isn't worth the paper upon which it is printed. As an historical document it is a valuable primary source, allowing a unique insight into the mind of a modern tyrant.  Sadly, even there, there is little new or original within.<br />Hitler's political philosophies were little more than a rough combination of half-understood pamphlets and what he was able to pick up on the streets or in the boarding-house.  Unfortunately, most of what Americans believe about Hitler was picked up in the same manner.  To quote from two previous posts:<br />\\"Did you know he was seriously molested by his parents as a child? Did you know he had orgasms while holding his ramblings on the stage? Or that he had sexual intercourse with his niece wich involved excrements? Did you know he wanted to become a painter but was turned down by his Jewish teacher? Did you know that HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS JEWISH!? Did you know he was addicted to amfetamins? Did you know he thaught he possesed the mystic abilities of the spear by wich Christ was pierced through? \\"  <br />There is no evidence of most of this.  While Hitler's father could be strict, there is no evidence of his being \\"seriously molested.\\" Orgasmic speeches and excrement-including sex?  Allied propaganda.  Hitler was turned down by a panel of professors, not a single teacher. None of the women in Hitler's family line was Jewish. Hitler was fed many meds by his \\"doctors\\", yes, but I have no idea where the bit about the spear of Christ came from.<br />Another reviewer speaks of \\"Hitler's eloquent use of vocabulary and great analogies.\\"  As Joachim Fest points out in his excellent biography, Hitler was discussing his period of poverty when he wrote \\"He who has not himself been gripped in the clutches of this strangulating viper will never know its poisoned fangs.\\"  Fest quotes Rudolf Olden commenting on that metaphor as saying \\"That one sentence contains more mistakes than one could correct in an entire essay. A viper has no clutches, and a snake which can coil itself around a human being has no poison fangs.  Moreover, if a person is strangled by a snake, he never comes to know his fangs.\\"  (Fest, 213)  This is what fills \\"Mein Kampf.\\"<br />To those reviewers, and to anyone else seeking to learn about Hitler, his motivations and philosophies, I strongly recommed the afore-mentioned bio by Fest or the superb two-volume work by Sir Ian Kershaw over \\"Mein Kampf.\\"  Little satisfies more than well-written history, and Hitler's book fails on both counts.
B00003CWL5|5.0|The phrase \\"beauty is only skin deep\\" has never been more truthful in this drama about the layers beneath a small suburban family. Kevin Spacey dawns the role of middle aged, emotionally stunted father (Lestor Burnham), who is revitalized by his attraction to this rebellious daughter's best friend.. This film breaks the formula of the \\"perfect\\" family by showing that looks are definitely deceiving. From the initial image of a quiet street at the films beginning, to the eerie narrative of Lestor from beyond the grave, this film shows that nothing is what it seems. Rather, the viewer lulled into a false sense of rural bliss, then dropped on the ground of reality. The lives of the characters are not \\"peachy\\" and \\"picture perfect.\\" Lestor Burnham's wife (Annette Bening) ignores the socially constructed idea of intrinsic domestic ability as she leaves her own home to indulge a sultry affair, as his daughter Jane (Thora Birtch) realizes that beauty is truly relative. This film takes the saying \\"you can't judge a book\\" by its cover and gives it a new spin.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|In the beginning, we are lead around and through a beautiful 18th century wooden ship and are sure we must smell the sea and the wet wood and the mold that must lurk somewhere between. The serenity is broken by fear, then a comforting command decision, and then the source of the fear is proven true but quickly handled by our master and commander. We surely know we, and the ship, are in good hands.<br />Movies aren't made like this anymore. Peter Weir has given us a very refreshing gift of another world, where a leader can lead without shame and fear of reprocussion. The ship is his world, to make of it as he chooses. And he is a good leader. And we are not ashamed of him, or his beliefs in duty, and truth . . . attributes which are scorned by many in our cynical world today. <br />I love this movie. It is beautiful. It is a picture of good leadership, combined with humor and gentleness, and Russell Crowe brings it together in a wonderful way.
B0000640VN|3.0|While Meg Ryan has contributed some worthy movies to the \\"chick flick\\" genre, KATE AND LEOPOLD falls woefully short of \\"good movie\\" status.  While not a complete nadir, KATE AND LEOPOLD serves up yet another formulaic movie that offers no real surprises and makes us wonder why Ryan plays a role in a film as uninspiring as this.  Not that the acting is bad, because it's not.  The real problem is the story itself.<br />Stuart (Live Scheiber), an inventor and Kate's ex, discovers a time wormhole and travels back to 1876 New York.  Leopold (X Men's Hugh Jackman), who invented elevators, chases him from his uncle's house, where he is to announce his bride to be, back through the wormhole into modern day New York.  Leopold was to marry into money since his family has run short of funds.  The rest of the movie shows Leopold adjusting to the modern world and wooing Kate (Ryan) off her feet.  The first half plays like a natural \\"fish out of water\\" story.  Stuart conviently has an elevator accident, getting him out of the majority of the movie.  Also making an appearance, Charlie (Breckin Meyer), Kate's brother, spends a lot of time with Leopold, thinking him another actor.  Beware: spoiler ahead.  If you know anything about films, it's obvious how this is going to end, so it's not really a spoiler.  Kate and Leopold go back to 1876 New York to live happily ever after.<br />The biggest problems I had with this movie was the uneasy mixture of science fiction and romance.  The exact same story could have been told without involving time-travel.  An excellent film in its own right, Splash took the \\"fish out of water\\" story and succeeded quite admirably.  Here, the science fiction is little more than a gimmick to dress up a rather formulaic story.  The most depressing thing of all, however, is Ryan has proven you can quite successfully have a \\"chick flick\\" while having an excellent supernatural slant (City of Angels).  <br />KATE AND LEOPOLD gives us a rather unrealistic love story.  KATE AND LEOPOLD is just an elegant man sweeping a boring woman off her feet.  Why Leopold would want Kate, other than she has Meg Ryan's looks, is beyond me.  Another problem with the story, however, is Stuart the inventor.  He is by far the most interesting character, and I kept wishing to see more of him.  Leiv does a wonderful job with the role, and the most interesting sections are the all-too brief scene of him in 1876 New York and again in the psychiatric ward.  The best and most captivating scene deals with Leiv explaining to a nurse that he is not crazy.  I won't ruin it for you if you do decide to see the film, but his explanation is absolutely wonderful, and is easily the highlight of the film.<br />However, he is taken out most of the movie because of an elevator accident, which makes no sense.  The logic of the movie is since Leopold did not invent the elevator, then all the shafts would be empty.  Well, if there were no elevators to begin with, why would there be shafts?  This is just sloppy writing.  The next time the writers want to do a cross-genre film, I hope they do a much better job than this film. <br />I give it a low three maybe a high two for a squandered opportunity of making another good cross-genre film like CITY OF ANGELS and involving an unrealistic love story.

B00005B4GU|4.0|Critics and fans alike haunt AMNESIAC, Radiohead's 2001 album, with accusations this record is little more than a KID B.  Indeed, much of the controversy surrounding this album has to do with complex issues of album vs. single, and Radiohead's self-important reputation.  It is rather funny how the actual music can get lost in all the shuffle.<br />In the early 1960s, rock music was a singles market, and people didn't think of albums as a piece of art.  Through seminal releases from artists such as Dylan, The Beatles, The Who, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin and so on, albums became important mediums of art.  Radiohead, with their three very self-contained albums (THE BENDS, OK COMPUTER, and KID A) fell in with this tradition.  <br />When 2001 came around, Radiohead and their record company began promoting AMNESIAC as a whole new album, and all the heavy conceptual ideals that a new Radiohead album entails went along with this announcement.  They also said that AMNESIAC would be the `real' sequel to OK COMPUTER, and there would be more guitars this time around.  What did they give us?  An album that doesn't sound much different than KID A, though a little more conventional and streamlined than its predecessor.  Because KID A was designed to be a radical album, some of the simpler and more conventional tracks were left off it.  Where did they go?  <br />Why, AMNESIAC.  And when AMNESIAC hit the market, people were more puzzled than they were with KID A, because they had been explicitly promised a return to the more guitar oriented sound of their pre-millennial work.  Not only that, AMNESIAC was promoted very heavily an actual album, not as an outtakes album that got slapped together from KID A's cutting room floor.  The band wanted AMNESIAC to be treated as a regular release, and it simply isn't.  Every record, sans AMNESIAC, operates as a complete reappraisal and an evolution of where Radiohead has been and where they are going.  Their projects are very well differentiated.  PABLO HONEY and its B-sides are very different than THE BENDS and its B-SIDES.  The same goes for OK COMPUTER and its B-Sides.  KID A continues this pattern of artistic reinvention on Radiohead's part for every new album.  But not so with AMNESIAC.  AMNESIAC sounds like just what it is - songs cut during the KID A session but not released on that album.<br />Putting all this aside, the actual music of AMNESIAC is just as good, though a little more streamlined and simpler (which is not a bad thing, don't get me wrong), than the music found on KID A.  As it is, AMNESIAC as more misfires than KID A does.  I don't care much for the dead weight instrumental \\"Treefingers,\\" which I think breaks KID A's momentum, and \\"Motion Picture\\" is a decent track, it never really has done much for me.  AMNESIAC, on the other hand, has the \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors,\\" \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac,\\" the reptitive \\"Like Spinning Plates,\\" and the slight should-have-been-a-b-side-instrumental \\"Hunting Bears.\\"  Why have two versions of \\"Morning Bell\\"?  \\"Morning Bell\\" is one of the closing highlights of KID A, but we didn't need this one.  Especially when you look at the B-Sides that were left off AMNESIAC, which would have made it just strong as KID A.   The rest of the songs on AMNESIAC as just as good as KID A, and had these two records been consolidated into one album, we would have a much more balanced piece of work with the more experimental songs and the more conventional songs playing side-by-side.. <br />All of these factors lead up both critics and fans slighting this album and calling it little more than a clone of KID A, which is ironic because KID A is named after the first human clone.  But I digress.  Because of the aforementioned politics, people's perception of AMNESIAC is shaped by the band, by rock history, and by the explicit promised made to them by the record company.  People approach this record not as a self-contained unit, but the second part of KIDA.  And in truth, they are right.  This is the second part of KID A.  <br />In my opinion, which doesn't count for much, instead of releasing two albums and adding all this confusion to people's minds, they should have either opted for a longer single album and left the rest for B-sides, or they should have released a double album and incorporated AMNESIAC's B-sides into the running order.  There's enough strong material here between KID A and AMNESIAC and the assorted B-Sides (\\"Cuttooth,\\" \\"Fog,\\" \\"Kinetic,\\" and \\"Worrywort\\" especially) for a first-class single album.  The best moments of these sessions rival Radiohead's best work, though perhaps this material cannot reach the grandiose claustrophobia and suffocating world view of OK COMPUTER.<br />I personally would prefer to have seen them release this as a double album.  While some of the material is not strong enough to merit inclusion, had the full two hours (counting the b-sides) of these sessions been officially released as a double LP we would have had a grand, new entry into the dizzying world of indulgent records.  On double LPs, even the misfires are welcome, because they add to the character and intent of the band in the creative throes of crafting new music.  George Martin was right when he said THE WHITE ALBUM should have been condensed into a single album.  It would have been a stronger album.  But it's that wild, messy, chaotic, scattershot effect that makes THE WHITE ALBUM such an effective and gripping listen.  The same would be true of Radiohead's double album.<br />P. S.  Here's a list of AMNESIAC's B-Sides.  KID A had no singles or tour so it doesn't have B-Sides.  The ones with astericks (*) should have been on either album, especially Cuttooth.<br />1.  Kinetic*<BR>2.  Trans-Atlantic Drawl<BR>3.  Fast Track (instrumental).<BR>4.  Amazing Sounds<BR>5.  Cuttooth*<BR>6.  Fog.*<BR>7.  Worrywort*<BR>8.  Life in a Glass House (Full version) (longer)

B0000DYJM6|5.0|For those who have been really been following Pearl Jam know that their numerous B-sides and rarities often rivaled and sometimes surpassed the songs on their albums.  I could easily name off twenty Pearl Jam b-sides that I think are just as good as what made the records.  I have long been dreaming of when Pearl Jam would make it easy for the rest of the world, other than the devotees who will find every b-side they can get their hands on, to have access to their stupendous catalogue music that never made the final cut, for whatever reason.  Indeed, I wish that the four songs from RIOT ACT had replaced some of the tracks on the last half of that album, which would have made it much stronger.  They could have cut \\"You Are,\\" \\"Help, Help,\\" and \\"½ Full\\" or even \\"Green Disease\\" and \\"Get Right\\" for the four songs on this record.<br /><br />So when I heard news of LOST DOGS, I was really excited.  There were a full ELEVEN unreleased songs included on this.  Looking at the tracking list, though, I found it hard to believe what had been left on and what had been included.  Where was \\"I Got Id?\\"  The two Singles soundtrack songs?  \\"Leatherman?\\"  \\"Crazy Mary?\\" \\"Angel?\\"  \\"Sonic Reducer?\\" \\"Long Road?\\"  There are a few songs that were included (\\"Gremmie,\\" \\"Leaving Here,\\" \\"U,\\" \\"Black, Red, and Yellow,\\") that I would have left off to make room for some of the better songs.  Listening to the record now, though, I understand why those `slight' moments are on here.  Still, it would have been nice to round out LOST DOGS with more material, with each disc only holding a little over fifty minutes of music.<br /><br />Pearl Jam's albums were always very tightly controlled.  They also always gave the impression of being very sour-faced and always very serious, like the smart kid always studying and never really cutting up with the rest of the guys.  Ever since TEN, each Pearl Jam release has played to a smaller and smaller audience, as Pearl Jam  becoming more of a cult band than the major bridge between 1970s hard arena rock and grunge that they were back in the start of their career.  Pearl Jam was the biggest band of the early 1990s in terms of record sales, not Nirvana.  Although Nirvana may have started off the whole shebang, it was Pearl Jam that kept it going.  As time went on, they become more and more of an anachronism, far afield of what was happening in the mainstream music scene.  Especially now, with Cobain dead over ten years, and listening to the radio and looking at what records are really selling, you can tell that Pearl Jam is really alone in the world, the last survivors of an era long since gone.  That is why this album is such a tremendous addition to their catalogue, because it follows its own internal logic, just like any other PJ album.<br /><br />LOST DOGS captures Pearl Jam at its rawest, loosest, and funniest moments.  What's more, it plays like a real Pearl Jam record, not a rarities release with substandard material that didn't make the cut.  If you weren't familiar with the rarities to begin with, and approached it as a regular release, you wound think this was Pearl Jam at their most accessible since VS.  LOST DOGS help show that the decision to shy away from the mainstream and release very sombre, serious, and in some places experimental albums was a deliberate move on their part, and that they could cut up and have fun playing music.  It captures the essence of the band as sincere, eclectic, and uncompromising musicians.  For those who want to know what Pearl Jam is really all about, then this is the record to get.  As a portrait of the band and an encapsulation of their talent and what they stand for, this is, strangely enough, their best release.<br />P. S.  For those interested, the majority of the already released B-Sides ARE NOT THE SAME VERSIONS found on their singles.  These tracks below are alternate versions of the official B-Sides and Christmas Singles.  Some of the differences are quite noticeable.  I muchprefer the original B-Side to \\"Alone.\\"  \\"Footsteps,\\" for some bizaare reason, has a harmonica over dubbed onto the original version.  The original mix without the harmonica sounds so much better.  With the harmonica, you suddenly get a vision of Vedder doing a Dylan impression, strumming his guitar and blowing his mouth harp.  There are some slight lyrical changes to \\"Hard to Imagine\\" and \\"Drifting.\\"  In the first song, LOST DOGS cuts the F word.  In \\"Drifting,\\" instead of singing \\"they get so d-ed excited,\\" he excised \\"d-ed.\\"  \\"Drifting\\" is a lot more fun to sing along to a lot better with that word in there.  \\"Wash\\" is one of the few exceptions to the rule, with the LOST DOGS version sounding better than the regular release from the \\"Alive\\" single.  The worst, however, is \\"Dirty Frank.\\"  The original version is much funnier, with Vedder continually repeating the line from Shaft: \\"Dirty Frank is a bad mother - hey, shut your mouth!\\"  Vedder talks a lot more in the regular release.<br /><br />\\"Alone.\\"<br />\\"Hard to Imagine.\\"<br />\\"Footsteps\\"<br />\\"Wash.\\"<br />\\"Dead Man.\\"<br />\\"Strangest Tribe.\\"<br />\\"Drifting.\\"<br />\\"Dirty Frank.\\"<br />\\"Brother.\\"<br /><br />(While never officially released, \\"Brother\\" is a well known to Pearl Jam collectors as a demo cut for TEN, along with the still unreleased song \\"Just a Girl.\\"  The most common version floating around is a full song with vocals.  On LOST DOGS it just an instrumental version.  The song is missing something without the lyrics.)
B00008CLOA|5.0|Pink Floyd was a popular band from the sixties, but when \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" came on the scene in 1974, it set the tone and quality for all albums to follow.  The album was  recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios and mixed by Alan Parsons (winner of a Grammy for this project).  With multi-track recording, tape loops, special sound effects, a multitude of synthesizers and oblique philosophical quotes throughout, this was a high point rarely reached in rock/pop music history.<br /><br />Band members Mason, Waters, Gimour and Wright create an album of mood, feeling, euphoria, confusion, fear and excitement.  One of the unsung singers that blasted the blues into the album was female vocalist Clare Torry.  Her emotive blasts carry through several songs.  \\"Speak To Me\\" starts with a heartbeat and slowly slips into \\"Breathe\\", a breezy, bluesy number with hooks, emotion and lyrics that fascinate.  No one can forget, \\"On The Run\\" with its special effects of someone running, airport announcements, generally strange noises and confusion until it ends with an atomic explosion.<br /><br />It should be noted that in the early severnties, many bands were experimenting with quadraphenia, that is close to surround sound only without the center front speaker.  The latest edition has been remastered in 5.1 surround sound that boggles the mind. Animals respons to it as if it was a living thing moving about the room.  The best and most succinct example of this effect is \\"Time\\", with more than a dozen different clocks going off at once with different sounds and clangs.  This segues perfectly into a metronome pacing in \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\", first bringing the vocals of Clare Torry into the album.<br /><br />\\"Money\\" is magnificent with its use of 5.1 sounds of cash, registers, calcultors and the lot, each coming from different speakers actually producing the beat and beginning of this great song that catapults into the main bass line and rock anthem that is only \\"Money\\".  Its one of the most exciting songs on the album for pure power.  Another single, \\"Us and Them\\" takes the listener into a completely hypnotic nether-world of calm relaxation.  The last third of the album, (\\"Any Color You Like\\", \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse\\"), bring all the previous songs and motifs together for a Pink Floyd/Clare Torry finale that builds and builds to a grand finale that never once falters nor fails to satisfy.<br /><br />Continually selling for decades, \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is a piece of history that never feels dated out of fashion.  I am sure there are millions of people who have heard this album thousands of times and always hear a little something new.  It's great in stereo, but the SACD 5.1 Multi-Channel Surround Sound in a good system is an experience not to be missed.  I admit that I spent nearly two thousand dollars on a system, just so I could experience exactly what Pink Floyd wanted their fans to.

B00006V9A0|3.0|Eight years after Cobain's death, Kris Noveselic, David Grohl, and Courtney Love finally mange come to some sort of agreement and release NIRVANA, which is a greatest hits compilation.  The biggest news about NIRVANA is its inclusion of \\"You Know You're Right,\\" which is the last studio song Nirvana recorded.  This is an excellent song, though why they open the record with it is beyond me.  It should have been at the end, because the rest of NIRVANA is sequenced chronologically. <br />The problem with NIRVANA is, with only having three albums and a large number of b-sides to draw from, it still misses the boat.  Courtney Love made it pretty obvious she wanted a hit album like The Beatles' ONE record.  The Beatles had a very large number of hit singles.  Recording for seven years, they scored twenty-seven number one hits.  There was a very clear criteria to determine what made it onto One and what didn't.  Whatever didn't top the charts didn't make it.  For the consumer, this was a good criteria to assemble a best-of.  ONE ran just under 80 minutes.  <br />Nirvana, on the other hand, didn't have the same criteria to go by.  Some of Nirvana's best material never made it big on the charts, though they're acknowledged classics.  Each of their three albums, plus the B-side collection and MTV UNPLUGGED, have their own sonic textures and vibes.  Nirvana's body of work works much better in the context of albums, because each of their three albums have very distinct personalities.<br />So what does all this mean to NIRVANA?  It has a difficult job before it, and unfortunately, it fails.  NIRVANA does not capture the essence of Nirvana.  The material that does make it onto the album can't be faulted as obvious candidates for a best-of compilation.<br />What can be faulted is the tracks selected don't give us a clear picture of Nirvana's three studio albums.  Moving from when they were unknown, Nirvana had a much more grungy, punk-informed sound on BLEACH which does not come through on NIRVANA.  NEVERMIND, 1990s rock's most important record, has a glossy sheen and a very produced feel.  Listening to BLEACH and then to NEVERMIND, this juxtaposition is very obvious.  <br />IN UTERO, Nirvana's last album before Cobain's suicide, is volatile, abrasive, dark, and tortured.  It's a very willfully difficult record, and stands as Nirvana's most cohesive artistic statement.  Sifting through for radio hits on IN UTERO completely negates what Kurt was trying to say on that record.  He was trying to cope with fame and bad personal relationships, and IN UTERO stands as his tortured cry.  NIRVANA ignores this completely.<br />The biggest problem with NIRVANA is its running length.  At only fifty minutes, it leaves out some obvious choices that are essential to the Nirvana canon.  Where's \\"Aneurysm\\"?  Where's \\"Verse, Chorus, Verse\\"?  Where's \\"Something in the Way\\"?  Where's \\"Polly\\"?  Where's \\"Drain You\\"?  Where's \\"Breed\\"?  Where's \\"D7\\" (which is an awesome b-side)?<br />In the end, NIRVANA feels like a botched opportunity to represent one of rock's most influential and important bands.  Stick with the original albums.
B00003CXCT|3.0|When I saw the Empire Strikes Back Special Edition, I wasn't overly impressed with the new effects.  The computer generated effects paled in comparison to the original magic.  I never did see the other two installments because of that.  <BR>I was thrilled beyond belief when I heard that the trilogy was coming to DVD, but when I read that it was the Special Edition version, I was totally appalled!  I grew up with the originals and that's what I want to see on my TV.  I think George should consider releasing the movies in their original glory for the old-timers and have the Special Editions on hand for those who don't know any better.
B00008WG3U|5.0|Fat Mike has been taking a lot of crap for his politcs lately, but let's put politics aside here and talk about the music.... This album slams man. I don't care what anyone says. I think this is one of NOFX's best albums because it rocks so hard and sounds good. NOFX has definatly gotten better over the years and this album proves it. I think it's funny how people b!tch when a band changes their sound, but then a band like NOFX pretty much keeps their sound with a few minor changes and people whine because it's boring. People are never happy, they always have to nit pick and find things that are wrong with something and whine about it. Boo hoo, all of NOFX's albums sound the same, boo hoo I don't like Fat Mike's politics. Get a life.

B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty A Review by Ashley McBride<br />Throughout the film, the main question of \\"what is beauty\\" is prevalent. There are many answers that are offered throughout the course of the film, but what stands out the most is not the typical superficial answer offered by most Hollywood pictures.  <br />Lester, the main character of the film whose life we as viewers follow undergoes a midlife crisis.  The monotony of everyday life is unrelenting and causing complete atrophy of his potential as a human being.  This is until he meets Angela the Hollywood answer to beautiful women, and a friend of his daughter Jane.  To Lester, Angela is all that represents beauty.  Ricky, a neighbor boy, develops a different definition of beauty; with his camera he can see the world in a different way.  He falls in love with Jane, a less stereotypical beauty but a more genuine person.  All the while, Carolyn, Lester's wife, Jane's mother, thinks success is the answer to finding beauty.  The substance of the plot is that before Lester dies, he is released from an insipid monotonous life and gets to experience his life's beauty to the fullest in his last year-though it is tragic he dies after he has just found beauty.    <br />Some common stereotypes are broken in this film.  For example, the fact that physical beauty comes second to internal beauty.  This is shown in the film by the fact that we are unable to really accept Angela as beautiful because of her misleading and overall repulsive personality-though she is physically very pretty.  This film challenges the viewer (with a series of disassociative affects i.e. rose pedals, hallucinations, overacting, Ricky's films) to look closer than the surface to find the fundamental truth, and thus beauty, within.  The film does not give an exact answer to what is beautiful-that is left for the viewer to do, which invites the viewer to look more closely at life and to think.  <br />Women are objectified in this film because they are examplesof separate incidences of beauty.  Carolyn always wears a façade (which we see break down at the house she is trying to sell) and will do anything to appear successful to those who are viewing her (this is why she closes the blinds before she breaks down).  Jane is objectified through Ricky's camera, he is always filming her and through his film, we see a side of Jane that is genuine and beautiful.  Angela is viewed by Lester and acts accordingly, because she likes to be objectified and watched.  Throughout the film, women are viewed through the lenses of men-and they, in turn, internalize this panopticon in the way that they act and thus appear.    <br />This film intersects aspects of race, social and economic class-the families we view are Middle American, middle class, middle management (and our main character Lester is middle aged).  This encompasses a broad range of people who can therefore identify with the film as \\"normal,\\" until they disassociate due to cinematic effects and critique the characters repute with the intensification of the film.  Through the challenge of the film (tag line: \\"...look closer\\") we see that we can find our own beauty, and not simply commodify the beauty forced on us by other Hollywood films.
B000002BSV|5.0|is this suede's best album? probably not..that would probably be dogman star..but this is their most radio friendly album, and that isn't a bad thing. This is probably their most accessible album as well. A good introduction to the band..and I'd recommend picking up Dogman Star as well.
B000021Y77|5.0|Run Lola Run  A Review by Ashley McBride<br />In this film, Lola is a very un-stereotypical heroine who undergoes three nearly identical episodes in which to save her lover Manny from his mob boss.  <br />The character of Lola critiques the Hollywood mainstream heroine in many ways.  She is not a contrived Hollywood beauty.  She has bright orange/red hair and punk clothing which offer a disassociative affect for the viewer, allowing them to critique the mainstream heroine and the priorities of Hollywood to alter her into a commodity rather than a true hero.  She also has superhuman ability, first to alter outcomes (chaos theory) and second, to see into the future (snapshots).  This also offers the viewer a chance to disassociate with her because she is unlike the viewer; though she seems real, is she?  She is saving he.  This is a main point because this allows the viewer to critique the \\"damsel in distress\\" role that females normally play.  Lola takes control.  This is prevalent especially when the exact translation of the German title is given \\"Lola Runs.\\"  This title more accurately portrays Lola in control-a genuine hero who is motivated to succeed so much so that she risks her life in three episodes/ tries.  Lola remains a hero the whole way through the film, unlike most mainstream Hollywood heroines.  Though she is unable to help Manny (because he ends up helping himself) she still gets there on time with the money retrieved (in a legitimate manner) in the last episode.  She tried, tried again, and then succeeded-which makes her the hero of the story.  <br />The cinematic effects of camera angle, cartooning, and electronic weaving all serve to disassociate the viewer from the film, in order to step back and critique it.  This film is fun because it challenges society to co-produce instead of just take in a film.  <br />Lola is objectified throughout the film, but not in a Hollywood manner.  She is usually shown as an entire woman-not as fragments of one (Lolais not a breast, a leg, etc.).  Lola is the object of the panoptical gaze, but is unaffected in her cause.  She runs not because she is told to and is being watched to ensure that she does, but runs because she wills herself to do so, and takes no care in anyone watching.  This is proven when she robs a bank (laws do not matter) and goes into the casino with casual clothes (appearances do not matter).  Thus Lola breaks the objectification by the panopticon set by institutions because she could care less that they exist.  Even when her father tells her she does not look good she is unaffected in her cause and ignores the comment.  This is just another way Lola as a hero breaks Hollywood mainstream heroines who care very much in rules and appearances and therefore are affected by the way in which they are being watched.  <br />Lola Runs!
B000002J09|5.0|pure and simple..led zep 4 is one of the greatest records of all time. to sit and rate the induvidual tracks is futile..but i will say this...and please don't lynch me..stairway to heaven is not the best song in this album. in my opinion, that honour would go to either rock n roll, black dog, or misty mountain hop..but in the end, what does it matter?
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is a great movie!! I really like that there is no bad language too. And for people who are scared that this movie is scary, I don't think it is at all, and i'm only 13.One of the funnies parts(I think)is after the battle at Helm's Deep. When Legolas walks up to Gimli,(who is siting on a dead orc)and says,\\"Final count-meaning how many orcs he killed-42.\\" then Gimli says,\\"42? Oh, that's not bad for a pointy-eared elvish princeling.I myself am sitting pretty on 43.\\" Then as quick as a flash, Legolas whips out his bow and arrow and shoots the orc gimli was sitting on. \\"43.\\" he says. Then Gimli says,\\"He was already dead.\\" Legolas:\\"He was twitching.\\" Gimli,\\"He was twiching!? That's because he's got my axe ebedded in his nevous system!!\\" as he shakes the axe that's in the orcs head! ...Anyway, this is a great movie go see it.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles string of groundbreaking hit albums extended into 1968 with \\"The Beatles\\", a double album more commonly referred to as \\"The White Album\\". It spent 9 weeks at number one and sold millions of copies. The first Batles double album, it is regarded as the greatest album ever made.<br />Disc 1 begins with the sonic whirl of \\"Back In The USSR\\", Paul's hard rock answer to The Beach Boys' \\"California Girls\\". Next comes John's soft but powerful \\"Dear Prudence\\", which features stunning acoutic guitar work. Lennon's \\"Glass Onion\\" is filled with the acid - tongued humor much of his later work included, and makes sly referrences to \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"I Am The Walrus\\". Next comes Paul's bouncy singalong \\"Ob - La - Di, Ob - La - Da\\", my faorite song on both disks. \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" and \\"The Continuing Adventures Of Bungalow Bill\\" are album filler. Next comes George Harrison's sweeping epic \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", featuring a searing Eric Clapton guitar solo. \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" is an odd John concoction; eerie, but it works. \\"Martha My Dear\\" is Macca's endearing classic about his dog. \\"I'm So Tired\\" is John at his acerbic best. \\"Blackbird\\" is a swift and touching Paul composition, essentially a solo number. \\"Piggies\\" is a hauntingly funny George composition that took on new meaning after the Manson Murders. \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" is a Dylan - style folk number written and sung (in a loud sorytelling voice) by Paul. \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" is Ringo's stunning debut composition. Most people hate it, but I like it, especially the bouncy and exhuberant carousel - style organ intro. \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\" is nothing more than a song about having sex in the middle of the road. \\"I Will\\" is short but beautiful. \\"Julia\\" is John's mournfullybeautiful song about his mother.<br />Disc 2 begins with another classic rocker, \\"Birthday\\", which will have you dancing around the room. \\"Yer Blues\\" is a morbid blues written by John, and \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" is a nice solo Paul composition that is about man's relationship with nature. \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hid Except Me And My Monkey\\" is another great rocker. \\"Sexy Sadie\\" is a nice John number, mellow and soft. Next comes Paul's infamous \\"Helter Skelter\\". Sort of a recursor to heavy metal music, it starts off with a hypnotic guitar solo and ends with Ringo yelling, \\"I got blisters on my fingers\\". \\"Long Long While\\" is an elegant George composition. \\"Revolution 1\\" is just an acoustic version of the hit sinle \\"Revolution\\", the b - side of \\"Hey Jude\\"(which should have been includedon this album) and a number 12 hit on The Billboard Hot 100. \\"Hony Pie\\" is a uplifting 1930s' number by Paul. \\"Savoy Truffle\\" a hunger - inducing George composition with an nfectious beat. \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" is a good John number. \\"Revolution 9\\" is an eerie collection of sounds, not really a song. But I think it's a groundbreaking track and a masterpiece. \\"Good Night\\" is a beautiful lullaby written by John and sung by Ringo.<br />This is a great album that I think everybody (emphasis on everybody) should own. Buy it if you don't already have it. You'll be sorry if you don't listen to me!
0380002930|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to reading Watership Down at first. I was afraid it would be a boring story about talking rabbits that lived out their lives in a warren (and 475 pages of it!). I was completely mistaken. Although, it was about rabbits, in no way were their lives unexciting. The story, in fact, was not boring at all. Richard Adams does an amazing job with this book. He takes an idea that is not particularly enthralling and creates an epic adventure story. The farther I got into the story. The more I wanted to read. It just kept getting better and better. I had to constantly remind myself that the characters were rabbits because they were flawlessly given human traits. Before reading this story, I could not understand why it was so praised. Now I see, however, that this book is truly a masterpiece. I recommend this classic to anyone who likes adventure stories.
0790729725|5.0|Just read on a website somewhere that this movie will be released as a 2 disc special edition in Late August 2004.  So don't buy this flip disc piece of crud.  They should've done this YEARS ago.  Great movie.  Great acting.  Lots of violence.
B0001HAISG|2.0|Well....my little cousin is doing a play on &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, so she had to get inspiration. I told her to go a head and rent Robin Williams in &quot;Hook&quot;. But no, she rents the new version, so I said ok I might as well watch it. I told her to take it back and get her money back from blockbuster. This is a terrible adaption to the Peter Pan story. First goes off as the acting, kids these days suck. This guys performances was worser than Elizabeth Berkley in &quot;Showgirls\\". I mean the special effects have gone better, but this is just too bad. Too too bad actually. <br />This is definitley the worst family film of 2003 next to &quot;Good Boy&quot;. Please, if you want to show your kids a great family film, try toy story or pee wee's big adventure. Or if you want to show them a peter pan movie, its all about robin williams in Hook.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|To many, Marillion will always be that &quot;Scottish Prog-metal band&quot; from the 80's that sounded like Genesis..<br />Well, I didn't think that then, and I don't, especially now. <br />Marillion stands above any of the neo-prog bands of today like Massive Attack and Radiohead (two band which owe a LOT of credit to Marillion). <br />Marbles is truely a work of art that's as much fun to listen to as anything on the charts these days.  Listen people.. There's a reason their fan base is so rabid. <br />From the (Dare I say)pop goodness of &quot;You're Gone&quot; and &quot;Don't Hurt Yourself&quot; to the thoughful and proggy &quot;Invisible Man&quot; and &quot;Neverland&quot;, there's nary a throw away track on this CD...Even the songs considered to be &quot;pop&quot; are far and above that definition. <br />Granted, some of the music may be hard to grasp at first, but under the layers is good, honest music with meaning. <br />Marbles is a must not only in Marillion fans collections, but in any music lovers. Do yourself a favor, check out Marbles. You can thank me later.

B00004W50T|5.0|I think that the biggest misconception about The Band is that Robbie Robertson is the mastermind behind the whole deal. In truth, many of the members of The Band helped co-write the songs, including stellar performances by Richard Manuel and the often forgotten Levon Helm. Pick up a copy of This Wheel's On Fire, an autobiography by Helm, and you will get more of an insider's look. There is no doubt that Music From Big Pink is a phenomonal album, and that The Band is simply one of the best groups ever comprised. Each individual influence blends with the others to form a truly fresh sound. However, if you want the best of The Band, I suggest you hear them live. I happened to obtain a rare live album from the mid-70s, right before they disbanded, and it is simply my favorite album ever.
B000002IOY|5.0|Overkill are one of the better known second-tier thrash metal bands, but they really deserve better.  This is some completely first-rate thrash here, which anyone who is interested in thrash needs to check out. This is the best of the four Overkill albums that I have, and stands up very well against all but the absolute best thrash albums by Metallica, Sepultura and Anthrax, and surpasses anything I've heard from Slayer, Megadeth, Death Angel, Dark Angel, Exodus or whoever. This is definitely a classic.<br />The most intriguing thing about Overkill is that many of their strenths are not ones you typically find in a thrash band.  Most notably, Ellsworth is quite a good vocalist.  His nasally sneer might annoy some people, but it fits the music suprisingly well, particularly in their somewhat sillier but still dark tracks, like Elimination and I Hate.  They're also ace when it comes to slow groove and doom tracks, and generally display a greater range of mood and styles than your average thrash band.(which is very nicely represented here) They also write some of the best lyrics in thrash, some more playful without people too silly, others darker with out becoming ridiculous. On the downside, they are good, but not truly extraordinary in the more conventionally thrash areas such as leads and rhythm guitar work.  But they're good enough in those fields that their other traits put them over the top.<br />Everything on here is worth listening to, so I'll just cover some of the particular highlights.  Elimination is simply excellent.  It's got tons of energy and bouncy, Anthrax-ish feel to it, and is very catchy. The epic doom track Skullkrusher is the absolute standout. It's got fabulous vocals and a slow, pounding groove like no other.  Another very catchy chorus as well.  Birth of Tension is perhaps the most interesting straight up rocker.  It's still got some solid dynamics though, and the middle break is quite fantastic.  Who Tends the Fire is another slow epic, even more atmostpheric than Skullkrusher, though not quite as memorable overall.  The title track is a sort of epic ballad.  It's more deliberately paced and less formulaic than most thrash ballads, and has a great ending as well.  It closes with the ferocious Evil Never Dies, probably the most intense thing on here but still pretty catchy.<br />Anyway, I'll cut myself off.  You know what thrash is. If you like it in general you ought to like this. A lot.  Check out Horrorscope and Killbox 13 as well.more atmostpheric than Skullkrusher, though not quite as memorable overall.

B0001Z53AQ|1.0|I think Eminem's a racist, don't you?
B00005JMEW|5.0|I'm gonna say up front that for the purposes of this review I'm interested in the movie itself rather than the actual DVD, though I will say that you probably ought to wait around for the set with Volume 2 as well, which should be coming out late this year.(No real specifics are available about it, that I'm aware of, though it is believed that it'll have the extended and colorized scenes from the Japanese cut, which the first DVD release doesn't have, on top of being a complete movie, rather than just half of one.)<br />When I first went to see this film way back in October I was not particularly excited and a tad ambivalent.  I'd seen and loved Reservoir Dogs, but I hadn't seen Jackie Brown or Pulp Fiction, and I didn't really know much of anything about Kill Bill.  But my friends wanted to go and I'd heard some good reviews so I checked it out. I was, to put it lightly, highly impressed.  It is, as people often describe Tarantino's work, a movie about and based on other movies, rather than on reality.  But that's alright, cause I find movies to be much more entertaining than reality, and this is my favorite movie of 2003, bar none. (Which is particularly impressive, considering that it's only half a movie)<br />One of the most common criticisms of this film is that it is too derivative. My response to this is twofold. 1. It's not really particularly derivative as far as genre film-making goes.  Action movies are the probably the most clich&eacute;d genre of film, with the possible exception of the horror movie. 2. I don't really care either way, as I'm not really looking for anything original when I see an action movie. I'm looking for nicely choreographed violence, and anyone looking for anything else shouldn't go see action movies. And that, obviously, goes for anyone considering seeing this, too. (That is, until it is released with Volume 2, which isn't action-oriented, and would completely change the dynamics of the film)<br />All that said, this isn't as action-oriented as most reviewers make it out to be. It is, however, almost utterly visually and atmospherically oriented, which is sorta the same thing, or at least has much the same effect. Thus, character development is held to a minimum, and the dialogue is not up to Tarantino's standards, but the visuals never cease impress and the soundtrack is completely perfect.  It mixes things up well from a visual standpoint, moving from simple, unadorned hospitals to an anime style sequence to intentionally cheesy and phony miniature sets to some exquisite Japanese visuals, particularly the snowy garden at the end.(The eerie, red sunset alongside the plane is particularly noteworthy as well)  It combines the simple with the beautiful with the cheesy with the blood-splattered, and they all work.<br />The film is divided into 5 chapters, which each play as a sort of vignette, (though they involve the same characters, obviously) which eventually comes together when you see it all.  The problem is, you don't see it all until you've seen Volume 2, which is compounded by the fact that this volume contains the scenes which are most tangential in the film. Thus, it is a movie of great scenes, not all of which may be terribly relevant to the rest of the story, but all of which entertain me, which is far more important, to me anyway.  And, although it doesn't necessarily come to much from a plot standpoint, it all fits together wonderfully stylistically and atmospherically.  Furthermore, all the extra scenes work to create a more complete universe, one which extends beyond the scope of the actual movie.  It's a difficult effect to describe, but I really like it.(It's another thing that you won't fully be able to appreciate until you see Volume 2)  But there's no getting around the fact that Volume 1 alone fails to create a complete, satisfying story.  This doesn't really bother me, but it is a valid criticism.<br />In keeping with the surreal, alternate universe sorta feel of the movie the action is wildly stylized and extremely balletic. More significantly, it is simply stunning.  The main fight in the House of Blue Leaves is simply my favorite action scene in film.  It's beautifully paced and has a smooth, flowing beauty to the choreography which provides a powerful contrast to the absurdly exaggerated gore and carnage of the scene.  The final fight with O-Ren is quite excellent as well.  It's much slower and more deliberate, but has an undeniable intensity to it. (The music for that scene is absolutely perfect, and completely makes the scene.  It fits the mood exactly and is perfectly timed) The other fights are first rate as well.<br />I've referred to how excellent I found the music of this film a number of times, but it requires further examination.  It is schizophrenic, perhaps even more so than the visuals, and manipulates the mood of the film in much the same way.  The cheesy yet effective Nancy Sinatra song from opening credits sets the tone nicely, and the Morricone-esque music from the anime sequence provides a great contrast to the Asian visual theme.(The brief piece that is played as they pan up the assassin's sword is particularly  powerful.)  But I'll cut off the specifics, and suffice to say that I could easily have listed half a dozen more scenes where I find the music to be particularly effective.  Some have complained that the soundtrack was overbearing, and I understand how someone could feel that way, but I personally loved.  It is a bit over the top, I guess, but over the top is what this film requires.<br />Well I've rambled on long enough I suppose, though I don't think I've quite shown how much I love this movie.  Just go check it out if you haven't already, and then go catch the equally excellent second half before it leaves theaters.e action is wildly stylized and extremely balletic.

B00005B36H|5.0|Let me start with a defense of Faaip De Oiad.  The &quot;song&quot; serves as a chilling end to the album and is part of the ideal of the band to question...the radio &quot;caller&quot; may or may not be concocting a hoax, but that is for you to decide.  All of this has been written elsewhere.<br />I have seen and heard Tool referred to as &quot;The Radiohead of Metal&quot;.  This is a misnomer, as Tool works within the aesthetics of hard rock and metal, pushing boundaries without mistakenly going outside the framework of the initial sound of the band.  Radiohead has all but abandoned the sound of &quot;The Bends&quot;, believing that &quot;OK Computer&quot; was the furthest that three-guitar attack anthems could possibly go.  Tool is breathtakingly cohesive as a unit, creating a synergy that is unparalelled in modern music (only the cohesiveness of Led Zeppelin immediately jumps to mind).  Lateralus is the logical progression in the development of an innovative, yet extremely focused band.  Consider the genre of Tool, whether you consider it to be Metal, Alternative Metal, Hard Rock, etc.  No other band operating within these genres can lay claim to the skill that Tool displays through masterful changes in dynamics, powerfully unique vocals and musicians that are actually far more technically proficient than the majority of their peers (especially when taken as a whole).  <br />In my opinion, it is difficult to dismiss Tool as &quot;pretentious prog-rock&quot; just because the band is surrounded by so many other bands that lack vision and the ability to construct a sonic blueprint that is not derivative ten times over.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|Without a doubt the album with the most attitude and style of her three albums. I am a fan and now I am an even bigger fan. You have to listen to &quot;Rearview&quot; and &quot;Heavy on my heart&quot;. Her voice is just incredible.
0553062182|4.0|certainly interesting, i did recognise myself, many times.  in particular, i was intrigued (and still questioning) about the idea of &quot;persona&quot;.  the author has a wide view and throws up some very intersting vignettes e.g. the general sense of &quot;disappointment&quot; with other people sometimes.  The book partially strengthened by resolve to take some counselling (something I have strongly resisted) and, so far anyhow, it has been v. interesting.<br />if i have one criticism, it is the assumption of Shyness.  &quot;Intuitiveness&quot; has an outward - looking function - this creates a certain tension for HSP's, which I know only too well.... one can be friendly, warm, intuitive but not want to be &quot;overwhelmed&quot; with stuff, it is not really the same as the wallflower phenomenon.... but this is hard to explain.<br />i feel the criticism of other reviewers re. HSP as being &quot;special&quot; is not really deserved ... the author I feel does understand &quot;it takes all sorts&quot; and gives credit for everyone's strengths ... she just makes the point (quite reasonably I think) that HSP are often misunderstood and underestimate themselves.<br />For a more indepth approach to many questions raised, I highly recommend Mid-Life Spirituality and Jungian Archetypes by Janice Brewi and Anne Brennan.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I'm just a general fan of bands doing something completely different.  So many sounds and styles are combined in this album and it's a great example of what a creative band, a good producer, and time in the studio can do.
0316666343|5.0|From the moment I read \\"My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973,\\" I was sucked into The Lovely Bones, by Alice Sebold.  The story is told by fourteen year-old Susie, freshly arrived in the heaven from which she narrates her story.  I was forced to ponder the contents of this book so much, that in the days after I had ceased reading the book, I was still thinking about it's contents. To have a girl who is the same age as me, and has been raped and murdered, tell about the things going on in the lives of the people she left on Earth, was depressing, but in an appealing sort of way.<BR> In the book, I was often upset at the characters in the story. Susie's body was so close to everybody, yet the police could not find it. If they had really wanted it to be discovered, then they would have uprooted every inch of the cornfield, not resting until they uncovered it.  I was also thoroughly upset that Susie's father was right about Mr. Harvey, yet the police pretty much refused to heed his suspicions.  Susie's mother's affair with Len, the chief investigator in her case, was also extremely upsetting.  I lost all respect I had for her throughout the book.  She was so selfish, it was appalling.  True, she took care of her children, and was the \\"perfect mom\\" in every way, but, after Susie's death, she never thought of her children.  Her only thoughts were, \\"How can I free myself from this place?\\"<BR> I was often regretful that Susie would not get to experience life, that she would have to live through her family and friends.  Any experiences that she had were through family members like Lindsay, her sister, or friends like Ray, her one and only love.  I wondered what it would be like to watch as my family and friends attempted to cope with my death.  Would it tear my family apart?  <BR> This was the kind of book that compelled you to think about it after you paused in your reading.  It opened my eyes to the cruelty and unfairness of this world, more than the stories I have heard or seen on the news.  How is it that the sickness of one man could unleash such a wave of sorrow on one family, one town, one country?  Because of all the Mr. Harvey's out there, the world we live in today is unsafe for children of all ages.  It is only people like Mr. Harvey who take pleasure in the innocence of children, the trustingness that their type have forced adults to lose.  If only these people could restrain themselves, the children, parents, and the world would have one less burden to lose sleep over.  If only books like The Lovely Bones were able to awaken the awareness of the harm of such \\"fun.\\"  If only people would listen and respect the lessons and lectures Alice Sebold gives in-between the lines of her incredibly well-written book.  Then, maybe we could take a great leap for mankind, a giant step towards the ever sought after American Dream.
B000056NX5|3.0|The reason I got this new DVD of JCS, is that i've never seen the play performed live, and this would get me closer to it than the 1973 movie version. Well, sort of. First of all, it's not neccesarily a faithfull live performance. The work of cameras, the edition, the need of presenting it \\"like a movie\\", take a little of that notion. And second, this is just another adaptation of the live play. Not the first, nor the last. <BR> Is it ejoyable for those who only know the '73 movie?. Well, I kinda liked it. My guess is that if you love the play, you'll like this DVD, because it's all about the songs and the play. But certainly, I cannot say that, as a whole, this DVD is better than the old movie.<BR> The \\"modernized\\" enviroment is intended, I guess, to give the play an \\"updated\\" feeling. JCS for the new generations. But the street looks of the stage, the grafittis, the Nazi/Darth Vader-like costumes of the authorities and guards, and other elements, compromise compatibility. I mean, the message of Jesus Christ is universal, but the time and place in which events took place were unique. More than updated, the historical facts look out of place. <BR> OK, maybe it's just a false impression. Some would argue that the '73 movie version had the same flaws, with, among other things, roman guards in jeans and construction helmets. But since the movie was filmed in locations close to the originals in place and looks, details like modern costumes were easier to overlook.<BR> Regarding the voices, most of the singers are wonderful. I was specially impressed by Tony Vincent (Simon), Fred Johanson (Pilate) (by the way, he sounds so much like the judge in The Trial, in Pink Floyd's The Wall), and Renee Castle (Mary Magdalene). But the leads...Jerome Pradon (Judas) has a good voice, but the problem is the way he sings. Too many breaks in his singing becomes anoying. And the scene of Judas' final moments is awful. He choses to be somewhere between singing and screaming, with poor results. It's a shame, because in some parts he shows that he has a great range and powerful voice, but he just choses not to use all of this potential most of the times. And he shares another problem with Glen Carter (Jesus). They rather did the high notes of the songs with an elevated soft voice, not a powerful one. That produces changes in the key of the songs that are not pleasant. And they share another problem: sometimes, they look unconfortable in front of the camera. Check for instance the Gethsemani scene. Finally I was completely disappointed with Rik Mayall's voice (Herod).<BR> Ok, I know I'm making an unfair judgement. After all, the singing in the '73 movie version was pre-recorded, and all the actors did was to lip-synch, and sure, they chose the better takes, so the margin of error was absent. But then again, I'm talking about things that will be noticeble by those who are \\"used\\" to that old version.<BR> But of course, not all is bad. The handling of lights and cameras is excellent. And a couple of scenes are very powerful and impressive, not only in performance, but also in a cinematic sense: the trial before Pilate, and the crucifixtion (the problem is that they are interrupted by the \\"Superstar\\" song performance, in which Judas and dancing exotic girls are singing around Jesus carrying the cross, a scene that is somewhat shocking  and was \\"softened\\" in the '73 version).<BR> In conclusion, if you are a fan of the old movie, and want to see or get this DVD, think of it as an alternate version, but not necessarily \\"better\\".

Even though it's all in Russian, if you've heard the English version, you get the idea of what it's talking about. If you don't know Russian, just listen b/c they have really powerful voices and emotions. I think the Russian versions have a lot more power b/c it's their native language. The English versions are awesome too,but the Russian versions kick butt!I love ALL of their songs, but all-in-all, this album rocks and is well worth the money! Enjoy!

B0000028UK|5.0|I got into Pearl Jam after Yield, in 1998 I think, and was stunned by their musicianship and song writing ability, which is evident throughout the album. Then I tried Ten because I enjoyed Yield so much, and was surprised. Yield is mostly melodic with the odd rocker, but Ten is all out solid rock music with a dark, depressing feel. So, I had to try Vs, and was once again surprised.<br />At first listen, I was almost disappointed. The first three songs, Go, Animal and Daughter hit me with typical PJ style. The fast paced aggression gets you into the mood, and you can really feel the strain Vedder puts into the vocals. But, I was stunned by how mundane the rest of the album was. I became agitated, Glorified G made me press skip due to dull repetition, Dissident was good at first but ran out of steam, WMA summed up agitation, Blood had no melody, and I just stopped, and put in Yield.<br />Then I decided to give my undivided attention to the album, really try each song. And this time, I was pleasantly surprised. Go, Animal and Daughter are deceiving, I thought (naively) that the whole album would be on the same tone. Most of the songs are unique, and remarkable. I still become bored with Glorified G, but I love the rest of the album for its experimental styles. I can honestly say now that Vs contains a whole variety of exceptional songs, and my favourite is probably Rearviewmirror, the guitar riff is extraordinary and reminiscent of the Ten era riffs. Rats has a great funky drum beat accompanied by the best bass line on the album, the chorus is catchy and has some thought provoking lyrics. Elderly Woman Behind The counter In A Small Town is a solid vocal ballad, very much the same for the closer Indifference, a great contrast between the beginning and end. Where Ten lacks, Vs revels. Ten is very straight forward rock music from start to finish, with the exception of the beautiful Black. Vs on the other hand has a great mixture of styles, which makes it unique, I won't say better.<br />Highlights: The two opening tracks, Go and Animal have a typical PJ feel to them, great way to start the album. Daughter is less aggressive and more melodic, very solid song. Dissident grew on me, catchy guitar riff. Rearviewmirror is good on first listen and exceptionally good on second hearing, everything is perfect, among PJ's best ever. Rats, for its funky feel, WMA for its tribal style drumming and the closer Indifference is a nice way to end a great album.say better.<br />Highlights: The two opening tracks, Go and Animal have a typical PJ feel to them, great way to start the album.

Some people complain that this is too soft for Scorpions, but personally I prefer ballads and soft rock, not a hard core rock, and I even made my own compilation only from the ballads.

0385470819|4.0|Is race a main factor in our courts today? It all depends who you ask. Some people would say race is irrelevant.  This book shows how race determines what the outcome in a trial could be.<br /> It all began in Clanton, a small town located in Mississippi. One day a little girl was walking to the store when all a sudden she was jumped by two white men.  The men beat and raped her. The girl's name is Tonya and name of the men are Ray Cobb and Pete Willard.  The men were about to be tried in court when the girl's father whose name is Carl Lee decided to take revenge.  He blasted Cobb and Willard into tiny pieces.  Carl Lee hired a lawyer named Jake to defend him in court.  Then the town of Clanton became a national spotlight.  Hundred of journalists came to Clanton to cover the trial of Carl Lee.  Even the KKK returend to Clanton,  who were banned from the town 25 years ago.  The trial was a long one.  To find out if Carl Lee was found guilty or not guilty you have to read the book.<br />  From my perspective,  the book is well written thats why it is good.  The book is kind of long,  but I thought it was worth it.  The only problem with the book it lacks interest half way through. The book was so good I even encouraged my sister and brother to read it.  I hope you can enjoy the book the same way I did.

B0001DI0FI|2.0|I have been an avid reader of the Aubrey-Maturin series.O'Brian was a purist and developed intense, believable characters. This film, unfortunately disappoints. The inane mis-casting of Russell Crowe, with his innapropriate Aussie drawl, is the biggest flaw. He in now way portrays the original character, either in stature or speech.The same can be said for Maturin, who is the \\"raison d'etre\\" for most of the missions undertaken by H.M.S. Surprise. If one wishes to see the fullness of this crime, read the series.I was soooo dismayed to see this in the theaters. The entire emphasis seems to be on the visual aspects of this work, which standing on their own are creditable, although lacking in many ways to show the immensity of the seafarer's world in Aubrey's time. I can only pray, that like \\"Mutiny on The Bounty\\", this great epoch will be revisited by artists with clearer intellect and vision. Sorry, but I can not recommend this juvenile epic in any regard.
B00008PBZW|2.0|Everything is here for me to have a very enjoyable movie experience. Nic Cage, Christian Slater, John Woo, a war movie dealing with US Marines....so what happened.<BR>   Well the first thing is the technical errors. They just wont be tolerated anymore, not after Saving Pvt.Ryan,Black Hawk Down, and Band of Brothers. You have to get the uniforms right, and you certainly must get the battle scenes accurate. This film does niether. The battle scenes for the south pacific are very inaccurate as are these mish mashed uniforms. Realism went out the window.<BR>   Next we have the story of the Navajo code talkers which get very little play. Instead the main story revolves around the tormented Sgt.played (very well) by Nic Cage. It is an intresting character but Woo doesnt give even Cage the proper time and set-ups. <BR>  I cant help but wonder whats gone on with John Woo since coming to America. He has not matched the outstanding work he did in HongKong , let alone surpassed it. FaceOff is as close as he has come to his previous films. I wonder if the Hollywood system has had an adverse effect. Or has Mr. Woo just gotten tired?<BR>  I for one miss the &quot;bullet ballets&quot;, the &quot;over the top&quot;melodrama, and the wonderfully metaphorical imagery. I will continue to hope that the great John Woo returns to his groundbreaking crime heroic/bloodshed movies of yesterday. Perhaps he should have a Tequila Pop and think about it.

The most original film I'v seen since Fight Club. You want to watch it over and over again.<BR>   I think that about covers my bit-o-praise for this film.

B000008GHW|5.0|This album compiled tracks very close to completion after Hendrix's death. This is definitely worth checking out. I'm a bit surprised that this is out of print, as I feel that this is a better album than most of the later collections of unreleased Jimi.  Came out here to find a cd version to purchase, but it looks like I will have to transfer my Lp to cd-r myself.Puzzling why this album was allowed to go out of print, but again so is the predatory nature of lawsuit-crazed, corporate record companies.
B0000AOV85|5.0|If I had to be isolated on a desert island with only one album it would be this one.  Not a rock and roll album --a teaching. I would like to be listening to it in my last moments on earth.
0446310786|4.0|After reading the phenominal novel &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;, I can definitely understand why it has been named a classic.  This book is packed with lessons and morals, has great character development, and leaves a lasting impression on the reader.  <BR>    One of the reasons I enjoyed this novel is because I admired the character Atticus, for his good character and strong convictions.  He was presented with defending an African American man in an extremely segregated town, and although it was guaranteed he would lose no matter how convincing his trial was, he still took it on as if he had a fair chance of winning, and put up an amazing argument.  I also loved how he put his heart into his trial, and really stood up for his belief against prejiduce.  Even with practically the whole town believing themsleves superior to people of other colors, Atticus had good morals, and fought for what was just.  <BR>   Scout was another character I particularly liked, because she was rambunctious, stubborn and independant.  She demonstrated how a young girl can really make a difference and have an impact on peoples lives.  Gem also showed unique character changes as he went through adolescence throughout the novel.  His personailty starting off soft and kind and then trasnforming to tough and boyish was an example of great character development, and amusing as well.  <BR>   Overall this book taught me so much about standing up for what you believe in and the realities of prejiduce.  I also learned from Boo Radley that you cannot judge a person until you know them.  The trial also intrigued me because I have an interest in law.  The only reason I would not give it 5 stars is because some parts were slow and uninteresting, where it was hard for me to read on.  Aside from that minor negative, so much can be derived from this novel and I definitely reccomend it.
0452282152|4.0|this is an exciting book that keeps the reader wondering if Catharina will ever discover Griet and the painter, Vermeer's secret. They share a bond and a single piece of jewelerly, a pearl earring. By the time Griet finds out how much she ment to Vermeer, she already has a family and Vermeer had passed away. This book will keep the reader occupied for hours
B00000DATR|5.0|To say this is Tubular Bells is a vast understatement.  Of course..there are the familiar themes, however, this totally blows you out of the water with the haunting themes and guitar solos throughout.  This is Mike Oldfield's best work to date.  He shows again that not only is he an original in his field, but, pays very close attention to the sounds that are going on around him.  <BR>A lot of this reminds me of Enigma and Fragma all rolled into one Celtic package.  Trust me, it's a good thing.  The vocals and songs here are truly beautiful and just lift this interpretation along the way.  I spent several hours playing this just apprectiating how the layers of sound just seem to grab you in and keep you there.<BR>A must for any fan, let alone trance and Celtic listeners.  You will not be disappointed at all.
B00003CWL6|5.0|\\"American Beauty\\" is a movie that doesn't completely go along with the normal Hollywood movie, in many ways it mocks it.    \\"American Beauty\\" exemplifies beauty in a range of different ways.  Towards the beginning of the movie Angela, the typical blond, good-looking, nice figured, sexual woman represents the typical view on \\"beauty.\\"   Angela did everything to go with the \\"norm\\" of society.  She viewed herself as someone who was always being watched; therefore she always had to present herself as a \\"model\\" of sorts.  This touches bases with 20th century philosopher Foucault's notion of the Panopticon.  Pan meaning \\"all\\" and opticon meaning \\"seeing.\\"  She feels as though if she isn't always looking as she \\"should\\" then she will develop a guilty conscious because she is in some ways letting down all the people who are constantly watching her.  Therefore performing to the panopticon notion.  This forces Angela to make herself out to be something she is not.  Throughout the movie she makes herself seem as though she is a very sexually active \\"vixen\\" because this is how she feels she has to be portrayed.  As the movie proceeds we find out that maybe all this has been a phasade and perhaps she isn't as she seems.  <BR>          \\"American Beauty\\" also produces existing stereotypes and critiques them.  As stated an example of an existing stereotype is Angela, the good-looking blond women.  Jane, Angels \\"friend,\\" represents the part of the movie that critiques these existing stereotypes.  Jane, the rebellious teenager, realizes that she is not perfect based upon traditional society \\"norms.\\" of how she should look.  She doesn't have the perfect body, she doesn't have the long blond hair, nor does she dress like Angela but she is happy enough with herself.  She doesn't care what her family, friends or society tell her to do to change her apperance.  A few times in the movie her mom, Carolyn, tell her that she looks depressed and that basically she doesn't look or act as she should.  In my opinion this is the movies way of critique the idea of typical societal \\"norms.\\"  It's showing that you don't have to look a certain way in order to be beautiful.  <BR>        Ricky, Jane's next door neighbor, helps point out the difference between \\"real\\" beauty and \\"ideal\\" beauty.  Ricky is considered to be the odd outsider.  He is constantly filming everything he considers beautiful.  His main filming target always seems to be Jane even though she is not considered to represent \\"ideal\\" beauty.  This flusters Angela because she doesn't understand why Ricky is so interested in Jane and not in herself.  In one sequence of the film Ricky is taping from his house into Jane's room and Angela notices.  Angela immediately starts to pose in front of the window for Ricky, but Ricky doesn't pay any attention to her \\"ideal\\" beauty.  Instead Ricky focuses the camera to a target that represents more \\"inter\\" and \\"real\\" beauty, Jane who is looking into a mirror beyond Angela.  This shows us that the general stereotypes for beauty are not always what represent actual beauty.          <BR>     I really enjoyed this movie.  It really kept me thinking and not bored throughout it.  It also provides those twists and turns that you may not have seen coming.  This movie does a great job to both show and critique many stereotypes about beauty.  I highly recommend watching \\"American Beauty.\\"
1592400876|5.0|This is the one book I really wanted to pick up on a trip to London, England a couple of months ago.A best seller there, lo and behold, it has become a must-have in Canada as well! I had an English teacher from Yorkshire in high school, who drummed into all of us the importance of correct punctuation: errors drive me mad to this day,especially in business correspondence. My boss is getting a copy of this book, just as soon as I can get my hands on another copy.
B00008YJH5|5.0|This is one of the great rock recordings of all time. In the sixties, there was Dylan with Highway 61 Revisited, the Beatles with Rubber Soul, Big Brother with Cheap Thrills, Jimi Hendrix with Are You Experienced. In the seventies, there was Patti Smith with Horses and the Ramones. In the eighties, there was the first Pretenders album and there was Surfer Rosa. In the nineties, there was Nevermind. It's too early to know what will be a classic from this decade, but too late not to know that Surfer Rosa helped make the eighties worthwhile.<br />I can't add much to 100-plus reviews below. This is the Pixies at their most energetic. There isn't a bad moment. Kim Deal doesn't get cooler or funnier than &quot;This is a song about a superhero named Tony...&quot; You can't go wrong with Surfer Rosa. Buy it now and congratulate yourself later.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|I enjoyed this movie in spite of some of the unrealistic items such as everyone is in period clothing except Julia Roberts.  If you can overlook things like this and also the improbable storyline then the movie is engrossing and entertaining.
B0001HAISG|1.0|The movie is pretty good but if one shells out the $$ for this DVD, one is forced by the manufacturer to watch previews up front and that warrants a negative rating.<br />I totally resent being forced to view any preview on any DVD I buy - and the DVD player I own will NOT skip ahead with this DVD as it does with the other DVD's we own.<br />Take my advice - buy the video tape version and fast forward past all the crappy previews.
B000008LOV|5.0|When I first heard this album, I was blown away. I never imagine that these five guys would get together and make a album. I love this one and volume 3 as well. This is the best since The Beatles. Long live The Traveling Wilburys!!!! Rest in peace Roy and George, we miss you very much.
0393324818|5.0|Michael Lewis is a fine writer and Billy Beane is a man of genius. This book puts the lie to Bud Selig's assertion that money alone creates competetiveness, and further describes the new realities of power offense vs. &quot;little ball,&quot; and how a relief pitcher can be found to fill holes for one season.
B00014TQ7S|4.0|This CD is great. It is the perfect summer driving music. It makes me feel like dancing!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece.  He  has combined  elements of king fu movies, old Japanese samurai shows, and cowboy westerns to create a great action movie.  Uma Thurman is so great as a former assassin who turns into an angry bride focused on revenge on everyone after her wedding and life are ruined.  This movie is non stop action from beginning to end.  I loved the scene where Uma takes on a roomful of assassins with black masks and swords and kills them all.  Every fight scene is fun to watch.  I loved the fight scene between Uma Thurman and Vivica A Fox.  It was so funny how they stopped fighting and acted like everything was okay when the little girl came through the door.  Lucy Liu gives a wonderful performance as an  tough Asian assassin.  I loved the scene in the movie where she slices off a person's head after he insults her.  The Japanese animation sequence looks so good in this movie.  I loved watching the making of the movie where Quentin Tarantino talks about his sources of inspiration for making Kill Bill.  There is a pretty good performance by a female Japanese rock band called 5, 6, 7, 8 that is included on this DVD that I enjoyed.  Kill Bill is the best action movie I've seen in a long time.
0486266885|4.0|This book is defenitly a classic.  It probably could have been of longer.  If it was at least the length of franenstein I am sure I would have given it 5 stars.  The book does a great job of exploring man's dual nature.  It is good for a quick read on a rainy day.  Anyone who wants to say they've read the classics should read this book.  Of course that is just my opnion, I could be wrong.
B0001D0FTW|5.0|This is the best release Edguy has ever put their name on IMO. \\"Hellfire Club\\" is a masterpice, and I'm very impressed with it. The whole CD is full of power fom start to finish....    There are no fillers here. None. Edguy has really moved forward here, and this is a huge step towards greatness IMO. If you're not familiar with Edguy, I highly recommend \\"Hellfire Club\\" and \\"Theater Of Salvation\\" as the wonderful place to start....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't buy box sets. I'm cheap that way. The more money I have with me, the better.  But I bought Firefly. I had seen the show and loved the show despite Fox's foul promotion and general mistreatment of the show.<br />And I'm extremley glad I did find it. Firefly is amazing. The characters are compelling, the plots fantastic, and the dialouge witty and original. Joss Whedon's Firefly is true to all Joss Whedon's shows: brilliantly acted, amazing storylines, characters you fall in love with, everything Firefly equated a truly original amazing show.<br />Go buy Firefly I you're looking for smart, original, excellent entertainment.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|This film has amazing aesthetic quality.  The screen play is somewhat different from the original novel and stage play, but includes classic lines, the same basic story, and certainly the same heartwarming theme of a boy who won't grow up and a girl who realizes she must.  The young actors who play Peter and Wendy put on an impressive performance.  There are long trailers in the beginning, but it's worth it.

0671027344|4.0|The Perks of being a Wallflower is a very good book for teenagers to read.  The main character Charlie is stuck in the hard times of being a teen.  Although, reading it will make your problems fell way less severe.  The Perks of being a Wallflower is a good book to read to understand the life of a teenager, family life problems, and dealing with them.<BR> In the book Charlie had to see many doctors and therapists for problems he doesn't even know about until the end of the book.  Charlie kind of has a communication problem.  He didn't really have any friends, until he met Sam and Patrick.  He falls in love with Sam.  She doesn't seem to feel the same way about him though.  It all works out for the best at the end though.  This just shows the ups and downs of love in a teenager's life.  Also, he experiments with some drugs in the book, and honestly tells you his opinion of what he thinks about them.  Another great thing about the book is that in the letters he writes, it really feels like he's writing to you, and only you.  Sometimes you just want to write back to him and give him advice, but he gives no identity.  In the book there are issues with drugs, homosexuals, sex, and a lot of other important issues, all told through the eyes of Charlie.  <BR> Charlie also faces some family issues.  In the beginning he never really felt loved by his sister.  He loved her so much, but she wasn't showing it back to him.  They resolved the problem, when she got into trouble by having sex. They got closer after that big incident.  Charlie was very close with his Aunt when he was younger. Something tragic happened to her though on the way to get his birthday present. That's when Charlie got in bad shape, and had to see all the doctors.  No one ever really understood why he took it so hard, for such along time.  In the end everything comes together and makes sense about why Charlie is so messed up.  It's a sad but good ending.
B0001N1RU8|4.0|If only more top selling artists had the guts to step away from a proven formula... especially at a time when singing standards seems to be the surefire way of selling large volumes of records(even Cyndi Lauper's doing it, for god's sake!) But this is not just a brave album, it's genuinely a quality one.<BR>  <BR>Instead of simply filling the record with catchy but predictable tunes, Diana experiments beautifully with harmonic structure, and plays around with some solid lyrics.  It's more than background music; this one actually demands you to listen, and I for one find something new and exciting in it with each spin. It may be diluted jazz, but if listening to Diana convinces people to pick up a Chet Baker, Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson, or Herbie Hancock record (as it did in my case), then more power to her. Yep, Mrs. Costello certainly turned this 22-year-old into a genuine jazz fan.<br />I'm witholding a star for some of the Krall/ Costello compositions that I think would sound better as performed by Elvis rather than Diana, but I am looking forward to bigger and better things in their future collaborations.
B0001WTUH6|2.0|I had high expectations for this movie, I mean come on, the eternal war between werewolves and vampires with a hot chick starring in it. However I found the movie to be unoriginal, poorly constucted and written, with some of the worst special effects this side of 1990. The filmmakers were too ambitious in my opinion, if they had worked with about $20 million more in the budget it might have been worth seeing. The only good thing about this movie was the cinematography, which was very cool, including some very nice use of filters creating a dark but polished look---think matrix. Otherwise the use of stop-motion was ugly and uninspired, and I found the dialogue to, rather than generate compassion or hatred for the characters, leave me unsimpathetic and uninterested. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|Master And Commander wasn't too shabby. Although I am no Naval Historian, I have seen other peroid pieces (Horatio Hornblower Series, etc...), and they were better in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, the movie was entertaining, but it lacked more action. The final battle scene could have used a little more work also. I understand that close quarter battle needs to look confining, but from a viewer standpoint, it would have been more enjoyable if you could have seen more of the fight. Not quite the epic masterpiece that a lot of people say that it is, but it was entertaining.
0385470819|1.0|I recently finished reading a book titled A Time to Kill, and I have to say it was one of the most boring books that I ever had the misfortune of reading.  The beginning is good there are these to white guys that rape this little girl, then the dad gets all heroic and shoots them up with an M16.  After that the book just crawls on, I felt lucky when something remotly exciting happened every hundred pages or so.  Not only that, the ending was very disapointing....well, less disappointing more completly unrealistic.  All in all I would rather close my hand in a car door than read this book again, and if it was possible i would have given this book zero stars but the minimum was one.
0671027344|4.0|Charlie is the main character of the book and he is writing a letter to all of the people that read this book but you really never find out about who he is writing to until the end. His friends Sam and Patrick also help him through out his life and help him deal with some problems along the way. The book also helps cover some things about how the life of a teenager is and what they all go through everyday. Charlie is basically a typical teenager too, he does drugs, experiments stuff with many different people and likes to go out with a lot of different girls.<BR>I thought that this book was an ok book to read in school. The book had many ups and downs and a lot of things would change from time to time. In the end, I think that this is a good book for kids to read in class at their high school or they can just read on their own.
0316666343|2.0|Set in the 70's, this is the story about a young girls rap and murder.  Suzie Salmon, which is the murder victims name, watches from a temporary heaven, while her family tries to deal with her death and the out comes are. Or what the future has to come for her family, friends and murder.<BR>Mr. Salmon, Suzie's father, has a very difficult time dealing with his oldest daughters death. Mrs. Salmon, Suzie's mother, is dealing with it better than her husband but cannot deal with the fact that he cannot get over her death and ends up leaving him.  Lindsay, is Suzie's younger sister, she is sad because of her sisters death but cannot stand the fact that every time she walks down the halls at school she hears the whispers, \\" that's the dead girls sister.\\" Ray is Suzie's true love, Suzie is madly in love with him and he returns the feelings. He was very heart broken to learn of her death so he confides in Ruth. Then there is Ruth was a girl who knew of Suzie but didn't really talk to her but after Suzie's death was all most obsessed with her death and continued to write about her and her death in her journals.<BR>Through out the book, there wasn't anything to keep my attention or make me want to keep reading. I felt that the events in the book didn't flow into each other. One part that didn't seem to flow to me when Suzie's spirit took over Ruth's body and she made love to Ray, it didn't really explain how or why that happened to her. I do like the topic of the book. It is a very unique topic and I wondered how she, Alice Seabold, inspired her to write a story about that. Anyone who likes mystery should enjoy this book.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|There has been far and few movies that moved me like this.  Outstanding performances!  Just wonderful.  One of the best films I have ever seen. You must see this one.
B00005JMEW|4.0|What happened to the good old days when movies had a beginning and an end and that was it? People moved on, did other projects, and tried to expand thier boundries with new ideas. Today it seems that it's all about the sequel. Don't get me wrong, I agree that Lord Of The Rings must be shown in three seperate parts, but Bill too? Oh well, such is money making - oops, I mean movie making. On to the review.      This movie was.... odd... but in a good way. Never has there been a movie shown in black and white, color, and anime all in one. The violence was over dramaticised, but it was obviously done on purpose. Odd touch, Quint. The Bushido and martial arts remained plausable unlike Pooping Tiger, Squating Dragon - which is a good thing. I prefer Jackie Chan style plausability in my martial arts. High wire special effects stuff tells me that either the actors were not physically able to perform the stunt (IE. too many twinkies), or we're going \\"comic book\\" where action is concerned. Either way, not entertaining.       The actors did a good job in thier respective roles, and casting was pretty damn good where that goes. Lucy Liu is beautiful, and did a great job. Uma, kudos for your physical work. Julie Dryfus (who's she (?), and Damn, she's hot), Vivica Fox, Michael Madsen, David Carradine, all great picks. But as for Darryl Hannah? Not sure what happened there. She's just not bad guy material. Entertaining movie, but wouldn't own it.       PS. To the whiners that said there was too much violence, you're whiners! \\"Kung Foo\\" movies are violent, go read heart warming stories that you can find in your bible - oh wait, there are none. How about the crucifiction of Christ, that one always gets me all warm and tingley! Say a prayer, eat a holy wafer, and get over it!
B00008EYA5|1.0|This movie actually has no point whatsoever. If there is a plot in this garbage, you'd probably have seen it before. Other than that, this movie has some good scenes of action but the story goes no where and begins from the middle, so you wouldn't actually understand, it's watchable but tasteless and boring. If you want the real deal, get Lethal Weapon 1, 2, 3 or 4.

B000127LW2|3.0|After collecting TNG series You might be very disappointed when opening Voyager Season package. My first impression was that the box set is incomplete, that something is missing. What you get is 5 DVD's packed in the cheapest, orange and slim disk 5-box  which has nothing from the dignity of the movie. It looks like the set is packed with replacement box. The box envelope is not even made of plastic but from thick plastic foil. There is practically no way to smoothly close the box without fastening also cheaply glued back paper cover. What a shame!  The DVD discs looks like they're copied from the original ones, the top side of the disc has almost no print except small and hard to read white information regarded recorded DVD material. For me personally they remind a clean DVD+R/-R discs ready to be burned. The package is designed so badly, that there is no way to avoid fingerprints on the first disc surface when taking out any discs just because this one is not covered with anything! Inserting the disc is also difficult, the center disc holder is so tight that you get the feeling about possible disc damage. Personally I suggest to secure all discs using another package. With original ST-V package your discs will become dirty and even might become damaged in case of accidental squeeze. I give \\"0\\" (zero) stars for packaging.<br />But things become even worse because in US version of season 1 there are 2 episodes missing: \\"Arena&quot; and &quot;The City On The Edge Of Forever&quot;. These two episodes are included in European version of Voyager, isn't it interesting ? Anyway having multiregion dvd-player consider purchase further Voyager Seasons released in Europe. You will get a nice package and as I see more episodes to enjoy. Anyway this is what I'm going to do.<br />The overall 3 stars note comes from the fact that the movie and sound transfer is very good and it deserves 5 stars. Comparing to the older TNG series a picture is much more sharp and clear. For the first time since TNG, I was able to watch ST Voyager on my 105\\" wall projector with no prejudice. But why someone in Paramount decided to release this fantastic series in so shameless box ?  For me this release is just an example of a mistake or ignorance of ST fans :-(t time since TNG, I was able to watch ST Voyager on my 105\\" wall projector with no prejudice.

The untypical male pregnancy is so hilarious that it will relentlessly tickle any viewer's funny bone!

Phillips are simultaneously pregnant. Supporting DeVito and Schwarzenegger are Emma Thompson. Great film!
0375751513|5.0|Oscar Wilde seems to have written a somewhat scathing critique of late nineteenth century English life, or at least that of the upper class. The two main characters, Dorian Gray himself and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton, lead lives of extreme self-indulgence.<br />Lord Henry constantly spews forth his theories and philosophies regarding everything about human nature. Although they are numerous, Henry's ideas can be condensed into one main point. Early in the narrative when he is first exercising his right to influence under the title of mentor, Henry exclaims to Dorian that the only thing worth having is youth. Youth, which is, according to Henry, the only stage where beauty can be found, comes with an ever-present hedonistic lifestyle. This is the template for which the impressionable Dorian bases his life upon.<br />Dorian becomes the ultimate purveyor of self-indulgence and corrupts everything he associates himself with, all the while accompanied on his journeys by a curse of grave implications. To the disappoint of many, I will not give away more of the story; as I'm sure most of you are already salivating over the details I have put forth.<br />The story unfolds at first in a matter of weeks and then jumps several years, yet the focus of the novel does not waiver. This Romantic Period novel is filled with the standard mystery, and a central dealing with human nature. It is well written and comes with excellent detail, as required by this writing period. It also comes with the characteristic whit of Oscar Wilde. The dialogue between characters is excellent and Lord Henry's theories are exquisite often bordering on comical, but always cynical.<br />Wilde seems to warn against the excess of hedonism and uses the story of Dorian Gray as a deterrent. More importantly I believe this is a social critique of high society, which breeds excess and cultivates decadence, while often regarding everything with a selfish eye. The book is filled intellectual quips about human nature and society, yet it is a short book and relatively easy read. This book is required reading for many, so possibly you've already read it, but if not, during commercial breaks of course, give this a try.n nature and society, yet it is a short book and relatively easy read.

B00005B36H|3.0|Overall Synopsis: If you buy this album expecting to get some crappy Nu-Metal BS, first get off this page and please get some better musical taste. Tool is Metal, but it is more a thoughtful and complex type than the likes of which Korn and Slipknot sing, which consists of loud music with loud unhearable loud screaming. If you are planning on getting this album, I would seriously recommend you have a certain amount of patience, as many of the songs on this album have really long build-ups that sometimes enhance, but usually take away from the album. That is basically my biggest complaint, along with it is sometimes hard to hear Maynard's vocals on many songs, as he is a really good singer whos voice is really an instrument on its own(Especially on Parabola).To make a comparison to a rather more commercial band, I would have to say Tool sounds very similar to System of a Down, who has the same distinct guitar and drumming style with a singer who has the same type of voice as Maynard, except System of a Down's songs aren't quite as long as Tool's. But where Tool really screws up this album are in the amount of filler in this album, basically taking up almost 5 of the 13 songs in one sweeping blow, really leaving the listener able to listen to 8 songs unless you want to fall asleep listening to all the songs. If you were wondering why I was prasing Tool so much yet gave Lateralus a bad review, it is mainly because I can only bear to listen to about 6 or 7 songs! I really wish Tool would have taken a little more time with this album and create more new material, instead of just adding in songs that take up time and are usually 4 minutes long! With their obvious musical talent, it amazes me they would waste it on such despicable acts as Disposition and Parabol, where Maynard simply mumbles and whines behind the same guitar riff for about 6 minutes, really toning down the album. Also there is also the semi-retarted Mantra and Faaip de Oaid, which consist of 2 minutes of moaning and about 3 minutes of a staticy voice talking about a hostile alien takeover. Also there is the filler guitar solo Eon Blue Apocolypse, which isn't all that great anyhow in whatever way you look at it. Below I'm going to rate the 8 other songs in order from the ones I least like and the ones I most like at the end, omitting the 5 filler songs, Mantra, Disposition, Eon Blue Apocolypse, Faaip de Oaid, and Parabol. But before I tell you about the songs, I'll just say that some of Tool's songs are dissapointinly slow(Reflection, Ticks and Leeches), while songs like Parabola, Lateralus, and Schism are masterpieces without a doubt. Ratings:<br />#8-Reflection:Although the last 5 minutes are really good, it's just too much when in the other 6 minutes before it almost nothing happens. Briefly Maynard comes on and sings for about 15 seconds in the first 6 minutes, but then unfortuneatly it goes back to the slow beat for another minute. But really the end is really good with haunting lyrics from Maynard (\\"Before we hideaway\\") and some good guitar riffs and drum beats. This song is simply rated so low because it's almost impossible to listen to without dozing off.<br />#7- Ticks and Leeches: I'm kind of surprised Tool did something like this song, as it is basically a Nu-Metal song with Maynard screaming and singing indistinct lyrics, much like a Korn song. Also, I have a big beef that the song \\"takes a break\\" between the minutes 3:30-6:00, really destroying the great beat the song has and it only briefly does the beat and Maynard come back up before the song ends.<br />#6- The Grudge:  This song contains a really good guitar to back up Maynard's great vocals, and this is one of the few songs where you can understand the beautiful lyrics. Great Chorus!<br />#5- The Paitent: Starts off slow, but about 2 minutes 30 seconds in the tempo picks up and the guitar and drums start to pick up, following up the best vocals on the entire album. At about 4:30 the instuments reallystart to pick up and there is some great guitar playing and awesome drumming.<br />#4- Triad: At first listen, this was my favorite song on the album because it's one of the hardest,but then it was downgraded. It starts off with a very frentic drum beat and some cool Middle Eastern noises, and then about 2 minutes in the guitar sweeps in, but not until 3 minutes in does the music really start to pick up, showcasing great musicianship from Tool's instumentalists. Sounds very dark and works well even without Maynard's vocals.<br />#3-Lateralus: After the first minute starts off with a bang with haunting lyrics and vocals from Maynard(\\"Black and White are all I see in my infancy\\"), and it develops into a great chorus. Great drumming!<br />#2- Schism: Almost the best, but not quite. It is notable for being Tool's first real radio hit, and that also ranks it higher. Outstanding vocals from Maynard from the beginning to the end of the song, and great music from the instruments to back him up. This song really builds up all the way<br />to the fever pitch towards the end. Great chorus that makes you bang your head at about 2 minutes 20 seconds in!<br />#1-PARABOLA: This song is EXCELLENT!! This song starts off with a bang, showcasing some heavy guitar playing and feverpitch drumming with some great vocals to boot. Tool easily shifts through musical measures and molds the song into a 6 minute opus that perfectly defines the album with it's beautiful chorus and soothing guitar riffs, perfectly blending the 2.<br />Overall a very good listen that is tarnished by the obtuse amount of filler!ly start to pick up and there is some great guitar playing and awesome drumming. <br />#4- Triad: At first listen, this was my favorite song on the album because it's one of the hardest,but then it was downgraded.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|if you want to hear a great rock/metal.hardcore/screamo/hardcore punk album, THIS IS IT !!!!!!  this band flawlessly and seamlessly combines all of these aspects, bringing something worthy of major recognition. hard screams are interupted by melody and harmony, and then angered screams are combined with harmonies from members off the band. if you want an album thatll make you piss your skivies, get this. its well worth the money !!!!!!!!

Are people too scared to fly in real jets now days to shoot films like they did in top gun, so they reley on computers to do it for them? I think so! The picture might as well be a cartoon because it looks that bad. If you want to see a movie like this see top gun...Better plot, better acting and much better scenes...and all the flying is real in top gun...this one however should find its way to your local landfill and get crushed by a bulldozer!
B000002ULO|5.0|Trite or not, cruel or not, James Paul McCartney creates better under stress and in emotional pain.  Only months after this CD was released, the new Knight Bachelor lost the only woman he believed he'd ever love.  Surely, even though the press was being assured Linda was &quot;fine&quot;, she wasn't, the fact of her illness was informing his work.<br />Just as &quot;McCartney&quot; was created during the hazy period he was trying to define himself after the Beatles, and &quot;McCartney II&quot; surfaced after his jail experience in Japan, &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; shows a more vulnerable, less cheeky McCartney, and with good results.<br />Unlike a lot of Wings albums, or &quot;Tug of War&quot; or &quot;Pipes of Peace&quot;, this album doesn't just yield one or two songs for the &quot;It's got a beat AND you can dance to it!&quot; crowd.  Instead, the lyrics reign here, introspective, haunting at times.<br />Not that some of the songs don't rock!  How could they not with Jeff Lynne and Steve Miller helping out?  Even fellow Two-tle, Ringo, helps out with Beautiful Night.  But since it's his voice in addition to drums, that's an element of sentiment, not one of quality.<br />The unusual production of some cuts, like the Victrola in &quot;Souvenir&quot;, reminds one of the days the Beatles were experimenting with all kinds of sound at Abbey Road.<br />My one disappointment about this CD happened a couple years after its release.  &quot;Little Willow&quot; shows up here, dedicated to a friend who'd died of cancer and her children.  Only a bit of detective work would reveal  that this friend was Maureen Starkey, Ringo's ex-wife, and the kids Lee and Zak.  But after Princess Diana was killed and a memorial album put together for her, the song Paul &quot;donated&quot; in her memory was....&quot;Little Willow.&quot; This was puzzling, maybe even disturbing.<br />Seeing beaming Sir Paul stroll in pictures with his new wife Heather and baby Beatrice, one can't help but feel happiness for him.  But I must confess, sometimes I wonder if a bit, just a bit, of stress or hardship could come his way to promote that creativity; nothing major, just a stubbed toe or lost set of keys or something.  Because he hasn't recorded anything as good as &quot;Pie&quot; since.<br />Oh, if you're wondering...Beatleoligists will remember that when John Lennon was asked to write in &quot;Mersey Beat&quot; how the Beatles got their name, and wrote, &quot;A man in a flaming pie came and said, 'You shall be Beatles with an 'A'&quot;. So the name is a nod to John, and to the Beatles...of whom McCartney just may be the biggest fan.iness for him.

B00007L7FN|4.0|Man!<br />    I sure wish that someone would clue some people in to the eras of Tangerine Dream...&quot;Worst Classic Dream&quot;,HA!<br />    I guess you could say that this isn't very technical of a T.D. CD?But this was the FIRST Tangerine Dream that had synths on it! <br />     This is a way-out classic from the early 1970's,not a new-age CD made on digitally perfect technology.  Don't look for light airy music,look for experiments made by friends of Salvador Dali,or fearky,hairy, Kraut Rock madmen set loose in a studio and existing with a mind-set to experiment into deep space!<br />     Now this album is thee first step to the classic mid-period of Tangerine Dream!  The baby steps were on Alpha Centauri ,and that was an album that reached for outer space with flute, guitar,and organ,for God's sake! <br />     If you are a Kraut Rock fan then this might be T.D.'s pinnacle for you!? Try ZEIT,and Alpha Centauri for earlier &quot;reaching for space&quot; madness.(With Zeit,possibly &quot;floating in space&quot; madness!?)<br />      Anyway,the ATEM album marked a finding of a &quot;code&quot; of sorts for Tangerine Dream.  It opened the way to smoother,cooler,scarier sounds that were emitted on PHAEDRA,STRATOSPHERE,etc.(&quot;Un-easy listening&quot; synth classics,I like to call 'em!) But,I have to say that fans of the more &quot;Prog.&quot; T.D, AND the more &quot;Kraut Rock&quot; oriented T.D. fans should both hear this pivotal CD! <br />     The sound on this issue is a million miles better than the Relativity re-issues that had a giant sound 'drop-out' on one track. So, now you can put on headphones and just float into the space that these early explorers created.<br />     Just keep an open mind...please.<br />     This is a classic from the early 1970's for God's sake,enjoy it for what it is.  Cosmic music of the trippy kind!
B000001EL7|3.0|Love Gun was Kiss' 6th studio album in a 3-year period, an amazingly prolific output considering how many bands today release only one album during the same period. This is not only when the band was at the height of their popularity, but also when chinks started to show in their armor. Ace Frehley and Peter Criss not only wanted to leave the band but were also experiencing difficulties with drugs and alcohol. This is also when Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons' songwriting skills started to slip as this was their first studio album that wasn't strong from beginning to end.<br />There are several strong tracks here and most of them are on the first half of the album. &quot;I Stole Your Love&quot; is one of their best album openers and one of Stanley's heavier songs. &quot;Christine Sixteen&quot; was the first single and one of Simmons' poppier efforts at the time, definitely a prelude to much of the material that would grace his solo album released the following year. &quot;Got Love For Sale&quot; is a great rocker from Simmons. &quot;Shock Me&quot; would be Frehley's debut as a lead vocalist and features one of his best solos. &quot;Plaster Caster&quot;, which was later featured on their MTV Unplugged album, and the title track, which features one of Simmons' best bass lines, are also strong tracks. After that, the album runs out of gas. &quot;Tomorrow And Tonight&quot; is an attempt at another great anthem ala &quot;Rock And Roll All Nite&quot; that doesn't catch fire. The tracks &quot;Almost Human&quot; and &quot;Hooligan&quot; are weak compared to their previous work. Finally, the last track &quot;Then She Kissed Me&quot; is arguably the worst of their cover tunes. Basically, it's a decent album with some great songs, but not among their best work.

B00003CWL6|2.0|\\"American Beauty\\" is one of the more celebrated films of recent years. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and is praised for its \\"complex\\" look at American suburban monotony. However, in its supposed subversion of cultural norms, it plays into them fairly strongly. The most notable of these deal with the female characters.<br />The film's protagonist is Lester Burnham, famously played by Kevin Spacey in the role that made him one of the most popular leading men in hollywood. However, the writing of this character engulfs the female characters in the film and subjugates them. Lester's wife, Carolyn, is the most one-dimensional character in the film. She is materialistic, selfish, and false. We know each of these things as soon as the film begins, and learn little more about her as the film progresses. Of course, her only possible source of salvation is Lester, who in one scene tries to snap her out of her obsession with material goods. Angela is another character who is blatantly framed as the typical concept of \\"American Beauty\\", as a young, blonde, sexually forward female who wants to be a model. However, when she undergoes her transformation at the end of the film, she is still at the mercy of Lester, and is reliant on him for comfort and safety. Janie, Lester's daughter, who is supposed to be the free spirit of the group, is \\"set free\\" by Ricky, the boy next door who invites her to run away with him, and \\"teaches her about the world\\".<br />In one particularly misogynistic scene, Lester, Carolyn, and Janie are eating dinner in their dining room, until Lester lashes out at both of them, throws dishes against the wall, and forces Janie to sit down. Lester is portrayed as the protagonist in this scene, rebelling against these \\"tyranical\\" women who are holding him back. <br />I see the treatment of the female characters in \\"American Beauty\\" to be its biggest flaw.
0743243307|5.0|The sheer quality - of tone, of voice, of story - of Brick Lane is something that doesn't come along too often, even in these days of mass book publishing.<BR>It's a universal story told with extraordinary technical skill. The qualities of the book have been compared to Jane Austen, Dickens and Dostoevsky. Yet the protagonist is the simplest of characters trying to lead the simplest of life. <BR>Brick Lane seems to be winning as many popular reader awards as it is literary gongs and, given its readability, it can be little wonder that Barnes &amp; Noble are publicising it for a year in their shop windows across America. <BR>This book is for the intelligent, thoughtful reader who is willing to immerse themselves in literature, even temporarily, to see the world in a clearer way. <BR>Take your time with this book and it will reward you greatly. It is an uplifting antidote to the increasingly brash, crass world we find ourselves within.
B000063JZQ|5.0|This is a terrific cinematic adaption of one of Shakespeare's greatest plays. The film is also known as &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot;, or sometimes &quot;Roman Polanski's Macbeth&quot;. Set in early medieval Scotland ( although filmed, I understand, in Wales ), this is a well-known tale of the ruthless ambition of a young noble, Macbeth, who is goaded into acts of evil by his scheming, manipulative wife. Macbeth literally murders his way to the throne of Scotland. Of course, we know what happens to those who &quot;live by the sword&quot; !<br />British actor, Jon Finch, has the title role, and he expertly peels away the various levels of his character's personality--his Macbeth is no cardboard villain. His performance is more than matched by Francesca Annis as Lady Macbeth, whose twisted mind and blood-soaked hands drive her to madness. Performances by other members of this primarily British cast are all fine, with Martin Shaw particularly effective as Banquo.<br />The other &quot;star&quot; here, of course, is Polanski. The story of Macbeth, and the times in which it occurred, were brutal, primitive, stark--wars were constant--men settled disputes with swords, daggers, axes and maces--death was not heroic or pretty--women and children could be victims as well. Polanski portrays this environment with as much matter-of-fact authenticity as possible. There are certainly some gory scenes, even by current cinema standards, and the final battle between Macbeth and his sworn enemy Macduff is far from some of the choreographed sword fights in Hollywood movies. The spare landscape and ancient castles add to the atmosphere--for interior scenes, light is used very sparingly, to add to the mood and sense of foreboding.<BR>The scenes with the three witches are creepy and effective.<br />I do have one question. The credits indicate that the script was written by Polanski and noted drama critic, Kenneth Tynan. Doesn't William Shakespeare deserve a little credit here ? Thosesoliloquies sound awfully familiar !<br />The DVD exhibits a decent, occasionally hazy, colour wide-screen picture. I was concerned at first when I noticed a vertical line on the right of the picture, but it disappeared, and the rest of the print seemed fine.<br />There have been numerous versions of this classic play, and I'm sure there will be more. How long before Kenneth Branagh decides that we need a new version on film ? In the mean time, Polanski's &quot;Macbeth&quot; gives us a totally engrossing, if bleak, cinematic experience.
B00008S2VG|5.0|It is SOOOOOOOOO funny that someone comes here, posts 4 or 5 messages rating this album ith 1 star and then comes over later to check the option - yes, I think this review was helpfull.<BR>You can love or hate Madonna and her albums, but anyway if you have to write a review of an album, just comment its content, just say why you hate it. Anyway we all know how these naive Janet and Mariah fans are and come here only to share their poison.<br />American Life is the most mature and modern pop album released last year and spanned 5 Billboard Dance #1 hits (American Life, Hollywood, Nothing Fails, Love Profusion, Die Another Day, plus the #4 Nobody Knows Me), 2 top 40 singles in the US (Die Another Day, #8, best-selling single of 2002 and 2003, and American Life, #37), 3 top 3 singles in England (Hollywood, American Life and Die Another Day) plus the #11 Love Profusion, 3 #1 singles in Spain (Nothing Fails and Love Profusion) plus the #2 singles American Life and Hollywood, 5 top 5 singles in Canada and a lot of top 5 singles in Australia, Italy, Japan etc. <BR>She mixed the avant-gardistic retro electroclash with a more folk, accoustic song and wrote lyrics about growing up as a person, discovering true values and the meaning of life.<BR>Her voice sound better than ever, the lyrics are totally touchy and the arrangements are superb.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|Hehe! The first time I heard this album I didn't appreciate one bit of the songs. But as time wore on, I began to fall in love with the album. Soon I was playing it whenever I had any free time or a simple time-out. I love her passion and fire in this album. I think she is angry and at the same time keeps who she is. But unlike her other albums this one is one where she seems to be fighting for the right to live. Some great and true inspiration I love about this fascinating woman. The songs that I liked on the album most were, <br />(1) Seasons Change:(5/5) A Great Song with a heavy rock feeling. I LOVE IT! A Great song to start the album with.<BR>(2) Left Outside Alone: (5/5) One of the most passionate songs that I've heard for a long time, it really cries out SPROCK(Soul, Pop And Rock) All in one track. It's something new to her and for her fans definitely. But beautifully done with her passionate voice. One to be remembered this century for me! <BR>(3) Time (5/5) A Great rock track and is one for the road on anger and passion for singing. I Love it!<BR>(4) Welcome To My Truth (5/5) Nothing wrong about this song, I just LOve it again! Good mixture of pop and rock. Nice experimenting and GOOD vocals. One of my favorite tracks to skip to when I want to hear this album<br />In fact I love the album but these are what I think are the most moving songs for me. I'm just telling you all what I think. But there is something on this album for everyone. But I recommend buying this album or listen to it and make up your mind. Your choice.
B000002UAX|5.0|In a time where the beatles are idolized and looked ast like jesus christ, one could argue that my argument of beatles supremacy is faulty. Fine, I dont care if you think i hopped on the bandwagon the beatles are something that will never be replaced. No one can do what they did. This album exemplifies that to the extreme. Some of theese songs can pull the very peak of human emotion from everyone. Songs like \\"happiness is a warm gun\\", and \\"revolution\\" can simply make a person cry out in pain or ecstasy. Listen to this album it will change your life no matter where your coming from. I wrote this in a hurry, sorry i couldnt magnify the beauty of the fab fours music a little more.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I missed watching this one on the big screen, but having watched it on video, I don't think I missed watching it on the big screen :-)<br />Let me qualify myself certainly not a Tarantino hater. I liked Pulp Fiction. A lot. And Jackie Brown. And Reservoir Dogs. And Desperado. Dusk to Dawn was just barely ok, in my opinion.<br />The latest installment from the king of in-your-face-gore is lacklustre, trivial, and eminently boring. There is no semblance of logic, the scenes are randomly strung together, the acting is tired, the fight scenes are WAAYYY too long and tedious, and I amd tired of listening to japanese bartenders who double as zen masters when business is slow. <br />Bad people did bad things to the heroine. She goes on a globetrotting mission to get even. But does it have to drag so interminably so? Does blood really gush like 10 fire hydrants from a severed limb? The sets are tacky beyond wildest belief. The acting is coarse. The storyline is hackneyed and worn threadbare. There is nothing here that hasn't been told in the previous movies. The zen is of the mumbo jumbo 2-minute ramen variety that is laughable at the very least. <br />There are logical chasms here that you could drop the Titanic into. Examples - A strapping 10 foot guy tries to rape a comatose girl in her hospital bed who has been vegetating and atrophying on life support for 4 years. And she bites his tongue off and wrestles him to death. And then she kills the nurse - another able bodied guy by repeatedly banging a door on his head. All this seconds after she snaps out of her 4-year coma. Then she gets into a truck and drives off. Then she gets on a flight to Japan and gets a samurai sword from a bartender. Then she singlehandedly slaughters about 50 Japanese samurai in one go, all armed with heavy duty swords themselves(I guess they were fresh out of bullets in Japan) ...ok, you get it. This is bilge of the highest quality. <br />The one good thing about this movie is that it just savedme spending eight dollars to watch Kill Bill 2. I will probably watch it when it comes out on video. Or better perhaps when it ever gets picked up by TBS or TNT :-) My advice to you is to do the same.
B000002LBH|5.0|There are things in life that will always defy explanation to those who have not experienced them.  I can try to tell you what it is like having a son or falling in love, but will you really understand until it happens to you?  The Smiths are one of those things that I could TRY to explain to you, but alas my feeble attempt to verbally express the impact The Smiths had on my life would never be properly conveyed.  During my 20th summer on this planet, LOUNDER THAN BOMBS played nonstop on my 1984 Dodge Charger's Blaupunkt stereo as I drive from my part time job at the movie theatre in West LA to summer classes downtown at USC.  From \\"Is It Really So Strange?\\" to the last song \\"Asleep\\" and back again I had BOMBS playing endlessly.  For that moment in time it became as important to me as air and blood.  I don't listen to LOUDER THAN BOMBS over and over again anymore, but I don't really have to as the changes it affected in me have already been done (for better or worse).  Like REM's first studio album Murmur, or losing my virginity, I think about LOUNDER THAN BOMBS and smile with a mix of pain, happiness and regret.  The songs are timeless; alas it is me a mere mortal that has grown old.   Feel free tender hooligans to take this for your own, for your summer of any year yet to come, and let it melt into the pores of your being.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was about eight-years-old. Now I'm 20 and it is stil one of my favorite movies. I recently bought the DVD from Amazon and have made a point to introduce it to all the children I baby-sit for and even some of my deprived college friends.(They have ALL loved it). Frankly, it's a film for &quot;children&quot; of all ages- one that parents will actually enjoy watching with their kids over and over again. The storyline is classic and the musical numbers, especially those featuring David Bowie, are wonderful (I still can recall all the words). Jennifer Connely is perfect as an ordinary teenager in extraordinary circumstances and nobody could have played &quot;The Goblin King&quot; like Bowie. What a wonderful, wonderful film!

B00004Y6O9|5.0|This is arguably Van Halens greatest album, although an argument could be put up for &quot;1984,&quot; and then after that album, well we all know what happened after that and its a shame but im going to make this short and sweet. Each track is a great hard rock song but to direct this at anyone who plays guitar, in regards to &quot;Eruption,&quot; I think it made half of the aspiring guitarists want to play more and the other half quit.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Anyone who gave this more than 3 stars has never seen a well thought out, intellectual film.  There is nothing interesting or engaging about this film, except that Bill Murray does a good job acting.  But he was much better in some of his other films.  People who give this film 4 or 5 stars are the type of people who think Red Lobster is fine dining because all they ever eat is Filet O'Fish.  I can only imagine what they'd do if they saw an Ingmar Bergman or Roman Polanski film.
B000002J09|5.0|From start to finish, this is without a doubt the greatest rock and roll album ever recorded. Each song is a different masterpiece, from the driving call and response hard rock staple &quot;Black Dog,&quot; to the delicate acoustics of &quot;Going to California&quot; to the Delta Blues inspired &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;, which produced most likely the greatest drum sound ever. Then there is the hard rock anthem &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; quite possibly the most popular and most recognizable, and in my personal opinion, the greatest song of all time, constructed with the perfect lyrics and the perfect guitar solo and well, perfect everything. It is the epitome of what a hard rock anthem should ever be. The guitar solo is merely brushed upon on the studio recordings compared to the live versions, and if you love this song i strongly reccomend downloading or purchasing the version on their latter released cd and dvd, &quot;The Song Remains the Same.&quot; I think its anyone who plays guitar or is just a fan of great guitarists should experience, it really shows why Jimmy Page will always be one of the greatest guitarists of all time. I could go on about this album and the rest of the songs for quite some time, but I will leave something to be desired so to speak so you can discover for yourself why Led Zeppelin was and still is the greatest rock and roll band of all time.
B00003CWL6|5.0|In the film \\"American Beauty\\", Carolyn, Jane, Angela, and Barbara each portray a different stereotype of modern America.  The ultimate question in the movie is what is beauty? What defines beauty? Is there one type of beauty, and if so , which one of these women is seen as most beautiful?<BR> Carolyn, Jane's mother,  can be interpreted as the typical American feminist, she provides for herself and her family through her reality job, but retains the traits of a typical mother, she is first seen pruning roses, and later performing household duties such as cooking and cleaning.  Because Carolyn plays both the role of mother and modern working woman, it is at hard first to decide which category she fits in.  However, due to her affair with another realtor, she moves out of mother and into a modern woman who is equal to men in every aspect.   Carolyn's beauty comes from her love of beautiful things.  She likes roses, expensive furniture, attractive clothing, and wants to present the overall feeling of beauty in relation to her family and home.  To her beauty is more material and is along the lines of perfection.  <BR> Jane, Carolyn's daughter, is depicted as the average teen with the usual angst-ridden issues to deal with.  She is on the school's dance/cheer team, a very stereotypical subject, but she also presents herself in baggy clothing, dark hair, and dark lipstick.  Jane, playing the usual teenager, doesn't get along with either of her parents very well.  To Jane beauty comes most importantly from the inside.  She doesn't care what her appearance says to others, she wears dark, loose fitting clothing, and ignores her best friend Angela's criticism of her wardrobe.  To Jane, Ricky, her next door neighbor and eventual boyfriend, is beautiful because he observes the world in nonconforming terms.  For instance, Ricky believes that a floating plastic bag is beautiful, because he looks past the immediate response of \\"it's just a bag\\", and sees beyond into how that plastic bag moves and how it makes him feel.  Jane is beautiful to Ricky, I think, because she is atypically beautiful, meaning that she strays from the ideals of conventional beauty, and lets her feelings and inner beauty show through her hair, clothing, and makeup.  <BR> Angela, Jane's best friend, is the perfect example of all-American beauty.  She is white and has blonde hair, blue eyes, what would be considered a perfect body, and she is portrayed as a teenage vixen.  Her concept of beauty is completely defined by outer, artificial beauty.  She continually lectures Jane about her wardrobe choices, and prides herself on being physically beautiful, and theoretically the girl of every man's dreams.  Her actions and personality however downplay her outer beauty because she's not very beautiful internally.  In a particular scene, Angela and Jane are standing outside at school and Ricky approaches them, but only speaks with Jane.  Angela is put off and confused by the fact Ricky didn't talk to her.   She has a hard time believing that a guy wouldn't want her attention.  <BR> Barbara, Ricky's mom, is considered the typical housewife, although she has been so disillusioned from years of living with her military husband, that it is hard to tell if this is her true personality.  Barbara's idea of beauty appears just be having her family fed and happy.  There is a scene where Barbara is cooking a large amount of breakfast, and Ricky enters the kitchen.  She seems to want to just fill up his plate and watch him eat all day.  Her definition of beauty is simple, she wants others to be happy.<BR> Applying John Berger's theory of the \\"surveyor/surveyed\\" to \\"American Beauty\\" can be thought of in a few ways.  The obvious is every characters surveyal of beauty around them.  Carolyn observes her flowers and her house.  Jane surveys Ricky, and in turn Ricky surveys Jane and soon bases his entire thought of beauty around her.  Angela surveys the physical beauty of others, and Barbara watches her  family in order to see what they need and what will make them happy.  The not so obvious is that each character surveys themself.  They are both the surveyor and surveyed, criticizing themselves and comparing themselves to others.  Each one is trying to find the true meaning of beauty, and what the characters find is that there are many different meanings of beauty, and no one fits every definition.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I'm not a big Errol Morris fan.  I find most of his docs contain too much of himself in them to be the truly objective works of art they strive to be.  However, this is about Robert McNamara, a man who is bigger than life (love him or hate him, he is) and very little of that \\"Errol Morris\\" feeling seeps into this film to its benefit.<br />I know this has been released at an opportune time, but this isn't Michael Moore confrontational tragi-comedy.  This is a character study of one of the most interesting men of this century.  A man who may well be (through his work during WWII and later in Vietnam) one of the greatest killers of the twentieth century.  But it all depends on your perspective of his role and who he is as a man and that is what is truly great about this film.  It does not offer any answers (much like the other great doc this year, Capturing the Freidmans) it only shows you the man.  It shows you McNamara being arrogant, smug, proud, and obstinant, but it also shows you McNamara being genuinely apologetic, introspective, thoughtful and sympathetic.<br />We are left with the final decision.  We are given the facts.  We are given the man, but we are asked to decide what we think and that is what makes this a significant documentary and a great film.<br />Also, Morris' talking head style, with all of its awkwardness, really works well with this subject.  His dramatization of nothing (maps and graphs and charts) is also probably the best and most compelling of any other documentary filmmaker.  The found footage is awesome, as well as the found recordings with Johnson and Kennedy.<br />On the DVD, watch the deleted scenes.  It's another half an hour of McNamara and though I still can't decide whether he truly believed what he was doing was right, and should be looked upon lightly in the course of human history, or whether he should burn in hell, I could watch him talk forever.<br />Who knew the most compelling drama of the year would be an Errol Morris talking head doc?  But it is.
B0001AP158|2.0|I don't know about you, but to me Bon Jovi's always been a guy that puts a lot of energy into his songs, to the point of forcing you to sing along until you're breathless.  If you've enjoyed doing that as much as I have, and love Bon Jovi for being one of the few artists to achieve this successfully, you will be almost disgusted by some of these songs - sure the ladies will go all swooney.  OK, maybe that's a bit harsh.  I'll be the first to acknowledge that I'm not the Die Hard Fan most of you are, who owns 10 Bon Jovi CD's and calls them &quot;My Favorite&quot;, but hear me out.<BR>I've always thought it would have been a, well, breathless, experience to witness &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; live, but take that singing-yourself-breathless out of it and what have you got left?  Something that, in my mind, should be left to other artists.  The ballads never were my favorite, but if they were yours you should prabably ignore this review, and you'll LOVE this DVD (read up on the other reviews that deals with this).  I haven't watched the bonus disc yet (there's some stuff that true fans will love), and this surely isn't all there is to say for the DVD, but to me personally it's the most sapient characteristic.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|From tvshowsondvd.com...<br />We started receiving reports that Gilmore Girls: Season One didn't include a booklet even though there's a pouch for it. There should be a booklet included in the set (it's a nice one) so we started to investigate the problem. It looks like booklets were left out of some, or possibly all, of the Canadian sets.

0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones is mystery about a girl named Susie Salmon who get raped and murdered.  She is speaking from heaven and tries to contact her friends and family.  As she is stuck in heaven she watches her friends grow older and live their lives.<BR> Throughout the book Susie watches and experiences an encounters with her friends. One of the most interesting ones was when her friend Ruth passes out she ends up in her body.  She then expresses her love for a boy she has like since before her murder.  This kind reminds me of ghost the movie.<BR>       The Lovely Bones is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I would rank it a 9 out of 10 for its great mystery, and the way it keeps you guessing what's going to happen, and the way it keeps you glued to the page not letting the book down.  The book also makes you think what really dose happen when you die or if maybe passed on friends or family members are trying to contact you.  I think this book is great for teens because of the way the characters go through life like any other teen.  The ending is kind of a disappointment and shocking, but you will have to read it your self to find out.  This book is a great one to read I highly recommend it.
0140434089|5.0|The Moonstone is a wonderfully written English mystery novel of the mid 1800s.  It tells the story of the path of a stolen Indian gemstone. The path begins from the day it was stolen from the forehead of a sacred statue of the god of the Moon guarded by three Brahmins (or Indian priests) to and from its journey Yorkshire.  While in Yorkshire, the stone is eventually passed down to Miss Rachel Verinder on the day of her eighteenth birthday and within the same night, the precious Diamond is stolen.  In several narratives, the theft of the Diamond is described.<br />I believe that The Moonstone was a fascinating and well thought out mystery novel.  Although I thought it was a little too lengthy near the end, this was only for the better.  Collins uses eight different narratives to re-tell the story of the missing Diamond.  The characters develop into believable and helpful elements of the story.  The narratives allow Collins to achieve suspense, thrill, and mystery.  In my opinion, he has successfully accomplished the true title of a classic mystery novel.
0140177396|5.0|This book has brought to light troubles I've had in past relationships with old friends. No, im not saying my friends are behemoth retards, but I now realize that true friendship never lasts. George and Lenny are the prime example of best friends, and their relationship is based on total reliance of one another. &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is an amazing story and anyone who hasnt already read it, must. <br />                                     Matthew Sinderbrand
0316666343|2.0|This story takes place in mid 70's to about the mid 80's in what seems to be a small suburban area. The main character was Susie Salmon. Susie was smart and did not seem to have to many friends. Susie had  her mother, father, a brother named Buckley, a sister named Lindsey, and a dog.<BR> She was murdered and raped early in the beginning of the story. It seems bad for me to say this but that was the only interesting part of the story. After Susie's death she spent about ten years watching her family to see how they have coped with her death.<BR> Every one in the family had their own issues to deal with, but the book still seemed dry, as though it were missing something. I couldn't stay interested. The mother was never there, Mr. Harvey's character could have been expanded more. After He killed Susie he ran away after being accused. I wanted more then any thing to see Mr. Harvey and Mr. Salmon, one on one. <BR> The book talked about a lot of things that seemed to have no relevance to the story, such as Ruth living in the city. There were about 4 chapters it seemed like dedicated to Ruth and her job as a waitress that seemed pointless. Another thing that could have gone was Ray's mom's character. All she did was give you a false idea that maybe Mr. Salmon might get pay back against Mr. Harvey, and smoke smelly cigarettes. <BR> This book could have been better if there was more confrontation and less constant talk. There seemed to be no reason to want to reach the end of the book accept to see how Mr Harvey will end up. There was one attempt of something interesting towards the end of the book and that was when ruth basically became possesed, to bad that I could not understand what was going on because it was written so bad with no explanation on why or how the possesion of Ruth occured. I would not suggest this book to anyone Hence the title The Boring Bones.
B0000020C4|5.0|The cast doesn't get any better than this.  Cameron should have asked this whole cast to close the show on Broadway.  The Eponine there (a Diana-something with a very squeaky voice) was just horrible!
B000001EL3|4.0|While not being as menacing and hard as their previous albums, KISS show they can still pack a hard wallop. The songs on here are a little more melodic, but no less heavy. Detroit Rock City is one of KISS's heaviest songs ever. Only one problem: Beth. Beth is a filler ballad which is sung by drummer Peter Criss. Although it went on to be KISS's biggest hit, it is still unbelievably filler. This is what causes the album to be a 4 star instead of 5. Other than Beth however, this is a must have for any metalhead or even rock fan.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|What a funny film. Animal House is the one movie that is completely lacking taste but is a masterpiece.  All the acting is laugh out loud hilarous.  Everything about it is funny.  The script is brilliant.  The plot is great.  The moments it puts you in is unexpected.  Everytime I watch it I laugh just as much as I did the first time I watched it.  I highly reccomend this film.
B00004TH6O|5.0|I think this is the best effort from QOTSA, because it is more heavy metal oriented than Songs For The Deaf, and the songwriting is better. The mix of heavy metal, stoner rock, and commercial rock is winning. On some tracks bassist Nick Oliveri sings, giving the song a screeching black metal sound. Two of theses songs are Quick And To The Pointless, and Tension Head. This is one of the best rock albums of the last 5 years. You should go and get it.
0767821769|4.0|Stepmom may not be a definate classic but It will be remembered as a sad sad movie.  It is one of the most heartbreaking films I have ever seen.  Susan Sarandon gave what should've been an Academy Award nominated performance as a single mom battling cancer.  Julia Roberts has another good performance as well as Ed Harris.  The film does move you and make you feel lucky.  It isn't my favorite, but for anyone who loved Terms of Endearment and Steel Magnolias this is the movie for you.
B000002B82|5.0|No More Tears, released in 1991, was a huge hit commercially. Listen to it and you will see why. The songs are straight-ahead metal with a commercial oversheen. This was Ozzy's second album with virtuoso guitarist Zakk Wylde, who added the crunching metal parts to this album. This album gave Ozzy his first solo Top Forty hit, with Mama I'm Coming Home, which rose to #28 in 1991. It is kind of suprising that this album was such a hit, considering this was 1991, at the height of the grunge era. Maybe it was just that it was so good, it would be impossible to ignore it.
6304711891|3.0|This is a good movie to watch on the superstation or when you have nothing better to do.  It isn't a complete letdown, but was definately not as good as Die Hard, or Entrapment.  The movie had some really cool action scenes.  Ed Harris, Nicholas Cage, and Sean Connery all were really good.  There also was a lot of violent battle scenes that were interesting, and the finale at the end is really cool.  The movie is good, but if you have high standards for action, pick something else instead.
0671027387|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  Dan Brown shows he has not knowledge of or bothered to check the accuracy of much of anything in his book.  The concepts of NASA, satellite orbits, satellite software problems, launch vehicles, rocket fuel and engine design or common laws of physics dealing with gases under pressure.  The questions that were just left hanging, like how do you bore a hole up 100 ft into the bottom of a glacier and hold a 8 ton rock into it until it freezes in place.  And that is jujst one example.  How is it there is alway a guy and a girl who just happen to be single, good looking, that can end up together at the end.  I am just glad I did not buy this book.
B00005AUBA|4.0|I think this is the most accessible Mogwai record to anyone.<BR>It is balanced with beautiful singing, nice tunes, atmospeherics, experimentation and offers classic Mogwai slow-build guitar playing.<BR>On the other hand, it may appear that Mogwai are going more into a mainstream direction at this point, having as a guest on track 4 the singer from Super Furry Animals.<BR>Overall the album works because there is something from everyone.<BR>Additionally, despite the fact that there is not much &quot;rock&quot; in this album, I recommend the album just for track 5 &quot;You don't know jesus&quot;. This is one of the most powerful tracks ever done by any rock band.
B00005JME0|4.0|I've seen Ashton Kutcher before in Dude Where's My Car and Just Married, and he didn't do a thing for me. But add slightly longer, less dorky hair, and a beard, then my eyes literally go out on stalks in my head! Plus, a lovely scene for the ladeez - he appears in little more than a towel at one point, which is very low-slung, and all the females will be yelling at the screen to get him to drop it! That doesn't necessarily mean I like guys with beards - they're OK to look at, it's a totally different matter if you go to kiss them!<br />I've read the novelisation of this, and absolutely loved it. The film is absolutely terrific too, although I missed the first couple of minutes, due to not finding a parking space! All people seem to know Ashton Kutcher for is playing dorky roles/playing dorky roles/ditching Brittany Murphy for Bruce Willis' ex. Wow. What they don't realise is he can pretty much do a serious role, AND he exec-produced it too. Just a little thing to add his CV.<br />If you've read the book, you'll pretty much understand what happens when the film suddenly jumps forward 5 minutes or so. Unfortunately, I went with someone who hadn't read the book, and I kept getting elbows in my ribs every two seconds, asking what the hell was going on! All the 'missing' sections appear later in the movie, but I kinda knew what was happening. It takes a lot to have at least some intelligence.<br />Amy Smart (who I've mainly known from Rat Race) plays the role of Caillie brilliantly. Her image constantly changes throughout the film (think Jenny's sometimes drastic image changes in Forrest Gump).<br />If you're expecting the ending to be very predictable, you'd be wrong. I couldn't really remember what the ending was from the book (need to re-read it now!), and I was quite surprised. It's one of those \\"what if?\\" endings, totally not what you're expecting to happen.<br />If you get a chance to see this movie, GO SEE IT! You won't regret it. Or get the DVD. Whatever suits you. I'll be first in line to get the DVD. Already pre-ordered it.ou. I'll be first in line to get the DVD. Already pre-ordered it.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I've read through most of the reviews and some of them just crack me up to no end. First off, the one where the reviewer complains saying that Smallville is for 12 year olds....then goes on to explain that he still collects comics. I mean really? So do I, but a collector of comics has no room to make an age reference slur. Then another goes as far as to say how Smallville has ruined the Superman mithos then on to say how much he can't wait for Lois &amp; Clark to be released on DVD. What is your major malfunction? Lois &amp; Clark? Are you serious or just die hard fanboy playing a prank?<br />With any story there is a begining, and to tell a good story you have to understand the characters. Thats all the first season can do, then on to the thick of it.<br />Lois &amp; Clark.....ouch!
B00006DEFA|5.0|Even though I was in my mid-teens when I saw this movie, the Director's Cut gave this movie more of a unique feel to it. Though I liked the original version, I also like this Cut as well because it shed some more light on the story line. While I am not particularly fond of classical music at all, this movie does have some nice tunes in it along with terrific acting. I would highly recommend it, even to those who don't care much for classical music.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|This film version of &quot;Emma&quot; absolutely captures the light, confectionary feel of the Regency period in romances. Others have raved about the pitch-perfect performances of most of the principals, so I won't say more except to agree! I will add that the production and costume design in this film is simply a visual delight. The movie thrives on repeated viewings because there's always something new to discover in each scene, be it a meaningful side-glance between Knightley and Emma or a detail in the design of a garden folly.<BR>The DVD edition is woefully sparse on extras, including only the theatrical trailer plus trailers for other Miramax films. You can't tell me that on a film made as late as 1996 there weren't any production stills or taped commentary, or anything? Heck, for a movie this visually beautiful, I would have liked to see design drawings or storyboards, at least! I'd give this review five stars if there'd been any extras on the DVD.
B000002LOM|4.0|For a long time I was a staunch defender of this album against the many who seem to despise it. I think a lot of the music is really ingenious; the piano on Mute Witness could almost have been an instrumental, the lyrics on King Leer are very clever, and Our Frank and Sing Your Life are just great songs. The entire album has a very cohesive quirky mood which sets it apart from, say, the shapeless Maladjusted.<br />What I realized recently, though, is that I don't really listen to Kill Uncle that often. I might think the songs are good, but when I want to hear a Morrissey album, I always reach for Viva Hate or Arsenal. I think this album deserves some credit, but I have to admit that you can't call it great if it isn't listenable.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I have been listening to this record for a few months now, and it's still wonderful.  I would have to say that this is one of the best albums I have ever heard.
B000002VEP|5.0|I let this Alan Parons Project album sit on a shelf for the longest time.  I don't know why.  After I focused my attention on it and the man Gaudi himself I was most impressed with the music.<BR>     The architech Antoni Gaudi was a genius of the highest order and his still-ongoing work in Barcelona is evidence of that.  This album led me to to know and appreciate this man's work.<BR>    I like the songs, each of which reflect an aspect of Gaudi's work on the Sagrada Familia Cathedral.  I wondered why Money Talks was on this collection until I read that Gaudi, in his later days, spent much time trying to raise funds for his masterpiece. <BR>    This is a most-excellent Parsons album.  Do yourself a favor.  Get this CD and then spend some time learning about Gaudi himself.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I was 13 years old when Star Wars IV was released. It blew me away. This was the first movie I saw more than once at the movies, 10 times to be exact. I couldn't get enough of it, but the more I saw it, the more flaws I noticed with the special effects. But that didn't bother me because the movie itself had a sound structure where the effects flaws could be over looked.<BR>Then it was on Cable TV, then the flaws were more prominent and annoying more than anything but still, the structure was as sound as solid as a rock. <br />When I heard Lucas was going to digitally tweak the film I was a bit perturbed. Why would you fool with a perfect film? But it's only a movie I thought. The buzz around this new version was high and my curiosity was aroused where I had to see what he had done.<br />Again, I was blown away. I felt that the \\"special edition\\" of Star Wars IV had somehow become more perfect. I felt like the 13 year old kid again seeing this masterpiece for the first time. The new effects didn't take anything away from the \\"original version\\" in fact it added much more. <br />Believe it or not I wasn't much of a fan of The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi because they didn't capture the originality of the first one. I think it's because Lucas didn't direct them, I'm still not sure why.
B00003CWL6|4.0|American Beauty is an example of director Sam Mendes' unconventional approach to film making. He takes Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey, and launches him into the deepest midlife crisis, perhaps ever seen on screen. Spawned from a lusting over one of his daughter's, Janie's, played by Thora Birch, friends Angela, played by Mena Suvari, Lester finds himself in a new world. He blackmails his boss, becomes friends with the boy next door Ricky, who also happens to be Janie's love interest, buys a sports car, starts working out, and smoking pot. He has amazingly contradictory moods, as he goes from subservient husband to demanding his `proper' place in his family.<BR> It is through Ricky's camera lens that Mendes' want us to see the beauty of everything in the movie. With Lester's obsession with Angela and society seeming to point out everything about her as perfect, one would assume she is what is supposed to be beautiful. However, Ricky's lens focuses on Janie. He sees her as beautiful, and makes her feel that way. The Roses in the movie show up every where in the Burnham household, and the vibrant color red as well, pointing out where Ricky's camera does not, that beauty is everywhere. There are roses in every room, in every scene whether people are fighting, or reflecting upon something. Mendes uses Ricky's camera as a tool to reveal the deeper meaning to things normal society may not see, such as Janie's beauty over Angela's.<BR> While unconventional, Mendes does and excellent job at revealing the underlying power struggles and beauty in his characters lives. Between Lester's fight for dominance over his wife, and the strategic placement of roses this movie certainly portrays much more than it appears to just on the surface.
B00005QK5X|5.0|The Wipers were the band I always needed to hear. They were frequently dropped as influences by various artists during the nineties including Blur, Nirvana, My Vitriol and more. This box-set brings you three of their most popular and well-known albums and more rarities than you could ever wish for. The first album, Is This Real?, is an enlightening and inspiring collection of classic pop-punk songs. The energy of Return Of The Rat, the alienation of D7, the anger of Mystery, the melancholy of Don't Know Who I Am and the pop brilliance of Let's Go Away. You will never fall out of love with this album. Then there's Youth Of America. It's quite different than the previous album but equally compelling. It tends to be slightly more of a challenge to get into but once you're into it, it's well worth it. The most accesible song is Can This Be, a stunning punk rocker that has some of Sage's best riffing. The title track, a ten minute-plus epic, is strange and interesting and eventually get's the listener hooked on it's unforgettable main guitar riff and great chorus. No Fair is your typical Wipers song. Taking Too Long features piano, Pushing The Extreme is enjoyable and closer (excluding bonus tracks) When It's Over is a beatiful instrumental which is well worth the listeners attention. Last is Over The Edge (my personal favourite). This has a raw production which may steer some listeners off, but is a unique blend of the two previous albums. I won't go into much more detail other than to check out absolute masterpieces like the beatiful The Lonely One, So Young and the Wipers best pop song, Messenger. If you love music, in it's purest form, more than anything else, you will adore The Wipers, one of the most passionate, energetic and inspirational bands of all time.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Before I even get into a discussion of what a great c.d. this is, I feel it is important to address a comment made by another reviewer to the effect that Michael Schenker didn't play on the brilliant version of Rock Bottom found on this recording. The reviewer then went on to show complete ignorance by implying that it was actually Paul Chapman. Let me put it this way: Paul Chapman is a good guitarist while Michael Schenker is a GREAT guitarist, one of the best rock players ever. There is no mistaking one for the other, and the tone and phrasing on Rock Bottom is clearly Schenker. Evidence? ok, here goes-  Chapman's tone at the time was much thinner than that on Rock Bottom, due to his choice of instruments (Gibson Firebird) and his delivery was much more rushed and less self assured than schenker's. (Just listen to some of the later UFO live stuff with Chapman and this becomes evident). Secondly, there is a live video of MSG recorded in 1981 for the German t.v. show Rockpalast where Schenker plays a very similar solo during Rock Bottom, and nobody has ever accused him of imitating Paul Chapman. But enough guitar talk, the total sound of the band on Strangers is stunning beyond belief, so this is much more than a &quot;guitar guy&quot; c.d.  If you like British rock and have never heard this c.d., buy it and find out for yourself what all the fuss is about.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I probably would have pondered for an unbearable amount of time, if asked &quot;What do you think about Diane Keaton (ladies first) and Jack Nicholson in a romantic (comedy ?) movie together&quot;. The casting has got to get ten stars for placing these two in these parts.  You almost HAVE to believe that Diane Keaton wrote this thing in the future and returned to do the movie (or maybe the play, that became the movie ?).  In any case I have never seen all individuals fit their characters so well and this in a fantastic motion picture. As Will once said &quot;I GOTTA GET ME ONENA DEES&quot;! What I can't understand is this DVD wasn't availble when he said it.  What could he possibly have been talking about ? No BS, Wade Arnold

B000002J0P|5.0|`Crosby, Stills and Nash' is a classic case of the sum of the parts being greater than the whole.   When this album was released in May of 1969, all of the main players had achieved a degree of notoriety.  What they brought to this project was a talent matured and seasoned by Stephen Stills in `Buffalo Springfield', David Crosby in `The Byrds', and Graham Nash in `The Hollies'.  While it may be tempting (and presumptuous)to contend that what CS&amp;N wrought was something completely different, never before had such a mix of divergent styles blended together so effortlessly, and with such a distinctive and savory result. Couple this with the great cultural significance of the album, and the sheer quality of the compositions and performances, and you have one of the epic albums in rock history.<br />`Crosby, Stills and Nash' defined a generation.  More than any other single work, this album defined the ethos of the Baby Boomers, The New Left, the counter-culture.  While their 1970 release `Deja vu' played on the `hippie mystique', `Crosby, Stills and Nash' elucidated it.  No longer tied to established values, this generation would live to emulate lyrics such as \\"Don't let the past remind us of what we are not now\\", \\"Listen not to what's been said to you\\", \\"Seagulls circle endlessly, I sing in silent harmony, we shall be free\\", \\"You are living a reality I left years ago, it quite nearly killed me. In the long run it will make you cry, make you crazy and old before your time\\", \\"and then I will lend you my will and your days will be filled with love\\", and \\"Speak out, you got to speak out against the madness\\".  To what degree were these artists mirroring society as opposed to creating a mindset? Certainly a bit of both.<br />`Crosby, Stills and Nash' offered an eclectic mix of sounds.  While the performances in this debut album are certainly categorized in the folk or soft-rock category, subsequent interpretations of numbers such as `Wooden Ships', `Pre-Road Downs', and `Long Time Gone' divulged their heavy-rock potential (check out Stills' version of `Wooden Ships' on his 1974 `Live' album).  Virtually every song is a conservatory of vocal harmonies.  While Dallas Taylor (seen peering out the window on the album cover) contributes percussion and David Crosby rhythm guitar, the lion's share of the instrumental work is single-handedly Stephen Stills'.  Stills' lead guitar solo's, both electric and acoustic, are imaginative, inspired, and at times, such as on `Pre-Road Downs', rabidly innovative and unparalleled.<br />`Crosby, Stills and Nash' harbors a wealth of creative genius, from the bold alliterations of `Suite: Judy Blue Eyes' (\\"Lacy lilting lady, losing love lamenting\\") and `Helplessly Hoping' (\\"Wordlessly watching he waits by the window and worries'), to the dynamic,desperate exchange between warring soldiers introducing `Wooden Ships' (\\"If you smile at me I will understand, because that is something everyone does in the same language\\"), so pertinent to the Vietnam era.  Stills offers five compositions, including a co-credit with Crosby on `Wooden Ships', and there isn't a loser in the bunch, though `49 Bye-Byes' gets a save from Crosby and Nash's steep and ascendant harmonies.  Crosby is in his prime, cataloging the beautiful `Guinnevere' and the ominous `Long Time Gone', this album's complement to `Deja vu's `Almost Cut My Hair'.  `Lady of the Island' is Nash's `Guinnevere', and `Pre-Road Downs' and `Marrakesh Express' give the body of work a much-needed buoyant lilt.<br />`Crosby, Stills and Nash' is a close to perfect as the men, the times, and their resources could impart.  It is nothing if not an essential componant of any comprehensive modern music collection.
B00005JLXE|3.0|Daredevil is yet another brilliant creation from the bulging brains of Stan Lee. As a kid, Matt Murdock witnesses his father beating up a shopkeeper, and runs away in horror. However an accident leaves radioactive waste covering Matts eyes, turning him bling but boosting the power of his remaining senses. <br />He becomes more agile, more stronger but the most amazing of all is his radar sight, the ability to 'see' by using soundwaves. But that's a long story.<br />Daredevil is a good movie. Ben Affleck plays a brilliant superhero, and the performance Colin Farrel gives as bullseye is truly amazing. Even Stan Lee makes a very brief appearence.<br />But despite it's promising story, Daredevil does have it's flaws. There are certain parts of the film which make you think to yourself...<BR>&quot;Hey, that's just like spider-man&quot; and other similar thoughts. It just feels like some peaces weredeliberatley ripped from Spider-man. Daredevil is a good film. <BR>But a Spider-man beater it ain't...
B00006B1HH|4.0|I admit, I love this film.  I love the music and the humor, the characters and the costumes.  But my love for the film does not mean that I don't recognize the insulting content in it.  Sandy, the blond-haired, blue-eyed girl is the symbol of purity and virginity when she arrives at Rydell High.  The school is a stereotypical representation of a white, suburban high school.  The representation of groups like the Pink Ladies and T-Birds glorify the popular/unpopular dichotomy that exists in high schools.  In the sleepover scene with Sandy and the Pink Ladies, the girls are sifting through beauty magazines and performing other activities like painting their nails and curling their hair.  The characters are acting out what society dictates as normal behavior for girls, and they perform these activities because they have internalized the male gaze.  <BR>In the racing scene at the end of the film, the director uses a shot-reverse-shot technique in which Sandy is seen apart from the group gazing at the happy crowd and appearing lonely.  The camera focuses on Danny, and then focuses right back to Sandy.  It is after this that Sandy asks Frenchie to help her transform her physical appearance.  This shot-reverse-shot technique illustrates that Sandy surveys her own body through Danny's eyes.  In the final scene, where Danny strips off his preppy sweater and the camera frames Sandy's body through the male gaze, beginning at her feet and slowly moving up her body in a very seductive manner completely objectifies Sandy.  The message is that Sandy must conform to Danny's notion of beauty in order to be loved and accepted by him, and he can take off the preppy sweater because he does not have to change.  Danny's notion of beauty is that Sandy looks something like a leather-bond Barbie doll.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I really like this movie because it has good dialoge and it has a good story outline, especially the character John Bender. He reminds me of this kid I used to know in school. I like the part where the gurls was dancing and the boys after they smoked that marijuana. I thought it was hilarious.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I was just going through the reviews here. They either rate the CD 5 stars or one star. It's either I HATE BRITNEY SPEARS or I LOVEEE IN THE ZONE. It must be a tough descision for any one who reads these reviews to help them buy the CD.<BR>Let me suggest this CD for all pop/rnb fans and old Britney fans also. I do not reccommend this for people under 14. I suggest rock fans and classical music fans to skip this one. For all the club loving/ party freak kinda people, this one's for you.<BR>I rate the CD 4.5 stars. I've heard better stuff but right now I think this is one of the best efforts in pop music.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|which was a loooooog time ago....Good catchy tunes but nothing original here.
B0000844IT|5.0|This was a very good movie funny as hell too. Love the part when the skeletons are slapping and punching Ash in the face. The thing i hated though how the skeletons looked in the movie it was fake looking. This movie is funnier than it is scary!!!
B00003CWL6|5.0|In the movie gAmerican Beautyh, Mena Suvari as Angela Hayes is symbolized the American ideal beautiful girl. She has blonde long hair, blue eyes, white skin, skinny figure, and wears bright color clothes. On the contrary, Thora Birch as Jane Burnham roles the opposite side from Angela, which is Jane has black hair, wear dark color clothes, and not smiling face most of the time. This stereotype beauty of Angela seems to be centered of the movie; however, the point of the movie criticizes Angelafs beauty by placing Jane gets more attention, and make Angela being able to see Jane establishing a little unique, but strong relationship with Rich. Angelafs impatience for Jane becoming more adult, and having steady relationship triggers her motivation to decide sleeping with Lester. <BR>Angela also has high self-conscious even thought the fact is that nobody actually pays attention to her (except, Lester picks out her beauty and be captivated by her charms). She has dual thoughts about her self; the one appears when she stays with Lester who she can be totally herself in the end, which is much less confident about her than the other one, which appears when she stays with other people, such as Jane or kids in her high school. <BR>As most of the girls especially the girls at ages like Angela care how they look and how the people look them, Angela, as snobby white upper-middle-class girl has this huge consciousness about herself. Her excessive consciousness about herself is caused by her gender, class, and especially race. As a white upper-middle-class girl, Angela seems to decide on what is the hottest looking for her, and tries to reach it at all the times. Angelafs encounter of seeing Jane becoming happier and happier even though Jane does not fit for her standard beauty irritates her because Angela wants to believe that her looking is the best.
B000148KK2|1.0|After &quot; LIVE IN PARIS &quot;,her best album in my opinion,how could Diana make this horrible album.<BR>Has Costello influenced her so much that she literally forgot her jazz?<BR>Her marvelous talent as a jazz player was totally abandoned in this CD.<BR>At least the band is always very good. Great musicians!<BR>Hope it gets much better for the next album!<BR>Go for it, Diana!
B0001V07ZQ|4.0|If you've ever seen any of the Horation Hornblower productions on the BBC, then I think this movie will be a letdown for you.  Russell Crowe, while an enjoyable personality overall, comes off as a tad too nice and understanding in this role, while the books about this time (CS Forrester's Hornblower included) portray their Captains more along the lines of booming-voiced autocrats in charge of every aspect of activity in the domain they take SO personally, the ship.  Russell Crowe never seems to boom.  He smiles and winks, and you start to wonder why the murderers and vermin the British Navy pressed into sea duty don't just push him over and sail to Tahiti (oh, sorry - another story)... that is until a crew member disses a midshipman suspected of being a Jonah and Crowe nails the offender to the mast.  And although the movie plays fast and loose with some aspects of sea life from the times, midshipmen very often were young boys whose wealthy parents sent to sea to make men out of them.  It's hard to get used to the 11-year-old barking orders to men 3 or 4 times his age.  <br />Anyway, I have all of the HH movies and have read Forrester, AND enjoyed this movie.  Crowe is handsome, the strategy isn't given away to you, and I was disappointed when it ended.<br />No \\"Making Of...\\" included on the disk, which I was disappointed about.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I finally rented this movie, having nothing to go on but the trailer and a few positive reviews.  I tend not to read too much about pictures until I've seen them; if I liked a film enough, I may obsess a bit and read up on what I can find about it.  This one, I liked enough.  The characters connected, and I appreciated both their situations.  They are both flawed, but their flaws are what make them human, and they are, through each other, coming to grips with these shortcomings.  One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Bob asks Charlotte, who is giving him the business over his dalliance with the hotel's lounge singer, &quot;Was there no-one else to lavish you with attention?&quot;  A great put-down, and a very eye-opening moment about the limits of his investment in their relationship.  Yet in the end, their bond is deep.<br />As far as &quot;getting&quot; this picture or not goes, I have to think that people who don't have not perhaps experienced the crises faced by the two main characters, or else are of the &quot;buck up, little camper&quot; mindset that countenances little time spent in introspection about one's place in the world.  Bill Murray's performance is too nuanced for anyone coming to this with a &quot;make me laugh, funnyman&quot; attitude.  Though there are comedic bits, I didn't particularly see this as a comedy, and wasn't expecting to, either.  Besides his name on the marquee, I'm not sure what led those viewers so disappointed with this to come to it expecting some sort of laff riot -- none of the reviews I've now read paint it as such.  Scarlett Johannson was enthralling, particularly considering the fact that she turned 18 during the making of the film.  Usually one sees older actresses playing younger, but she very successfully turns this formula on its head.<br />I didn't see the film being particularly racist; the whole premise is that Bob and Charlotte are alone together in a very foreign place, and Sofia Coppola has taken steps to accentuate this.  In most cases, the Japanese people seemed quite normal; it's just that they inhabit a completely different world than the two protagonists, and speak a language that neither comprehends.<br />If your idea of a good time for two hours is watching things explode or laughing until you think you'll piss yourself, then by all means, stay away from this one.  If, on the other hand, you can appreciate the crises we face coming to grips with who we are, what we are doing with our lives, and why we are doing it, then I would suggest that you will very much appreciate this small, thoughtful film (budget was between 2 and 3 million dollars, I gather).<br />The dvd itself left something to be desired.  The transfer was generally good, though in the beginning there was some break-up in the dark backgrounds. The sound was very good. A commentary would've been nice, and I found it odd that Ms. Johannson was so completely neglected in both the interview and &quot;behind the scenes&quot; pieces.  Only one of the deleted scenes (a brief telephone interaction the morning after the karaoke party) seemed like it might've added anything.  Hopefully, a &quot;special edition&quot; will be forthcoming at some point in the future.
B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zeppelin is the most influential Rock in Roll band in the entire history of music; there is just simply no getting around that. They hold up with age and terrible bands like Dave Matthews, Coldplay, and this pop rock spoon-fed char topper pale in comparison. One more thing and then I am done venting, if you refuse to like Led Zeppelin and prefer bands like Duran Duran than keep your offensive, officious, overbearing, malodorous, monotone, mouthy jabbering out your review! You providential puts! If I read one more review that says \\"well, it's flower power\\" or \\" it's cheesy now and lacks the emotion found in Brittany Spears's work or Nickel Back's\\" I swear I'm going to snuff it, off myself, I can't take it!<br />I apologize to the harmless reader and now wish to continue. Led Zeppelin III took a quite different approach than their first two rock infused blues albums, not that that sound is not to be found on this album, far from it,\\" Celebration Day\\" and \\"Out on the Tiles\\" give you plenty of the Led Zeppelin you love. What makes this album so spectacular are the folk and blue undertones of the acoustic pieces often overshadowed by the colossal radio hit \\"The Immigrant Song\\"(Lord of the Rings/ Similmarilion/ Norse Mythology based lyrics). Songs like \\"Friends\\" and \\" That's the Way\\" really set a nice change in pace from previous Led Zeppelin albums. Overall great album to have I know I love mine, but for the new Led Zeppelin fan go for the fourth album (Stairway to Heaven), then get three, and then end your collection with their later stuff like Physical Graffiti.
B000063TDY|2.0|SAXOn was still licking their wounds from the disastrous albums ROCK THE NATIONS and DESTINY when they released this one here. It's an improvement over the others, but still not a real return to form, which would only come with DOGS OF WAR.<br />There are some great tunes here, but the majority of them are generic forgetabble metal tunes, mos of them writeen by bassist Nibbs Carter.
014100018X|4.0|I must admit I saw the movie before I read the book, but liked the book much more.  Joanne Harris knew the romance between Vianne and Roux (respectively played by Juliette Binoche and Johnie Depp in the movie) was not an important factor in this story, only Hollywood's little addy, and undoubtedly the reason for people saying the movie was better.<BR>Harris writes in an entrancing manor which is not only evocative in her descriptions of Vianne's Aztec chocolate recipes, but it leaves an impression of the exotic, appealing, and surreal nature of Vianne Rocher's character.  Vianne is the epitome of a wanderer with her little daughter Anouk, but in their wanderings they come across many people who's lives they touch.  The persuit of belonging is a predominant theme as well as not being afraid to be different and possess some mystery (it's so much more interesting).  <BR>Description of chocolate has never been so vividly mouth-watering as in this book, and with its promotion of indulgence, makes one want to savor its taste long afterwords.  No wonder even the priest is forced to live a little (what harm is there in that?)<BR>The witchlike characteristics of Vianne and Anouk (as well as Armande Voizin) not only appall the enemy villagers who rebel against her Paganistic rituals, it makes the reader incredibly curious for more hints of supersticion, fortune-telling, or mind-reading eminent in Vianne.  The north-wind's blowing, and allusions to the &quot;black man&quot; also add to this enchanting tale of two wanderers who defy the black man in hopes to find somewhere they can settle in. <BR>A must-read, especially while on vacation, and be sure to bring chocolates with you!!
0385470819|3.0|A Time To Kill is set in Mississippi during racist times. The book a time to kill tells a story about a young black girl that gets rapped by two white guys. After the rape her the throw her out.  Some people found her and took her home. Her father wanted to take justice into his own hands.<BR>One part in the book tells how he got revenge on the two white guys. He shoots them in his face on the stairs and then he is charged for murders of to white men. The rest of the book is mostly about  his courts and if he's guilty or not.<BR>This book shows a lot prejudice actions and how the kkk was involved. I enjoyed reading this book and if you want to know more about racist times I recommend this book.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|What was the point of this movie? I think they just tried to make a very confusing movie so it'll look very intelligent. I don't think even the director fully understood the movie.<br />But I still give it 3 stars for it being original and moody, something rare in the movies these days.
B000089RVX|2.0|There's only one reason to listen to this band: Amy Lee has an incredibly smooth and powerful voice. Though it has no-doubt been run through more filters than your drinking water and spent dozens of hours in Pro Tools, it works. She is fun to listen to.<br />The rest of the band is your average nu-metal radio band. They have next to no chops, and they don't really bother to give us anything interesting musically (that main guitar riff in &quot;Tourniquet&quot; is kinda cool, though). But, they back up Amy decently, and that's enough for a few listens. <br />In short, if you want to hear a good female singer in a rock band, then pick up this album. If you demand anything interesting from the other members, then leave it on the shelf.
B00003CWN3|4.0|The production quality both audio and video was good. The script was facinating and truely sad. This was not a feel good movie and in fact will leave you angry. Teena Brandon was a self destructive, confused young lady that wanted to be accepted and loved however she could not accept herself. The story is about how she lived and the situation that leads to her death. It was actually very well acted and I was impressed with the finished product. This is a quality addition to any collection.
B000007T1M|5.0|Half of the people who reviewd this cd bought the secound cd before this one there for they are not TRUE system of a down fanns. They also say that the soucond cd is better wow they couldnt be more wrong but they arent true fans so what do they know. The other people who review this cd are just stupid metal heads and the only thing they look for in their music is loud noise they if it isnt loud they throw it in the garbadge immediatly these people are just idiots I love hard core metal but I also like softer rock too because I acctually like music . THIS CD ROCKS IF YOU BOUGHT THE SECOUND ONE FIRST U ARE NOT A TRUE FAN YOU ARE JUST A &quot;BAND WAGON&quot; FAN JUST LIKE THE BAND SAID WHEN I SAW THEM LIVE!
B0000959N0|4.0|Im an avid reader of Daredevil and enjoyed the film. The writers got a great deal straight from the comics. They also changed the character and his mythos, but that's par for the course. It has changed in various ways in the comics. DD went from a happy \\"devil may care\\" character (check out the 1964 origin issue and read from there) to a darker brooding character filled with rage and self pity. DD didn't just develop into a darker person, but his new traits were \\"retro-fitted\\" into his history. In other words, Daredevil has various \\"true\\" pasts and incarnations. <br />The character of Stick was a later addition to the DD mythos. Look at the first issue of DD. There was no Stick. DD developed his skills on his own. Stick isn't in the movie, but then it took something like 15 years for Stick to show up in the comics. Elektra was another later addition to the comic. DD's intense rage and insanity weren't there at the start either. Matt's brother has been long forgotten. There are other things that aren't there in the original comics, and ideas from the older comics that aren't in later ones. Many of the retro-fitted ideas into DD's history don't match the original character, but they've kept DD alive. <br />The changes in the film serve the same purpose as those which have taken place in the comics. DD in the film is much darker at the start. He's more Punisher than Daredevil, but what makes him ultimately not like the Punisher is demonstrated as the film plays out. I think it's a good explanation for why DD is who he is. Given a character that has changed a great deal since 1964, the makers of this movie did very well. There isn't just one way to tell his story or one story to tell. I'm happy with the results and can't wait for more.
014118213X|5.0|Howards End is a wonderfully written book.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It is a very compelling novel that deals with the conflicts between the wealthy upper class and the less affluent working class of England.  The novel is set in the close of the Edwardian Era of England, a time in which these conflicts were flourishing.  The Schlegel sisters represent the cultured and sophisticated side of the upper class of England, while the Wilcox family represents the more materialistic and stuffy side of England's upper class.  The conflict between these families, which governs most of the book, arises from the dilemma of which family will obtain ownership of Howards End, the estate, after Mrs. Wilcox passes away.  The two families are joined by the marriage of Margaret Schlegel and Henry Wilcox.  The ownership of Howards End is awarded to the same person for whom it was destined in the beginning of the novel.  E.M. Forster crafted a masterpiece in Howards End, and it is a classic that will last throughout time.
6305428425|4.0|Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow make a great duo playing the role of Romy and Michelle, respectively, in this mirthful comedy.  Romy (Mira Sorvino) and Michelle (Lisa Kudrow) have been social misfits throughout high school. All through high school Romy and Michelle were made fun of by the popular group of girls otherwise known as the \\"A group\\".  They finally have a chance to show they fit in by attending their 10 year high school reunion.  Prior to the reunion, Romy and Michelle transform themselves into \\"successful\\" women.  They wanted to impress their classmates, especially the \\"A group\\" and thought the way to do this was to show up in a fancy car as efficacious business women.  Romy and Michelle worry about how they are going to be surveyed by their peers so they make up a lifestyle that will astound them.  Romy and Michelle also become their own surveyors.  At the reunion, Romy and Michelle find their definition of success different from the girls of the \\"A group\\".  The \\"A group\\" girls are married and pregnant which is a typical stereotype of women at their 10 year high school reunion.  Romy and Michelle goes against the stereotype of women getting married and bearing babies.  Instead they portray a more modern representation of women in today's society.  In today's world women are moving more towards a career rather then becoming homemakers.  It's interesting how the movie depicts this idea.  This movie is definitely a must-see.  At the end you realize the problems one encountered in high school are not so significant after all.   Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion took me back to \\"the good old days\\" minus the 80s music, big hair, and horrific outfits.
0812968255|4.0|This translation may not be perfect, but it is a good resource for wise choice making. Although, Marcus Aurelius persecuted Christians (a sect in his time) his virtues and stoic philosophy grant him the ability to be a distinct spiritual artist. I prefer to replace his &quot;gods&quot; with God and his force against Christians as a force against sects or being part of bad crowds or better yet ignored. There is no substitute for the bible, but his spiritual exercises should be recognized as good.
0140177396|5.0|let me start out by saying this book was AWESOME!it keeps you on your toes and wondering. Lennie just touched my heart with every thing he said and did. I could feel his emotions. I cried so when he got upset, and I laughed when he was happy. Steinbeck really did a good job with this masterpiece. this is a book that you can read again and again and learn something new everytime. I would recommend this book to anybody who is looking for something to make the tears fall.
B0001Z53CY|3.0|I think this album could have been a lot better.  D12 really doesn't understand the idea of a group because Eminem is harly on here. Even if he's on a song, he's either only doing the chorus or only sings for like 10 seconds. D12's ablum &quot;Devil's Night&quot; was so MUCH better and better songs.  They should kick out some of their members because some of them have NO singing talent at all and a disgrace to the entire album.
B000089CJI|5.0|When I was your age, I listened to early OMD and Human League, and I was amazed how much of this sounded like it came from that particularly period.  The band also resembles the New Pornographers in the sense that the project was really something of a lark, but its quality and artistry exceeds that of Death Cab and Dntel.<BR>This is not retro music per se - it is extremely well crafted pop with highly intelligent really quite beautiful lyrics.  The backing vocals add immeasurably.  This is easily the best new music I've heard in the last several years.
0156027321|5.0|Rarely does a book break the boundaries of past fictional conventions to communicate a fresh story about spirituality in an unforgettable way.  Life of Pi is such a book.<br />Those with great faith often receive enormous trials to test their faith.  That's exactly what happens to Piscine Molitor Patel (who later shortens his name to &quot;Pi&quot; to make it easier to remember and to avoid jokes).  As a lad, he finds himself inextricably drawn into practicing the Christian, Hindu and Moslem religions at the same time in his native India.  While his practices annoy his religious advisors and puzzle his parents, Pi finds himself content in his continuing appreciation of God.  Life is always interesting for him, too, as he helps out with the family zoo.  From observing the animals, he finds out a lot about how animals relate to one another and to people.<br />Annoyance with the Indian government leads his father to decide to emigrate to Canada.  He sells the animals and boards a ship with his family to transport them to North America.<br />At sea, the ship quickly sinks . . . with one human and four animal survivors from the zoo crowded together in a single lifeboat.  The largest survivor is Richard Parker, a full grown Bengal tiger who takes up half the boat.  There's also a hyena, a female orang-utan named Orange Juice, and a zebra with a broken leg.  What will happen next?<br />The remainder of the story is a fable-like adventure that reminded me of a cross between Robinson Crusoe and all of the books about survival at sea in a lifeboat that I have ever read . . . except with the twist of how animals and a human can survive together.<br />The book's beginning and end of the book are especially delicious for their hinting about the true nature of the story and what has happened to Pi.  In the end, you will find yourself wondering . . . did that story really happen to Pi . . . or did another thing happen?  You'll find yourself pondering that question often.<br />Ultimately, the book asks the question, &quot;What is our responsibility to God . . . to one another . . . and to ourselves?  I suspect that this book will raise new answers and questions for you.<br />Ultimately, the book asks the question, &quot;What is our responsibility to God . . . to one another . . . and to ourselves?

B0000VD04M|5.0|Ed Wood (Johnny Depp), is a positive film enthusiast without strong skills in story telling, yet driven to tell the audience his story.  Ed's stories display little interest in perfection as they openly display imperfections which eliminate the magically believable moment.  However, it is these imperfections that Tim Burton highlights in Ed Wood where he displays Ed's imperfections and peculiarities to bring out the human side of Ed, which is what makes him lovable.  In filmmaking Ed might have received an F as he was awarded \\"worst director ever\\", but as a human he should get an A.  Tim Burton decided to film Ed Wood in black and white which vividly enhances the contrast in Ed's character.  In addition, the performance by the cast is outstanding as they add phony mood to the film, but it works like magic in this brilliant story.
B00005K9LM|4.0|Following on the heels of the successful 'Screaming for Vengeance' (1982), with the same artist doing the cover, 'Defenders of the Faith' (1984) did not disappoint.  Long before speed became the watchword for hardcore metalheads, Priest refused to follow up their previous hit single (&quot;You've Got Another Thing Comin'&quot;) and released the speedy &quot;Freewheel Burning&quot; and the menacing &quot;Love Bits&quot; as videos and the guitar drenched &quot;Some Heads Are Gonna Roll&quot; as the first single.  The result was very little radio airplay, but a mammothly successful tour.<br />The tour is documented on several live cuts released on the Priest remasters, but only one is inlcuded here - &quot;Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith.&quot;  (FYI:  You can obtain live versions (from the same show) of &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; on 'Sin After Sin' remaster, &quot;Rock Hard Ride Free&quot; from the 'Priest Live' remaster, &quot;Night Comes Down&quot; on the 'Ram It Down' remaster, and &quot;Grinder&quot; from the 'British Steel' remaster).  The studio track, &quot;Turn Your Light On&quot;, is nothing more than a disposable power-ballad and a reminder of the downturn that Priest would take with the successor record, 'Turbo' (1986) (i.e., it is an outtake from the 1985 studio sessions).
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Tim Burton directs an enchanting story about storytelling and the magical properties of fantastic tales.  The story begins with the son, William Bloom, who has moved to France with his expecting wife, Sophie. and after three years he is forced to return to the US to see his dying father, Ed, with whom he has not spoken in three years.  William is determined to find out the truth behind his father as everything that he has heard since childhood about his father has been fantastic imaginations about giants, miraculous adventures, and big mysterious fish.  However, as William returns to his childhood home the fairy tales told by his father continue, and the question is whether William will have time to find out the truth before the old man dies.  Big Fish is a powerful cinematic experience as it combines the traditional and contemporary manners of storytelling and as the tale unfolds it leaves the audience with both entertainment and notions to ponder.
B0000630BT|3.0|To be sure, 'Painkiller' (1990), the last record to feature Rob Halford on vocals, was a well-intended middle-finger to the forces behind the ridiculous suicide litigation and the abandonment of radio.  However, aside from &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; and the title track, those Priest fans who were there from the beginning found it to be a little too little, little too late.  That is, the scant lyrics have to be arguably the most inane of any Priest record, and the speed metal thing (i.e., the idea that speed=good music, personified in the addition of Racer-X drummer, Scott Travis) came about a full two years after the trend emerged.  Unfortunately, despite the fact that speed-kings Metallica successfully brought back the traditional Prist style of letting the chords ring with its eponymous 1991 smash record, Priest's downward spiral into the irrelevant would nonetheless continue with the 'Ripper' Owens records, 'Jugulator' (1997) and 'Demolition' (2001).<br />At least there is some good news.  Unlike most of the Priest remasters, at least the extra tracks have a connection to the underlying record.  We have a live version of &quot;Leather Rebel&quot; (taken from the same 1990 LA show as &quot;Better By You, Better Than Me&quot; on the 'Stained Class' remaster) and a decent outtake, &quot;Living Bad Dreams&quot;, from the 'Painkiller' sessions that was probably left off the original record because it was a ballad (god forbid!)

B00007BH5C|5.0|I have heard all three of the movie soundtracks and they are all amazing.  Howard Shore is a great composer.  You can reinact all the movies in your mind by hearing these wonderful soundtracks.  Great Movies. Great Soundtracks.
B00009V8Z9|1.0|And I would never write an album review for an album I haven't heard in its entirety, but my roommate plays this album constantly and everytime I hear the beginning of &quot;Follow Through&quot; I get this overwhelming urge to either leave the room or poke my eardrums out with sharp sticks.  I am forced to listen to this CD on a daily basis sometimes and it's sheer torture.  The only good song on the entire album is &quot;Chariot,&quot; and I really like that song a lot (I almost purchased the CD because of it), but I'm thoroughly glad I didn't because the rest of the songs are a completely different genre and also annoy me to no end.  The melodies are so irritating and predictable and the lyrics and rhymes are so bland and obvious.  Some of these songs sound like they took ten minutes to write based on their musical and lyrical depth.  He has a nice voice, but that's no saving grace for some of the most annoying music I have ever encountered.  Please buy John Mayer or Jason Mraz or someone who writes catchy, clever songs or just download &quot;Chariot&quot; and save yourself from this garbage.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|I'm always amused when I read radically divergent reviews of a movie. Big Fish seems to be one that people either love or hate. This is, in short, an homage to the art of the story--to imagination. If you are a person who likes movies that follow a linear progression, with clear good guys and bad guys and a standard plot, this is not a movie for you. This movie is a hall of mirrors, with worlds within worlds and characters that transform and transcend themselves, often appearing or disappearing inexplicably. The cinematography and direction are highly stylized; the colors are vivid and the characters are, in some cases, quite literally larger than life. I loved the sense of wandering into one enchanting or enchanted place after another; it was never clear if a place was in some alternate universe or just down the road. I couldn't wait to visit the next magical scene--it had a very Alice in Wonderland quality about it.<br />The movie asks several questions. What is better, truth for truth's sake, or a great story for the sake of a great story? Do we have the right to hold onto illusions at the expense of real life and real loved ones? Is the desire to reinvent oneself a noble quest or a pathetic, self-aggrandizing exercise in futility? While it is clear that Burton leans in the direction of the &quot;big fish&quot; tale, he doesn't offer easy answers. He shows the frustration experienced by the son, Will, who has been kept at an emotional distance from his father who seems not to be able to incorporate the reality of his less-colorful boy into his wild tales. Although Will comes around at the end and gives his father an emotionally wrenching last &quot;gift,&quot; the audience still gets a sense that the son is not all wrong--his father's unwillingness to bend and share authentic experiences with boy did come at a heavy cost.<br />My unwillingness to give this movie 5 stars is mostly based on a few performances that seemed less than stellar; Billy Crudup is good butnot great in a part that could have been handled with so much more sensitivity. I believe he was supposed to be more likable, but he came across as a bit of a whiner. I typically love Ewan McGregor but I couldn't quite get a handle on his character; he seemed not to fully commit to the character and thus, he didn't convince me that he was the perfect casting choice for this. Jessica Lange is wonderful as always, but her part is relatively small and she plays a type more than anything; she is supposed to be an archetypal love of a man's life, and so she is angelic and two-dimensional. It would have been great to see the effect of her husband's constant storytelling on her life, but perhaps this would have been too much to cover. <br />Several of the smaller parts deserve special mention; Steve Buscemi brings another delightful character to the big screen as the unbelievably untalented poet Norther Winslow. Danny DeVito continues to impress; he's at once grating, conniving, and emotionally vulnerable. Another standout was Marion Cotillard as Will's French wife, Josephine. She manages in a very few lines to convey such depth and warmth; she's a beautiful young woman who should get some notice in the future. Another wonderful performance is Matthew McGrory as the giant, Karl, a fantastical creature who manages to be one of the most real characters in the movie with his wistful melancholy and realistic outlook on life.<br />If you have an open mind and want to escape to another dimension, this movie is not to be missed.
B0001AVZA8|1.0|This movie was as dull as dull gets! Sorry Jack, you're just not convincing as a charming old fart who can &quot;reel-in&quot; the twenty-somethings with the fight and personality (lack there of) of a farm raised trout! Diane Keaton's character, supposedly a sharp counter-point to her competition (youth, beauty and naivette) was unconvincing. Instead of genuine wit and eruditeness, the script gave her trite and expected lines.  We, the audience, were treated to multiple scenes of Diane et.al., laughing at her witticisms which she silently mouthed as the music swelled.  I suppose we were supposed to believe that at these times at least, Diane was clever. At least Diane isn't a plastic-surgery addict -- it was nice to see a mature woman looking her age!
0767830555|5.0|To be frank, although I enjoyed Scorcese's Mean Stretts, the film did not leave a lasting impression on me.  This does not mean that the acting was poor, rather the script was somewhat simple and unpolished.  Scorcese took a lot more time on Taxi Driver, and this is apparent throughout the entire film.  To begin with, the music score by Herrmann compliments the tone of the movie perfectly and conveys a feeling of loneliness and drifting.  Secondly, the strength of DeNiro and Keitel's acting has improved considerably.<BR>   I don't want to give an explanation of what happens in the movie, rather to present an inidividual understanding.  Many have dismissed Taxi Driver as a film which goes nowhere, and have called it too artsy.  My interpretation differs.  Certainly, it is not a unique film, but the feelings of loneliness and social awareness that DeNiro brings to his role are interesting.  DeNiro may be thought of as a modern day Steppenwolf-a man completely alienated from his surroundings.  Note, for example, the scene where he sits in the cafe with his collegues.  His inability to communicate at even the most superficial level demonstrates his alienation from his surroundings, but also arouses the sympathy of the viewers.<BR>    Taxi Driver is unique in that the Scorsese did not hesitate to include racism in the movie(recall the scene when Bickle leaves the cafe and throws some menacing looks at a black man passing by).  To see a film that is not concerned about making people happy and being politically correct is refreshing.  Also the portrayal of the corrupt and superflous candidate is amusing.<BR>   Essentially, Taxi Driver is one of the most slept on films of the 1970's.  Although it made a big impact at the time of its release, the touchy subject matter made it difficult for TV stations to air it to a home audience.
1576751988|5.0|I must have read fifty time-management books, but this is the one that did it for me -- my productivity has increased tenfold after reading this book.  Tracy has simple precepts that nevertheless made a light bulb go off in my head, like &quot;There is never enough time to do everything, but there is always enough time to do the most important thing.&quot;  And he helps you define the most important thing -- the one that will make the most difference longterm.  After years of struggling to prioritize and work on ten projects at once, the way the author explains things finally made me &quot;get it.&quot;  I was also impressed at how he did his research: he found the most productive and successful people he could, and asked them how they did it.  This book REALLY helped me!   Let me add that I have no connection to the author or publisher of this book, and this is my first review for Amazon -- I'm just an unbiased reviewer who loved this book.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|I don't know exactly how to rate this album...I guess 4 stars will do.  This is by far a very diverse album, which features the songs that basically reintroduced the Offspring to the world (Pretty Fly &amp; Why Don't You Get a Job).  Now, while those are not necessarily the most involved songs ever, they are fun, but are not the high spots of the album.  Have You Ever, Staring At the Sun, The Kids Aren't Alright, Feelings, Americana &amp; Pay The Man are essential listening for the Offspring fan.  Everyone of those songs has its own flavor and feeling, and are among the best songs ever written by the band.  The album is very much associated with the singles that came with it.  Whether you like these songs or not, they are not all this CD is about.  The writing is clever, diverse, and unique, and it still holds up today.
0156711427|5.0|I knew I wanted to read A Passage to India when I heard about it. That's where it ended--as soon as I started to read it. The book was long, and tedious, begging for more action. As I trudged through the book and finished it, I realized that its significance lies not in entertainment, but in the thought provoking questions it raises. This is its one area that totally redeemed my painful experience. <BR>  The book focuses on the racial tension during the British occupation of India in the early 1900's. The story develops emotions and feeling within its characters based on their perceptions of others through distorted racial prejudice. It raises the question: Is it possible for the natives to befriend their English occupiers?<BR>   When two women, Mrs. Moore and Adela Quested come to India, they seek to see the &quot;real&quot; India. They soon befriend Dr. Aziz, who is Indian. As Aziz shows them the country, racial tension soon creeps in. Much attention surround the Marabar Caves, and from this the central crisis arises. The fleeting romance between Adela and Mrs. Moore's son Ronny, plays an integral role in the racial accusations brought against Aziz. <BR>  Relationships prove to be the focus of the novel, and shows what prejudice does to them. This theme is one still being fought in the Middle East as Western influences clash with Muslim Arab culture. Can we be friends?
B000002LIX|5.0|I make no appologies when I say that that was the worst editorial review I could have imagined. I couldn't help but take offense for Jane's Addiction when I read it. To begin with, I prefer Nothing's Shocking to Ritual. Keep in mind the editor said this is &quot;by far&quot; the best Jane's Addiction album. Then he goes ahead and takes a stab at the incredible duo of epics daringly placed smack in the center of the album, saying they are &quot;overlong?&quot; What's that supposed to mean? This possibly would get the nod over Nothing's Shocking if track 8 was something else, because it's not my cup of tea. That's not to say it's bad, just not my cup of tea. Oddly enough, the editor said that was a standout. Hmmm... anyway, so I take it as an insult to Jane's Addiction if he could say this is by far better than anything else they've put out and criticize a heavy portion of the album. (Dude, &quot;Three Days&quot; and &quot;Then She Did&quot; are 2/5 of the cd!)<br />That said, if you're looking for a fun album, look no further than this. I gave it 5 stars despite not really liking &quot;Of Course&quot; so that really tells you something. This is also a better place to start than Nothing's Shocking with the more catchy tunes in &quot;Stop&quot; and &quot;Been Caught Stealing.&quot; &quot;Stop&quot; being my favorite song on the album. The aforementioned epics are not far behind in my book. Just a different perspective for you, the consumer.
0671027344|4.0|THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER<br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is about a teen, named Charlie who is experiencing and seeing different things. Most of the things he faced were actual stuff that happens to teenagers in high school. The stuff that he faced were dealing with his friend and foes, trying to stay away from drinking and doing drugs, and going out with a girl who he doesn't like. Charlie mostly kept most of the things he saw or heard to him self. As you read further in the book you will find out that he falls in love with a girl who is older then him. Her name Is Sam and he loved her a lot. He also has two gay friends who he is close with. He faces difficult obstacles through out the book. He wasn't close to his sister like most of the children in the family are but when something happened; he was the only one she trusted.<br />I thought the book was real good although it wasn't the action type of book that I wanted but I still enjoyed it. I liked this book because it had surprising turns that came up out of nowhere and the real life obstacles that happened. Also, I thought this book was good because every time there's a bad situation Charlie finds a way to get out of it. <br />If you like reading a book with actual stories and a surprising ending. Read this one!!!
1592400876|2.0|A classic example of book overhype. Ms. Truss may be a fine person and experienced writer but she desperately needs a much stronger editor, as this so-called British bestseller is wildly overwritten, hopelessly redundant, decidedly unhumorous after the first few pages, and generally not very illuminating to those of us who also abhor poor punctuation and grammar. Absolutely not worth the $17.50 it commands. Sorry, Lynne.
B000002C1W|5.0|Roger Waters?  Many reviews claim a lack of something with out Waters.  What about Syd?  Flat out, this album stands on its own.  Fantistic!  A band with different key members that stands tall from 1967 to 1987.
B000002MUW|2.0|Despite some interesting songs like &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; or &quot;Secret&quot;, this Madonna album is nothing to write home about. Presenting a mix of R&amp;B/pop/soul, this effort fails to seduce and intrigue, being a listenable enough yet ultimately blah record at best. It`s more tolerable than &quot;Erotica&quot;, though, but far worse than the subsequent and more innovative &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;American Life&quot;. An average record from an uneven artist.<br />Mostly filler material.
B00005QENZ|5.0|This album is PACKED with songs - and they happen to be big songs that rock. Granted, it's produced with polish, but when you've got loads of money and you're in the big game (AND trying to keep your 2nd wind rolling with momentum in your third decade of relevance), there WILL be some &quot;commercialization&quot; to your music. But if I ever get any point across to anyone, hear ye hear ye: Commercialization doesn't have to be a bad word if you still back it up with your musical integrity.<br />Many people say that Get a Grip does not back up the integrity of Aerosmith. It's funny how in the early 90's, this album was the ONLY thing acceptable in the teenage mainstream (aside from Zeppelin and Floyd) that wasn't spelled with an N, an I, an R, a V, an N, ... you get the idea. So, when it was trendy to bash the 80's, Aerosmith sort of fell through the cracks of adolescent ridicule and sold millions of this record, and they have been paying for it with many &quot;loyal and disappointed&quot; fans ever since Grunge faded out and the late 90's gave way to the new Millenium. Now, many call the AmazaCrazyCryin trilogy a bunch of cheesy garbage. Funny how these are the same songs that were colossal hit singles with fans and newly-converted alike, back in 93-94. Then you've got your older generation who won't shut up about how Aerosmith will never rock like &quot;Toys in the Attic.&quot;<br />So, as a fan of All Aerosmith Eras, I hope you can accept that as a chance for an objective (if passionate) review of &quot;Get a Grip&quot;, when placed into the big picture.<br />First of all, in another 5 years, this album will probably be well-remembered again, and probably thought of as a classic, just as some of their 70's stuff (especially since word is they're going back to that direction at last). It's all just a big cycle, and if you need proof, trust me - the 80's are MUCH more tolerated now than a decade ago. It's just taboo to touch anything within the 5-15 year span afterthe initial craze dies down. But I'm gonna touch it. And listen to it. And talk about it. And love it.<br />This album rocks big time. And it doesn't rock shallowly, either. Joe Perry's got some scorching solos all throughout (especially given his &quot;sloppy&quot; bluesy balls-to-the-wall technique). The one in &quot;Livin' on the Edge&quot; is quite melodic and creative. The one in &quot;Crazy&quot; is so tasteful to the mood of the song. And mainly, &quot;Eat the Rich&quot;... this is one of Aerosmith's greatest non ballad songs ever. It starts with the 'Walk This Way' riff, but does not cash in. It dives into a fast gritty riff of its own and plunges into a real calorie-burner of a song, no pun intended. The lyrics, the music, the groove, the cohesiveness as a band, the refraining from substance abuse that often clouded the band's creativity - it all came together with &quot;Permanent Vaction&quot; and &quot;Pump,&quot; and triumphantly kept on going.<br />Let's tackle the issue of AmazaCrazyCryin. These songs are expertly written, recorded, and performed. So emotional, not pretensious, at times epic, and when closely analyzed, creatively crafted. If you are thinking they sound like a formula that's been repeated over and over, ... don't forget that someone first has to invent the formula. There, issue tackled.<br />Anyone thinking chants of &quot;sellout&quot; might want to think of the pressure-filled situation of having sold gazillions of copies and STILL having the ball in your court, knowing that the public won't forget you've got another album coming up again. This album also proves that not so long ago, you could have 5 HUGE big singles and NOT chalk the rest of an album up to filler. This album can be thought of as a great template which, aside from Amazin/Crazy/Cryin, has never stimulated later influence in other artists who boybands shall here britney go unnamed matchbox20.<br />Only &quot;Gotta Love it&quot; gets a bit boring and repetitive, and eventhere, they experimented with some different chords that just didn't happen to work. As far as 14 song journeys go, &quot;Get a Grip&quot; is one of the strongest albums. I think it's a wonderful touch to close with a well-written instrumental (&quot;Boogie Man&quot;), showcasing immense diversity for an American staple known as Aerosmith.<br />Don't get me wrong, I DO have issues with outside writers, when the band could do it themselves (I've got huge problems with the Diane Warren infection that would soon follow), but in my modestly educated opinion, the product as a whole DOES sound like the band you expect it to sound like, just a next-decade upgrade (And I usually call veteran rockers' &quot;evolutions&quot; DOWNGRADES instead).<br />Bottom line, put all the mild controversy aside, put the phones on (or crank the stereo up) and blast off to Aeroland. You'd be hard-pressed to honestly call &quot;Get a Grip&quot; anything short of quality rock and roll from a legendary band that does just that.
B00005JY1B|1.0|As bad as the cover suggests, &quot;Sweet November&quot; is not really a movie but a long soap-opera episode featuring Keanu Reeves, Charlize Theron and a bland Enya soundtrack (yup, Enya. Sounds good, huh?). Essentially a cliched, tiresome and utterly tedious romance, this corny chick flick manages to deliver two or three decent scenes (mostly due to the solid Thero performance) and a lot of uninteresting tearjerker moments that drag endlessly. As entertainment this effort just falls flat, and as food for though it`s equally inane and useless. Nothing new or exciting here, I`m afraid, but I can`t say I`m surprised.<br />Insipid and forgettable.
B000001G16|5.0|\\"I walk alone in the darkness of the city...I might be dyin but you can't hear a sound\\"    Good lord. Which album to listen to? Given that both are handed down from God himself. Isn't it ironic that Jon and Richie \\"parted ways to do their own thing\\" and then each of them singlehandedly made the BEST ALBUM EVER MADE, completely without the other? Well, that in itself should build on the musically underrated credibility of the band Bon Jovi. Unfortunately this was the artistic peak (so far!!!!) in their career, as recent albums post \\"Keep the Faith\\" have been played it a little safe.    But you want to talk underrated? This will go down as the most underrated album of all time, hands down. I cry when I think about Richie's potential. He has so much soul, technique, feel, blood and sweat....    Everyone knows this album is an artistic triumph (which Richie regrets his lack of commercialism (???????) ), but just like Jon's Young Guns Masterpiece, this album is SATURATED with epic lyrics to get you through the toughest of tough times and find emotional muscle, and there's many other great things for all the \\"commonpeople\\" out there. AND there's great diversity throughout. Highlights are the title track, \\"Father Time,\\" and \\"The Answer\\", and also the single \\"Ballad of Youth\\", though of course the whole thing really is a mega highlight in an otherwise ridiculous music industry. Again, if you consider yourself a lover of music, you BETTER own this album.    Greatness    And Richie, for God's sake get your passion back to play guitar and stop dwelling on being radiominded for atleast 2 songs an album. Is that too much to ask?
B00005JMJ4|2.0|&quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; was a solid, though overrated, directorial debut for Sofia Coppola. Moody, ethereal and meaningful, it presented a promising director and one to follow closely. With &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, her sophomore effort, similar gloomy and melancholic atmospheres persist, yet the movie doesn`t quite work and fails to impress. <br />Sure, the idea of two lonesome individuals in a foreign land developing a peculiar relationship (friendship? love??) is somewhat enticing and could lead to a good introspective drama, still this cinematic experience drags too much and never seems to take off. Bill Murray plays, well, Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johansson is cute but far from excellent on her role. <br />Trying to develop subjects like loneliness, communication and life choices, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; only suceeds in delivering an indulgent story with uninteresting characters, enticing cinematography, a well-crafted atmosphere and a very good soundtrack (Air (again), Death in Vegas, Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine`s Kevin Shields, and many others). <br />This effort is a cheap way of discovering some places in Tokyo at night (offering a realistic, documentary-like style), but a movie should tell an absorbing story with memorable characters, and this one just falls flat. I`ll admit that it`s pretty and enchanting at parts, yet some nice visuals and neons aren`t enough to provide a (good) movie.<br />Disappointing and sterile.
B000002TQV|4.0|(...with the top prize going to Bon Jovi's &quot;These Days&quot;, in my subjective opinion - don't click &quot;no&quot; if you don't know it)<br />Do not bother with this album unless you are serious about your music. I personally maintain that mantra for all albums. This won't work if you are one of those people who only buys music that &quot;seems to be popular&quot; so you can have it on as background aural wallpaper in your house. It needs time to grow on you, and that can only be done with highly attentive listening.<br />I have a pretty firm grasp on my 700+ cd collection. All in all, I make it a point to be aware of as much music as possible. This cd, however, was one that slipped through the cracks of my rigid listening routine. Technically speaking, I am in the agegroup of people who was supposed to worship Nirvana and friends in the 90's heyday of 80's extermination camps. I am proud to say I put my musical alliances elsewhere, but not proud to admit I made a mistake with Radiohead; I lumped them in with the rest.<br />I did like &quot;Creep,&quot; but for some twisted reason I liked it just enough to avoid the first album but buy &quot;The Bends&quot; right when it came out ... and I barely ever paid attention to it, there was much better stuff on my priority map. It collected dust for years. The whole grunge/alternative thing was a huge turnoff for me, essentially because there wasn't as much substance in it as there was record-company-brainwashing, and the &quot;rock songs&quot; never really rocked. Mr. Cobain never learned more than 4 power chords, so I thought his message would have been better to the music industry (popularity aside) had he chose to express it in a medium other than music (and I don't know if I was all that wrong, look at where the biz is now!!!). Instead, the mediocre &quot;Nevermind&quot; album is seen as one of the best ever (gag).<br />As a supporter of &quot;Progressive Rock&quot; and any music that tries to push boundaries, however, I started to notice many respectable people put much respect of their own into Radiohead. I wanted in, and asked a good friend of mine to coach me through &quot;The Bends&quot; in a way that I would finally see what I'd been missing and couldn't see for myself.<br />He had me listen to &quot;High and Dry&quot; over and over again. I listened to it 15 times a day for a few weeks. I was on a mission. Finally it clicked and I found emotion and purpose in the unique Thom Yorke. I was too afraid to listen to anything else though - it was a lot of work and a very delicate project. Next it was on to &quot;Fake Plastic Trees,&quot; which I already knew somewhat, a great sentimental ballad. I realized that what was so frustrating for me about Radiohead was that there was much creative potential, but there were no solos, no epics, no great musical chops. It's more about the message and mood that make the musical statement. Which is great, but very 90's and very one dimensional. Some see a guitar solo as excessive, while I see it as getting my money's worth for the MUSIC I am buying. Fortunately the statement of Radiohead itself is wonderful; the whole album is a journey through the mind of one who has just made it into the spotlight with an unsureness as to where to go next. A slab of lonely and cynical disenfranchisement is injected into each song. Still, I need interesting musical creativity or I get bored; lyrics and personality alone don't quite finish the job.......usually.<br />My friend then suggested &quot;Street Spirit&quot;, the closing track. And this hit a homerun with me. Songs like this are what it's all about, making over-orchestrating the song unnecessary. The song is so good, it speaks for itself, with arpeggiated guitars, some backup string sounds, and the agitated despair of Mr. Yorke. Only when you truly focus on it do you &quot;get it.&quot; I listened to this over and over hundreds of times, for the sake of ENJOYMENT!!!<br />Then the whole album was fair game for my ears, and I must say, it's quite a strong album. Each song has something to offer that is somewhat different from one another (a rare feat for a 90's album), and there's all kinds of music with a unifying atmosphere. My personal favorite is &quot;Nice Dream&quot;. It's a beautiful ballad-ish song, but it's more sedated and ambient than a standard default tune. Much work went into the subtle textures and very creative harmonic changes.<br />That was 2 years ago, and the album continues to grow, with something new coming out of each listen. If you've written this cd off, it may be one worthwhile bringing back to life. On their own, none of the songs are among the best ever written (far from that), but the healthy flipside is that unlike most albums, EVERY song here is good. No filler.<br />As I am very close to countless people who consider this a masterpiece, there's a lot of cruddy albums out there to spend your time fighting them about instead, and it's just as well to let the Radiohead worshippers be. It's just a shame that those who consider this perfection have a long way to go in terms of seeing what's out there. Not that I don't, but for many people, this is their personal bible for times of need. JBJ's &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; album fills those shoes for me instead, being what I consider to be a much stronger dose of musical therapy. There's about 30-40 years of intelligent rock that puts &quot;The Bends&quot; in its place. For starters, make sure you check out Porcupine Tree and Transatlantic (and a little obscure band you've never heard of called Pink Floyd). While &quot;The Bends&quot; has grown on me immensely, that doesn't mean it has to grow to the top of the list. It's beyond respectable, but there's still much room to grow. It's funny that with their next handful of albums, they would progress more sideways than straight ahead...all in a day's work of being a unique and unpredictable group of lads from over the pond.
0140540563|5.0|Authors these days are constantly reinterpreting old fairy tales and nursery rhymes to spice them up, repackage them, and sell them as something new.  Credit this idea, in part, to the illustrious Jon Scieszka (a free cup of sugar to anyone who pronounces his name correctly) and illustrator Lane Smith.  Together, these two have successfully rendered the world of nursery-dom topsy turvey, beginning with the clever, \\"The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!\\".  At long last, the viewer has a chance to look past the biased press and (undoubtedly) stacked juries to hear the true story from the lips of Mr. Alexander T. Wolf himself.<br />As Wolf puts it, the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding.  One of those events that get blown way out of proportion.  See, it's like this... the wolf was just looking to borrow a cup of sugar for his poor bed-ridden granny.  He wanted to make a cake for her, but finding himself lacking the necessary ingredients he went to his nearest neighbor to borrow some.  Now here's where it all went higgledy-piggledy.  The pig (living in a straw home) didn't answer the door and the wolf had a bad cold.  By pure bad luck he accidentally sneezed the home down and, in effect, killed the pig.  Thinking it a bad idea to waste pork, the wolf ate the pig and decided to try another neighbor.  And so it went until he got to the brick house and was shortly, thereafter, arrested.  Poor poor wolfie.<br />Here's what you have to contend with if you read this book to l'il uns.  Yes, you have a wolf eating pigs.  Which is, to be fair, what wolves do.  Now you never see the wolf actually put each pig in his mouth.  And you never see the pig's faces prior to their devourement.  So, frankly, how much worse is this than your average fairy tale?  Trust me, the kids'll get over it.  After all, the book is aligned in such a way that your sympathies really do side with the wolf himself.  I was especially amused by the book's take on the \\"biased\\" media.  Says the wolf, the truth was kind of dull, \\"So they jazzed up the story with all of that `Huff and puff and blow your house down.'

0684808323|3.0|The book is good at the beginning, I can't tell you that it goes out of the story because everything written in the book is related to the story, but some parts of the book are really boring.<br />Everybody knows that in Vegas the mob owns the hotels & casinos at least at first, but what I really don't believe is that the casinos now, at this moment are the cleanest business in the country, maybe they don't take the money as 30 years ago, but I'm sure that in Vegas are many tricks with the bets and the money no matter if now in Vegas have one theme park in every hotel & casino.<br />At the end of the book, if  the wife of \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal was killed or not, who really cares?
B00002MZ2T|5.0|After such a strong beginning in the US, it left many wondering if this amazing Australian duo could do it again. Not only have they met my expectations with this album, but have far surpassed it. Again writing their own music and lyrics, Savage Garden takes you on a wonderfully emotional trip for the hour of pleasure you receive with each listening! &quot;Affirmation&quot; starts out strong with the title track being first. An upbeat spout of opinions (such as &quot;I believe the sun should never set upon an argument&quot;, &quot;I believe I'm loved when I'm completely by myself alone,&quot; and &quot;I believe your most attractive features are your heart and soul&quot;), this song will have you happily singing along in no time because of its upbeat attitude. My favorite track off this disc is &quot;I Knew I Loved You.&quot; A whimsical love ballad about knowing that there's someone out there for you and that you love them already, I don't think I'll ever get enough of this song. While the end of the album is slower, after a few listenings I came to appreciate it. &quot;I Don't Know You Anymore&quot; is a beautiful song, with emotionally raw lyrics and just light piano for music. &quot;Two Beds and a Coffee Machine&quot; is also somewhat like this song. With a piano and violin, Darren's vocals take us on the journey of one abused housewife who is financially bound to her abuser. However, the song ends with a positive line: &quot;There's hope in the darkness, you know you're gonna make it.&quot; Another favorite of mine is &quot;Crash and Burn,&quot; one of the radio singls. With rich vocals, addictive music, and an amazing message, it's definitely a song to listen to when you're not having such a great day. &quot;You Can Still Be Free&quot; is probably my least favorite on this album. The chorus seems to get old after a while, but the verses do make up for it. Other than that, I don't really have anything negative to say about this sophomore album. It's such a shame the Darren and Daniel went separate ways, as I would have loved to have heard a third endeavour!
0312995423|5.0|This Dan Brown book, in my opinion, was excellent.  Even though it followed the basic plot of all Dan Brown books, it was full of twists and turns that kept you reading and guessing until the last page.  The adventure from the book was fun and entertaining.  It was full of double crosses, mistaken identities, and misunderstood clues.  The odd facts about secret government agencies and technology were fascinating and informative.  I dare anyone who reads this book not to be entertained by this delightful yarn.
0385336810|5.0|I thought this book was great.  I've never read any of Sophie Kinsella's books, but now I will.  This book made me not want to put it down.  If you are looking for a book that has romance, comedy, and drama, this is the book for you.
0316666343|3.0|During a class for school, I was introduced to Alice Sebolds &quot;the Lovely Bones&quot;. Within the first two sentances, I was hooked. The sentance &quot;My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie. I was fourteen when i was murdered on December 6,1973&quot;. This immediately drew me into the story. <br />Throughout the whole book, Sebold makes you part of young Susies family. She takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions even years after her death. The hunt for her killer is just as dramatic. You are introduced very early to the mysterious character of Mr. Harvey. <br />This book may seem long at first, but eventually you just can't stop turning pages, and your done. I liked this book very much, but the last few chapters seemed to drag on, and I could have done without them. The last big event of the story is why I only rated it 3 stars. The event that took place didnt seem very real, and in my opinion ruined the real feel of the story. Overall, I would recommend this book to highschool age kids to adults.
B00018D44U|1.0|The recording industry once again gets behind some pretty face, with the right &quot;team,&quot; and poof...a star as born. Meanwhile, real talent like Peter Cincotti, Brian Evans, and Steve Tyrell are on the backburner. If you want the real thing, buy these three guys. Don't fall for the 12 Grammy hype that no one bought, just as no one should buy this CD.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Five years ago, I thought I had heard the epitome of hip-hop with Eminem's &quot;Slim Shady LP&quot;.  A few years later, Ludacris came up with a few beautiful singles.  And then there was Kanye.<br />When I first heard his debut single, &quot;Through the Wire&quot; I admit I wasn't very impressed (probably because I didn't know he had gotten in a wreck and had his jaw wired shut and was rapping with it still wired, so I didn't understand).  When I heard Slo Jamz I realized there must be more to him.  By the time &quot;All Falls Down&quot; came out on the radio, I had to get his CD.<br />College Dropout is my most favorite CD in a very long time.  Kanye's beats are incredible and I wasn't suprised to learn that he had supplied Jay-Z and a few other well-known artists with their instrumentals.  There is not a song on the CD I do not like.  Kanye not only suprised Jay-Z and the Rocafella &quot;familia&quot; with his white-hot rhymes but suprised America too.  Every song IS going to make you bob your head, and a few such as &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot;, and &quot;Get 'em High&quot; will have you rapping along with him and crip walking, working out, and throwing your hands up high.<BR>                            Parents might be disuaded by the fact that he--instead of encouraging education--tells America that he succeeded brilliantly without the aid of a college education.  Remember kids, unless you can make beats and rap like Kanye West, STAY IN SCHOOL.
0930289455|2.0|As you can see from nearly every other review here, this work is generally considered a classic - if not one of the all-time best Batman stories, up there with those Frank Miller ones. I disagree. And I disagree reluctantly because Alan Moore's writing is actually very clever and Brian Bolland's artwork is simply gorgeous. Why? Simple. I disagree with nearly everything about Alan Moore's \\"Batman\\". Frank Miller mentioned something like that in an interview also. Even Alan Moore has stated countless times that this is his weakest work. But fans still clamour after this book...<br />Five reasons I dislike this book:<br />[1] Batman is totally wrong. It seemed like the pet-peeve of every cynical Brit writer in the 80s and 90s to portray Batman as equally insane compared to his foes [check out Grant Morrison's \\"Arkham Asylum\\" for more of the same].<br />[2] The hopeless ending. Agreed, this book has the Joker at his most evil and the book ends with Batman and Joker laughing in the rain?<br />[3] The level of *sick* shocks in this book. From Barbara Gordon's crippling to Jim Gordon's \\"circus\\" experience. This was written at a period where shocking violence in comics is considered a prerequisite in crafting a \\"mature\\" work. Granted, I actually prefer Barbara as Oracle than the cheesy Batgirl but I absolutely detest the way Alan Moore did it in this book.<br />[4] The totally unnecessary \\"origin\\" of Joker. Joker is one of those characters in comics who really can do without an origin. He is a sicko, and that's all you need to know. We do not need to see him from a more compassionate perspective by having a \\"tragic origin\\".<br />[5] The use of \\"Watchmen-transitions\\". Alan Moore is justly famous for the use of clever transitions between panels. But in this book, we have transitions such as a poster of a fat woman freak in a circus leading to the next panel of Joker's pregnant wife. Where's the catch? This is the real problem of the whole work - clever but ultimately pointless.
B00005JM02|1.0|More like &quot;Jaws&quot; than &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is an intensely scary movie at points, with violent scenes that are totally inappropriate for younger children. It is a dazzlingly beautiful work of animation, but should be enjoyed by older children and adults. If you are unfamiliar with the film, there is an opening scene where Nemo's mother and siblings are descimated by a vicious barracuda. Later, Nemo's Dad and friend are savagely pursued by a toothsome denison of the deep ( and  dark)sea. Lots of jump-out-of-your-seat moments. The big scene with &quot;Bruce the Shark&quot; is less funny than you would think, and the violent chase which ensues, complete with teeth-bared Bruce hammering away at a sunken ship trying to get to the smaller fish inside is brutal.  To me &quot;G&quot; = &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; or &quot;Teletubbies&quot;. I can only conclude a lot of money changed hands somewhere to get this rating(and all the subsequent merchandising). This film is far more disturbing/scary than many PG or even PG-13 movies.  Please do NOT show this DVD to your small(under 8) children without viewing it first!
B00005JMEW|3.0|A serious problem that many self-proclaimed movie-buffs have is that they often think a good movie, and a movie they enjoyed, are one in the same.<br />I won't go in to it, because the only people that would agree with me, aren't the problem, and the one's who are the problem, are too full of themselves and too busy listing off how many DVDs they have in their collection as if it somehow gives their opinion more credit, to stop and think about it.<br />The problem with this DVD is, yes, it's the cut version.  We're missing some extra torture at the end, as well as a few extra items in the showdown scene - not to mention it's in black and white, instead of colour.  The animated sequence is slightly shorter here, as well.  Yeah, special features are lacking as well, but I consider the integrity of the film to be a much higher priority.  The Japanese version is uncut, and seems to be loaded with a lot more features (although I haven't really dug around much).
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Okay the series is amazing!!!  Yes, even for guys to watch!!!  But as the title eludes to - where is the booklet that's supposed to come with the set?!?!?!
B00004WG2F|5.0|This movie seriously kicks ass.  It's been my favorite movie for years and it makes me cry everytime.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Ok, let's start with the obvious: THE CLASSIC TRILOGY ON DVD!!!! Let's not get all huffy about the fact that it is the \\"Special Editions\\" and not the \\"original\\" editions. The incredible pettiness over this issue is a true testament to the incredible works of art the Star Wars films are. Especially the pettiness over the \\"New Trilogy\\". You will see reviews that scream \\"WHY DOESN'T GEORGE LUCAS LISTEN TO THE FANS?!?!?!?!\\". The answer is quite simple; the fans are not the artist, Gerorge Lucas IS. He makes these films with the hope that we enjoy the quality and scope of his amazing space fantasy. I believe you will enjoy the quality and scope of the epic tale of Star Wars: Episodes IV-VI. This is a story that has been told and re-told for over 25 years now. Only a REAL MASTERPIECE could endure for so long. Many critics cite these movies as breakthroughs in technological advancement in film. This is true, but it often overshadows the incredible story of a farmboy turned hero. It is a story that paralells many stories throughout time. A farmboy hero (Luke Skywalker), his trusty and loyal side-kicks (R2-D2 and C3PO), and old and wise wizard (Obi-wan Kenobi), a pirate (Han Solo) and his first mate (Chewbacca), a princess (Leia Organa), an evil henchman (Darth Vader), and of course the evil castle (The Death Star). It is a common formula for a storyteller's masterpiece, yet it holds a certain uniqueness because of the backdrop of a galaxy far, far away that it is painted on.
B000000OA6|5.0|I had never bought a Queen album before. I didn't know anything much about the band except for their hits and I had heard quite a bit about the enigmatic Freddie Mercury. Well I've been trying to branch out a bit lately so I just randomly bought a bunch of Queen albums last week. The first one that I listened to was &quot;A Night At The Opera&quot;. Very good album. I liked it a lot. Then I put &quot;Innuendo&quot; in. It blew me away right away. Wow. I own a lot of albums. I have a CD collection of about 200, and I don't have very many bad albums in my collection at all. So this means a lot when I say this: I already consider this to be one of the best albums I own. When I learned that this was released the same year Freddie died, it made it even more powerful. I mean here you have this guy who's near his death bed giving one of the greatest rock performances ever.<br />Some people have said that this is a dark album. I find it to be very uplifting! A few of the songs are really reflective, but the overall feel of the album is something like, &quot;Don't let it get to you!&quot; The only song I don't like very much is &quot;The Hitman&quot;. The rest are just crazy good. I see one reviewer doesn't like Delilah. Well I think that's one of the strongest songs on the album. Go figure. The vocals on it are hot! It's a love song about his cat. I read that Freddie lived alone with lots of pets. He loved his cat. Really touching if you ask me that he could find the love in a simple animal. You really get the feeling that he was making the most of his life. <br />I just love this album so much. If you consider yourself even a mild rock fan, you have to buy this.

B00003CWL6|4.0|American Beauty invokes a relationship between women and society.  The main women in the film are shown to the extreme ends of feminity and beauty.  Caroline, Jane, and Angela all have different aspects they bring to the film and each one symbolizes the true nature of women in the world outside of film.  <br />Caroline is a housewife trying to make a name for herself in the world of real estate.  She is the modern American woman trying to play the role of the mother, wife, business person, and typical woman in society.  However, she seems to be on her way to failure for all of them.  Caroline is an over achiever and it tears her apart that she is not perfect.  Her daughter Jane, however, prefers to exhibit almost no feminine qualities.  Caroline sees Jane as trying to be the opposite of herself.  She even asks, at one point in the movie, if Jane is trying to be unattractive.<br />Angela is Jane's best friend.  She is the typical beauty with blue eyes, blond hair, and a thin body.  Yet Angela is extremely unhappy and seeks the attention of everyone she comes a crossed.  <br />Jane is the one that becomes the true Beauty in this film, though she does not dress or act the part.  Her Beauty comes from being surveyed by the next door neighbor, Ricky.  Though his eyes, we come to see the beauty in Jane, and the ugliness in Angela and Caroline.  <br />The lesson learned here, is that one does not have to be perfect or thin or successful to be beautiful.  One simply has to be seen.  If only the outside world would come to such an epiphany.
0788821075|3.0|`Pretty Woman' is about a prostitute named Vivian, played by Julia Roberts, that finds herself in the employment of a very rich man named Edward, played by Richard Gere, that spends most of his time working.  <br />Vivian does her thing and talks Edward into hiring her for the week for the amount of $3000.  In order for her to do her job, she must go shopping for some new clothes.  She encounters the first signs of prejudice when the store clerk will not wait on her.  On her way back up to the hotel room the hotel manager stops her and to her surprise, he helps her in every way he can.<br />As the film progresses, Vivian starts to fall in love with Edward.  When Edward's lawyer discovers Vivian's true identity, he tries to attack her, but Edward intervenes.  Vivian then realizes that she could never belong in Edward's world.<br />After the week is over, Edward gives Vivian her pay.  She goes home and starts to pack.  She wants to go back to school and make something of her life, but at the same time she is missing Edward.  Just before she is ready to leave, Edward pulls up in a while limo and climbs the fire escape, just like in one of Vivian's dreams.<br />The film is entertaining and is the ultimate fairy tale come true, but what does this film say to it's young viewer's.<br />The film implies a that a woman, in order to be `pretty,' must be thin, young, and provocative.  I wander what the ratings of this film would have been if a heavy-set, woman wearing no make up was cast as the leading role.  An intriguing look into Hollywood film.
B00000K3G8|5.0|Just a point of clarification: this Special Edition CD is a great compilation and has great re-mastered sound, but it is not the complete soundtrack from the movie.   The CD is missing the songs &quot;Cities&quot; and &quot;I Zimbra&quot;/&quot;Big Business&quot;, probably cut out because it would force the compilation to be put onto 2 CDs instead of one. <br />Anyway, it's still a great disc so check it out.
B0001RVTXO|3.0|The label 4AD has acknowledged that on these discs the beginning of the song &quot;Hey&quot; has been cut off.  They plan on correcting this on future discs but have no plan to recall the defective discs that are already out there.  Don't buy this disc until this has been corrected.
B0000CDL93|5.0|They say that the third time's the charm and this certainly applies to the latest DVD version of Oliver Stone's film, JFK. Previous incarnations included a movie-only edition spread over two sides of a single disc and an extras-packed two DVD set, part of the Oliver Stone Collection that came out a few years ago. What's new on this one? Aside from all the extras from the last version, only a feature-length documentary and that's it.<br />All of the extras on the previous edition are included as is one new addition, a 90-minute documentary entitled, \\"Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy.\\" It uses Stone's film as a jumping off point in which to revisit the events of and surrounding the assassination and examine the cult of conspiracy theorists. There is some fantastic on the set footage of Stone in action and interviews with most of the star-studded cast. Detractors of the film (Walter Cronkite and a film critic from The New York Times) and its supporters (Robert MacNeil from the MacNeil/Lehr Report) are interviewed, providing an excellent snapshot of the controversy that swirled around the film at the time. This is an excellent, in-depth documentary that even includes interviews with Marina Oswald and fascinating archival footage of the real Oswald, including his infamous death on live TV at the hands of Jack Ruby.<br />For casual fans of the film who already own the Oliver Stone Collection version, buying this new one probably isn't really worth it. For hardcore fans of JFK and Stone, the inclusion of this impressive documentary is worth the price of purchase. For completists, however, one glaring omission is AMC's excellent episode of Backstory that was done on the making of the film. Perhaps this will be included on yet another future edition of this film. That being said, this is a solid two DVD set for a landmark film. JFK is essential viewing for any fan of cinema.

6304145438|5.0|This is a mini review of one of my all time top 10 favorite films<br />Since this film is set at Christmas time many view it as a must see film for the holiday season.  While this is well and good, it may obscure the true greatness of this picture. Simply put: This is the best film of all time. It is definitely worth watching anytime of the year. <br />It's a wonderful life reunites director Capra and actor Stewart at the height of their powers.  Lionel Barrymore is perfect as the miserly Mr. Potter.   The film is an excellent fusion of wry comedy and tender sentiment.
0140177396|4.0|John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is a very great book about two men who is looking fore work. Lennie is big and strong as a bull, but not so smart. He is like a child. But George is thin and smal, and he is the brain. The movie of mice and men is like the book, if you have read the book then you must see the movie. George have to watch Lennie all the time, because he foregets allways what George says. But he don`t foreget that they dream to buy a litle house and a farm with animals. That Lennie is going to take care of the rabbits. But Lennie gets in trouble all the time, and thats not good. In there new jobs Lennie killed a woman and he runs away, and George have to shoot him in the head. And thats the end of the story. The end of the story was not so good, thats because Lennie gets killed. He was a great worker, but he was getting in trouble all the time. Thats is the reason George shoot him i`ll think.
0425173755|5.0|Reading Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express is like calling up an old friend.  It is alway a familiar comfort.  This book is so perfectly Christie.  All of her favourite character types are here as suspects and the action is stripped down to Poirot simply interviewing one of these suspicious characters after another in his own inimitable style.  The solution is joyous, but almost sublimely ridiculous, and many of the clues with which Poirot uses to solve the crime are denied to the reader but still this is one of Christie's more elegant reads (to speak nothing of the perfect film version which even improves on the book).  This is the one to pick up and read again and again to get away from any of the stresses of a long day.  Simply the best.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Toxic is an excellent song: modern, catchy, fun and interesting (the dramatic violins, Britney's haunting display of classical singing), thus I was hoping to find more of this. But no; I'm afraid this album consists mostly of pointless junk barely containing a single sound gig to maintain interest. There's children's music (Showdown, Boom Boom), mind-numbing wannabe songs like Outrageous, Brave New Girl, the Hookup and Early Mornin' - all crap indeed worth skipping. Fortunately there are songs aside Toxic that save this album from being the epitome of bad music: Breathe on Me, Shadow and the single Everytime. <BR>Shadow begins nicely, turns into stadium rock by the time of the refrain, but makes for a good song anyway. <BR>Everytime is simply gorgeous. <BR>Surprisingly, as In the Zone is a sexually themed album and the S word is mentioned every so often, the theme itself is best handled in Breathe on Me: \\"We don't need to touch\\", goes the message. The Kylie-ish song is hypnotic and its airy sexuality keeps on haunting your player over and over again. The song, lyrics and everything, is just brilliant. <br />We'd get a five-star EP out of \\"In the Zone\\", or four singles sold separately. Selling them like this, surrounded by stupid birthday party songs is just greedy. Like Madonna, Britney has an ear for good music, the ability to know what the audience wants and to respond accordingly, the cunning to manage her resources, and the brains to write perceptive lyrics worthwhile listening even if the song is meant for brainless partying.<BR>After all, we're talking about one of the most influential people on the planet. The future President of US. <BR>Serious.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Enough people have already told the plot of this movie but it<BR>is so interesting to see such an unusual and unique film being<BR>made today.

This had to be a difficult movie to make<BR>and he pulls it off fine. You get so caught up in it--you can't<BR>wait to see what happens next. Slowly you start figuring out<br />what is going on.

Guy Pearce---cool--what a cool dude
0060920432|5.0|This outstanding book Mihaly Csikszentmihayli  is a tuly the best book of it's kind on the market. It is not a motivational, &quot;pump-up&quot; book. Rather it is based on true psychology and on what works. Not just a &quot;feel good&quot; book.<br />Highly recommended.
B00000GAIW|5.0|This is where it all started for me as a Tull fan. My friend let me borrow it and I ended up buying the CD. I've listened to other Tull and while they are brilliant in their own ways, nothing seems to measure up to this album. Everything flows together beautifully.
B00003CX9W|4.0|This really is the best way to introduce kids to classical music. If your having a hard time educating your kids on the classics. I really think this will help. Kids seeing their favorite character in scenery with the classic arts. Really is a wonderful idea.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Gorgeous from beginning to end, this film lusciously illustrates a cross-section of O'Brian's novels.  I'm almost done reading the Aubrey-Maturin series and feel the movie perfectly captures the spirit, intelligence, and wit of the books.   <br />Another Peter Weir visual feast.  Hope this does well enough at the box office to justify a sequel.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This is a very well done movie for Spider Man. Like a lot of people. I grew up with the Web Slinger and was very thrilled with the movie.<br />It's worth viewing for a Spider Man fan.
0140177396|5.0|&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is a tremendous book. It is a very understanding novel that really grabs you. Goerge is the main character. He is a strong-willed honest man. He has been lifelong friends with a &quot;slow minded&quot; man named Lennie. They both just lost thier jobs because of Lennie's bad behavior. They have recieved new jobs and George is vigorously trying to keep Lennie under control in order to keep thier new jobs.You can really feel George's emotions when trying helplessly to keep Lennie in order. The Plot of the book is fantastic because it has many unexpected twists and turns. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00004R9A4|5.0|This is a very good movie for every one. The story is very nice and the characters are fun for every body. I really can't think of any complaints. A rated acting and scenery.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty, a film directed by Sam Mendes, is meant primarily as a commentary on the American ideal of lifestyle and it's vast difference concerning reality. The film's previews include the cath phrase \\"Look Closer,\\" which prompts the audience to examine the film. The movie opens with a scene of the \\"ideal\\" suburban neighborhood, which is anything but that. On this street lives a gay couple, a couple in which the father is militaristic and the mother is suppressed to the point which she loses contact with the world, and the Burnham family. Outwardly, the Burnham family is living the American dream, big house, good jobs, and even a white picket fence. However, if one does \\"look closer\\" one would see that this is simply a facade perpetuated by Caroline, the Burnham wife/mother. She is perfectly groomed, has a (somewhat) successful career, cooks wholesome meals, and listens to elevator music at dinnertime. Through interesting plot development, Mendes destroys the stereotype and eventually Caroline. <BR>  Lester, the husband/father, is submissive to this scenario until his job is threatened and he snaps. Lester quits, obtains a job at a fast-food restaurant, begins to work out, begins an affair with his daughter's cheerleader-friend, and picks up smoking pot, and he's never felt better. Gone is our ideal father, replaced with a rebel rediscovering his youth.<BR>  Jane, the daughter, is out of touch with her parents. She is somewhat of a nonconformist and her contact with her mother destroys our notion of ideal mother-daughter relations. Caroline only speaks to Jane to acknowledge how proud she is that Jane hasn't \\"messed up\\" and to criticize Jane's choice of clothing. Jane is unsure of herself and very self conscious, she is not the happy-go-lucky teen of our dreams. <BR>  Also on this street lives Ricky, who views the world through his camera lens. He films what he considers beauty and serves as a representative of panopticon, or the view that we are always beingwatched. Through his lens Ricky films Jane, who eventually becomes romantically attached to Ricky and strips for the camera. Jane becomes the subject of Rickys's interest which although first is uninvited, soon becomes welcome. Ricky uses his camera to survey his domain, the new neighborhood, and to watch Jane. It is he who \\"looks closer,\\" not only at the stereotypes but at the world itself, and finds beauty in it. <BR> American Beauty not only helps us realize the futility of pursuing an \\"American dream\\" but also invites us to look closer at our own lives and to find the beauty within them.

B000021Y77|5.0|Run Lola Run, directed by Tom Tykwer, confronts stereotypes produced by Hollywood, with its unique graphic and audial representation as well as plot technique. Lola, our heroine, has 20 minutes to reach boyfriend Mani with a replacment for the money which he has been placed in charge of and lost. Lola is far from our average American female lead. Her hair is bright red, she's loud, and is imbued with superhuman powers. Not only is she able to sprint all-out for thirty minutes, she also is able to make it accross Berlin in this amount of time, and appears briefly as a cartoon character. Despite all this, in all of the scenarios, Lola never succeeds. Tykwer employs the use of three different senarios that play upon the butterfly effect and illustrate situations that Lola may or may not have experienced on her journey to Mani. The film is very contrary to stereotypes perpetuated by American cinema. Lola is everything but a heroine; she does not possess extraordinary beauty, has no control over her situation, and is unable to succeed in any area of her life it seems. She is unemployed (depicted by her low quality clothing) and so is her boyfriend Mani, apparently. <BR>  Tykwer's use of unusual graphic depiction (cartoons), techno ambience (created by the musical track, which does not allow the viewer to rest), and portrayal of Lola as the anti-heroine all create such an unrealistic combination as to contrast and expose the lack of reality in traditional female heroines and movies.<BR>  The original tital Lola Rennt (Lola Runs), was translated into Run Lola Run. Lola, who was originally running of her own volition, is now being told to run, presumably by Mani, a source of patriarchy in Lola's life. Lola runs to her father in the scenarios, requesting money from him. She represents the low class female, seeking help from the privileged, wealthy patriarchy. In one scenario, Lola dies, leaving Mani to gaze upon her devastated, unattractive body. Mani comments upon her appearance, leaving Lola once again in the role of the surveyed. In the final scenario, Lola comes to the rescue only to find that Mani has solved his problem, and that her help was unneccesary. Where before Lola has taken charge and responsibility, she is now powerless and useless, again in contrast to the heroine stereotype. The film closes with this thought and is emphasized by the shot of Mani and Lola interlocking hands. Lola is no longer seperate, equal, or powerful, and Mani does not need her.

All the songs are powerful and the only album I wouldn't recommend by Nightwish is Century Child.

0060900075|5.0|I've always felt that Aldous Huxley was the most versatile thinker of England the last century, Without forget obviously the presence of Bertrand Russell. His huge culture allowed him to explore all the known items. I must recognize that with the astonishing exception of a \\"Brave new world\\", as novelist, he doesn't have much to offer. I'd rather prefer his meticulous essays in multiple directions.<br />This book, in particular may be a good star for all who pretend to get into the Huxley's world.<br />I read that book in the middle of the seventies, and the first you acknowledge is the visible enchantment that gives to every note. In fact, Huxley was a fan of William Blake, and that explains the title \\"The doors of perception\\" (Jim Morrison was too a fervent reader of Blake).<br />The approach given for Huxley in The doors... is like he and us were in an opened conference with no restrictions of any subject.<br />The explanations above the different ways you may reach of reducing the efficiency of the \\"third eye\\" is ravishing. You read page after with anxiety for absorbing every little commentary or observation. The links inmediatly leads you to Loudun's demons (which served to Ken Russell for making a film entitled The demons, with Oliver Reed) (in my point of view his most complete work),<br />Heaven and hell is an autobiografical experience, in which he is under the effects of the mescaline, a plant used in Mexico. This mind journey is supported by recordings made in company with his wife and a friend of them. So this reading is just an overlapping of all the process.<br />In the seventies, too many things shocked the world. The end of Vietnam's war, The Watergate affair, the prizes of oil established by the OPEC in 1973. Those were the days in which Marcuse and Erich Fromm hold a wide audience all around the world.<br />And in this sense, this book became a landmark, because the huge amount of items that troubled to Huxley , such he refers us in a \\"New visit to a brave new world\\", The island (the other side of the coin respect a New brave world), Huxley added it no limits territories, a true example of what you may define like a reinassance man. In this category, you can include thinkers and writers like Bertrand Russell, Ortega and Gasset, Ernesto Sabato, Jorge Luis Borges, Joseph Campbell, Mircea Eliade, Paul Diel, Jean marie Domenach, just to name a few.<br />This book, if you're really are interested for knowing the essential facts that happens in your mind when you are disturbed by your own choice, will offer a crude but enriched analysis. Don't be afraid just thinking the information may be dated.<br />I'm talking about the first step you may climb in order to follow you bliss in this sense. The links you can do have no ending. All depends about your inner convictions and interest areas, like investigator, universitary student, common reader or mythology investigator . The sky is the limit.<br />You will be always rewarded.nd (the other side of the coin respect a New brave world), Huxley added it no limits territories, a true example of what you may define like a reinassance man.

When Fricsay passed away in 1962, Kertesz became in the great young promise.<br /><br />Indeed, he owned that we can call a sense of span in music.

Each story is enough to give you a chill or two, if not at the very least a few goose-bumps. I enjoyed the dark-humor in a couple of stories. A must read for any fan of the darker side.

Istvan Szabo , David Lynch , Taylor Hackford, Alvaro de la Iglesia, Cohen brothers, Kaurismaki brothers, Lars von Triers and Francis Ozon at this moment are the only directors who seem to have the force and the talent for following these dark passages.<br />Watch this film with people able to make an intelligent discussion after.<br />And remeber just once more, you must kill your inner dragons, because no one will make for you.

068484267X|5.0|If one keeps an optimistic attitude, then one can certainly overcome some of the highest hurdles found in life. This theme is powerfully shown in Frank McCourt's        touching memoir, Angela's Ashes. Frank McCourt writes about his life as a boy up until his early years of adulthood. McCourt tells the story from the 1st person point of view and his style of writing dramatically changes as the character progressively gets older. Frank's father, Malachy McCourt is a self destructive alcoholic who pisses any money he makes at local pubs and leaves his family to desperately search for meals. Frank's mother Angela McCourt is a humorous but loving woman who never pities herself or her family. The story opens in the late 1920's in New York City. Malchy and Angela have already had four boys when they decide to move to Limerick, Ireland. Limerick is a town ridden by disease, poverty and as Frank so vividly describes it, rain. Frank's little brother Malachy, named after his father enjoys Frank's company and the two often take pleasure in adventures together. Frank tells of his times in Limerick from the perspective of a young boy and gives little opinion, this adds humor.   <BR> \\"It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood\\". Frank's childhood is one of deprivation and poverty. He and his siblings often have little to eat and sickness spreads through the family. Frank's father, Malachy continues to drink away his wages. As Frank gets older he struggles to deal with a severe case of typhoid and he is placed in the hospital for months. Frank is forced to befriend literature when no one else available. As Frank becomes a teenager he  begins to work at several different jobs to help support his family. Despite all the problems Frank and his family face, optimism still prevails. McCourt does a marvelousjob at laughing off the tragic circumstances that existed in his childhood. Frank's mother is forced to make sexual sacrifices to help support the family. Despite this, Frank still dreams of making enough money so his family will never have to suffer again. McCourt also makes many references to his Catholic upbringing. He accepts the rivalry between Catholics and Protestants in Ireland and does his best to be a good Catholic. When Frank grows older however, he is haunted by his sins and ultimately does his best to distract himself from his guilt.<BR> Angela's Ashes is a great book which helps one appreciate their life and not take for granted the luxuries in our lives. McCourt does a brilliant job of making the reader cry and laugh while displaying his tough upbringing in Limerick. I personally would recommend this book to anyone especially those who love a good read with great characters and a satisfying ending. The reader will close the book with a smile, a tear and a rewarding feeling that reminds them of how powerful optimism can be.
B000002UD0|5.0|The way Elton John tells the story:  he heard the finished song and said to Lennon, &quot;That's a Number 1 hit!&quot;  &quot;It'll never be #1.&quot;  &quot;I bet it will.  If it goes #1, you have to come out on stage and sing it with me.&quot;<br />I strongly associate music with events, times, places.  On the Monday of Thanksgiving Week, 1974, my 21-year-old sister died of leukemia.  That was the same week &quot;Whatever Gets You Through the Night&quot; hit #1, and on Thanksgiving Night Elton gave a concert at Madison Square Garden, and out on stage walked John Lennon.  (The results can be heard on Elton John's live &quot;Here and There&quot; 2 CD set...excellent, btw).  Yoko was in the audience, and the rest as they say, is history.<br />&quot;Whatever Gets You Through the Night&quot; is a cheerful pop song with a lot of deep meaning in its lyrics.  It helped me through the grief of my sister's death, and many times I've listened to it over the years.  Some of the other songs on &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; foreshadow his later work on &quot;Double Fantasy.&quot;  On  balance, a very good album...with one excellent song.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Please listen to the 30 second samples before even thinking about buying this lame album.  Clapton has recorded some admirable covers of early blues artists in the past - listen to Jesse Fuller's 'San Francisco Bay Blues' from 'Unplugged', for example - but the tracks on this album utterly fail to impress.  What made the legendary recordings of 'Mr. Johnson' (puh-leeeze!) so impressive was the simple fact that they comprised just the sounds of one man's powerful voice and his mesmerizing guitar.  <br />On these tracks, the guitar playing is often buried beneath - rather than complemented by - the sounds of other instruments: piano, harmonica, drums, bass, etc.  The raw energy of Robert Johnson's early work is simply lacking (or buried) on these sanitised Clapton covers.  As one reviewer has already noted, this album is simply too 'slick' for its own good.  A far superior (modern) album covering Robert Johnson's songbook is 'Hellhound on My Trail' from the Telarc label. Mainstream Clapton fans may find the Telarc album too 'authentic' to appreciate, but true fans of Robert Johnson will find more to relish on that album than they will on this unnecessary addition to the Clapton catalogue.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a longtime SF fan, I've found that I'm often disappointed by what's out there to watch. But Firefly truly surprised me and I was crushed to learn that the the show was cancelled before they finished the first season. There are some things in the world for which there is no justice. Development of near beer, the constant rise of ticket prices for everything from the movies to a baseball game, and the way the idiots at FOX can keep their jobs running more &quot;reality tv&quot; than quality programming like Firefly. (Why can't these people just develop that non-fatal cancer that just forces them to leave the industry in order to do charity work in Laos...?) <br />Unfortunately, I came to the party late. That is to say, I didn't see Firefly on television, but perhaps I was lucky in that regard. I saw the entire series in the order it was meant to be shown with all of the extra shows not broadcast on the advice from a friend. <br />To say that I was enthralled and astounded is understating the case. There is no simple way to describe what this is about except to say that a very complex world was built in a very believeable future populated with a crew that I would happily join in a heartbeat.<br />I love the fact that this show avoids almost all of the cliche's that we've grown to accept in the genre. There are no mysterious alien races, there is no sound when you see the ship gliding through space, lasers aren't a primary weapon, there aren't any robots (or androids, or clones) and the heroes aren't caricatures  who spend all of their time being noble. <br />What you DO get is a complex show with rich, subtle texture and humor that plays on the great inter-relationships between the characters. You also get action, intelligence, great looking females who aren't immediately background props and a ship that has more personality than anything since the Millenium Falcon. <br />If you haven't seen this, I truly envy you because I would give an awful lot to be able to enjoy this for the first time again. Instead, I'll have to satisfy myself with being able to know when the beautiful moments are coming up and be able to watch for more of the little details that Joss Whedon always uses to enhance his worlds. <br />Get this. Then prepare yourself for the movie coming out next year. It's worth every penny. <br />-Gabriel

B000001GQD|5.0|This is by far the best recording of the Rachmaninoff out there. Richter is at the top of his game, he is much more agressive than most pianist's interpretations, and this is exactly what is called for. An all-around great interpretation. As for the Tchaikovsky, there are much much better recordings out there (such as the famed Cliburn or Graffman recordings) and I would not reccomend buying if your in need of a good Tchaikovsky (again, try Cliburn); however, if for some reason you must limit yourself to one Rach 2, then this is it.

B00004XPPB|5.0|A good actor is one who we forget is on the screen seeing the character rather than the performer. Johnny Depp seems to achieve this often in his career and once again we are treated to an outstanding performance in Donnie Brasco. Depp plays FBI Agent Joe Pistone who goes undercover to infiltrate a New York Mafia family. Hollywood has been there done that with this subject matter many times over but this film has a feel that is different than most of those over the top productions. Joe Pistone becomes his alter ego Donnie Brasco, blurring the line between his job and reality. <br />This is an intricate character study, not a film full of flying bullets and cheesy bravado. Depp and Al Pacino both give Oscar worthy efforts as you see the fondness develop between their characters over the course of the story making the inevitable ending that much tougher for Pistone to deal with.

B00003CXWV|5.0|This is a remarkable film about an exceptional story based on an eventful life. I'm surprised by the number of critics. Does this film try and glorify the drug dealer? No. Is George Jung a hero? No. Is the film's purpose to make him one? No. This is why I have problems with a majority of the critics of this excellent film. Why the criticism? The subject matter? The fact that it was based on a true story?<br />At any rate, back to the film, which is wonderfully shot backed up by great performances from Johnny Depp, Ray Liotta and Jordi Molla. The film is told from a narrative perspective by George Jung (Johnny Depp) tracing the spectacular rise and fall of the pioneering US cocaine distributor of the 1970's / 80's.<br />The film moves seamlessly from George's adolescence to adulthood through a number of locations and vividly captures the essence of that decadent era. The sets, costumes and music all work perfectly.<br />The audience takes an incredible journey, pulled into a world of drug smuggling / distributing, the illusion of 'easy money', ensuing greed and finally betrayal. While many are quick to point out the fact that this person was a &quot;drug dealer&quot; and ponder, &quot;why feel sorry for him?&quot;, this misses the point. His story doesn't search for sympathy from the audience, although it is a sad one. It is an unapologetic look at an unapologetic life.<br />The greatest takeaway from his experience was that he realized too late what was truly important in his life. Simple things, not the money, not the cars, but &quot;real&quot; things as foreshadowed by his father's speech to him as a child. A point that is continually being underscored by his father's unconditional love (wonderfully played by Ray Liotta, a refreshing character change for him) and culminates in his own unconditional love for his daughter - although he is too late to recieve it.
B0001ADB8C|1.0|For the price, they should have released the box set with original album packaging and inserts. If they released SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND with the original cover, then why not with the original song lineup and have the replacement songs as bonus tracks (most of the bonus tracks are jokes anyway). Where is LAY HIS HEAD, SAT SINGING, I DON'T WANT TO DO IT among others. Wake up Capital, this set shouldn't have cost more than $70 (if that much). What's next, his 8 Apple albums in a box set for $175 (I would love to see the bonus track they would put on ELECTRONIC SOUND).  Capital released this set so they could have included some of his Apple recordings (DEEP BLUE, MISS O'DELL, I DON'T CARE ANYMORE which were b-sides not on albums or, so far, CDs). Do you really need bonus tracks of the same year as the album it's on is made?  For the DVD, some of his \\"music videos\\" made me cringe. The DVD could have been done much better. Don't buy this set because of the DVD (I did, OUCH!!!!!!!!!). All in all, buy the CDs seperate, you'll save your hard earned money.

B00005UKE0|5.0|George Harrison sets the bar incredibly high here. This album is a stunning piece of work, and it shows George's need to break out on his own as many of this pieces were written while he was still in the Beatles. How they kept this stuff back, I don't know.<br />The first seven or eight songs on disc 1 is enough just to make up perhaps one of the top 10 albums ever made in rock history. But he follows that with another disc of great, great songs (I believe it was a three-record set back in the day).<br />In the astute liner notes, George admits wanting to re-produce many of the &quot;wall of sound&quot; songs produced by Phil Spector, but hung onto it to represent the era. Instead, he gives us some incredible accoustic versions of these songs, particularly &quot;Let It Down,&quot; which is clearly an improvement over the solid Spector-produced song.<br />This album is hard to put into words as Harrison really takes songwriting, signing, guitar playing, and production to a new level. As far as Beatle solo albums, only McCartney's &quot;Band on the Run&quot; is in this league, and really it's not in this league. It's just the next best.<br />When talking of all-time great albums, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; stands near the top.
079073804X|5.0|Based off of william peter blatty's best selling novel about a girl who becomes possessed by a malevolent entity really packs a punch!<br />The Exorcist caused all sorts of hype back in 1973 causing people to faint, vomit or go into labor in theatres.  This movie comes with alot of baggage: the green vomiting, head spinning and foul language spewed out by an innocent girl who is having major trouble with her bed really makes this film a cut above the rest of other horror movies.<br />Each actor becomes the characters of the story making the film that more believable.  This movie doesn't rely on creative death sequences or high cost special effects but rather it has an emotional impact creating psychological horror for the viewer.  There are many disturbing scenes involving the twelve year old girl, most notably one with a crucifix, I was stunned when I saw this scene because it showed that this film didn't hold back on making the viewer believe in the story or that the story really happened.  <br />The movie isn't constant violence every other minute but rather the tone of the movie is set by the music and the surroundings.  The music is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end.  It seems like there is a surprise every time we see Regan (Linda Blair) lying in her bed restrained by straps.  She talks in Latin and she projectile vomits.  She floats off of her bed and her head turns around three hundred and sixty degress.  The words HELP ME are etched into her stomach at one point during her possession.  She has a horrible purple tongue that darts in and out of her mouth during the exorcism.  She even turns into the dead mother of one of the priests.  It is also shocking to see the girl go through many painful tests such as a catscan to diagnose her condition.<br />The cast includes Ellen Burstyn as the put upon actress mother of twelve year old Regan (Linda Blair).  Max Von Sydow plays his role of Father Merrin so well that we actually believe that he is a priest.  Jason Miller plays Father Karras who ultimately saves Regan from her demons .  If you want to see a good slasher flick go watch Halloween or Scream but if you want to see the scariest movie of all time, get The Exorcist for a roller coaster ride that you will never forget!

B00005JKHN|5.0|One of Disney's best animated films has to be Sleeping Beauty.  The story of Princess Aurora who is taken away from the kingdom by the three good fairies in order to protect her from the curse of the wicked fairy Maleficent.  The film looks just like a medieval tapestry and the scenery is amazing.  Disney's Sleeping Beauty has some of the best animation ever seen on film.<br />It is wonderful that Disney has been releasing these restored versions on DVD of their classic films and adding some wonderful documentaries and behind the scenes.     <br />Sleeping Beauty contains some of the most widely recognized Disney characters: Princess Aurora(Briar Rose), The three good fairies Fauna, Flora and Merryweather and the most notoriously diabolical villain Maleficent.<br />While being an animated film, that doesn't make it any less thrilling, suspensful or exciting.  I recommend seeing this movie just to see Maleficent.  She appears in flames at Aurora's christening and she goes out with a bang as a ferocious fire breathing dragon.  This movie is truly an epic in every sense of the word: from the wicked fairy's curse, to the princess hiding out in a cottage with the three good fairies, to the princess meeting her fate atop the castle to Prince philip slaying the dragon and running up the stairs to find the Sleeping Beauty. This is one film that both adult and child can truly enjoy.<br />The Perfect Disney Film!!!!
B00004VWAF|4.0|A unique fusion album that was way ahead of its time. Definitly an inspiration for trance techno, but while I find most modern techno dull and cold, this album has the energy and soul of a live jam session (even though it wasn't recorded live). I do miss Miles' solos which are short and few, and this album doesn't quite have the character of Bitches Brew, his earlier fusion album. Still, these are some great grooves, and if I were a DJ, I would be sampling this stuff like there was no tommorow.
B00008NG5V|5.0|I don't know if there's a single CD I own that flows so effortlessly from one topic to another, weaving them all so seamlessly with a sound that doesn't wear out its welcome.  Not only that, but it's not dank and dreary, but stays upbeat.  <br />I feel Jack Johnson's personality is shining through 100% of this CD.  An interview I read with him just radiated with easy, laid-back, 'take it as it comes' sensibility.  He seems like a guy who would be fun to hang out with, to pick around on a guitar, go surfing, or just have some lunch.  Similarly, the songs on this CD seem to fit with any of the above environments.<br />The only negative I could find with this CD is it may be touchy to play as background music. To a casual observer not really listening, they may say (as they did in my case) , \\"wow, hasn't this song been playing for a long time?\\"  That may be because almost all songs consist of Johnson's guitar and drums, with a backup singer or second guitar sprinkled in every so often.  However, if you like the sample songs you hear from this CD, you'll absolutely love to hear the album in its entirety.<br />I personally love his style, and was saddened to see some magazine critics pan his work as being too ordinary, boring, or similar to his last album.  I prefer the sound of this album to Brushfire Fairytales, simply because it's more stripped down, seemingly devoid of studio touch-ups... though there must be a few, since everything sounds so pristine. <br />This is right up there on my list of albums I'd have if stuck on a desert island.  Johnson would approve, and would be right there with his surfboard and guitar.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This movie is the best movie I have ever seen! Al Pacino is the best. No other person could have played the role like good old Al Pacino-the king of gangster movies! He did it so well-He is my favorite actor! AL PACINO, YOU ROCK! AWESOME JOB! This is the best movie. It is a ganster movie about a Cuban immigrant's rise to the top of the cocaine industry. It is awesome, the 160+ F-bombs, the gun fights, the night clubs, the babes! This is the best gangster movie ever made, with the awesomist lines like &quot;Say hello to my little friend!&quot; and &quot;You got that like in your eye, like you haven't been f***ed in a year!&quot; and &quot;You think you can take me?! You need a f***ing army you gonna take me, I'm Tony Montana! When you F*** with me, you're f***ing with the best!&quot; This movie is awesome, I give it 10 stars, and two thumbs up. Once I finished watching it for the first time, I wanted to watch it again and again, especially the end gun scene! It is so awesome! Awesome movie! AL PACINO MADE THE MOVIE! AL PACINO, YOU ARE THE BEST!
B0000AFQS0|5.0|You can tell a lot of TLC went into this DVD.  This is the most well-made DVD I have ever seen.  It was clearly made by die hard Who fans.  The restoration must have been incredibly tedious.  They really did a fantastic job with the bits of decaying scrap film they had to work with.<br />But watching it makes you realize how unique the Who were live around 1969 and it's sad that nearly all the live footage of them from this era has been lost (Pete didn't allow filming of their performances at that time).  The director talks about this in the commentary during \\"Young Man Blues\\", which he actually salvaged out of a dumpster!  Even most of highlights of the Woodstock performance have been lost.  But what remains is sooooooooo good, I just wish I could see more.  Hendrix, Clapton, etc. could never get as intense as Pete playing live around 1969.  Pete was the guitar demigod.  Watch the woodstock performances (especially chapter 32) to see what I'm talking about.  Yes that is blood on Pete's right butt cheek.  It's where he wiped his bloody right hand while playing like it was his last day to be alive.
B00007E8V4|3.0|...this album seems to lacking what the first two had.<BR>Don't get me wrong, there are some truly amazing songs, such as streamline for example, but what destroys this record i sthe over production. Serj's voice is as usual, phenomenal, but is ruined by the guitarists constant backing vocals. He whines like a little girl. Why doesn't someone tell him, this??OK, he writes all the songs, but there is no need to put listeners in such pain.<br />Most of this record was originally leaked on the internet. If you can find those versions, burn those to a cd instead. No annoying backups can be found on any of them....<br />but still, some great songs. I just hope the next one isn't so polished.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This album is (sic). its a must for every diehard Slipknot fan, and a definate not for the Nu metallers out there. Best Tracks include: Me Inside,Wait &amp; Bleed,Spit It Out and Eyeless with lyrics like &quot;You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes&quot; inspired by a psychopath from California. Definatly Slipknot will come screaming and If this album is anything to go by, Vol 3: (The Subliminal Verses) will be a great album to.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Eventually she'll be sooo bad, she'll fall off the face of the earth completely and all will be well again.
0385336810|5.0|Her secrets are ones that I can definitely understand...if not relate to.  I just LOVED this book.  It had everything - it's funny, witty, intelligent, poignant.  Yes, there were a couple moments where I got a little teary-eyed - I could really feel her pain at certain points in the story.<br />Having read the 'Shopaholic' series, I found Emma to be refreshing and less needy than Rebecca.  Her little lies and withholding of information didn't annoy me as much as Becky's.<br />A very fun read. For all the grown-up girlies out there, time will pass quickly when you're reading this book.
B00005Y7L4|5.0|The movie which was made after the novel written by Koushoun Takami is Japan's \\"high-octane thriller.\\" A story about a class of students forced to fight to death on an island by their fascist government. This movie shows how the bonds of friendship and trust are broken by the will of self-survival. The cinematography in thise movie wasn't awesome, but it didn't matter. Great characters, plot, and an amazingly original idea make this movie great. Not all will like it, but if you have read the novel and enjoyed it, you will also enjoy the movie.
B000002O4S|3.0|This is a decent soundtrack overall, but nothing too impressive. The best tracks I think are the &quot;Huey Lewis And The News&quot; songs. The last two songs are good ones from the film as well, however the rest of them seem to be filler. I also like the two &quot;Back To The Future&quot; tracks, but think they should have opened and closed the album, instead of being randomly stuck among the other songs. This is something good to own if it's one of your favorite movies, otherwise I'd leave &quot;Back To The Future&quot; in the past.
B0001V07ZQ|5.0|This movie, in my most sincere opinion, is the single best war movie ever made.  The battle sequences are amazing and the relationships, for the most part, are quite real.  No one who enjoys a good epic w/ some battle and some friendships/buddy relationships will be saddened by this.  Oh and best of all.......NO TACKED ON ROMANCE SUB-PLOTS THAT MAKE NO SENSE!!!!!!!   Great acting, great production....etc.
B0001M0A4I|4.0|As far as classical music, im not a expert.But for first try it sounds very good to me.Would like to here more of tonys piano playing in the music.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is a great show from the writers to the cast. Re-live the first season with this DVD set. It is a must have for any fan, and it comes complete with special features. Best of all you get to enjoy the show with no commericals. Well worth  the money.
1592400876|2.0|The book has all charm of political talk show radio, those festivals of self congratulation offering smug warmth to those of us ever so much smarter than the other guy. It gets pretty thin pretty quick. Ms Truss suggests that punctuation exists to make clear one meaning over alternative errors of thought. She then proceeds to display her insights with ever so many examples of typographic or educational errors. It's not a bad thought, but it gets less funny the longer it goes on. And for a small book it seems to go on long. On the way she loses any connection to the early, simple truth, and the book becomes a simple parade of her superiority to traffic signs, cartoons, fourteen year-old girls, and Shakespeare. And it's not a bad parade; she has a firm grammatical grasp and offers many truly engaging bits of punctual history. But finally I wish I had heeded my unease at buying any book equal in size to those wondering where went the cheese.
B000089RV6|5.0|AC/DC released their first album of the 1980s Back in Black in July of 1980. The album was the first since the death of frontman Bon Scott and marks the arrival of Brian Johnson who joins lead guitarist Angus Young and his rhythm guitar playing brother Malcolm, bass player Cliff Williams and drummer Phil Rudd on this classic contribution to rock and roll history. There is no single weak track included, even the lesser-known album tracks are strong and kick ass. Despite the fact that AC/DC, returning producer Mutt Lange and engineer tony Platt recorded this album in the Bahamas, this is no reggae album or AC/DC gone rastafarian. Instead, the album is filled with all of the booze, sex and rock n' roll that goes with it. Brian screams rather than sings, but AC/DC at the top of their game wrote the best, catchiest hard rock songs you can imagine, like the grand, anthemic Hell's Bells which its bell tolling came about from Malcolm in the restroom or the magnificent title track which its riff came from the Highway to Hell tour backstage. Have A Drink On Me was a great send-off to Bon. Shoot to Thrill was the rock and roll version of an outlaw song. The Top 40 hit You Shook Me All Night Long is classic despite Mutt's reservations that the song was too wordy. The closing Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution is classic with its evangelistic beginning. Brian's intro was a great poking fun at the evangelists. Back in Black was a smash immediately hitting #4 and selling 19 million in the US alone and it was because of the material and not the personalitites. Highly recommended!
B00005JMKI|2.0|WOOF WOOF! And I lke ALL of Lars' other movies. Have sat through all of Kingdom I and II twice... but this one just didn't do it for me. I actually sat thru all of a 170m foreign DVD just because it WAS a Lars flick and am only giving it 2 stars instead of 1 for the same reason. Boring, pretentious.
0316666343|4.0|This book is a chilling story that wittily describes a young girl in heaven looking down on her family and her murderer. Alice Sebold really goes into detail about her death and the way she reacted and was feeling at the time. It is scary because this book is not far from the truth; adolescent girls get victimized a lot in our society. This book beautifully depicts heaven and creates a picture in your mind of what it would look like. This book keeps the reader wanting to keep reading. It describes Susie in such detail that you feel like you know her. It also gets you frustrated because you know who her killer is and you want him to get caught. This story was very depressing to read, you will feel teary-eyed after the first chapter. However tragic it may be this book is also a refreshing story that at least has a happy ending. The Lovely Bones takes you through a roller coaster ride of emotions, one page your feeling happy because Susie's murder is unraveling, and the next you are heartbroken at the way her family is taking her loss.<br />This book realistically depicts a family in mourning over the loss of a child, and a sister. It really gives you a taste of what it feels like to have lost a loved one. How this book describes the afterlife is especially interesting, everyone basically gets what they want except for being alive and with their loved ones. The theory in this heaven is if you want it bad enough, you will receive it. Susie watching down on her loved ones is very interesting because you get to know everything she thinks or feels. She can also tell what emotions other people are feeling, or what they are thinking so that you can get to know more about that individual. What made this book unique was the fact that she has to watch her friends and family grow and make wrong choices and experience life while she is frustrated because she cannot be there with them to help them with their problems.<br />The Lovely Bones shed some light on what it feels like tohave to loose a person that you love and what it feels like to have to watch the people that you love suffer because of your death. Susie felt horrible whenever her family would hurt because of her death because she loved and cared for them all so dearly. This book had a very powerful effect on me as a 13 year-old girl because it made me think of what would happen if the same scenario ever happened to me. This was a very touching book and I would recommend it for all age groups, especially teenagers. This book taught me to count the many blessings I have and to be thankful for them all. This book teaches you about the struggles of accepting death, whether it be your loved one's, or your own.
0061020710|5.0|Maybe not. After all practice makes perfect. But for someone's first book this is truly amazing! The plot was excellent, the characters witty and amusing, and the settings couldn't be better! This book is lacking in some areas, it would help if somethings were explained a little better, but is still excellent. I can enjoy it all the more because this book has Discworlds best chararcter, Rincewind. If you haven't read any of his ohter stuff this book will still be okay, but if you have read other stuff it makes the book more enjoyable. Buy this book today!<br />~Rincewind
B00000490M|5.0|&quot;Wax on, wax off&quot; is a catchphrase that will forever be instilled in the human psyche, thanks to the eighties release, The Karate Kid. <br />Now, as you cringe at the images racing through your head of disco balls, pastels, hair spray and corny one-liners and you decide to bury yourself in a deep hole and hide, dust off the cob webs because no matter how many times you've see it, this is one eighties flick you can't help but love. <br />Now available on DVD as an Ultimate Collectors Pack, we can relive this inspirational story of courage and friendship. <br />While teens of today may call this a retro disaster, and use the video cover as a coaster during a drinking fest at one of their underage parties, there's no denying the saying, &quot;an oldie but a goodie&quot; loudly rings true.<br />Moving to a new home and starting over is never easy. Just ask Daniel Larusso (Ralph Macchio). Leaving Newark for LA, Daniel's the new kid and he thinks the whole world is coming down on him. <br />It's all doom and gloom until like any other 16 year old teenager with rushing hormones, meets a beautiful blonde, Ali Mills (Elisabeth Shue). <br />However, Ali brings baggage to the picture, a wild ex boyfriend Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) who also happens to be the leader of the Cobras, a ruthless youth karate gang. <br />Subject to constant bullying by the cobras, Daniel turns to an unlikely source for help, Japanese war veteran turned apartment block handyman Mr. Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita).<br />Mr. Miyagi, who has been taught karate by his father becomes the helpless teens mentor and teaches him the craft, not as an offensive tool, rather only as a means of self-defence. <br />After months of unconventional training such as washing cars, sanding decks and painting fences and houses, Daniel's prepped for his toughest battle, a fight against Johnny in the thrilling conclusion. Will good prevail over evil?<br />It's the finale that's most exciting. My finger is always drawn to the rewind button, where I can't help but recap those final gripping moments again and again. <br />The youth of today's movie going generation will have a field day laughing at the funky eighties pop music, the tightly worn jeans, and (I must admit) the outrageous hair styles. Despite this, 20 years later, a lot can still be learnt as its messages transcend across the boarder of time.<br />An everlasting masterpiece the whole family will enjoy, John G. Avildsen's The Karate Kid, the original of the trilogy, is undoubtedly the standout. <br />Though a little hackneyed and slightly predictable at times, it's the relationship between Macchio's and Morita's finely tuned characters that still make this a heartfelt film, two decades after its cinema release.<br />It's a shame Ralph Macchio can't brush off that teen type cast. Struggling to get adult roles because of his boy like features is unfortunate as his acting ability is second to none. <br />It sadly seems he'll forever be remembered as 'The Karate Kid'. A great performance is somewhat to his detriment. Still, only one word can describe this movie, unforgettable...that's for sure!<br />Dim the lights, heat up the popcorn and enjoy this timeless classic.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't know where to begin.<BR>Firefly is by far the best television show ever in my mind.<BR>The jokes aren't the funniest, nor are they &quot;stupid humor&quot; that is always easy to get.  Often jokes even happen in the background away from the main action creating a more &quot;realistic&quot; atmosphere.<BR>The storylines aren't even the most origional, but they help bring out a bit of nostalgia and help you remember the campy western AND scifi shows of era's gone.<BR>The acting, now the acting is superb, especially on the part of Nathan Fillion (Malcom Reynolds).  Nathan Fillion was unknown to me prior to watching Firefly.  It was even mentioned by a friend of mine that he wasn't the &quot;right casting&quot; for the part of the Captain...however, by the end of the series the same friend said the part was perfectly cast.  Nathan Fillion has the ability to play any emotion he is asked to.  He is perfect as the &quot;gruff/loving/friendly/hardened soldier&quot; type that is his character.  That may seem like a confused character, however it is played EXCELLENTLY by Nathan Fillion.<BR>I honestly can't figure out what is so redeeming about this show, but I love every minute of it.  After having watched the entire series 5 times through I STILL get urgest to watch it and feel strong emotions when I see specific quotes from the series.<BR>If you are at all a fan of Science Fiction OR Westerns, I urge you to give this show a chance.
B000003N7R|5.0|Although not nearly as much closed minded about liking new jazz forms as other &quot;swing&quot; musicians of the thirties and forties, you would think Duke Ellington would not want to record with this new experimentalist, John Coltrane. Obviously he did, and the outcome was amazing. I can never imagine Coltrane doing a collaboration album or asking to play with another jazz musician because I can't imagine Trane talking. I've never heard his voices, except for his brief vocal statement on Love Surpreme. Anyway, this is a great album. The first track, In A Senntimental Mood, is probally the most famous as it was featured in an episode of The Bill Cosby Show. It shows restraint, but also has Elvin Jones's melodic drum fills, mostly using the small tom and floor tom together in a good collaboration. Big Nick starts off what might be a &quot;cute&quot; little tune, but once Coltrane solos, he's turned it in to a free jazz/Anant Garde song. Ellington just copes in a cool way even under Trane's heavy improvisations. The others are all great too.
B00007BHOE|5.0|ok look we all love Slipknot but lets face it this dvd brings their music to a new level i would pay a hundered dollars for this and come on if u dont think Joey's solo was f**king awsome <BR>u must be crazy
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|well d 12 fell off but we all knew that would happen just like beg for mercy was CRAAPPPP this cd cant come close to devils night which is one of the best cds ever, eminems still a dope lyricist but the rest of the group is repetive and all the songs sound the same the only ones that stand out are 4,9 and maybe 11 but i dont even know about that one
0440236738|5.0|This book is suspense and thrill at its finest novel form. I did not quite like it as much as Tell No One, but it is another excellent book from Coben. If you have read one of his book,s this is a MUST read because it is so good. If you haven't read any Coben books, I suggest you start with this or Tell No One. You will not be able to put it down. Always unexpected twists.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|and they cancel a lot.  After watching these episodes; being left with such a longing for more, I wanted to call my cable provider and make them remove FOX from my channel listing.  Thank god they got the go ahead to make a movie (Serenity).  Slated for 2005 and I'll be the first one in line.
B000060P79|1.0|Simple Plan is just another example of why since 2000 music has suck. they are just another pop punk band  along with Good Chorlette, New Found Glory, and Lilexthat sounds JUST LIKE everything else blk 182 did 4 years ago.music today is like its was in the 80's no creativty, no originality,and no idenity. Just record companies puking out the same band over and over and over again. I first saw Simple Plan on T.V. and thought Blink knock offs and they would'nt last, but then I saw them on Nickoloden, NICKOLODEN, then on Disney and I got bored with them. But then when I saw them appearing in the Mary Kate&Ashely Olsen movie now I wish they were dead. Since the 90's ended music has sucked. MTV and the radio suck. You guys who are all 14,15,16 don't listen to this you want Punk listen to SUM-41, MINOR THREAT, BLACK FLAG, GREEN DAY, RAMONES, DEAD KENNEDYS, SEX PISTOLS,AFI, BAD BRAINS, AND THE CLASH. Even Offspring is better than is. Enough said.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I really liked this film.  I think that it stayed with the basic formula of star wars and is a great addition to the series.  I LOVE the dvd quality.  Very nice.  IMO, better than Episode II in quality and movie.  Characters are also great with Darth Maul, Anikin, young Obi-Wan, and Padme.  I think that this movie would have been better if Jar Jar didnt have such a big of role as he had in this film, but I think that this movie had a better story and WAYYYY batter acting then found in Episode II.  Nice way to kick off the prequals.

B000009EAD|5.0|This album is a must-have for every Power-Metal fan. With \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" IE successfully proved that they are one of the best (if not THE best) Power-Metal bands in America. <BR>Here Jon Schaffer's excellent songwriting merges perfectly with Matthew Barlow's killer-voice.<br />The disk is packed with highlights: \\"Burning Times\\", the opener, is a straight rocker and immediately caught my attention when I first listened to it. It is followed by \\"Melancholy\\", IE's arguably most famous track to date. \\"Watching Over Me\\" is a heartfelt song about a deceased friend of Schaffer's, and features a great sing-along-chorus. The next top-track is \\"My Own Savior\\", note the powerful bass and rhythm-guitar work (this song being pure HEAVY-METAL).<BR>IE's most recent effort (\\"The Glorious Burden\\") features 2 songs about the American War of Independence. On \\"SWTWC\\" there's an instrumental dealing with the same topic: \\"1776\\". Schaffer said he didn't dare trying to explore this historical setting on a lyrical level, so he concentrated fully on the music, with success.<BR>\\"Blessed Are You\\" is another \\"Power-Ballad\\"-style track with superb guitar-solo. <BR>The CD is concluded by the \\"Something Wicked\\"-trilogy (consisting of the tracks \\"Prophecy\\", another example of Schaffer's rhythm-guitar prowess, \\"Birth Of The Wicked\\", an awesome heavy song, and finally \\"The Coming Curse\\", which starts with a one minute piano-intro and then starts rockin' like hell.).<br />As mentioned before, if you think you're into Power-Metal, you better own this or get it. Soon.
B000002U82|5.0|At first, I didn't really like this album that much.  After a while, it sinked in.  I understand if you don't like Dark Side of the Moon and other Pink Floyd CDs.  Animals is nothing super special and Meddle is decent cause of Echoes.  Wish You Were Here can be not liked as well too in an understandable way.  But THE WALL you just have to like. Here is what I think of Dark of the Moon's tracks:<br />1.  Speak to Me/Breathe:  Nice intro with all the weird sounds of the album combining together and then it slows down into Breathe which is a slow depressing song.<br />2.  On the Run:  The only song I truly dislike on this CD.<br />3.  Time: Depressing song but one of the best of Pink Floyd.<br />4.  The Great Gig in the Sky:  I love the piano in this song and the way it starts out with some guy saying stuff about not being afraid of dying.<br />5.  Money: Enjoyable beat not being depressing as the previous tracks.<br />6.  Us and Them:  Good song but not as good as Money.<br />7. Any Colour You Like:  Instrumental with cool sounds.<br />8. Brain Damage: My Personal Favorite Song from Pink Floyd, probably my favorite of all Pink Floyd songs.  Its dark, haunting, and gets you sucked in, at least for me.<br />9:  Eclipse:  Perfect Finishing Track to the album.  Short though, wish it could be longer.
0385336810|5.0|This book was hilarious and another excellent book by Sophie Kinsella. I can hardly wait to read what she writes next! The book grabs you from the beginning and then you don't want to put it down!  Very fun and light reading and quite entertaining!
B000066NW0|5.0|This album is great and her next one will be great.  Don't let the others fool you when they take so long to write a horrible review.  Anyone who has the time to sit down and do research behind who writes the lyrics and what kind of computer they use to &quot;buff up her voice?&quot; Are you kidding me?  It's pathetic.  She's a great singer and I give her props for getting where she is. If you turned into a big star, I don't think you'd want bad reviews.  Let's not be jealous. So like the album's titled...&quot;Let Go&quot;  Buy this album.

B000002J2B|5.0|... odd that some 28 years later this, the best of all the Genesis records, should suddenly seem so of the moment and to the point. American journalists and construction workers get their heads lopped off by Islamic hate-mongers with an insatiable thirst for blood and vengeance. &quot;For his name they could slaughter, for his name they could die...&quot; I know what I like about this CD, always have: the melodies are not prog-rock at all, but extraordinarily well crafted vignettes whose stories deal with fundamentalist murder, the legacy of war handed down from father to son, whimsical allegory (a fat cat is killed by an avenging super-mouse), ruminations on the Middle East, love lost in an afterglow, the redemption in the heart of one who turns the world so it's facing the way that you're going. In short, all of our moments of desperation.<BR>The musicianship positively crackles throughout. None of them would ever be this good again. &quot;Wot gorilla?&quot; and &quot;Unquiet slumbers&quot; are filled with hairpin turns and polyrhythmic shifts that only an artist at the very peak of his powers could negotiate. Banks' keyboards have a chamber like quality that set him immediately apart from all other British tinklers. Collins was still a drummer with something to prove both behind and in front of the drum kit. Rutherford was underpinning the songs and adding depth to the guitars in sublime ways, and Hacket, well, at this point, this was Hackett's band and he took them musically to where they had been striving from their inception at Charterhouse School. Plus, he penned the ultimate song that is so absolutely haunting, given the abominations run rampant as Western Civilization and Islam confront each other in this deadly Crusade to obliterate each other.<BR>The remaster has taken what was always a sterling album and given it new life. It is a joy to listen to this again. Still what hangs with you after you have thought about all that is said is Hackett's observation:<BR>&quot;Seems Helen of Troy has found a new face again....&quot;
B00006FMAW|5.0|I managed to stumble across this film when I went around searching for an \\"intelligent film with gross-out gore\\". And that's what I got when I ordered this cheap DVD. The film starts out following this 17 year old that feels alienated in his upper class home. Everything seems perfect but nothing is what it seems. There are a series of revelations the protagonist (Billy) discovers as his curiosity grows. Unraveling the truth was no easy task because of \\"Society's\\" many conspiracies and cover-ups.<br />The movies political voice lambasted against shallow people only worrying about social status and popularity (as illustrated with Billy's ex-girlfriend in the beginning). It also shows how the rich, literally, feed off the poor. This reminds me of how back in the Roman Empire, the peasants were heavily taxed, which was one factor of the Fall of Rome, where the poor revolted. There were clever puns thrown in that some people might have missed. The rich would eat and tear a person (well just one person) in an erotic orgy zombie-like attack, \\"rich feeding off the poor\\" - get it? There lots of references about how everyone would be \\"contributing to society\\" too.<br />Society has the oddness of \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" and \\"Nick of Time\\", the social satire of \\"American Psycho\\", and the gross effects of \\"Bad Taste\\" and \\"Re-Animator\\", only more emphasis on slimy repulsive sludge. Some people got dismembered in ways beyond my imagination. It wasn't bloody but it was gooey, I felt like some of the goop splattered on my face, as I stayed glued to the screen. This bizarre part makes up about the last 20 minutes of the film. Searching for answers made up most of the movie.<br />Other stuff I should mention: There's a little love story on the side mixed in. Film might feel like it ended a bit prematurely. Some nudity and sex scenes. A fat lady is thrown in for comic relief. You will see someone have an actual butthead. The music is pretty good and fits the movie's tone. The box says it's unrated, not rated R.<br />So if you want gross splattastic effects used in a film that mocks greedy shallow rich people that think they're better than us humans (the rich weren't human?!) in a cynical imaginative manner, \\"Society\\" is good choice.unrated, not rated R.<br />So if you want gross splattastic effects used in a film that mocks greedy shallow rich people that think they're better than us humans (the rich weren't human?!) in a cynical imaginative manner, \\"Society\\" is good choice.

WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? <BR>Still the best band ever.
6304711905|1.0|What a cartoon compared to the superior WYATT EARP (coming to DVD May 18 2004.)  This movie was paled by the other instantly.  Not only is the characterization way off here, but the whole &quot;Cowboys&quot; and red scarf thing has nothing to do with anything related to the events or characters.  What a shame some fine talent is wasted in this overrated mess.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Piece of Mind is probably the most controversial of the classic Maiden albums, with seemingly equal parts claiming it's overrated or underrated.  It's not with out its flaws, but I suppose I belong in the `underrated' faction, and it's probably my second favorite Maiden album, behind Number of the Beast.(though Seventh Son and Dance of Death come very close)<br />This is the album where the classic line-up solidified, with the addition of Nicko on the drums.  Clive was good, but I think this is a noticeable step up, as Nicko is bit more varied and grooves better, imo.  Although he's good, Nicko is relative weak point when compared to the rest of the band.  Dickinson's vocals pretty much define classic metal, and not with out good reason.  A bit over the top on sometimes, but I, for one, like a little bit of cheese with my Iron Maiden, every once in a while. Smith and Murray are legends as well, and prove why they are just about the best guitar duo in metal.  They have some of their most tasty leads of all here, particularly the solos on Flight of Icarus and the little licks they use in To Tame a Land.  When it comes to melodic guitar in metal, no one else comes close.  Harris is the backbone, as always, and gives the songs the surging energy they need.<br />This album is a bit unusual, in that it contains both some their very best material, but isn't as consistent as most of their other albums from the Golden Age. (though this is partially because the better material is so very good.)  The best material dominates, however, and it's got the mix of moods and styles which the next couple albums can't quite match.  The song everyone talks about as being utter filler is Quest for Fire, and I agree.  The middle break is decent, but the verse riffs are real boring, and the vocals are grating all throughout. It's pretty much worthless, but I like everything else.  Lots of people dump on Sun and Steel as well, but I've grown to really like it.  It's certainly not the best thing on here, and it's a bit underwritten, but the chorus is really catchy and I like the whole mood of the song.  The solo is totally worthless, and the whole middle break is of no note, but it has a very solid core.  Those things aside, this album has some utter classics.  The Flight of Icarus is definitely one of my top 3 Maiden songs.  Their best chorus ever, along with probably my favorite lead break of theirs. It's very well constructed as well, with a nice buildup through the verses.  The Trooper is probably the definitive IM song, in my book.  It's got that classic galloping bass with some more stellar lead work and an absolutely first-rate performance from Dickinson.  To Tame a Land is a bit underrated, and another classic.  Tons of atmosphere and great groove combined with some of their best guitar licks ever.<br />The rest of the album isn't as good as that stuff, but it's all worth listening to, and has got good variety.  Where Eagles Dare is a good opener, albeit not their best one, and is a bit more deliberate than a lot of their opening tracks.  Die With Your Boots on is another solid and varied rocker which is somewhat marred but the obnoxious overuse of the titular line and a weak pre-chorus.  Revelations is one of their best ballad type songs. Very nicely paced and constructed, with another instantly memorable chorus.  Still Life is one of their more unique songs which gives this album its distinctive feel.  It's quite quiet and moody throughout much of it, and is pretty creepy.  Another underrated track.<br />All in all, this album has a few weak points, but the classics carry the day. Check it out, unless you don't have any Iron Maiden, in which case you ought to get Number of the Beast first.ing on here, and it's a bit underwritten, but the chorus is really catchy and I like the whole mood of the song.

B00003CXCT|5.0|I will keep this short and simple.  I was 7 when I saw the first one and it changed my life. Not unlike many other people I am sure.  I am the Star Wars generation and damned proud of it.  This series and especially the first film quite simply changed movies the way Elvis and the Beatles changed music and popular entertainment.  Star Wars took us to the next step on the evolution of entertainment.  God bless Lucas and all the rest for starting a revolution that can still be felt today.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|The Butterfly Effect was a great movie compare to what the critics might say. I thought the plot,actors,and storyline were excellent. A movie,I thought at least,made you think \\"what if\\". What if you weren't the same if you went back in time and righted your wrongs, What if you could honestly say you have No Regrets in life. Ashton Kutcher did an excellent job with his shifting of moods and intensity throughout the movie for each different sceneio of him going back and trying to right the wrongs in his life. <BR>Compared to his Punk'd and Dude, What's my car this film from Ashton Kutcher was What I think the world needed from him some new and some fresh. A great movie for any Ashton fan and a complishment on his part in his acting career.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|It's finally being released on DVD! The whole, original miniseries version of \\"Das Boot\\". And to think that just a couple of days ago I was commenting on the fact that nobody seemed to bother releasing it... I was considering to buy the \\"Director's Cut\\" edition in a couple of weeks if things stayed that way, then today I was going through my \\"to buy\\" list and searching here on Amazon for the titles, when I looked for \\"Das Boot\\" I noticed this new version among the results. I'm definitley buying this one. I still remember watching the miniseries on local TV all those years ago (in fact, I've still got it taped on VHS) and have anxiously been waiting for this moment to add it to my DVD collection. Definitely one of the best WW2 and anti-war productions I've ever seen. Don't miss it!
B00006LLNU|5.0|Well, since I was raised on prog-rock and eventually outgrew the excellent Pink Floyd and Crimson, it's been a long time since I heard anything that matched them in terms of grandeur and musicality. For myself, Sigur Ros does it. This is space-rock for the 21st century. Many stunning melodic moments on this disc, particularly the deeply felt emotion of Track 4. Most of the disc is at a rather slow, funereal tempo, and much of it not only \\"echoes\\" the prog-rock heroes of yesteryear, but approaches the modern classical timbres of Arvo Part and Tavener. For me the highlight is the closing Track 8, which builds to a crescendo that left me tight in the chest when I first listened to it. The power and tension in this track leaves you hanging in an emotional high.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Since Tool's Aenima in 1997 I have been an avid fan, and Tool are probably the band I listen to the most (I won't say favourite, I have too many). When I found out that Maynard James Keenan was doing a new album I was thrilled, but almost disappointed that it wasn't with Tool. I refused to buy either of APC's records, until a few months ago, when I realised how naïve I was being.  I didn't want to like them, I almost thought MJK was `cheating' on the rest of his band members by going off and making new recordings with other people, albeit very talented people. Billy Howardel's guitar playing is first-class, Jeordie Osbourne White is a great bassist and Josh Freese is solid on the drums (nowhere near Danny Carey though). So, I have to admit they make a good band, and I found out that the rest of Tool helped with production (sigh).<br />So, we all know how wonderful MJK is, but how good is the new blend of musicians. Well, in a nutshell, very good. The opener, The Package, straight away throws you into the dark, disturbing world of drugs and possession. The gradual build up of texture using layering and dynamics is very subtle, but achieves a great deal for the song. After the slow, clever build up we finally hear the immense explosion of guitars and drums. The song contains some of the best vocals as MJK really stresses each syllable and adds to the haunting lyrics. The Noose carries over the same dark and eerie atmosphere made famous by Tool. The lyrics are anti religious, in typical absurd MJK style, imagining how a halo could become a noose. The song starts slowly and gradually builds to a very impressive climax, similar style to The Package. There are other Tool-esque songs, such as The Outsider and Pet which are both solid rock songs, but I think APC are at their best when they try something different. They have great ability to produce softer songs, reminiscent of Mer De Noms. Songs such as the closer Gravity and A Stranger, both have some wonderful singing and guitar playing.<br />The general feel to the album is different to Mer De Noms. Mer De Noms had a darker, sexual side to it, mostly about obsession and lust. Thirteenth Step has a more `social' side, MJK sings about drug addictions, religion, nightmares and a pet hate of swimming (Aenema represents it better). Both of APC's albums are different, and APC certainly have their own style, and I can honestly say they are among my favourite bands at the moment. I don't think Thirteenth Step has the general depth to match some of Tool's releases, but it is nonetheless a great CD for any rock fan.d guitar playing.<br />The general feel to the album is different to Mer De Noms.

B0000CFW87|5.0|Well, I loved this c.d.  His voice was enchanting, even a bit haunting at times, and just wonderful. I was reading alot of reviews for this album and I have come to a conclusion.  People do not like this c.d because they are stuck in their ways of stereo typical &quot;good music&quot;.  Take this advice from a true fan, by this album and it will change your life, for the better! ;)
B00005T343|4.0|This is not a suspense-drama like \\"Silence of the Lambs;\\" it's a horror movie.  As a horror flick, \\"Hannibal\\" wins the 4 stars.  That this sequel fails to retain the genre of the original film is \\"disappointment #1.\\"<BR> <BR>Losing credibility as a drama makes \\"Hannibal\\" susceptible to the humor that we attach to the \\"horror\\" genre.  It had me rooting for the monster.  This led to \\"disappointment #2:\\"  The monster let me down by letting the heroine tame him.<BR> <BR>Anthony Hopkins and the other actors captured their characters convincingly.  The cast showcased REAL TALENT in the face of a plot that lost contact with reality.  An impossible plot is on par for the horror genre, but a sold-out monster is not.  <BR> <BR>I saw \\"Hannibal\\" on TV, so I was spared the truckloads of pulpy gore that it reputedly dumps on moviegoers.  Would I watch it uncut (pun!)?  Yeah, but with reservations.<BR> <BR>In keeping with the \\"horror\\" genre, the final scene would have been better served (pun again) if a \\"flying knives\\" Oriental chef-style ending had dispatched the heroine.

068983571X|4.0|I really enjoyed reading The Hound of the Baskervilles. I thought it was very exciting and suspensful. Conan Doyle uses a very elevated vocabulary which may not be appropriate for young people. Also Conan Doyle does a great job of illustrating to us what Baskerville Hall might look like and what the moor may seem like at midnight on a cloudy evening. He also depicts the characters very well and he did a great job with the death scenes. I was a little dissappointed that the book was not more scarey. It was not the best  I have ever read but The Hound of the Baskervilles was certainly a great book.
B0000648WZ|1.0|If you're hoping for anything like the classic novel, skip this turkey.  It can't decide if it wants to be slapstick, satire or gung-ho.  The acting is dreadful, the writing is worse.  Skip it!!
0440180295|5.0|This book is as fascinating as it is strange. It takes an important and normal concept like W.W.II, and through narration, repetition, and dark humor, turns it into a strong political statement before you realize what it is really saying. <BR>Vonnegut writes this so that it is easy to read and it moves quickly. When he talks about violence or death, he points it out so blatantly and casually that it is disguised, and the reader quickly passes over it.<BR>It is very serious and well thought out, despite its casual narration and humor. Kurt Vonnegut uses strange ideas like aliens to help paint a clear picture of the main character Billy Pilgrim's life, and provide a way to break up the war story and the horror of the Dresden bombing with other information.<BR>The alien concept of time is also very interesting and provides something to think about for quite some time after reading the novel.
B00005N9CV|2.0|Surely there must be others who feel, as I do, that Krall is an over-hyped, mediocre vocalist lacking in passion and depth, with an almost complete inability to communicate the emotional essence of a lyric. So who's buying all these CDs? Probably people who also think Norah Jones and Peter Cincotti are just swell and wouldn't know a real singer if one bit them on their posteriors, I suppose. Hey Krall fans, ever hear of Lee Wiley? Peggy Lee? Oh, I forgot, they're not only not young and blonde anymore, they're DEAD, so they're not &quot;relevant&quot; to your late-twenty-something musical &quot;tastes.&quot; Krall is for people who voted for Bush because &quot;he seemed sincere&quot; and go to see the latest &quot;blockbuster&quot; CGI-laden movie because the Fox TV critic called it &quot;a white-knuckle thrill ride.&quot; The triumph of media hype over taste and discrimination is now complete.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I am a Linkin Park fan, and I own Hybrid Theory, Reanimation, and now Meteora. Meteora went back to their roots like what they did with Hybrid Theory and came up with this little album. Like their first one, which only had 12 tracks, this album has 13. The CD starts out with a intro, and the CD gets into Dont Stay. Dont Stay is a good song and worth listening through. Then Somewhere I Belong is the third track; which was their first single off of this album. Then we come to Lying From You; a good song, and of course listening to in full entirety. Then one of the hip-hop songs mixed with hard gultar riffs is Hit The Floor. Mike mixes rhymes and Chester brings his loud and emotional voice in the chours. Then one of the best songs on the album is Easier To Run. It is like Meteora's version of Crawling. Another one of the best songs is Faint. Mixed with Mike's rap, and again with Chester on the chours. They then slow it down to Figure 09. The song is good, and again still worth listening to. Then we get to Breaking the Habit. This song is FULL of emotion and Chester screams it out with all of his heart, and this man has a F*cking voice. Then comes From The Inside, still worth listening to and checking out. Then we get back to Mike with his raps in Nobody's Listening. Then Mr. Hahn comes back with Session with his DJ skills. Then comes the last song Numb (this was their third single off of this album), and I have to say it is one of the best songs off of the album. <BR> <br />See LP makes music for people to like, unlike most bands out there they only make about three or four tracks that are good, but with LP, they make a album and they want people to listen to it and enjoy the album all the way through. This is something that most muscians out there that can rarely do that. Sorry Korn, but LP can beat you with making a great album.

6305922756|4.0|What can ya say about Spinal Tap? You either love the movie, or hate it! Theres no in between's. This Rock or should i say MockUmentry is the funniest one out there. And now that its on DVD in this special edition, you are defintly getting your moneys worth! I was able to get this cheap for $20 Australian, and it was one of the first DVD's i bought, and it was one I have never regreted!<br />The sound quality is excellent, altho i do remember the guitar beeing a bit fatter in sound on the VHS but it dosent matter. These guys really know how to make this kind of comedy work. They dont try to go for gag after gag and joke after joke, they succeed well with what they do because it's more on the serios side then on the comedy side, and if you wernt aware you where watchign a comedy and knew it was all a gag then you might take the film serios as i know alot of people have! But they just dont understand the brilliant humour of Spinal Tap, and the very clever way it has been presented to make you laugh.<br />The bonus features are great, there is 2 discs packed full of extra goodies, video clips, interveiws, telivision appearences.... i dont know if the world version comes with them or not? but the Australian one does come with a few commercials that Tap did back in the early 90's for a food product that where called &quot;Rock 'n rolls&quot; which where horrible pizza bun things that never lasted, but the commercials where funny enough to watch again on the DVD!<br />The only thing I wish about this DVD was that they added the interveiw they did on an Australian talk show called &quot;Tonight live with Steve Vizard&quot; and there appearence on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; but even tho they arnt included, the DVD is still great value for money!<br />Also dont forget to check out &quot;The Return Of Spinal Tap&quot; if you wanna watch more a live show, then the acting....and &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; which is along the same lines as how TIST was shown, but about folk music, but trust me, its a good film! Dont let the folk music thing make you think other wise!

B00003CWL6|5.0|*AMERICAN BEAUTY<br />Lester Burnham: Kevin Spacey<BR>Carolyn Burnham: Annette Bening<BR>Jane Burnham: Thora Birch<BR>Ricky Fitts: Wes Bentley<BR>Angela Hayes: Mena Suvari<br />Directed by Sam Mendes/ Written by Alan Ball/ 120 minutes (Rated R)<br />BY ANDREW KOCH<BR>Beauty: The quality that gives pleasure to the mind or senses and is associated with such properties as harmony of form or color, excellence of artistry, truthfulness, and originality. Although, society has put this definite and limited meaning into beauty, realistically beauty is indefinable. The simple fact that something is beautiful to one person yet ugly and ordinary to another makes it such an abstract concept. Yet, what is finite about is beauty is the idea that society tends to make a mold of beauty. This cast that is produced is the cause of much \\"shaping\\" towards an ideological goal and is the cause of much internal and external conflict between people, institutions and entities of all sorts. <BR> In, \\"American Beauty\\" the theme of beauty is deeply rooted throughout the movie. The scenes switch frequently from character to character, through which we are introduced to and dig deep within each character's conflict in beauty. Angela, who represents superficial and exterior beauty, directly strives for her society's ideological <BR>concept of beauty. To her, beauty is what everyone else tells her and what she sees on the cover of Maxim Magazine. Conversely, Jane Burnham represents the inner beauty within the characters of the movie. Genuine, open, loving, independent and not ready to follow society's guidelines on beauty. She does and wears what she feels comfortable in. Her personality and behavior represent this inner and innocent beauty not found often in \\"American Beauty\\". To Carolyn Burnham, beauty lies in the way she seems to all others whom view her (society or her friends and family). The illusion of \\"happiness, a successful job and being a perfect wife/ mother type\\" makes her feel comfortable that people view her as a beautiful person. As society shapes, views and impresses upon the character's beauty and concept of beauty, there exists one character independent of this obligation. He watches and judges beauty, of the women in particular, because it brings him a sense of inner peace. Ricky is independent of the judgmental societal panoptican (all seeing and always watching). He becomes a significant silent and panoptical entity himself in the movie. Whenever shown in the movie, he has his camera and is taping/ observing the beauty of women to things like the wind-carrying bag through the air. <BR> The movie \\"American Beauty\\" is more than just another \\"black comedy\\" or typical Hollywood film. It moves past the portrayal of beauty through images, actions and looks. It explores and critiques the modern stereotype of what beauty is in women of today. It also explores the interactions and conflicts that arise within the clashing of different ideas of beauty between characters. More importantly, it forces the viewers to reflect upon the idea of inner/ physical beauty and how others view it, themselves and society as a whole.

B00005JLR8|5.0|\\"In America\\" does not only concern about the hardship of a family that crossed half the world to settle in a foreign land seeking a more prosperous future, but it also touches on how its remoteness is coped with. \\"In America\\" reveals the amount of sacrifice and amount of courage it is needed to relinquish the past in order to fare on to the future. Directed by Jim Sheridan and written by him along with his two daughters Naomi and Kirsten Sheridan, \\"In America\\" is a spellbinding look into the life of a family who discovers more of who they are in an extrinsic territory.<br />One of the main reasons \\"In America\\" is so endearing is because of this phenomenal cast. Paddy Considine is able to portray a man deep in affliction but is able to summon up a cheerful face for the children. Samantha Morton, who received an Academy Award nomination, is extremely suggestive through her countenance alone. Real life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger are ever delightful. Besides being there to tug at our hearts, there are instances where it reveals their significant talent. Consider when Christy snaps at her dad, \\"Don't `little girl' me. I've been carrying this family on my back for over a year ever since Frankie died.\\" This easily could have failed and be comical, but Sarah Bolger manages to deliver it in such an honest and convincing fashion. Emma Bolger's moment comes in the ice cream parlor where she says she has no friends and no one to \\"tell secrets too.\\" This scene may appear effortless but that's because Emma Bolger seems authentically saddened with her character.<br />Djimon Hounsou, who was first introduced by Steven Spielberg as the slave Cinque in \\"Amistad\\" and has played similar characters after that, delivers his best performance as Mateo. We have seen him numerous times before as oppressed men with tough skin that are perspicuous. As Mateo, this finally allows Hounsou to reveal not only his softer side but also exhibit his range. Hounsou gives quite a well-rounded performance where he can be both intimidating and amiable, and forceful yet yielding.

Although I know I thoroughly enjoyed the book the first time, it is just and funny and fresh on the second read.  I'm not the type who normally laughs out loud while reading or watching t.v. for that matter, but certain pieces in this book have had me in TEARS!!!  David Sedaris is a genius!  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes brainy satire and enjoys a good laugh...
B00003CXFV|5.0|*ERIN BROCKOVICH<br />Erin Brockovich: Julia Roberts<BR>Ed Masry: Albert Finney<BR>George: Aaron Eckhart<BR>Donna Jensen: Marg Helgenberger<BR>Pamela Duncan: Cherry Jones<BR>Kurt Potter: Peter Coyote<br />Directed by Steven Soderbergh/ Written by Susannah Grant/ 126 Minutes (Rated R).<br />BY ANDREW KOCH<br /> While many movies have subtle and underlying themes, \\"Eric Brockovich\\" blatantly screams female empowerment and the fracturing of feminine stereotypes. This movie tells the amazing true story of a woman who against all odds and against many hardships was able to turn a court case around. At first glance Erin Brockovich with her skimpy clothes, bad manners, tough attitude, kids and mediocre job seem to frame Erin as a promiscuous, ill mannered and irresponsible mother type. It seems as though she is capable of nothing but mediocrity. Yet, throughout the movie her behavior, intelligence, courage, hard work and use of femininity help her become something even more special then she could have ever imagined. <BR> Erin's appearance is an entity of its own throughout the movie.  In the movie she is an extremely good-looking female who dresses to impress. With her breasts in plain view, tight clothes that show her curves and the way she carries herself; they all combine to objectify her as a \\"piece of meat\\", and not a person. Men cease to see her as a woman and only as a commodity/object of which to look at or try to acquire. This phenomenon is not in vain; it serves a purpose for Erin. The objectification in the eyes of all men allows to her to unsuspectingly acquire knowledge and to get her way without any resistance. This concept is not unique to only Erin. All women whom radiate these qualities are deemed a sexual prize to admire or try to win, they loose all personality and substance. It is a common theme within society today and will always be. Ironically, this objectification that seemingly decreases her human feminine substance is just the thing that allows her to become the staple of female empowerment throughout the movie. <BR> This movie also works to explore some feminine stereotypes that society has built through the last couple of decades. The fact that \\"a middle age mother, fairly non-educated and of the middle class\\" is able to achieve so much in law/ humanity is really amazing. She proved that someone of the middle social and economic class can achieve greatness. Most importantly, she proves that women can take processes that work against them and turn them around in their favor. Erin also took the notion that someone so attractive and expressive is just a nitwit/ \\"sexual prize\\" and destroyed all precedent with her achievements on screen and in reality.
B00006RINF|5.0|This is simply a wonderful album. There's just no way around that fact. Cristina Scabbia has the greatest female voice in music today, easily. Range, quality, hotness...she's got damn near everything. How this band has gone undiscovered by so many people for so long, I have no clue. There are simply no bad or even average songs on this album, it's one of the most solid I've ever come across. I actually got into this band by way of Evanescence, internet forums and KaZaA, and I'm glad I did. Evanescence is a great band as well, even if they aren't quite as good as Lacuna Coil. Try coming across their stuff from the older Origin album, it's very good as well. If it was available on this site, I'd suggest it as well...meh. We have to agree here that Evanescence's success on the mainstream level is affecting the success of bands like Lacuna Coil and Nightwish very positively, even if you don't have a particular liking for Evanescence.

1594200106|5.0|Shadow is a magnificent blend of saga, mystery, romance, historical thriller and drama, all wrapped around the fascinating enigma of a book that is able to change the life of all of those who read it.  So far is the best thing I've read this year, stunningly well-written, witty, tender, scary, thrilling and very clever. It reminds you of the magic prose of Garcia Marquez, the intellectual games of Eco or the byzantine labyrinths of Borges, as the critics have said, but it is much more than that.  I can't remember how long it's been since a novel gave me such much pleasure, such pure unadulterated reading fun.  Any lover of good novels, of the great victorian sagas or those addicted to mystery and intrigue will find this a revelation, as I did.  This is such an oustanding novel, so well-crafted and dazzlingly written that defies clasification. A new genre or label should be invented to describe it. In the meantime I'll just label it a masterpiece and encourage you to discover it and have the time of your life.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This has got to be the best thing to ever come out.  I loved this series and never wanted it to end!!  It got me back into WW2 and now I've come back to my WW2 buff days:P.  I don't even think you need to like WW2 to like this series, because the story (TRUE story) illustrates courage and valor of the men of easy company.  Makes you respect the real people who fought the war, like Richard Winters, Carwood Lipton, and all the other men who gave their lives up for our country.
0784011176|4.0|I haven't seen this movie for a long time, but saw it again the other day.  I forgot how powerful it was and how breathtaking all the actors are as well as the scenery.  Strong performances and beautiful music (I bought the soundtrack long ago and had to dust it off after seeing this movie again!).  As for some of the negative comments of seeing Harvey Keitel naked (full frontal, too), and found him disgusting looking, well, folks, that's how most people look in real life!

0425173755|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK! When I was an eighth grade, we had to do a book report on a mystery from the school library. I ended up grabbing this book at the last minute just because I needed one. I've never regretted it. This book has introduced me to Agatha Christie and this is her at her best.<BR>   You have a wide assortment of nationalities all stuck on a train, on which a murder has just occured.  Hercule Poirot happens to be on the train and takes up the case. His only clues are a match, a burned note, a handkercheif, a pipe cleaner, & a broken watch.  Poirot manages to solve the case with just those four clues and information from interviews with the passengers. <BR>   I'm typically pretty good at solving mysteries half way through the book. Here, I was stumped. One page made me certain it was a American and the next it was an Italian. And then there's the HUGE twist at the end. I didn't see it coming and you probably won't see it coming. Unlike many mysteries, this twist actually made sense and was the perfect solution to an apparently perfect crime!
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Big Fish is a wonderous masterpiece featuring a story tailor made for the imagination of Tim Burton.  If ever a director and storyline were destined to be matched, I have to believe this was the case.  Big Fish is larger than life and features a tremendous performance by Ewan McGregor who just continues to raise his stock with every film.  McGregor stars as a young Edward Bloom out to experience life to its fullest.  Always an adventurer, the critical point in this film is the discovery at an early age of how he is to die.  This discovery is made by staring deep into a witch's glass eye (one of the many tales woven through this film).  Big Fish does beg the question then, that if you know how you are to die, does fear of living life leave you liberated?<br />Albert Finney stars as the older Edward Bloom as he prepares for death and Billy Crudup is cast as his son William who goes on a discovery of the truth to exactly who is father is before it's too late.  Burton does a tremendous job of weaving in details that keep the viewer see-sawing back and forth as to the truth of Edwards tales all the way to the end.  Big Fish is a visual experience to be enjoyed.  The only disappointment has nothing to do with the video at all but the DVD had few extras that I craved after the movie left me begging for more.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|I agree with the other 5 star reviews of this film here on Amazon.com that this film IS highly entertaining... for those seeking action and ALSO for those who love a good story with lots of character study... and in those areas, this film will not disappoint... but I am also have a great passion for the recreation of history, in spirit if not in literal terms... and this film is right \\"on target\\". It is a work of art consistant with history from the first frame (sensitively designed title text), to the the finale.  <br />I was fortunate to be able to visit the HMS SURPRISE (actually built in 1970 as a replica of a 1750s British warship called the ROSE) used in this film. It is currently docked in San Diego harbour and open to the public. I saw it prior purchasing the DVD. I stood on the actual deck and examined the recreated planking, rigging and details on board, and even up close, it is like stepping back in history... it looks so carefully outfitted. Below deck is a display of the film's costumes, musical instruments and props used in the film behind glass showcased walls, and they are remarkable. The costumes are authentic down to the delicate hand sewn details, the brass with perfect patina, and the china and silver table service looks museum quality... most of it recreated just for this film.  <br />It was no surprise that with such attention to detail, the film has such an authentic look on screen, but what ultimately won my praise for this film was the respect for the \\"correctness\\" in manners, gesture and story the actors showed here.  Whether it was minutely accurate is not important, but with so many films now on DVD that simply do not care about the historic look or beauty of period film or costume (\\"Shanghai Knights\\" and \\"First Knight\\" immediately come to mind) it was great to see a work on film that displayed the texture and look of past in such authentic way.  The music, much of it classical, is not all of the period, yet it still felt \\"right\\" for thefilm and adds to the sweeping vistas and first rate cinematography... which is remarkable in this filim.<br />I loved the story, I also thought the characters were wonderfully developed. Crowe is marvelous... and his character showed the intensity, power, determination, loyalty, that a captain would have had... and yet also the sensitive nature and a bit of humor that would have kept his crews loyalty through horrendous times. His portrayal is on a par with his performance in \\"L.A. Confidential\\" and \\"Gladiator\\".<br />There were many reasons to love this film... overall it is a real adventure. Bravo!!
0385470819|5.0|This is one of the most interesting novels I have ever read of John Grisham's. The drama inside the courtroom, which he is famous for, was absolutely exquisite. I loved every minute of it. Also, the book wasn't as simple as some of the other books, which kept it interesting.<br /> The plot for this book surrounds a man and his family. Mr. Carl Lee Hailey's daughter is beaten and raped which leaves him and his family in great despair. After not getting the justice that he thinks should have been given out, Carl Lee decides to take matters into his own hands. He seeks revenge by brutally gunning down the 2 white men who raped his daughter. This leaves Carl Lee in a lot of trouble.<br /> The foolishness of Carl Lee's actions leaves his family even more devastated as he winds up in jail. He attempts to free himself of jail or death by hiring attorney Jake Brigance. As tensions mount, the book gets even more interesting. The drama, the courtroom intrigue, everything you would expect to find in a John Grisham Book and more!<br /> This book focuses on the racial part of things down in the Deep South. This is a very powerful story; it has meaning and feeling and makes you consider what you would do in that situation. I encourage everyone who reads this review to go to your local Library or a bookstore and get yourself a copy of this book. I guarantee that you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole way through.  <br />By: Brennan<BR>Done as a school book report
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is hands down one of the best shows that has even been on television and now you can throw away those nasty VHS tapes that you've been watching and rewatching for the DVD version, with NO COMMERCIALS!  (Not that I thought the commercials would be there, but you get the point.)<br />With these DVDs you can relive all the wonderful Gilmore moments: why Luke and Lorelai are meant to be together, Rory and Dean's rocky relationship beginnings, and even Sookie and Jackson's love.  Please, don't miss out on this, so much of what has happened in the past seasons make rewatching the beginning so much more worthwhile!
B0001M0A4I|5.0|The bridge between classical music and rock is littered with the wrecks of well-intentioned hybrid works that unfortunately end up somewhere in the middle ground between both genres.  Often, orchestras will play \\"the music of . . .\\" rock acts such as the Rolling Stones, or rock artists themselves will try their hand at composing pieces for an orchestra.  Too often the former ends up sounding like muzak and the latter ends up being largely arranged and orchestrated by others with dubious results.  In the end, most fail to engage the listener musically.<br />Looking at this past history, it is a brave person who seeks to cross the path between these worlds.  Seven: A Suite for Orchestra, though, stands out as a prime exception to the general rule.  Composer Tony Banks is perhaps best known for his writing and keyboard playing with the progressive rock group Genesis over the last three decades.  Seven is his first full orchestral album, and represents the best example of a rock artist crossing over into classical thus far.  Generally, there are several reasons why this work succeeds.  Banks' compositions have always favored more complex musical structures that lend themselves to expansion with an orchestra, compared with normal pedestrian three-chord rock structures.  Many of Banks' previous compositions were laden with classical influences such as Rachmaninov and Ravel.  Additionally, as Banks explains in the notes accompanying the album, he wrote and arranged the pieces himself and minimally used an orchestrator, Simon Hale.  The pieces were written for an orchestra, and are not rock compositions later adapted by an independent arranger.  Banks had previously done orchestral music for the film entitled The Wicked Lady in 1983, and instrumental music for several film scores thereafter.  Banks also avoided making the album a display of instrumental virtuosity with mere orchestral coloration in the background.  Rather, the emphasis here is on composition.  Where Banks plays piano, he does so minimally and only to augment the orchestra.  The music on Seven also does not pander to the trendy \\"pop\\" classical pastures of acts like Bond, and instead has depth and substance.  Finally, Banks himself is a listener and aficionado of classical music, and thus Seven is not some whimsical foray into a new genre.<br />As for the music on Seven, there are seven separate songs that can stand on their own, yet which work as a whole.  The musical influences range from Banks' own instrumental and film work to the English Romanticism of Vaughan Williams.  There is also a touch of other 20th Century composers, including Sibelius and Shostakovich.  Banks plays piano on three of the tracks: Spring Tide, The Ram, and The Spirit of Gravity.  Black Down, which is named after a hill located near Banks' residence, ranks highly with this listener, as it evokes a dark romanticism throughout.  Spring Tide features several interlocked melodies, and its introduction is also an appropriate opening for the album.  Another favorite is The Spirit of Gravity, which like much of Banks' previous instrumental work, progresses through several differing parts while remaining focused in purpose.<br />The London Philharmonic Orchestra was appropriately selected by Banks-they assist throughout with fervent playing of each piece.  The sound is excellent and results from co-producer Nick Davis along with the location of the orchestral recording at Air Lyndhurst, which is an advanced studio with an old Victorian church as its \\"live room.\\"  Even the painting \\"Le Pays Avec Arbres\\" by the late Stefan Knapp was selected by Banks personally and appropriately adorns the cover, thereby completing the whole package.<br />Therefore, Seven is highly recommended by this listener as a superb work by an excellent composer who should do more within the classical genre.
0316666343|3.0|Like other reviewers, I felt almost guilty for not liking the book better.  I read about the touching, &quot;luminous&quot; writing.  If &quot;luminous&quot; means &quot;I can't figure out what the hell this sentence is saying,&quot; then luminous the book is.<br />The concept was excellent - girl in heaven looking after her friends &amp; family after her murder.  Susie was fairly fleshed out, and her dad was real, but, again like other reviewers, I found most of the characters rather stilted and unreal.<br />Still and all, I found myself turning pages until the last 3 or 4 chapters where it was a matter of, sorry, getting the damn thing over with!
B000021Y77|4.0|In this film, the director, Tom Tykwer challenges to Hollywood movies, which is to break the female role. In &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;, Lola is a hero. Making a heroin into a hero is the new way. Also, how Lola dresses is challenging to the cinematic male gaze. The typical Hollywood heroin is skinny, having a long hair, wearing high heels and smiling. However, Lora doesn't have any of these elements. Tywker's challenge leaves us a question. Is Lora a hero all the way in the film? Although Lola is trying to be a hero to save Manni, Tykwer makes the last scene close to what traditional endings in Hollywood movies. The close up shot of Lola and Minni holding hands is ironic because it seems like it is a happy ending. This ending asks audiences that &quot;Is Lola really happy?&quot;. Lola wants to save Manni but he solves the problem himself. Even though Lola breaks the gender role, her lover Manni is in control of a situation.<BR>However, by making the ironic ending, the third part is stood out from first two parts. The third part is more realistic than other two parts because Lora's situation is similar to what female positions in Hollywood and everyday lives. Therefore, I think Tykwer is asking that how we think about Lora's situation which is familiar to us.
B000001Y5J|5.0|this is one of the best ever records ever <BR>i was grateful of buying this record
B000001DTM|4.0|After experiencing abundant success with the previous two albums,THE JOSHUA TREE and RATTLE AND HUM,U2 didn't spawn many Top 10 hits from this album. Only ONE and MYSTERIOUS WAYS made it to the Top 10. This CD was released in the standard plastic jewel case and the cardboard gatefold case. In fact,since RATTLE AND HUM,U2 had no megahit albums.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Iron Maiden has had quite the illustrious career, spanning from the origins of NWOBHM up til Dance of Death. This could be the best album they're released. From the opener of Where Eagles Dare to the closeing Dune inspired To Tame a Land, this album is what metal should be. Chock full of classic Maiden riffs, complements of two GREAT guitarists, to the well thought out and diversified lyrics, its a great disc start to finish. For anyone looking to delve into this amazing band's catalogue, either this or Number of the Beast would be a great starting place.
B00008DDSC|4.0|This is a great little movie. It's precisely the kind of film that should (and did) come out of the Sundance Festival; a small budget, story/character driven film with themes largely unexplored by Hollywood. The characters are more than a little quirky, yet very believable (aren't real people a lot more strange and complex than your average movie character?). The story has some dark themes, but again they are tangable and &quot;real&quot; though stylized. And despite the &quot;dark&quot; themes, the overall feeling of the film is fun and funny. If your favorite movies are Titanic, Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, or other big-budget, Hollywood-type films, you will most certainly dislike this movie. However, if you are interested in seeing what good acting, a good script, and challanging subject matter can do for a film despite low budgets, this is a great example.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this CD before all the hype, and loved it from the get go. Almost every song is awesome, and the lyrics really hit home for me having just ended something I thought was love. My main love is heavy metal and even death...but I just like good music, and the songwriting on this CD is outstanding. <br />For the people comparing it to Lacuna Coil - give me a break. LC are so incredibly boring, but just because they are under a metal label, people think they are somehow a stronger band. <br />Evanescense is not trying to be metal. They aren't trying to copy Korn or LP (there's no rap on the CD asides from the life song). Just accept them for what they are. The vocals are outstanding, but the girl doesn't make the band...the songs can stand alone.<br />Great CD that I have played 1000 times over, and finally cannot listen to it anymore because the lyrics just open up old wounds.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Dire Straits had a big hit in 1979,SULTANS OF SWING. Their next big hit was MONEY FOR NOTHING,from this album with Sting,which he co-wrote with the band's frontman Mark Knopfler. Other hits from this album include SO FAR AWAY,WALK OF LIFE and the title track. Only SO FAR AWAY does not appear on the 1988 follow-up compilation MONEY FOR NOTHING. It should have since it was a Top 20 hit. YOUR LATEST TRICK has an excellent trumpet introduction. All the other songs are good.
B00005UEAR|4.0|Ooh ooh my turn to rate this album.<br />Basically for this album it all comes down to the 2nd disc. Oh sure there might be a few times where it can become rather awesome on the first disc (what I'm thinking is John Myung's glass prison) anywho 2nd disc is what I got this for and I don't regret this buy!
B00005JKC3|3.0|Ok, I'll admit it, I'm probably going to be crucified for this review because I've talked to people who are AMAZINGLY against this movie, but then again, there were people who agreed with my point of view about it.  <br />THAT BEING SAID, I HATED this movie the first time I watched it, because it was a little slow for my taste, the Origin wasn't the same as the ORIGINAL Hulk origin, and there was just a whole lot of OVERACTING by Nick Nolte.  <br />Then I watched it again.  The Origin aspect... It still gnawed at me a bit, but I thought about how he &quot;originally&quot; turned into the hulk, and it really doesn't make sense.  He would have been disintigrated by the Gamma Bomb, and that's not going to help make a somewhat believable movie.  So the origin change seemed at least... FEASIBLE.  I talked to someone else who said it should have been some &quot;new bomb&quot; but...  I think that still causes some issues...<br />The SLOW factor.  Well, yes, it's slow.  But if you think back on most of the Comic based movies, they're kind of slow because they take time to show the true origin of the character, give you an idea of who they are, and what they do.  The Hulk is supposed to be a &quot;brainless wrecking ball&quot; and it's kind of hard to devise a 2 hour plot around him smashing stuff (or you'd have Fast and the Furious 3 mixed with a giant green monster).  You have to have some understanding of who Bruce Banner is, and why he became what he became.  So I understand the need for the pace being the way it was.  I'm expecting that they'll have a much faster paced sequel (if rumor turns out to be true) because you don't have to worry as much about character introduction, and can get into the &quot;hulk smash&quot; more without explaining how the Hulk happened.<br />Then the final complaint.  The Nick Nolte factor.  Round two of watching this movie didn't help this issue at all.  In fact, it made it worse.  Every scene that Nolte was in was literally painful to watch because he overacted so much it seemed like he was TRYING to overact that badly.  It seemed like he was trying to make soap opera acting look good, or possibly he was just trying to make sure that no one ever takes him seriously again.  Either way, I had trouble watching his scenes, and seriously wish they would have re-considered casting someone or anyone else in the part.  <br />In conclusion, the general story wasn't bad, the thought process of the director seemed to be in the right place, and my only other little complaint may be that the Hulk as a character, seemed a bit too intelligent for my thinking, though, the comic book Hulk has gone through many different levels of intelligence and or mental capabilities and this is comparably a moot issue if comparing it to how poorly Nolte's performance was. <br />Check it out if you haven't seen it, it's not bad, but don't expect it to be the comic book you remembered from the 60's exactly.  It makes a little more sense than the original origin, so THUMBS UP for that...
B0001UZZWW|3.0|Shrek, the main movie, is SO popular there's really no need for yet another review, so I'll focus on the mini 3D adventure included with this set.<BR>While it's great to have the original cast all back, the one thing this &quot;adventure&quot; lacks is humor. There's plenty of action, and one can definitely see how this footage could be used for an amusement park attraction, but all-in-all, there's just no real substance here.<BR>In fact, the trailer for the upcoming Shrek 2 theatrical release was more entertaining, and generated more laughs, than anything found in the mini-3D adventure.<BR>One definitely annoying part is when the short film ends. Suddenly, the credits start rolling and the sound goes completely mute...no music...no singing...nothing. I can only imagine that those releasing this opted to cut costs and spare the extra expense of paying for music rights.<BR>In a nutshell, it's worth a look, but that's about it. If you already own the original Shrek on DVD, save your money and use it to see Shrek 2 instead.

B00003CWL6|4.0|American Beauty is a film about the `typical' American family, with the `typical' husband and wife, daughter, and a white picket fence surrounding a beautiful rose garden. But, as is it stated below the title of the film, we must look closer. Kevin Spacey's character, Lester, is the husband, who works 5 days a week in his cubicle office space, who suddenly comes to a realization that his life as he knows it, isn't what he wants it to be.  His wife, Carolyn, played by Annette Benning, is Lester's wife, who falls asleep as soon as her head hits the pillow, concentrates all of her time being the best at her real estate job, gawking after the `Real Estate King' Buddy Cane. Their daughter, practically ignored by both of them, suffering from lack of self esteem, with a friend who thinks the world of herself. This friend, Angela eventually becomes Lester's obsession. This `typical' beautiful girl, blonde, blue eyes, thin, puts on a front for all the world to see when she's really suffering inside. When a new neighbor moves in, the son of the household, Ricky, develops an interest for the family. He films them, and watches them, this panoptical character, who sees things differently than the others, intriguing the daughter of Lester and Carolyn. But within the family, we see how Lester objectifies Angela, he fantasizes about her, and somehow every fantasy is overflowing with red rose petals. This film however opposes the stereotype that the man of the house runs everything, because in this house the woman puts herself in charge, and pushes everyone under her. She craves power, and high status. Overall the film raises questions about `typical' family life, or anything `typical', and invites you to think about what is really important and beautiful in life.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for A dream isn't absolutely perfect.Jared Leto is miscast and not up to the emotional range needed to portray his character's downward spiral into the perils of hell.And sometimes, the visual effects get a little too crazy.But the film so stomach churningly,heart-wrenchingly, unbelievably powerful, that you really won't care.<br />Ellen Burstyn is absolutely magnificent.No, that's not right.She's fearless,and uninhibited, and simply unbelievably powerful.I knew she was good, but not this good.Her performance deserves to be studied, and it is the most powerful female performance that I've ever seen in my entire life.Her downward sprial into addiction is the single most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen.Horrifying,but heartbreaking.Jennifer Connelly manages to remain subtly,quitely emotive, even in the role of a junkie.She's a good actress.Marlon Wayans came off as a surprisingly affecting dramatic actor.The movie creates a hypnotic and dazzlingly horrific vision of the hells of addiction through visual affect.By the end, you'll be dizzy,<br />This film is so much more than an anti-drug movie, though.It's a bloody and intense study of the crumble of human decency.This movie will make your heart beat a thousand miles per hour, it'll make you sweat and weep and shake and swear you'll never watch it again-even though, deep down, you know you have to, because in this movie's undeniable emotional potency lies an addiction in itself.Not in the sense that you need to watch it all the time.I'd think you were absolutely nuts if you did. But in the sense that the film(along with it's stunningly pulsating soundtrack), never ever ever EVER EVER leaves your head and heart.This movie follows me daily, more so than my own shadow.<br />Requiem is the most depressing film I've ever watched.My mother couldn't sleep for a whole night after seeing it.It is an absolute nightmare-graphic and shocking and visually uninhibited to the very extent.It's not so much the content of thefilm, as the entire atmosphere of it-you'll be so depressed by the end that you'll wonder whether there's a meaning to this life.I wouldn't recommend watching this movie at night-it's hard to get a good night's slep afterwards.I cannot stress this enough-it is nothing short of a living nightmare and will leave you on the verge of a suicide attempt<br />That said, this movie can be summed up in two words-horrific and heartbraking.It is so heartbraking, that your stomach hurts and your heart aches, and all you can think of is these characters' descent into their own private hell.But that's what drugs are.I believe it impossible to make a witty, or darkly comic movie about drugs.Drugs are a nightmare-they take over your soula and mind, and destroy every shred of humanity within you-addiction in general is just that, although that all depends what you're addicted to.That is like watching a film about rape and complaining that the rape scene was &quot;too difficult&quot;.Did it ever occur to you that maybe rape is a little difficult.By the end, Requiem no longer feels like a movie, but like a living nightmare with a very sad core.It is the most stunning,powerful, horrifying,heartbraking, unbelievably mind-numbingly,heart-achingly,stomach-chrningly unforgettable film I've ever seen,
B00005JKCH|3.0|Spider-man, based on the comic, personifies the spider, who is also a super-hero, with strength and agility along with the ability to spray his web wherever he chooses. Peter Parker, or Spider-man out of hero mode, is a young student who gets bit by a spider and achieves super powers. Peter eventually uses his powers to fight off criminals, and those who hurt others. He eventually encounters the Green Goblin, played by Willem Dafoe, who is his friends' father when not out on the streets causing trouble. In the film, Peter's character has a crush on a girl he knew growing up, M.J.. M.J. is our `damsel in distress' who is seemingly always in need of help, and has perfected the art of screeching for aid. Our two super powered characters are both male, one in search of power, money, and Spider-man's neck, the other, trying to attain his love, M.J.. M.J. is objectified and made to seem like a dumb girl who needs a smart strong man to save her. The panoptical view of the hero, who sees all evil, seems to also see M.J. and focus his life-saving abilities on achieving a mate. Overall the film is pleasing to the eye, and allows for critical thinking on how woman are portrayed in movies that mainly focusing on young audiences.
0792833236|4.0|Robert De Niro is an actor of absolutely unquestionable and indescribable strength and power.There is no acting in this film.Robert De Niro is purely and simply Jake La Motta; famous 1940's boxer with uncontrollable rage and bouts of jealousy that eventually cost him the care and respect of his loved ones.Robert De Niro put on about 50 pounds towards the end of the film; you probably already know that.What you will not know, and simply MUST expeirience is the sheer power of De Niro's intense, yet realistic, ultimately stomach churningly wrenching performance.My title is a little inaccurate.De Niro, isn't the boss, he's the God, at least in this film.<br />Pesci is stunningly effective as De Niro's brother, and 18 year old Cathy Moriarty marks a very impressive debut as the sultry Vickie.The script is perfect and every bit as profane and vulgar and in your face as it needs to be.<br />True, this film tends to lose it's compellingness as a drama during the film's tiny dry spots.But it's a wondrous character study, one of the best of all time; and the mastery of De Niro's performance is earth-shattering.
B000002KBH|5.0|This is their best studio album.  What more can I say?  Brokedown Palace may be the most beautiful rock song of all time.  A must.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Since when did mediocrity get so fashionable?  I'm sorry, but this is nothing short of horrible.  I'm not a snob: I think Nirvana is brilliant; so you don't necessarily have to be a great musician to make great music, but it sure doesn't hurt. Not only can this &quot;drummer&quot; not play, but these songs are just gawdawful.  My 10 yr old son started playing guitar and one week after he and his friend started to play, they were ripping up 7Nation Army; and I don't mean playing it in a &quot;I just learned how to play Smoke On the Water Dad!&quot; way, I mean, they were playing it just like Jack.  (yechhhh!)  My 14 year old started playing bass, and his drummer buddy can play the drums and the guitar to this song at the same time: And arguably he sounds better doing it than these 2 goofs.  <br />Please, ignore the hype, save yourself the money and the aggravation of having been suckered by a peppermint twist of a video, and stay the hell away from this piece of crap.  Sure, it only took 8 days to make this record: IT SOUNDS LIKE IT!

B000002UDB|5.0|I can remember it like it was yesterday.  The year was 1978 (or thereabouts).  I was 14 years old, and I knew OF the Beatles, but really couldn't have named more than 5 of their songs.  I was into stuff like ELO back then.  Anyway, one night, a local radio station decided to play the entire Magical Mystery Tour album from beginning to end.  So I figured, what the hell, I put on a set of headphones and sat down in a chair and listened.  It was during that 30 or so minutes that my life changed.  I think my jaw literally hung open.  Every song was better than the last.  And from that moment on, everything I thought I knew about music was demolished.  I begged my parents to buy me the album - then I listened to it about a 5000 times.  It was one of those moments in life where you just know, EVERYTHING changed for you.  Am I overstating it?  No, I don't think so.<br />A few months later, that same radio station (Detroit WRIF), played the White Album.  OH MY GOOODDD!!!
B00005JKOI|4.0|This isn't really my favorite movie that John Hughes made, Sixteen Candles is my favorite, but this one is also pretty good..besides the ending. Molly Ringwald was SO much better with Duckie.  Duckie is the best character in this, he's so funny.  The part at the end when he's at the dance and he looks at you through the camera, it's priceless!! You got to check this movie out, it's a good one.
B000002BE9|4.0|This album is filled with Sade-esque vocals united with original lyrics and creative musical combinations creating a soulful and emotionaly charged sound.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who experiences a stressful day, i.e. everyone.
0802130208|5.0|Having avoided this book for years (I tend not to buy into hype, whether from the media or my friends) I finally picked up this &quot;classic&quot; novel and started in.  Prepared to hate it every step of the way, I instead found myself mesmerized by John Kennedy Toole's marvelous writing, and especially the main character of Ignatius.  At once loveable and yet heinously repulsive, this Falstaffian oddity is one of a handful of most-memorable characters to ever grace the written pages of American, and more importantly, southern literature.  Why this book isn't required reading in school, along with Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; McCrae's &quot;Bark of the Dogwood,&quot; and Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; is beyond me.  Not only is this book funny, but the construction, the pacing, the tone, the overall effectiveness of the writing, is truly one of a kind.  Forget the fact that Toole did himself in by not being able to get this masterwork published.  Forget the fact that this novel won the Pulitzer Prize.  Forget the reviews, both good and bad, and simply read this novel for what it is:  a great, funny, rollicking journey through the land of insanity, mixed up with the great city of New Orleans and the fleeting beauty of life.  Just a great read.
B000001GQT|5.0|Put aside his Nazi past, and Herbert von Karajan remains one of the most controversial conductors of the 20th century.  There is still that famously aloof, arrogant personality to deal with, and then, there is the music.  For some folks, Karajan's interpretations and recordings are without peer.  For others, he's just TOO much... of everything... Period.<BR>As usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  Karajan himself put it best: \\"My whole purpose (in conducting an orchestra) is to achieve a momentary state of ecstasy through<BR>music.\\"  Karajan's approach to music is, therefore, necessarily<BR>HEROIC.  That leads him to achieve results with some composers'<BR>works that are spectacular, and just plain strange with others.<BR>This recording is, unquestionalbly, one of the spectacular ones.<br />Stated simply: no one, absolutely, no one conducted the tone poems of Richard Strauss any better than Herbert von Karajan.<BR>The affinity between composer and conductor extends beyond tempermnet and philosophy into the realm of sheer mysticism, and the music reflects this.  I defy anyone to find a recording of <BR>\\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" that's any better than this one.  The only contender I can think of is one by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by (you guessed it!) Herbert von Karajan.<BR>Even the notable recording by Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony sounds limp by comparison.<br />Clearly, Nietzsche's novella as philosophy struck an important chord in the soul of Richard Strauss, and he poured much of that soul into this composition, which is daring, dramatic, brooding<BR>and poignant by turns.  Nobody brought those qualities out of an<BR>orchestra any better than Karajan does here.  This may give the impression that the music tends to bombast, and the way it AVOIDS<BR>bombast is precisely what is so stunning about this performance.<BR>What frequently gets lost in discussions of von Karajan's art is<BR>the remarkable CONTROL and discipline he exertedover his orchestral forces.  It's not just all about BIG, heroic sonorities.  There is a delicacy and precision to the softer passages in this music, and a control to the careful grading of <BR>crescendoes that is breathtaking.  When you reach the climaxes,<BR>Karajan hits you with a wall of sound that makes you stop in your tracks and shake your head in disbelief of the miracle you just heard.<br />I really can't reccommend this recording highly enough.  It is one of those serendipitous experiences where everything, the matching of composer, conductor and orchestra, all falls into place<BR>just exactly right.  If you want to know what all the heat and passion over Herbert von Karajan is all about, look no further.<BR>This is some of the most STUNNING music-making you will ever hear.
B00001QEE8|5.0|The Jungle Book is one of our families two favorite Disney movies (the other is Mary Poppins).  As close as can be expected to Rudyard Kiplings book, The Jungle Book is the story of the boy Mogli who is raised in the jungle by a pack of wolves, with Bagheera the panther as a close family friend.  One day, SherCan the tiger returns to the jungle, with a special hate for mankind.  It is decided that for the wolf pack's safety, Mogli must go.  Bagheera offers to return him to the \\"man village\\".  Of course, Mogli doesn't want to leave the jungle, the only home he has ever known, so he slips off into the jungle and has a grand adventure.<br />The Jungle Book is a movie that even the adults in our family don't mind watching more than once.  The story is good, the gags are funny, the adventure is gripping (for a children's movie), and the score is really and truly one of the greatest and jazziest ever put to a Disney movie.  In fact, our five year old loves the songs so much, that it sparked an new interest in jazz music in our home with the family!<br />I highly recommend this movie to any family looking for whole-family fare.  Unlike some of Disney's more modern fare there is no implied sexuality, short skirts, or bloody bullet wounds.  Just 100% wholesome family entertainment.
0684833395|5.0|This isn't the type of book who's rating tends mainly on opinion. But more on how you read and studied it. While as everyone says it's a war novel, it's a metaphor on corporate America. It is a difficult read, but if you study it it will prove worthwhile. Reading with someone who knows the book also helps. It does help you become well read because of it's being one of a kind. You learn from it, not every book's hero is the ultimate anti-hero. Not every book is a paradox upon it's self.<br />This could be read just for the humour. When you think about it though you wonder, why am I laughing, this is so dark. It's the way of writing only expert authors such as Heller can do that makes the book that way. <br />Who you are also is necessart for the book. You need to be well read to begin with to get the most from it. You need to be willing to take your time. You need to not care if there are 5 pages where the characters swear 24 times. You need to be able to deal with this book. You could be a 13 year old mature high-school student or a 30 (or 50) year old adult. You need the inner maturity and perserveriance to do this book what it disearves.
6305784116|3.0|The Aristocats is good enough for the kids, but the adults are likely to tire of it quickly.  There is nothing wrong with this movie.  The animation is perfectly fine, in that it is a completely different species of art from the modern computer graphic.  The story is typical fare for children (cats get stolen and lost, have an adventure to find their way home, and live happily ever after), a sort of morph between &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; and &quot;101 Dalmations&quot;.  There is one tune that is pretty decent, though doesn't quite deliver on the wonderful high-energy jazziness like &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.  All in all, this is a movie that the children aren't likely to tire of soon.<br />That being said, it just seems to lack the flair (musically and literarily) of other Disney classics, such as &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; and, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;.  Musically this movie is very weak.  There is one tune that is almost quite good, but not quite.  For story, the adult just feels a lot like they have seen this movie before.  There is nothing magical or surprising.  It's just sort of predictable and flat, not even particularly funny.<br />Overall, if you are just looking for a movie to occupy the kids for a little while, this might be a good selection.  Small children, at least, will like this for quite a while.  If you are looking for a movie to be a family affair that will actually be enjoyed by everyone, you might want to pass on this one look elsewhere - because the &quot;grown folks&quot; are going to get sick of this one quickly, perhaps even before the end of the first viewing.
B00007163D|5.0|The best sales person giude to closing. An All Star line up. Ed Harris, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Jack Lemmon and Alec Baldwin can't get better then this.  The role of Rona by Al Pacino was nominted for best actor.  This movied was great and the dvd was great.  The price is attractive 2 Discs with many features.  This is the movie that teaches you how to close and the gives the neccities of-up selling, and just to give you that drive you need to be a better focused salesperson.  This movie just has some of the best, and most amazing acting I have ever seen.  BUY this DVD you wont regret it TRUST ME, you can always trust a sales man lol. A must for all Al Pacino lovers.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|I got Shrek to watch, because I was unsure of it's appropriateness for our five year old, and wanted to preview it first.  Boy am I glad that I did!  Just about all of the humor is adolescent-idiot crude and disgusting, that is, when it isn't aimed at sexual innuendo.  This movie is not appropriate for children at all (unless you want them to learn swearing and farting as a standard of humor).  I am truly disappointed with the movie ratings board for allowing the movie to get by without a PG-13.  And what is really awful, is that all of that crude humor wasn't even funny!<br />It's a real shame, because the story was a really great one for children, showing the value of open communication (instead of making assumptions about overheard parts of conversation) and judging people by their hearts and minds (instead of outward appearances).<br />The only thing that saved this movie from absolute dustbin status wasn't even in the movie.  There is an extra on the DVD (not sure about the VHS) that is a karaoke rap-sing using mostly old eighties songs.  As an adult, I found this funny, but I doubt most kids would even get it.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|To really appreciate this movie, you should watch it with the subtitles on to catch the subtle meanings.  I believe Aubrey does want to catch the Acheron because of the injury to young Blakeney.  This movie gets better each time you watch it.  The ending is perfectly positioned to allow a sequel.  Unlike Pirates of the Carribean which was somewhat entertaining but utterly ridiculous, this is a credible movie and beautifully done.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I just can't get over how good this movie is!  I was reluctant to see it in the first place. Peter Pan has always been one of my favorite stories, and the previews for this version just seemed so different than what I was used to. Thankfully my friend suggested we see it, and the rest is history. I completely fell in love with it. Everyone in the cast is so wonderful...Jeremy Sumpter is awesome. Could they get anyone better to play the eternal child?  As for Captain Hook, well let's just say that I've started thinking up pirate names for myself now. Jason Isaacs is great in this role, he gives the Captain so much emotion that I've never seen before.  The whole movie is packed with emotion, it's great.  I will say that in my six experiences at the theater to see Peter Pan, the small children that were there in droves seemed to be bored. Teens and adults will enjoy this more.  The story is much more sad and dark than most people might think, just as the original story is. But it's so beautiful, don't miss out on this one. I do believe in fairies...I do! I do!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Although Mer De Noms is definitely a great album (one of my favorites), this album surpasses it. Thirteenth Step is awesome!! Here's how I rate the songs:<br />1. The Package - 6/10 - Alright song, just starts off too slow for too long. Not a great opening song.<BR>2. Weak and Powerless - 9/10 - Of course this is a good song, however, no where near the best.<BR>*3. The Noose - 10/10 - Awesome song! One of the best songs on the album and one of my favorite APC songs!<BR>4. Blue - 9/10 - Another great song. Really liked it at first but kinda went lower on my list after listening to it enough.<BR>5. Vanishing - 7/10 - OK song. Good bass though.<BR>6. A Stranger - 8/10 - Maynard's voice is really awesome in this song. Nice little song.<BR>*7. The Outsider - 10/10 - Unbelievable song!! Definitely one of APC's best songs of all time! And YES this song is better than Three Libras.<BR>8. Crimes - More of an intro type song.<BR>9. The Nurse Who Loved Me - 8/10 - This song is definitely a bit strange, but I like it. It's different, and that's what I like about it.<BR>*10. Pet - 10/10 - Another incredible song here! Great guitars in this song! Another one of my favorites!<BR>11. Lullaby - Intro type song.<BR>12. Gravity - 9/10 - This is another really good song. Great closing song.<br />At first, I thought that MER DE NOMS was unsurpassable. I was wrong. THIRTEENTH STEP, to me, is definitely a better album. If you have Mer De Noms, you really need to get this album. It won't disappoint!!
B00005U122|5.0|I'm not going to compare this to Pulse or Delicate Sound Of Thunder. Pink Floyd's only DVD release to date (and probably ever) is Pompeii, like it or not. Pulse and Thunder is what is left off Pink Floyd since Waters left. They were nice enough, I have them both on VHS, and I watched them from time to time. <br />But this is something else entirely. The post-Waters era Floyd is a very good band but not a groundbreaking band. They made The Division Bell, a great album by today standards, but they no longer make cult records. Waters, on the other hand, made Amused to Death, maybe his greatest achivement ever, maybe greater than The Wall or Dark Side. <br />And this DVD is the testament to his present status. Of course, you already read a thousand reviews praising the sound quality as well as the cristal clear picture. Of couse you did! It is even better than they say, and I can only add that you must experience this video, reading is no more than a mere prologue to it.<BR>I might add that the visual direction is incredible, maybe one of the best ever. And the set list is a knock out. Now, some people complained about some changes in the performances (an electric guitar on Wish You Were Here, Waters singing Time, band members singing Money, Dogs, and etc). You know what? It actually makes it better! You already have those versions on the albums! Why make a copy when you don't have the original elements. Gilmour is not here, so you have to play and sing his parts somehow. So Waters reinvented them, and they work! They are just different ways to approach the songs.<BR>Also, the songs from his solo albums are beautifully executed, specially the one from Pros And Cons, since it is also very different and much more emotional. <br />Truth be told, when you watch Pulse, you can feel something missing. It is good, mostly because of the show and the musicianship, and a fine rendition. But something quintessencial is absent. Of course, you guess it's Waters. But when you watch this DVD, you don't feel that. You will find it compelling the first time, and by the third, you won't even think of Gilmour and company. This is Roger Waters, this is his show and he is in peak condition. Everything is flawless from start to finish, and nothing ever felt truer to the real Pink Floyd live of the late seventies. <br />My advide is, if you love classic PF, and that means Animals, WYWH, Dark Side, The Wall among others, this DVD is for you, if you can handle the fact that PF no longer exists. But Waters is out there, writing great songs and brilliant lyrics still. And now he proves that he is a great live performer as well.<br />Words can't do this one justice. Just watch it and feel it, and prepare for the incredible.
0064407667|5.0|Even though this is a book targeted to kids by its publisher, I think that the author wrote it considering a much broader audience. I would say that as Rowling did with \\"Harry Potter\\", Snicket will captivate people of all ages. A word of warning though, the author clearly states that this is an unhappy story and that if you do not like this you should not try to read it. He is not joking! The story is sad and every time there is a glimpse of hope, it is quickly quenched.<br />The three Baudelaire siblings are the main characters in this unhappy story. Violet is a fourteen-year-old who loves to think constantly about possible inventions. Klaus is twelve, intelligent and enjoys reading all kinds of books. Sunny is the little infant that is going through a biting stage and will go at anything with her four teeth. Everything starts out wrong right from the beginning, when the Baudelaire siblings, now orphans, find out that their parents died in a fire. They have a huge fortune, but they will not have access to it until Violet reaches adulthood. In the meantime, Mr. Poe, the executioner of the estate will manage the funds and take care of finding a place for the orphans to live in.<br />Violet, Klaus and Sunny end up living with Count Olaf, in a house that is a disaster and has a weird feeling about it. Also, they quickly realize that the Count's only interest is in the money they have and in nothing else. The kids are forced to take care of the house chores and only find solace in their friendly neighbor, Justice Strauss. But any glimpse at happiness is quickly extinguished by new terrible events. We even get a second warning by the author halfway through the book: \\"...people who hate stories in which terrible things happen to small children should put this book down immediately\\". However, my recommendation is: keep reading, you will not be disappointed.<br />The start of the series left me hooked and I will read the following books in the near future. I like the story, even with its sad tone, and enjoy the author's style. He has a humorous way of writing, defining obvious words and explaining some things that do not need explanations, even for kids. I think this is his way of satirizing some children's book that treat kids as if they were unable to comprehend simple matters. Moreover, there is a point in which he will start defining words using other words he defined before.<br />I am extremely satisfied with the experience of trying out this new author and would highly recommend it to people of all ages.y, even with its sad tone, and enjoy the author's style.

B000094PYJ|4.0|With &quot;Presence&quot; Led Zeppelin gets back to the heavy blues influences that showed up so strongly in their debut album, even though the album starts off with one of their longer rock epics, the 10:26 &quot;Achilles Last Stand.&quot; In &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; Robert Plant wails on his harmonica big time while Led Zep pounds its way through the song, but it is the final track where the group gets back to the ground they explored in their best blues track, &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; on &quot;Led Zeppelin III.&quot; &quot;Tea for One&quot; is without doubt or possible exception, the SLOWEST song in the Led Zep repertoire. After listening to Bonzo thrash his way through the opening track, it is unreal to hear him tapping that cymbal over and over as the song progresses with monster blues riffs countering Plant's sultry vocals.<br />In many regards this 1976 album is a continuation of the work on &quot;Physical Graffiti.&quot;  In addition to the three aforementioned tracks, &quot;For Your Life&quot; is the other biggie on the album.  That leaves three less than stellar tracks, although Led Zep's throw away tunes are never boring.  &quot;Royal Orleans&quot; is over about as soon as it begins, &quot;Candy Store Rock&quot; is a bit of rockabilly, and &quot;Hots on for Nowhere&quot; gets rather funky.  Given the rest of the album you almost expect Led Zep to ditch those three tunes and bring out one more epic.  In the final analysis, who cares about the black object in a series of pictures each of which is something completely different? Just turn out the lights and listen to this one in the dark (unless you are depressed or despondent, in which case you need to avoid the final track at all costs).
B00001ZULV|4.0|For those who are only familiar with Genesis from its radio fame of the past couple of decades, who don't own any of their albums and aren't especially interested in hearing any other Genesis songs but those you have already heard, this album is absolutely a must have. But are there even any of you out there that fit that description? Probably not.<br />As for myself, I'm a Collins-era Genesis fan whose first exposure to Genesis was that clever &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; video that used to run on MTV back when MTV was good. I became a big fan of the &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; album, as well as &quot;We Can't Dance&quot; and &quot;Genesis&quot;. For anyone who is content with the songs of that era, you'll enjoy this album. More than that, though, I would hope the inclusion of the Gabriel-era classics &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; and &quot;Carpet Crawlers&quot; spark some curiosity, so that you'll check out the older Genesis stuff. I'm still familiarizing myself with the early albums, but they are genius, and not to be missed, though quite different from the Genesis I first knew. I'm pleased that at least a token effort was made to represent the Genesis of the 70's.<br />Speaking of token efforts, the album also includes &quot;Congo&quot; from the post-Collins &quot;Calling All Stations&quot;. It's not a bad inclusion, one of the best tracks from that album, but like &quot;Mama&quot;, &quot;Tonight, Tonight, Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Abacab&quot;, it is badly cut down from the superior full album version. The entire coda is omitted, which is the best part of the darned song!<br />Anyway, if you don't own many Genesis albums yet, go for &quot;Turn It On Again&quot;, and hopefully you'll get a taste for more. If you already have the albums, you might want to pass, unless like me and many others, you buy it solely for the updated &quot;Carpet Crawlers 1999&quot;, which is magnificent!
0739432176|5.0|Garth Nix delves into the dark heart of high fantasy in the Abhorsen Trilogy, three interconnected fantasies about a strange family of necromancers who lay the dead -- and forces of evil to rest. With detailed writing and nuanced, likable characters, this is a modern fantasy classic.<br />&quot;Sabriel&quot; is the story of a teenage girl living happily at a girl's school, while her necromancer father (the Abhorsen) roams around putting the dead to rest. All that changes when a sending brings her father's sword and bells, meaning that he is dead or incapacitated. So Sabriel takes on her father's duties... and the specter of a horrible evil creature that is reaching out from death to snare her.<br />&quot;Lirael&quot; takes us to the cold citadel of the Clayr, a race of seers. Young Lirael is depressed because she doesn't have the gift of Sight yet, even though everybody else her age does. But things take a sinister turn when she sets a horrifying, bloodthirsty creature loose, and must work (with the help of the mysterious Disreputable Dog) to get rid of it. But what Lirael doesn't know is that the outside world is in danger too -- from a new evil threat.<br />&quot;Abhorsen&quot; brings the series to an explosive conclusion. Lirael and her nephew Sameth (along with &quot;cat&quot; Mogget and the Disreputable Dog) are in danger from the Dead. What's more, the Destroyer Orannis has escaped from his prison and is being assisted by an evil necromancer and the Dead called Chlorr -- and a pal of Sameth's. Now Lirael has to stop the Destroyer before he... well, destroys all life in the world.<br />The Abhorsen Trilogy is a perfect example of dark fantasy, with its grotesque dead, magical bells, enchanted and shadowy beasties. It takes the trappings of high fantasy and lets us see them through a mirror darkly. Not to mention that the characters are likable -- especially the gutsy Sabriel -- and the acid-tongued animals and black humor add a wry spin to the fantasy stories. &quot;Lirael&quot; is a bit limper than the first and third books, since it takes a long time to get going, but it's still a worthy and spellbinding book.<br />Garth Nix's Abhorsen Trilogy is a thrilling fantasy epic, and not to be missed by anyone who enjoys a little chill down their spine. A must-read for fans of fantasy and horror.&quot;Lirael&quot; is a bit limper than the first and third books, since it takes a long time to get going, but it's still a worthy and spellbinding book.<br />Garth Nix's Abhorsen Trilogy is a thrilling fantasy epic, and not to be missed by anyone who enjoys a little chill down their spine.

B00009RAJH|3.0|I have to make these same reluctant but truthful comments regarding the remastered versions of Rumours, Tusk and the epynomous album:  The remastering of these terrific albums, which was badly needed, is a real disappointment.<br />I have a decent stereo (NAD S500i CD player, NAD S300 integrated amp, Dynaudio Contour 1.3 Mark II speakers and a Velodyne FSR-10 sub), and most well-done remasters sound wonderful on it, but these three recordings are extremely bright and sibilant; harsh really.<br />Also (and I think this is part of the original production), the lead vocals are recessed and muffled; always just lurking in the background, never up-front where they belong.

B0000028UK|5.0|Pearl Jam's sophomore offering, 1993's Vs. (yes, you're right - it does not say Vs. anywhere on the sleeve) was at the time the fastest selling album in music history, managing to sell all 1.2 million copies printed for release date in the first 18 hours of hitting the shelves. The album received widespread critical acclaim as well as widespread critical disgust and a year later appeared in many readers polls in magazines around the world as both \\"best album of 1994\\" and \\"Biggest Disappointment,\\" often in the same magazine (and I cite Guitar World's 1994 Reader's Poll as an example).<br />The reason for this hugely mixed reception was its dissimilarity to the debut, Ten, from 1991, which sold something ridiculous like 14 million albums worldwide. Ten was a breath of fresh air in the aftermath of 80s hair metal and the late 80s/early 90s technopop and hit the ground around the same time as landmark multiplatinum albums by fellow Seattle outfits Soundgarden (Badmotorfinger), Nirvana (Nevermind) and Alice in Chains (Dirt).  It was a revelation - a hugely personal album to the band (as all decent albums should be, I think) which struck a chord with listeners as it had the musical prowess to be potent and listenable as well as carrying the emotion it did. Needless to say, Pearl Jam were tipped to be successors to U2 as the world's next biggest band; it was with great expectation that we awaited Vs.<br />Vs., though, is an entirely different animal to Ten. Firstly, Ten was magnificent as a studio album with production by the Parashar brothers second to none. Vs, the band's frist collaboration with Brendan O'Brian, captured a more live, stripped-down feel. To this day, Pearl Jam's massive catalogue of live albums (80 or so from three different world tours) sound like Vs. Secondly, the material was a lot more brutal, pulling no punches and perhaps disguising the band's dissatisfaction with everything less.<br />In my opinion, this is the finest work in the history of humankind. The album starts with the frantic, schizophrenic \\"Go\\" and proceeds to tear its way through 10 more excellent tracks before slowing down to the haunting, introspective \\"Indifference.\\" Even the quiter tracks on the album have a sense of urgency about them; the lyrics are all captivating and again, deeply personal to the musicians who wrote them. You get the impression that Eddie Vedder has more demons to conquer than hairs on his head, and he nails each track with an emotion which is still awesome to behold some ten years after the fact.<br />In fairness, things have changed somewhat now. I do think Pearl Jam have evolved as individuals and as a band. Perhaps the worst of those demons have been laid to rest, once and for all, as the new material by the band seems largely departed from what drove them all those years ago. They've grown older, I've grown up; but I cut my teeth on this when I was 17 and it inspired me to pick up a guitar and play, and it will always be my favourite work.

B00005NG9Z|5.0|Ok ok, I'll admit that if Alice aren't my favourite band in the world, they're in my top 3, and near as I can tell, they cannot do any wrong...Anyway, this the Video Bank which accompanies the Music Bank boxed set. While the Music Bank has 48 tracks - new, old, unreleased and rarities, this carries far fewer. All the videos the band ever made are on the disc; as well as a couple of behind the scenes things which show the band at play between shows and interviews and what-have-you.Here in sunny South Africa, we don't get this sort of thing anymore. We barely got it back then, either; but there are officially zero radio stations which have a majority-rock playlist so for the most part the only good stuff we get is current chart rock. we get even less in terms of music videos, that's for sure, so I was obliged to rush out to buy this item as soon as it became available here a couple years after everywhere else (as usual - welcome to darkest Africa). It was bought sight unseen - the only Alice videos I'd ever seen before getting this were those for Grind and Again; and a clip of I'll stay away from the boxset's 4th disc. So I was in entirely virgin territory even though I have almost all the albums at home.I have to say some of the stuff is a little cheesy - but in a good way. The first two videos are for We Die Young and they both are kinda psychedelic and 80s (in a bad way - sensory overload). But it picks up after that, with some magnificent material there for the taking, including all their big hits and the new track (well, new at the time) Get Born Again, which is creepy and disturbing and reminds me of the video for The Unforgiven by Metallica. As I said, some of the videos are not great and a little boring and overdone - Rooster, for one, whose video I don't like even though the song is classic - but there are some gems in there as well. There is also a mini documentary form an old TV spot put together ny some executive with some foresight waaaaaaay back when Facelift broke in 1989 or thereabouts; as well as a few extras/behind the scenes items which focus on the band as not-Alice and just being old friends messing about backstage.The disc could have benefited from having an interview or two, I thought, perhaps hauling in a director from one of the videos and having a mini MTv-esque \\"Making the video\\" segment for one or two of the tracks. Unfortunately, you get the impression Columbia Records didn't want to have to pump any more cash into this than absolutely necessary, which is forgiveable in that there was an accompanying CD boxed set; but at the same time, it does come off as sort-of budget.I rate the compilation as five stars; but in terms of content (ie bonus materials on a normal DVD movie) only 2 stars, since It's pretty much just chapter selection and that's it. Still, works well to plug it into your DVD player, leave the TV off and just play it as a greatest hits CD through the stereo speakers!

0140544518|5.0|My elementary-school age son loves the upside-down fairy tale books, like The Stinky Cheese Man, The Wolf Who Cried Boy, or The Big Bad Pig and the Three Little Wolves.  This book isn't as much fun for him as those, because at least 80% of the humor is intended for somebody no younger than 12.  <br />*I* laugh my head off whenever we read it; it's certainly a five-star book.  Just don't expect a young child to enjoy the book.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|For any price, this dvd &amp; cd are the best music value out there.<br />Buble's star is sure on the rise and it's no wonder. Comparisons aside, he has a sound and presence like the late greats and thank goodness he arrived on the music scene to take us out of the doldrums.<br />His show ending - accapella -- without the benefit of a microphone/soundsystem in a huge hall is testament to his skill and left me (and his audience for that matter) in awe. And in tears - it was beautiful.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Dream Theater are amazing and, along with Rush, solely responsible for my love of prog metal. But you all are scared to death that there may be bands just as good if not better than Dream Theater. After the last two albums they put out I'm convinced they are overrated! 6DOIT is good but has some serious flaws (the great debate for example) while Train of Thought is progressive Nu-Metal nonsense. This band has a lot of redeeming to do in my opinion. Otherwise they need to go ahead and throw in the towel. It's odd that people are praising Train of Thought on Virgil's website considering the contrast in substance and quality between these two musical powerhouses. As for Symphony X, Dream Theater doesn't have the stones to put out a real progressive metal album like The Odyssey. And whoever said it's more reasonable to compare DT to the likes of Aghora and Cynic . . . are you serious? DT needs to be compared to one band and one band only . . . themselves and the bar they set. Besides, Cynic is so far over the heads of most Dream Theater fans that it's likely to give many of them an aneurysm. Yeah, Dream Theater is one of the most talented bands to have graced the Earth, but creatively they are loosing it. I feel bands like Pain of Salvation, Andromeda, Into Eternity, Ark, Zero Hour, Opeth and many others are the future of prog metal. I'm tired of making excuses for Dream Theater.
B000127LW2|2.0|Much too expensive for the way this collection was packaged.  The first season of Voyager shows the great vision that Gene Roddenberry had with his first original series, but Paramount is just seeking to milk as much money from the loyal viewers as possible.  The cheap cover and lack of pamphlets make this a shameful release.  Compared to the Stargate SG-1 releases, which are way more reasonable and much better packaged, the only reason I bought this was because Amazon's price was more reasonable than retail stores.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|See, you all are helping me prove my point. I say Dream Theater is overrated and you all start acting like I insulted your mommies. Come on! How old are you all? Then you go off and start talking about Dream Theater not being on TRL. So you have to be on TRL to be overrated? Are you all familiar with the metal scene as a whole? Within the genre of prog metal Dream Theater is overrated (ooooooh, I said it again). They are amazing, but they are writing junk now as opposed to other prog metal bands that are actually putting out good songs. Dream Theater is doing one of two things right now; putting out poor songs because they are trying to appease the Nu-Metal converts or they have simply lost their ability to write good music. I personally think it's the former (I think that if they wanted to they could write amazing stuff again). I'm not going to settle for mediocre song writing like you all are with Train of Thought. And yes, Dream Theater tried to put out a more metal oriented album with ToT, (as did Symphony X with The Odyssey); the only difference is that one failed miserably while the other produced a masterpiece. I'm very aware that these two bands are different, but both made drastic changes to their sounds with the release of their newest albums; one was a dismal failure, the other a success! That's the comparison I'm making between these two bands. They both had similar goals. That's all! The two bands have very little in common with their sound (other than that they are both considered progressive metal). And since when did exceptional talent dictate good song writing? The musicianship on Train of Thought is second to none. It's blistering fast and technically superb. Exceptional musicianship doesn't mean good song writing. I think you all are afraid to explore what else is really out there. I think you are scared that you might find something you like just as much if not more than Dream Theater.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty, directed by Sam Mendes, is a brilliant film that invites us to \\"look closer\\" and examine the ideals of beauty. Jane Burnham and Angela Hayes are best friends who are on the cheerleading squad together. Jane is the \\"ugly,\\" dark-haired gray-eyed sidekick to Angela, the blond-haired blue-eyed \\"beauty.\\" Beauty is put under the lens when Ricky Fitts, Jane's neighbor, films Jane with his personal video recorder from his window. Angela embodies the stereotypical \\"perfect\\" female, so Jane isn't the typical object of affection and questions Ricky's feelings for her. Ricky shows the viewer through his eyes, his definition of beauty. There is not a single definition of beauty. It is our horizon of experience that shapes our ideals.<br />Caroline Burnham is the obsessive compulsive, whiny, housewife. She is the super female who works as a realtor and top dog in the matriarchal family driving the car and making the money. By contrast, the Fitts are the patriarchal, militant family under the command of Colonel Frank Fitts, who is abusive to his son Ricky. Their neighbors, the Jims, are a (...)couple living together. They have a very healthy relationship and respect each other and see each other as equals.  Fascinating, how the most controversial relationship in society is the best functioning family of the three in the film.
B000002H33|4.0|After becoming the fastest band in the land on 1984's Ride The Lightning, Metallica slowed down their tempos a little on Master Of Puppets. They were still a thrash band, but on some tracks, some Rush-esque prog melodies are hidden beneath the thrash. The first solo on the title track is one of these moments. This is not as good as the 5-star Ride The Lightning, but it is still a metal classic. So if you like thrash metal with progressive elements, this will be the album for you.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|During late 2002/early 2003,there was huge crisis in the music world:no Alicia Keys!I mean,her legendary debut Songs In a Minor had already made enough history,but people wanted more.And she gave us more with this one.Alicia DEFINITELY passes the sophomore jinx and then some with this soul-filled beautiful piece of music.Alicia's voice is never better,especially in the songs that sound like Aretha or Chaka would have made back then,examples being the &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; of 2004(except this song is actually good) &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot;the '60's flavored &quot;Wake Up&quot;,and the made-for-classic remake of Gladys Knight's &quot;If I Was Your Woman&quot;,where Alicia makes the song sound almost as good as the original.And,Alicia has a little feistyness that she never showed in Songs In A Minor,that being the upbeat &quot;Heartburn&quot; which sounds like something an R&amp;B veteran would make.I mean,this girl makes you even want to listen to interludes.Some of the best tracks on this album are interludes,and I don't mean that as an insult!&quot;Feeling U,Feeling Me&quot; is 2 minutes of pure delight,as is the opening interlude &quot;Harlem's Nocturne&quot; where Alicia plays the instrument she was destined to play(the piano) beautifully.<br />Cons:1 or 2 of the songs are sleep-inducing(THE TITLE TRACK!) and that's pretty much it.<br />The Verdict:One of the greatest albums of this decade so far,this album simply made Alicia say &quot;I ain't just stayin here for 15 minutes!&quot;My personal rating:5/5,but I have to be professional about it,too!<br />Recommended:DEFINITELY!

1594200106|5.0|I'm very grateful that THE SHADOW OF THE WIND was translated into English or I would have missed out on this magnificent and splendid novel. I applaud Carlos Ruiz Zafon's ability to make both the plot and characters come alive on the page ultimately resulting in a satisfying reading experience. At the center of this novel is the young Daniel Sempere who, during a visit to the Cemetery of Lost Books with his father, takes home a discarded novel by unknown author Julian Carax. After becoming intrigued by the book Daniel sets out on a journey back to the beginning of the 20th century to uncover the secrets of the life of Carax. There are enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing until the very end. As the novel progresses Daniel realizes that there are significant similarities between his and Carax's life.<br />Accompanying Daniel on his journey is the womanizing Fermin who is full of espionage advice and the sadistic and brutal police inspector who has a fearful reputation. Despite the human characters I believe one of the effective characters in this novel is the setting of post-Civil War Barcelona, Spain. Carlos Ruiz Zafon creates a wonderful and intriguing atmosphere including rainy and dark nights punctuated with foggy mornings of the old cobblestone streets. While reading I couldn't help but envision the story in black and white similar to a classic movie. Presented is an alternate side of Barcelona not often seen in other works of fiction or films set in this city. All aspects combine to create an enjoyable book that I highly recommend.
0375751513|5.0|With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now. There are many interesting scenes in the book that make this book very exciting. It is about a man who, upon receiving a portrait of himself, is so upset that it will &quot;mock&quot; him with it's permanent beauty, while he will age and decay. He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.<br />Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read. I did not want to read ANY Romantic novels but I am very happy that I chose this one! And you will be, too!

B00015HVI8|5.0|I tuned in to this show on Showtime when it first aired.  I only paid for Showtime, so I could watch this show.  I quickly dumped Showtime when Stargate SG-1 switched to the Sci-Fi Channel.  <br />As for the episodes - beginning with Season 1, I felt it didn't have the best start with the emphasis on Sam being the female with the overreactive, defensive attitude, but that quickly faded.  The show grew to be one of my favorite shows.  This show just gets better and better, and I love that they pick up on previous story threads.  I was always a big Star Trek NG fan, but the characters' apparent amnesia sometimes after very emotionally charged previous episodes drove me bonkers.  These characters change and are affected by what they go through.  I love the story ideas, but the characters and their interactions really make the show.  <br />Although I was sad to see Daniel Jackson go for Season 6, Jonas Quinn was a great addition.  I wish he could some how have become a regular character (like having him on the Atlantis spin-off, but oh well) when they brought Daniel Jackson back.  My husband prefers Jonas Quinn to Daniel Jackson, but I love both of the characters and was kind of conflicted about Jonas leaving.  <br />Now, when are they going to release Season 7?  I've got to catch my husband up on this show since he didn't start watching until Season 5 was airing, and I want him to be able to have all the background before Stargate: Atlantis airs...
6305696071|3.0|What is it that has enabled Pretty Woman to be renowned as a modern-day fairy tale? Fairy tales usually provide a substantial moral that leave both children and adults with warm and fuzzy feeling inside. Was the moral of Pretty Woman that all it takes is some expensive clothes to confer respectability? In all fairness, Pretty Woman does play upon the idealistic feelings of its viewers. A &quot;rags to riches&quot; story, Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) gets to live out the ultimate fantasy in which she is able to change a man into her own &quot;Prince Charming.&quot; And of course, Edward Lewis (Richard Gere), playing a cold businessman, obliges her. In an instance, Vivian is transformed into the world's most wholesome prostitute (isn't that a double negative?). Never mind that she outrightly states that she'll screw anyone who'll pay. Vivian is &quot;tall, cute and clean&quot; - completely opposite to the sickly-looking hookers you really see on a neighborhood corner nearest you. The cheerful depiction of prostitution in this film is absolutely disgusting, and oh yeah, nothing short of a fairy tale.<BR>   <BR>   In addition, why is the message &quot;the clothes make the man&quot; continually being sent to viewers? This idea may hold true during a job interview, however, the idea is not only demoralizing, but also wins the prize for being most shallow. In the film Trading Places, Eddie Murphy plays a homeless man who not only gains respect through his suit and tie, but also by exuding an intelligent and charismatic style. This is what enables him to successfully fool others in thinking he is a rich businessman. All Vivian manages to promote with her spiffy clothes is the idea that men will forever and always be surveyors and that she is trapped in a panopticon. What a shame...I'm trapped in a male-dominated society where bums get to be businessmen and prostitutes get to be &quot;pretty women.&quot;

B0001RVTXO|4.0|It's pretty much impossible to go wrong with any Pixies songs, but I must say it's imperative to go out and buy the albums, especially Bossanova because it was ridiculously slighted here. I can understand only putting 3 songs from that album on here (although I'd put 7), but I don't understand how they could have picked &quot;Dig for Fire&quot; over &quot;The Happening&quot; (which is far and away the best song of all time, I'd say. Well, maybe not far and away, but you know.) and &quot;Havalina&quot;.  Also, no &quot;River Euphrates&quot; and no &quot;Cactus&quot; from Surfer Rosa.  Still, Pixies songs are Pixies songs, and this is a decent place to start, although any of the middle 3 albums would be just as good to start with (Surfer Rosa, Doolittle, Bossanova).

0800177177|3.0|Dracula. The original version, not any of Anne Rice's fancy ones, nor any of John Carpenter's creepy ones. Just the original that started all of them- Bram Stoker's noble and ancient Dracula. Not truly based on the famous novel of Stoker's, it tells of Dracula's sorrow of his bride that died long ago, and how he is determined to have another woman named Mina as his and only his- despite the fact she is loved by another man, her fiance, who is played by Keanu Reeves- and this man is far than willing to let her go. And Anthony Hopkins, played as Van Helsing, a pure madman in this film that gives the film a twist of humor, will assist Keanu in protecting Mina from the seductive grasp of Count Dracula (although indeed he's only cute when he's in his young mode!)<BR>I'm highly critical of occult films, especially of the vampiric category- but this film actually met my personal satisfaction. Sure, parts of the film were sprinkled with artistic dust from Hollywood- but what book doesn't get this treatment when formed into a novel? The goal is just not to pour too much of the artistic dust on, and I, in my own opinion, think Hollywood did a pretty good job of this in Dracula. They basically gave the essance of the story, and that was Dracula was threatening Mina's life, regardless that they made it more intimate than Bram Stoker truly wanted it to be. We all know how Hollywood is- romantics to the very R. But Hollywood is also sleazy to the very S at times as well. All the nudity was ridiculous; I mean, it makes the movie seem trashy, when truly it is a great and beautiful novel. I think they should have cut that stuff out, or at least have toned it down a bit. <BR>But all in all, I did enjoy the film, and thought Gary Oldman was the absolute perfect vision of Dracula.
B0001FR3I6|3.0|Similar to a Stephen King effort, this rather subpar film concerns a prison psychiatrist who has been falsely accused  of murdering her husband.  It is partly a ghost story as well but overall the dramatic tension is not played out as well as some other films, and I think there are some better films out there.  But as a horror story it's fairly good, since it effectively combines a ghost story with a story of another murder. The best scenes show Halle Berry as the psychiatrist thrashing herself about her cell after she has been thrown in an asylum along with her former patient;she knows she is innocent of the crime of which she has been accused, so this is not the act of a madwoman.She is shown showering with the other inmates in abject humiliation. The scenes showing her trying to escape the asylum occupy many minutes of screentime; when she does, she borrows the attendant's car keys and escapes to her husband's house in a screeching drive across the countryside. When she arrives she has many flashbacks as she attempts to maintain her sanity.
B000001ED1|4.0|I just got this album today mostly because my kids are huge Joan of Arcadia fans and because most of the customer reviews raved about this artist (and rightly so).  It is a great album.  Part way through our first listen, it struck me that Joan Osborne reminded me in some ways of Lucinda Williams.  Fans of Joan Osborne who are unfamiliar with Lucinda Williams might want to give her a try, especially the World Without Tears CD.  Just a thought.

B0001Z53AQ|5.0|Everything Eminem does is good and this cd is no exception.  I am not sure what some of the other reviewers are talking about but I agree.  I like him because his voice is different and not just a deep mumble like most other rappers.  Order this cd!
B00005JLXE|2.0|A friend of mine loaned me his copy of &quot;Daredevil&quot; a little while back, and I was actually quite excited to watch it.  I knew next to nothing about Daredevil, save that he was blind and that his other senses worked extra-well to compensate for that fact ... beyond that, I was totally in the dark.  I had recently come off of seeing a pair of comic book adaptations not too long before trying out this one: the excellent &quot;X2: X-Men United&quot; and the pretty good-but-not-quite-as-much-fun &quot;Hulk&quot;, so I was pretty sure I would enjoy this one too.  I was sadly mistaken.<br />To be fair, this film did have a couple things going for it, though one of them is admittedly entirely subjective.  First off, I was interested immediately by the use of Roman Catholicism in relation to the main character.  To be clear, this both interested me and set me on edge ... while I appreciated seeing a character in a movie have the Faith play a notable role in his life, just as it does with mine, it also set me on edge ... I didn't want the church to be portrayed in the wrong way, as it tends to be in movies that I have seen (not in the fact that the Church is insulted, but that the writers' understanding of the Church is sometimes mistaken on a particular point or attitude, which leads to the Church not being properly represented.  I felt the same way when I saw Nightcrawler praying the rosary in &quot;X2&quot;.  Gladly, I had nothing to worry about from him, and Nightcrawler definitely came out as my favorite character of that film).  I felt the Church itself to be well represented in this film ... Daredevil's actions contrary to her teachings, such as the things he does motivated by revenge, were his own choices.  Good enough for me.<br />There were two more things I liked about this film, which helps to merit it two stars rather than just one.  First, the whole childhood of Matt Murdock/origin story episode of the film was enjoyable.  Second, I have to say that Colin Ferrell stole the show as the villainous Bullseye, hamming it up to a most entertaining degree and becoming a true bright spot amid the mindless chaos which surrounded him.  If he had been the star, I would never have considered the movie to be a perfect one, but it would have still been incredibly fun to watch ... like seeing a movie just about the Kurgan from &quot;Highlander&quot;!  <br />Now that I've got the good things out of the way, let's take a look at the stuff I remembered most: the bad.<br />First off, there's our main characters.  Murdock and Elektra have got to have the worst possible scenes together out of any cinematic couple I've seen in recent history.  Their meeting in the coffee shop or wherever it is is just awful (and he comes off looking like a major creep, if you ask me), and their little fight on the playground was downright embarrassing (made even worse by the awful one-liners they were forced to spout).  Things don't get any better, and there was certainly no sympathy to be found from me when Elektra ... well, let's not spoil it for those who have not yet seen the movie (though I should still tell you not to bother).<br />I was majorly bewildered and frustrated by Murdock's confession scene after he had 'a bit of fun' with Elektra.  It's one thing not to confess something you aren't sorry for, but if you aren't ... well, shouldn't you be telling the priest about that?  I find it truly distressing that he could be such good friends with a priest and so familiar with the Church and all her practices/disciplines/beliefs and not mention or even think twice about that little detail.  If he had been a non-religious character I wouldn't have given this matter a second thought.<br />What else is wrong with this movie?  There's the awful music (I eagerly await the day when the world realizes that rap is cra ... crud and stop subjecting us to it), hearing the phrase &quot;lawyer by day ...&quot; repeated over and over ad nauseum, the incrediblestunts that Daredevil is able to pull off (I actually had to double-check and make sure that he didn't have other superpowers besides his hyperactive senses) ...  If that's really true, I'd like to be able to jump off of buildings the same way he does, and a heck of a lot more.<br />&quot;Daredevil&quot; was a complete waste of time, and has soured me from seeing any more comic book adaptations until the third &quot;X-Men&quot; film comes out in a year or two.  You know it's a bad sign when you find yourself rooting for the bad guy, which we all know will only result in disappointment if we do.  If you haven't seen this yet, give it a miss and do something else, like go to the library or clean your bathroom sink.  You'll have a better time of it, and if you knew what you were missing you would thank me.<br />Carry on Carry on,<br />MN
6305075379|3.0|Who wouldn't watch a movie that had Mel Gibson wearing obscenely tight leather trousers, and looking scarily young?<br />Before The Passion was brought to the attention of film buffs, and the press, there was Lethal Weapon. And before that, Mel Gibson made his name in the Mad Max movies.<br />There's nothing on the DVD I got for my birthday, not even a trailer. And I hate watching DVDs with no trailers. I'm fussy me. So I wasn't sure what to expect, or what the film was exactly about. All I knew was that my mum couldn't wait to watch it, and was drooling (along with me) when Mel Gibson appeared shirtless.<br />Before the amount of money that was spent in the car chase along a freeway in Matrix Reloaded, there was this. A simple, but still effective car chase, which introduces you very briefly to Max. I don't see the point in spending loads of money, when all you need is a bunch of cars that can be trashed, and a camera.<br />Then you get to see that Max has a pretty young wife and a young child. You can almost see how the rest of the movie pans out after that. It's pretty obvious, he's not mad until something really traumatic happens. I was expecting the whole growling, throwing stuff, but instead, he seemed relatively calm - except for the sweat on his face.<br />It's NOT obvious that this movie could get another two sequels out of it. Maybe one sequel, but two? And the latter featuring Tina Turner of all people. And there's rumoured to be a fourth, along with a fourth Die Hard, and god knows what else. Something tells me Mel Gibson won't fit into those trousers!<br />If you think this is going to be a movie based on revenge, you're wrong. The revenge part doesn't start until about half an hour before the end.<br />It will be interesting to see the sequels. To be honest, this film did nothing for me - unless you count the tight trousers! Very easy on the eyes, if you know what I mean.
0345339738|4.0|All around i thought this book was spectacular.  It was a great follow up to the novel The Two Towers.  However, i foung that The Return of the King was much, much more interesting.  Yeah, they explain things in great detail and it takes a long time to read, but it makes the book even more interesting.  <BR>     I have always loved The Lord of the Rings trilogy books, so there is not much to say other than they were all great reads.<BR>I do have to admit that as much as The Return of the King is a great book and has excelent reviews it also is very time consuming. It has big words that for the normal person aren't always easy to understand. Some people can get very bored of a long book when it takes them forever to read even the tiniest of details. All in all, if you have the time and you love to read this is great book for you to give a shot at.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|This Cd is straight bumpin. It's a million times better than their prior album, and tho it't not up to the level of an eminem solo album, very little is. Tracks like American Psycho II and How Come are just off tha chain. Go out and buy this album.
B00009V7OL|5.0|James Cameron is one of the most talented directors out there.  He takes you into these worlds that you never though would be explored or visually realized.  The way he does it is awesome.  The Abyss is no exception, and it follows in the footsteps of Aliens, and The Terminator.  It is filled with Drama, Action, Special Effects, and some awesome thrills.  You feel completely and totally cut off from the world, and you are indulged in the characters that are on screen.  The cinematography is great, and the acting is good.  If you love sci fi- &amp; action see this film.  I highly reccomend this movie for just about anyone.
B0001I55OC|2.0|&quot;Timeline&quot; is like the Amazon discription said good popcorn movie.  I call it great popcorn cheese.  I gave it two stars, but if you are looking at it as a popcorn cheese then it ranks as a 4 star in that genre.<br />Timeline rapidly explains on how they discovered this wormhole.  They are so quick at explaining how this happened I just feel that they couldn't come up with a good idea its like they talked under their breath and just hoped you really didn't hear how lame of a plotline how they discovered the wormhole.<br />This movie just had you laughing at the cheesy lines. This should have been on SciFi Channel Saturday night movie.  Its perfect for that.  Great bad acting (Paul Walker, who makes Vin Diesel look like Christopher Walken) and of course cheese lines after line.  Even a nice cute little ending.  <br />This movie is definitley a rental, but wouldn't waste money on purchasing it.
B00004U8JV|5.0|Most sequels tend to stink and downgrade the first.  This may not be as good as one but it definately is one of the most action packed and hardcore sequels.  I loved the performances, especially Julianne Moore's.  I am also glad you got to explore the Ian Malcom character more.  The special effects improved drastically, but they did not stand out too much from the first.  The movie all in all is one of my must sees.  It is probably one of the best movie sequels out there, see it now.
B000056K04|4.0|In the past year I discovered the artistry of the Dave Matthews Band.  In a torrent of music acquisition, I have acquired nearly all of their albums, none with disappointment.  Upon my virgin listen of 'Everyday' I thought I had found the sour apple in the bunch.  But there were a few tracks that called me back (namely, the ones performed at the spectacular 'Live in Central Park' concert) and I continued listening to 'Everyday.'<br />  I now fully appreciate 'Everyday.'  The style is different from previous DMB albums and it took some adjustment.  The musical prowess is still here, however; the DMB is a creative and artistic entity, not just an entertainment fad.<br />One of my least favorites on the album is the 'The Space Between' single.  Not because it is a bad track - it just doesn't do much for me.  'Sleep to Dream Her' is a fabulous track, demonstrative of the musical talent of the group.  I'm still trying to figure out what the time signature is.<br />'Everyday,' the title track, has a refreshing if subtle African influence.<br />If you celebrate the artistry of the DMB then definitely buy this album and give it time to grow on you.  Then go out and buy 'Live in Central Park' if you don't already own it.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Pearl Harbor, I expected, would be a movie like Titanic.  I knew it would stay away from past efforts to portray the attack on the harbor, and I also knew the film would be different.  The film isn't a masterpiece but I enjoyed watching the portrayal.  At some points in the film is was almost like watching a discovery channel documentary, and you lost sight of the plot.  There were not any horrible performances.  Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, and Cuba Gooding Jr. all did very well.  The movie was a little slow at times.  The attack was the focal point of the film and everything after that was dull.  It is not a failure but definately not a triumph.
B0000062GE|4.0|There's many good songs in this album.  They mix alittle techno with alternative.  I wouldn't call them experimental.  The singer has a good strong voice and the band rocks.  BUT!!!!  The only thing a thought could have been better would be was the singing.  It's nothing original, the singer uses the same tone of voice when he sings the quiet parts in the songs.  he should of used more variation.  But he can still sing out hard.<BR>Yes I would sort of compare them to NIN's but I would not put them on top.  NIN's can easily beat them.  I would GO BUY this cd.  It is worth the money.
6305692572|5.0|No film has shown the damage that alcoholism does to someone in this way.  Nobody thinks that even the houswifes and the soccer moms could be effected.  The alcoholic in this movie is played by the awesomely talented Meg Ryan, who should've been nominated for her role as the depressed alcoholic mom, Alice.  Andy Garcia is also a good choice to play the troubled husband.  The movie is very depressing but has a silver lining.  Everyone should see this movie at one time or another, it will change your view on this disease.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|I'm not sure how to rate this movie.  My school asked us all to watch it and only if our parents objected were we not compelled.  I watched it and it was months before I had another good night's sleep.  At the time, and perhaps today, this was the scariest movie I had ever seen.  More than the normal gorefest, this seemed like something that could happen at any minute.<br />I have not seen the movie since 1983 but it has stayed with me.  The memory of what happened to all of these people.  Jason Robards in particular.  It's important to see.  To see the fragility of man and to strengthen ones resolve that this never happen.  No one is a winner in this kind of situation.<br />Not good for young children.
0790737345|5.0|This film is soooo good.  It makes you look at life in a whole other perspective.  The performances in this film are phenomenal.  Nicholas Cage, Meg Ryan, that dude from NYPD Blue, and the whole rest of the cast played fantastic roles.  The story is both gripping and moving, and the script is awesome.  The way the movie changes you is very spiritual.  The cinematography, though subtle, is good.  The score and the soundtrack is one of the most mournfull I have ever heard.  Everything about this movie is surreal.  See it.  I highly reccomend this movie.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Does anyone truly remember the golden age of cinema anymore? It was the era when the screen was lit up with lavish epic-dramas set against ancient backdrops such as Greece or Rome, where the likes of Kirk Douglas and Charlton Heston fully controlled the attention of movie-going audiences across the country for three-plus hours, and when going to the movies cost you under a dollar (and that was including popcorn and soda-pop). Well it seems the studio executives in Hollywood are becoming quite nostalgic as they are willing to take a risk and return motion pictures back to the genre that many thought was dead long ago. And it was Gladiator, a film that contained what many thought was a washed-up director and no-name leading man, that resurrected the \\"ancient\\" genre thanks to its nearly $200 million domestic haul, massive DVD release, and its five Academy Awards wins including Best Picture. Now Hollywood is going all out in, what they hope will be, the new golden age of cinema complete with lavish three hour epic-dramas, gladiatorial and militant battle sequences, and overly-oiled up leading men ... if only they could be convinced to bring back old ticket prices, only then would we be truly satisfied but perhaps that is asking too much too soon.<br />The story center on a man who was once in the service of a vast ancient empire commanding troops in grand feats of battle but now serves merely as entertainment in the gladiatorial events fighting for his life. Maximus Decimus Meridius was one of the greatest generals the Roman Empire had ever seen in that he courageously fought in battle, won the field when he was commanded to do so, and retained the loyalty and devotion of his troops. Here was a man truly a rare sight in the area of leadership, one that could, if given the opportunity to, lead Rome back to its former glory as a republic and not an empire. That is what the current emperor, Marcus Aurelius, sees in him and why he choose Maximus over his son Commodus to take control of Rome when he dies. Unfortunately Commodus suffocates his father before the announcement can be made public and orders Maximus to be secretly done away with. After escaping from his captors and returning home to find his wife and son crucified, he is taken by slave traders and made into a gladiator meant to kill other slaves for the enjoyment of the veracious crowds. When he is entered in the gladiatorial games in Rome, he sets out to enact his revenge on Commudus, either in this life or the next, all the in the effort of seeking retribution for the deaths of his innocent family. The story for Gladiator, though marred with numerous historical inaccuracies, is quite honestly one of the most entertaining and visually engaging epic-dramas in years. Though it is not the most original story line one could come up with (it borrows heavily from Hamlet and other Shakespearian plays), the plot does manage to keep the audience's attention even against a lengthy two hour and forty minute running time.<br />Gladiator is one of the rare shining example for the rest of Hollywood ... a $100 million budgeted epic does not need tremendously famous leading men and women to be successful as long as the cast members that are used in the film are suited to their roles and work cohesively well together on screen, which this film demonstrates in spades. The role of Maximus Decimus Meridius is quite possibly Russell Crowe's most commanding performance to date, with the only exception being his role as Captain Jack Aubrey in the naval drama, Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World. He successfully transitions his character from a dynamic general in the beginning of the film to a barbaric gladiator by the mid-way point of the film, and yet at the same time he maintains some of those leadership qualities that made the character so enduring to begin with. Another relatively unknown, at the time of this film's release, actor who manages to light up the screen was Joaquin Phoenix with his exuberant and often disturbing performance as the Emperor Commodus. The character is so overly emotional, viciously conniving, and eerily mysterious that one can't help but have extreme hatred for him from the moment you first see on screen. Phoenix does a tremendous job at emotionally setting a character that you are meant to hate, which only fuels already fervent enthusiasm for Maximus as he progresses through the film. Possibly the only slightly famous name on the list of cast members belongs to the late veteran actor, Richard Harris, though the only people who may have really recognized his name would have been film enthusiasts and fans of his work. Harris presents a character that, although he is the emperor of a vast empire, is frail and grandfather-like in manner and actions, which makes his death scene all the more excruciating to watch. And praise must also be given to Connie Nielsen, the only woman of the cast, who showcases a strong and caring woman trapped between the wishes of her dead father, the brutality of her powerful brother, and her enduring love for Maximus. It is not till the final sequence of the film till we see her fully come into her own and present it a way that is eloquent and yet commanding at the same time.<br />Overall, Gladiator successfully resurrects the once dead epic genre albeit more sanguineous, vicious and gut-wrenching then its golden age predecessors. Visually, and emotionally, this film is nearly perfect with Ridley Scott's direction taking the ancient world of Rome and presenting to the movie-going audience that is neither overwhelming nor is it trivial to their view of the story at hand in this film. The only major complaint that can be made about this film is its constant lack of respect, or reverence, to historical events and characters involved in the plot of the film. One can say that this is an action-drama that is not meant to be played out for historical purposes but the fact that it deliberately takes historical figures and twists their lives to make them more interesting for the overall plot of the film should be disturbing to many educators, though, it must be clearly noted, that this is hardly the first, nor last, time Hollywood is guilty of such a crime. But taking the film, despite all of that, for what it is, Gladiator is one of the most enthralling and emotionally compelling dramas of 2000, though not at quite the level of being the best picture of the year.
6305696071|4.0|Pretty Woman starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere is a romantic movie about a young woman, Vivian, who is a hooker for a living and one day stumbles upon Edward, a handsome and successful businessman. He needs to get to a certain destination and she gets him there in his beautiful sports car which he can hardly maneuver himself.  Although their romance starts as an accidental meeting, after spending a short time with her he falls for her.  He lets her remain in his hotel for a couple of days and attempts to transform her because he sees all the potential she has.  Initially he falls for her because of her physical beauty, like most men do.  They survey the women in front of them and decide who they will be with.  As the days go by he tries to change the way she dresses in order for her to look more ladylike and so that she could fit the role of an ideal woman with not only her physical beauty but her attire as well.  He tries to make her look as though she is from the high society by allowing her to shop at Beverly Hills with his credit cards of course.  He clearly displays a stereotype of men which is that they feel that they need to take care of their women and keep them looking beautiful as though they were objects because the woman that they are with reflect somewhat how they will be seen by others.<BR>Although Vivian has a job that is not seen as commendable, she is independent.  She pays for her rent and supports herself alone.  The arrival of Richard in her life changes that. He offers her luxuries she has never seen and she takes them.  She transforms herself to fit the image of a woman he would fall in love with, which he does, but not solely because she changed her appearance but because he saw her charm right from the start.  Although this movie seems to be a typical boy meets girl, boy falls for girl because she is beautiful it is not.  It's a sweet, captivating story that displays that two people from two different worlds with different economic backgrounds and views on the world can fall for eachother.  However, it is not realistic that a woman struggling as she was would suddenly meet Price Charming.

0790729369|5.0|As a house wife in the middle of nowhere, Francesca was not surveyed by anybody, which made her just work hard for her family and farm. Her less self-consciousness can be easily explained why. She represents the stereotype of white country woman who is not treated as a woman but a mother, wife and a co-worker; however Robert Kincaid made her realize that she is a woman still. The middle-aged woman who is getting less objectified often becomes a theme of movies, and this movie is one of those. <br />Francesca is not as objectified in this movie as the women in the other movies. She is more natural looking peaceful middle-aged woman; however, she seems to be unsatisfied with her normal life and hiding her passion under her quietude life but Robert easily reveals her original character. <BR>This movie was a shocking because Robert reveals Francescafs passion. The stereotypical image of a country woman that is faithful to her family, and she never even thought about cheating on her husband. However, this movie collapses this stereotypical image of a country woman by Francesca cheats on her husband. Yet, we can see stereotypical conservative side of Francesca by knowing that she does not tell all about her story until she dies.

B00008G9JN|5.0|If you are a Tull fan, or just a music fan in general, it doesn't get much better than Songs from the Wood. Jethro Tull are in the prime here and present what is basically an acoustic album that is just beautifully written and performed. If you enjoy stripped down, acoustic music there is no other album needed. I won't even bother reviewing each song because each one is fantastic in it's own way. Even if all you have is just a passing interest in Tull, or only know the band because of Aqualung, pick this disk up. After one listen you will understand why there are still legions of Tull fans after 4 decades!! This is one of the best Tull albums, and interesting I always thought Songs from the Woods had a wintery or holiday feel, and it was nice to see a couple songs recently included on Tull's A Christmas Album. Finally, this has nothing to do with Songs from the Woods, but after listening to that album I decided to pull out a newer Tull album and give it a listen. I just finished listening to Roots to Branches, and was going to review it as well, but I cannot find it listed here??? Amazon has like 30 different versions of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;Aqualung&quot; individually listed, but no Roots to Branches? Does anyone know why this Tull record is MIA?
B00009RGBS|5.0|This movie had every right to the best oscar award when it won it in 2003.  Besides Zellweger, every person in this cast gave the performance of their life.  Zeta-Jones overpowered in this to prove her magnificent voice, and Gere was surprising good as well.  Even the smaller roles of Latifya and Reilley gave a powerful perfomance to really prove their stuff.  Anyone who says that Moulon Rouge was a better movie has very bitter taste and must have fallen asleep in both or are deaf.  Rouge was a horrible movie with weak acting, while Chicago was the easily the best musical in the last couple decades.
B0001US8FI|5.0|Enter The Dragon is simply the greatest martial arts movie ever made with the greatest martial artist to ever live.  The man who started it all and set a standard that has yet to be topped after 31 years. The man I speak of is none other than the one and only Bruce Lee. With his charismatic personality and superhuman skill, Lee is such an amazement to watch. No wirework, no camera tricks, no CGI, just phenomenal natural martial arts talent. What also makes this 2 disc DVD a gem is that you not only get Enter the Dragon, but also the Warrior's Journey documentary with the lost footage of Game of Death in which Lee, in my opinion, does his best fighting. If you are a fan of martial arts films in any way then do yourself a favor and get this DVD. You cannot go wrong here. Bruce Lee is a true legend who was way ahead of his time and died far too young. However although he may have died young, he still managed to change the world of martial arts and cinema forever.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|It was very difficult fir me to actually watch this movie the entire way through.  I saw this and ahted it, but when Chicago came out i thought it was one of the best musicals of the time.  Here the acting was fairly weak and the plot was just boring.  If you want to see a musical, go get Chicago, not this trash.

B0001I55OC|4.0|Rating<br />1 star = abysmal, run & hide<br />2 star = poor<br />3 star = good, worth the effort<br />4 star = very good<br />5 star = great, must own<br />=============================================<br /><br />This is an entertaining, action-packed, good movie.<br />No it's not epic like Lord of the Rings, but it's not meant to be.<br /><br />If you are going to compare it to the book then just forget watching this because you will be disappointed if comparing. If you watch this movie and like it, then consider reading the book. Get the book, its awesome!<br /><br />Back to the movie review:<br />1) Action sequences were pretty good. The brief scenes showing the siege of La Roche was an interesting glimpse into medieval warfare<br /><br />2) The movie feels like a 3+ hr movie crammed into just 2hrs. This worked for some things (kept the action going and gave a sense of trying to fly through the pages of the book because I couldn't wait to see what happened next) but for other things (characterization and plot) it left something to be desired<br /><br />3) I liked seeing Paul Walker in something different than Fast & Furious. He seemed relaxed and not trying too hard. A likeable character.<br /><br />4) This is a movie...they forget the science and leave a lot of questions. They found a wormhole. How? Who cares. Deal with it. Read Crichton's PREY and you'll appreciate the brevity of this story's explanation.<br /><br />5) My wife who was totally ignorant to the book or the movie or Paul Walker thought it was a good watch. We popped the popcorn and enjoyed the continuing downward spiral of situations for the characters.<br /><br />6) The end was VERY rushed. One second survivors are patting each other on the back and the next frame time has passed and there is some dialogue and the movie is over.<br /><br />OVERALL: If you can keep and open mind and watch it for what it is, you should have fun and enjoy a very good movie. Hopefully you'll want to read the book afterward and realize it is a GREAT book.rward and realize it is a GREAT book.
0399208534|4.0|Through no fault of its own, this book is perhaps best known these days as the story President George W. Bush named as his \\"favorite book\\".  Ignoring the fact that the Mr. Bush was born in 1946 and the book was published originally in 1969, it's a good idea to reexamine \\"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\\" on the basis of its own merits.  It is the best known Eric Carle book by far and has remained a beloved text since the day it was conceived and published.<br /><br />Here's the plot, inasmuch as there is one.  A caterpillar (make that a very HUNGRY caterpillar) proceeds to eat his way through an amazing and amusing assortment of fruits, sweets, and (in time) leaves.  After becoming quite a fat little fellow, the caterpillar makes a cocoon for himself and eventually emerges as a splendiferous butterfly.  The end.<br /><br />I'm going to ignore the fact that as a child I found this book a bit repetitive.  We are told that children like to hear repeated phrases in books, and perhaps this is true.  From what I can recall, however, this book bugged me with its continually repeated, \\"but he was still hungry\\"s.  Looking at it now, though, it is a lovely little work.  The caterpillar has far more expressions on his face than I initially remembered.  When he's searching for food he has a somewhat bewildered look in his eyes.  When he's eaten an amusingly large assortment of foods his eyes droop as he attempts to live through his own stomachache.  Oddly, the time he looks the most distressed is after he has turned into a beautiful butterfly.  Now his face is contorted in such a way that his drooping eyes and open mouth make him look as if he is crooning a sentimental sad ballad to the viewer.<br /><br />To be frank, I'm not the biggest Carle fan in the world.  But he really was one of the forefathers of the collage picture book.  And though I might prefer some of his later book to the caterpillar, there's no denying that the book has had the kind of staying power most authors only dream of.  So by all means pull up a chair and take a gander at the very hungry caterpillar.  It's a nice tale that amuses and entertains even as it helps children to count.dream of.

B000008M1P|4.0|Before I got into punk music in high school, I was rabidly a big pop metal fan during my freshman and early sophomore high school years. Vixen was my favorite band at the time. At the time I was more than impressed that it was possible for a group of women to form their own rock band just like the boys. Looking back now, I have to laugh at how cheesy Vixen were but at the time I thought their music was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Their music was undeniably catchy. I forgot how I was introduced to the band but I am more than sure that it was through the first single &quot;Edge of a Broken Heart&quot;. Never got to see the band live which I am rather disappointed about. Some of the music on the album is unbelievably cheesy like &quot;I Want You to Rock Me&quot;  and &quot;One Night Alone&quot; but they were catchy as heck. Granted the band really didn't write most of the songs on their debut album, I didn't care at the time. My favorite songs (and they still are) are &quot;American Dream&quot;, &quot;Waiting&quot;, and &quot;One Night Alone&quot; (as cheesy as that song might be). They are so catchy I can't help but sing alone to the songs. Vixen may not have been as hard as L7 or Babes in Toyland but they deserve their spot in rock music. They proved to a lot of people that rock music isn't a gender thing.
0689504764|5.0|Glancing at the cover of Michael Rosen and Helen Oxenbury's, \\"We're Going On a Bear Hunt\\", I thought something along the lines of, \\"Hrmph. I bet they watered it down and made it syrupy.  There's no way this kind of kid's book (in which a father and his four children of different hair colors go hunting for a bear) is going to actually end with the family finding the bear and getting chased back to their house\\".  Well, you can just color me wrong all over.  Not only is the book faithful to the original song, but it's a hoot to boot.  The words are those old familiar ones we all love so well, and the pictures are a high-stepping romp complete with adventure, daring, and danger.  Everything, in fact, that a good picture book could hope to be.<br />If you've ever heard the song \\"We're Going On a Bear Hunt\\" then you know the way the story goes.  A father and his rambunctious youngsters are setting out to locate one bear.  They're not actually on a hunt in terms of carrying guns or anything of that sort.  In fact, these people haven't anything with them but one another and the clothes on their backs.  With their border collie along with they successfully cross the tall wavy grass (swishy swashy), ford the deep cold river (splash splosh), tromp through the ooey-gooey mud (squelch squerch), wander through the deep dark forest (stumble trip!),  run through a whirling snowstorm (Hoooo woooo), and at last enter a deep dark cave (tiptoe).  It's the dog that sees the malicious bear first and the brave troop run back over every place they'd been before to escape.  In a moment of frenzied activity they enter their house only to discover that they've forgotten to shut the door.  At the last minute they get it closed (angry bear safely outside now) and everyone crawls into bed and under the covers.  The final shot in the book is one of the bear as he tromps solemly homeward again.<br />This is quite an exciting book.  Author Michael Rosen has captured the enjoyable sounds of the story quite well, and the high tension towards the end is just delightfully scary enough for the youngsters.  But it is illustrator Helen Oxenbury that really lets this puppy shine.  She has the ability to create scenes in which characters are interacting with one another against huge evocative backgrounds.  I'm very partial to a scene in which the family is joyfully running through the tall grasses, dotted occasionally with deep red poppies.  The sky is a blue one, filled with light puffy clouds and in the distance a flock of birds travels up and away.  Admittedly, I love a good pastoral illustration, but this kind of care for illustrations is visible in all Oxenbury's color pictures (each appearing on every other page).  If you're at all familiar with Helen Oxenbury then you'll find numerous scenes in this story that remind you of her other books.  The baby found here looks like nothing so much as a clothed version of the infant in, \\"Big Mama Makes the World\\".  The muddy squelchy vista in another picture is reminiscent of the barnyard takeover attempt in, \\"Farmer Duck\\".  She knows how to pick `em, Helen Oxenbury does.<br />Will kids be scared by a family chased by a bear?  Pleasantly so, I believe.  The shot of the bear walking home is enough to convince even the worry-wartiest of children that the family is not going to be eaten in the near future.  All in all, this is just another one of those great picture books that fill the world.  It reads aloud very well, so if you need a book to present to a large group, I've found the perfect match for you.  If you like high adventure and a good tale, \\"We're Going on a Bear Hunt\\" delivers both in spades.

B000003TA4|5.0|3 words...&quot;A MUST BUY&quot;. Get this album if you're new to Nirvana. Dont listen to ppl who also reviewed that this album sucks. They dont know nothing about good music. They are just posers. anyways, dont let this album go.....its worth every penny. you wont be disapointed !
B000089RVX|5.0|I LOVE Evanescence, their songs are AMAZING!!  The group is hot!! Words can't describe how much I like this CD, if you haven't heard much from Evanescence I suggest you sample some of their music (tip: don't purchase any music/dvds until you've sampled it). I highly recommend buying this album, &quot;Haunted&quot; is the BEST song on the CD!
B000063DFN|5.0|Powerslave was another massive hit after Iron Maiden's 1983 album &quot;Piece of mind&quot;, but i liked Piece of mind better than powerslave. But dont get me wrong here..i love powerslave but i like piece of mind better. Put this in ur collection if ur a big Maiden fan. The songs are pretty awesome and Bruce's voice sounds better than ever.
B000099T2L|3.0|I think Beyonce's &quot;Dangerously In Love&quot; was pretty good for a first try. I think that she should have sang more upbeat songs, the only fast songs she has are &quot;Crazy In Love&quot;, &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot; the rest of the CD was just a bunch of slow songs, I do believe that her CD was WAAAAAY overrated, I do believe that she should have had more vocal lessons before releasing this CD because she did scream alot and she did drag some of the notes, but overall I think it was pretty good.  I really hope her second CD is alot better though.
B0000035E7|5.0|If ur a big fan of Nirvana then buying this album is a no brainer. This album truly gives out the real feeling of how a recording should be. It feels raw and upbeat. Buy the album &quot;NEVERMIND&quot; first if u are new to Nirvana.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I personally think this CD is AMAZING!  She's very talented, although I do like her last album better this one is still great and really shows off her vocal abilities, I think that if your into modern day soul music then you'd like her CD, my personal favorite song on this album is &quot;Karma&quot;.
B00000DFSK|5.0|I like the idea of putting most of the good songs in about a decade and put them in one greatest hits album. But i would recommend someone to get &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; first. But u should also put this greatest hits album in ur collection as well.
0811826848|5.0|This book transcends its overt purpose of being an anthology of the Beatles.<br />Anyone who loves the music the Beatles gave us will find much rewarding material here. Those who want to know about how success can be accomplished in popular music will be riveted. Those who like to look back on popular culture in times past will have a happy trip. If you just love exciting photography, there is much to attract you to this volume. I found myself singing the Beatles' songs to myself as I read the text and looked at the illustrations. That was the best part!<br />To me, the most thought-provoking part of this book was its rags-to-genius quality. The Beatles were unlikely candidates to become leading musical innovators. Most of them were so poor that their families lacked indoor bathrooms when they were growing up. None of them could read music. The combined number of music lessons they had was less than ten in total. They could not afford musical instruments. Their families could not afford to subsidize their careers. Yet they were observant about the new, in contact with what moved their hearts, listened intently for better music, and worked with a never-ending frenzy to fulfill their passion for the music. It's vastly more heartwarming and fascinating than any rags-to-riches story ever can be.<br />I had never understood John Lennon's complaints about the &quot;packaged, predictable&quot; Beatles until I read in this book about the type of band they were while evolving their style. Particularly in the Hamburg gigs, they were more like a jazz combo that played rock and roll. The music was free form, and they stretched some songs into being as long as an hour and a half.<br />In fact, their commercial success was a tremendous tragedy for their artistic success because they were probably at the edge of developing a whole new musical genre that would have become the dominant one today. I'm sorry it never happened. I feel even more sorry for them, in realizing that they knew what they lost and must feel it very deeply.<br />I was also moved by the story of their tempestuous friendship. These guys went through tremendous stresses, strains, and deprivations together. They fought, they disagreed, they slugged each other, and they appreciated each other. Yet, there was a strong enough pull towards each other that allowed the group to continue through its amazing journey, despite the difficulties. To have had such friendships, even if they are eventually lost, must be an amazing experience. Few will know this closeness in their lives.<br />I came away from this book with a new appreciation for the Beatles. Before this book, the Beatles were all about (for me) how they sounded and looked, and how I reacted to that. Now, I see them as being role models for important aspects of human experience that we should all appreciate.<br />Before closing, I do have two words of caution. This book is very open about the major and minor vices of life. As such, this book could make the wrong impression on adolescents. They don't need too many new ideas about how to rebel, and this book could be read that way. That's not what the Beatles were doing, but a 13 year old could see it that way.<br />Second, as revealing as the book is, more is ultimately still hidden below the surface than is revealed. These young men knew a lot of pain, and that pain was an important source of their brilliance. Don't be offended that they did not share more. It was probably very painful to share as much as they did.<br />I would like to give the editors major credit for developing a successful dialogue style in the book that included quotes from John Lennon. It must have been the dickens to read through all of his many quotes, and to weave them into material comparable to what can be developed in a simple interview where the others could be aware of what each other said.<br />&quot;Take a sad song, and make it better.&quot;ew what they lost and must feel it very deeply.<br />I was also moved by the story of their tempestuous friendship.

B0001GL3K4|1.0|Insipid, unromantic, implausable are the mildest terms to describe this utterly uninspired piece of dreck. Leaving matters of the heart, emotional honesty and intimacy to the British is tantamount to relying on the Germans to pump out comedies. The movie is painful to watch. They have dragged every name UK actor out of a deep coma to sleepwalk through their roles.  If this is the best Britain has to offer then please, don't bother. The inane political subplot is so insulting and simplistic it is a wonder that adults wrote this garbage.
B00006FDCD|1.0|Dont waste your money on this DVD. This is the worst movie ever, its three hours long. During the movie, I strongly considered ending my life. And ending the lives of those around me. I dont know if I Can really put how bad this movie was in prespective. The movie has no real plot, its boring, TERRIBLE ACTING, terrible story, its the worst movie ever. Stephen King should be shot for making such a terrible movie.
1592400876|4.0|WOW!  Now I understand the frustrations my previous English teachers felt trying to make me understand the importance of punctuation!  This book is a humorous take on what all of us should have learned in high school but were unwilling to accept.  Punctuation is everywhere, but proper punctuation is not!

B0000024YL|5.0|I have been listening to Simon and Garfunkel for 35 years.  Since I was a child, I have respected their melodies and the gentleness and humanity that flows through their songs. <br />&quot;Homeward Bound&quot; and &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; are truly originals.  <br />I know I will have a life long love for these very special artists!
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Little Queen of Spades and Kind Hearted Woman show why Clapton is a master of the slow blues. Several of the other arrangements show a strength that other people miss when they discuss Clapton; his talent at reinterpreting selected old blues songs. Some examples for you check out; &quot;Goin Down Slow&quot; from Pilgrim; &quot;I'm So Glad&quot; from Fresh Cream; &quot;I Can't Hold Out&quot; from 461 Ocean Blvd.; &quot;Everybody Ought To Make A Change&quot; from Money and Cigarettes. I find these more compelling than blues players who try and overtly copy. I like the idea of finding something new/a new way of hearing a lyric or chord progression rather than copying someone else-it can't be done anyway. This keeps the whole thing alive. I love blues but have no patience with blues bands that ape a particular genre. Clapton realizes this and Me and Mr. Johnson is more interesting because it isn't a recreation of the original recordings. If you saw the Scorsese Blues documentary on PBS recently dealing with Skip James, there were interpretations of that music by contemporary musicians. Some worked better than others but the attempts were more interesting and surprising than having someone ape Skip James (not that anyone could actually do that). Clapton threw his lot in with this aesthetic a long time ago (&quot;Blues Ancient And Modern&quot; I think he called it in the early days of Cream) and this is why he had to move beyond John Mayall and why he's been changing and experimenting for the last 35 years. Lets hope he continues to do so. In any case, as an artist he's free to do what he wants and you are free to like it or not.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah is truly an original.  <br />She sings from her heart, and not with the pre-packaged sound of some many musical acts nowadays.   Her lyrics are easy to listen to and absorb and one can imagine what she is talking about. She is talking about real life.  &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; the title track is a gem. <br />I will purchase her next CD for sure.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|&quot;Big Fish&quot; has to be one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  It is well acted, looks beautiful, and is very heartwarming.<br />The cast in the movie is just perfect.  Everyone in the body embodies their roles and there are all perfect for the part.  They all convey the right sincertity so that the story is believable.<br />Also, the movie is stunningly and artistically beautiful.  It is full of vibrant colours that make the move a treat to watch.  There are many scenes in the movie that are so beautiful that it nearly reduced me to tears.  The scenes in Spector and at the circus are exceptionally impressive.  The best scene in the whole film is when time stops in the circus tent.  Everything except for Ewan McGregor is perfectly frozen makign for an artistic treat of a scene.<br />Finally, the movie just makes you feel good.  It is about the true meaning of love and subscribes to the idea that people really do have a solemate.  Edward Bloom is a great character and it is fun trying to figure out what parts of his story are real and what parts are not.  Although the end of the movie is a little bizarre, it still leaves you feeling good because finally, everything fits.
B00003CWL5|4.0|American Beauty is an interesting film.  It critiques the stereotypes we Americans have of what is beautiful and what isn't.  \\"Plain Jane\\" becomes the one seen as the true beauty, and the typical, gorgeous, blonde-haired, blue-eyed Angela is put in her place.  I enjoyed the window scene when Ricky focused his camera on the reflection of Jane instead of Angela flaunting herself.  This scene really made this theme resonate.<BR>I liked Jane's character much more than Angela's.  However, both of them define themselves by what men say.  For Jane, Ricky was the one who made her feel like a woman.  I wish that she could have had self-esteem on her own instead of needing a guy to give it to her.  However, most of us women have the same issue, so it is realistic.  I think we all know that Angela relied way too heavily on the opinions of the men around her to define herself as feminine.  The biggest example is the scene at the end when Lester finally treats her as more than a sex object.  She is taught by him to accept herself and like herself for more than her looks.
B0001ENYKS|4.0|It's excellent to see a band like Franz Ferdinand break onto the scene when most other bands are either mind-blowingly depressing or all too untalented. Franz Ferdinand seems to be, on the surface, a mix between Interpol and The Strokes, with some 80s nostalgia thrown in. The lyrics are unenlightening, but this record isn't about songwriting prowess--it's full of great melodies and riffs that make this LP addictive. The 2nd and 3rd tracks, &quot;Tell Her Tonight&quot; and &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, are definitely the highlight, although the inclusion of obscure and nonsensical German in &quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot; is a good laugh: Ich heie Superphantastisch / Ich trinke Schampus und Lachsfisch = &quot;My name is superfantastic, I drink champagne and salmon.&quot;
6305364648|4.0|As an action movie, I really enjoyed True Lies.  It has a lot of funny scenes in it that I truly liked.  However, I did not feel that way about the way Helen was depicted throughout.  She starts out as the hum-drum housewife--completely de-sexualized, and thus completely unfulfilled as a person.  It is only when she puts on some lipstick and tears the dress apart that she starts to feel excited about her life--as we can tell by the way she dances.  I feel like the movie is furthering stereotypes of boring housewives this way.  It's as though the message is to break out of line, get sexy-looking, and only then will you enjoy life.  It's clear that Helen comes to define herself by what men (i.e. Harry) see in her, because the last we see of her is the ballroom scene in a gown slit up almost to her hip putting lipstick on again.  Yes, Helen becomes comfortable with her sexuality.  This can be a good thing, but it is shown as the only avenue towards self-fulfillment.  <BR>Other than that, I did enjoy the humor of this movie.  So, if you can make yourself aware of the way that femininity is depicted throughout, then I'd say to go ahead and watch it.  Otherwise, caveat emptor.
0844663662|5.0|Slaughter House-Five is a captivating novel of Billy Pilgrim and the jounrey through his life. One of Kurt Vonnegut's best works. He combines humor, science fiction, and one of the world's greatest anti- war books in to one. When Billy Pilgrim, a weak and mostley quiet man,  becomes &quot;unkstuck&quot; in time after being captured by aleins, you travel through his life. From his terrible World War II experience (inspired by Vonnegut's own war experience), including the tragic bombing of Dresden to the planet of Tralfamadore  where Billy and the reader are introduced to a whole new concept of time and death. The reader journeys simultaneously through all phases of Billy's life which is centered on the war and the effects of the war. Constently the reader is torn between reality and fantasy and questions the sanity of Billy Pilgrim. This is a complex novel , basically without following a story line or a conventioal flow of characters. Through out this book Vonnegut makes you laugh, cry, and most importantly think. By the end of the novel the reader is captivavted and stunned by the brutality and horrors of war and questions our own fractured society. Slaughter House-Five is one of the best  peices  of American literature and I recomend it to anyone.
B000000OAN|5.0|You've got your &quot;IV&quot;'s, &quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot;'s, &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;'s, &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;'s, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;'s, the list perpetually continues.<br />All of which are wonderful, but stalwart fans refuse to acknowledge that most GREAT bands evolved with even better music following their eternally labeled &quot;classic&quot; album. With &quot;A Night at the Opera,&quot; Queen did both; they made a PERFECT album and made even more perfect music as their tragically doomed career marched on to the day of sadness in 1991.<br />If ever there is an album worthy of putting on headphones and clearing your mind of the rest of the world while meditating to an album, surely this is the one. The leadoff song &quot;Death On Two Legs&quot; is perfect, with tasteful piano work, as is the next &quot;Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon.&quot; There's so much going on in so little time! At this point, you know exactly how to expect the rest of the album: there is no way you can expect anything. The successful diversity of this band is unmatched to this day. The witty personality of Mercury is splotched everywhere, taking an already-greater-than-ordinary-song and putting something to it that is just .... ah, who needs words.<br />It always helps when there's no filler on an album, and every track stands on its own. This is one of the strongest start to finish albums ever made. The grade-A musicianship and quality diversity only make the jaw drop more as you hear such unique compositions as &quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot;, &quot;The Prophet's Song&quot;, and &quot;Good Company.&quot;<br />Then you've got the simple stuff. And only Queen knows how to put an unspeakable magic and emotion into songs with 3 (or in Queen's case 6) chords. Such songs include '39, the compound metered &quot;Sweet Lady,&quot; and wellknown hit &quot;You're My Best Friend.&quot; Even the mandatory insertion of Roger (&quot;I'm in Love with my Car&quot;) is remarkably wellsuited for the occasion.<br />Finally you've got the songs written by God and given to Queen, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; and &quot;Love of My Life.&quot; Enough's been shoved in people's faces about those tunes, so you probably don't need any further commentary. The works of a genius.<br />A good album 1) doesn't only thrive from its singles, 2) has the creme de la creme of both artistry and emotion, 3) has a wealth of diversity, 4) lacks filler, and 5) flows perfectly start to finish, without even being a concept album. Again, this album passes the test on all accounts.<br />If you are an American and think you like music AND don't have the majority of Queen's albums (PARTICULARLY this one and Innuendo) then you should be mildly ashamed of youself. Queen never got the appreciation from America that they deserve, people knowing only &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; and &quot;Those Sports Songs.&quot; Ugh.<br />But it makes sense I guess. I'm an American, but devote lots of time to everything I do. Many prefer the quick fix, and avoid Queen/prog/classical music because it demands to much of the listener. Queen is the perfect place to start for those looking for substance in music. Indeed, Freddie pretty much throws it at you and you can't help but &quot;get it&quot; when Queen performs.<br />Get it.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|When The Matrix Reloaded first came out I really didn't like it. However, now that I've seen it on DVD a few times, I can honestly say I like it a lot better. It still feels like half a film, the action sequences still seem kind of pointless, and it lacks the punch and innovation of the original - but as long as you're prepared and know where everything is leading and how this chapter in the Matrix saga ends, it all seems to flow and overall work a lot better than it really should. The thought puzzles surrounding &quot;choice&quot; and &quot;free will&quot; are still good for a ponder, even if they haven't been as nicely integrated as the philosphy in the original. It also helps to have seen The Matrix Revolutions, which should really be viewed as one combined film with Reloaded.<br />Normally I give DVDs another star if the extras add value to the overall package, but there's not that much extra stuff here. You get the funny MTV awards spoof and a good documentary on the freeway chase, but everything else feels promotional. There's also something funny about the audio-mixing too; music is cranked up while speech is softer than it should be. Overall it's a competent DVD, but there's supposed to be a much better box set coming soon. As for the movie, it's still flawed but gets better with repeat viewings.
B000002OMN|5.0|That point may very well be different for everyone. But this album will help you find it. Lost? Depressed? Suicidal? Searching? Confused? Anything other than feeling alive and at peace? That may sound like an antidepressant commercial, but I'm just prepping you for one of the greatest albums ever made - as Meat Loaf is certainly no more subtle.<br />This album, every time I put it on, gives me a wake-up call. Meat Loaf/Jim Steinman's music is so emotional, so human, so real, artistic, accessible - this album is where everything came together (again!) and reminded a few million people why music is so important in one's life. I think the most important purpose about music is that it makes a person feel. It moves you. And very few things out there are more intense than this. Warning: this album is not for the casual fan of bland music. Not everyone deserves these songs. But if you think you are human, you may just pass the test.<br />I'm not going to waste any more than this lone sentance to utter what a shame it is that some call this music cheesy, campy, pompous, etc. - give us a break. This album is one of the best ever made. There's so much to say, it's probably doing more justice to analyze minimally here. Even nostalgic people from the first Bat Out of Hell era love this album - and THAT's a rare thing indeed, to have an album that easily rivals another classic from its own lineage-and by the same fans.<br />These songs address life. There's not a weak spot on the album, and not a wasted minute. I saw an interview once where Meat was asked to respond to the criticism of his songs being so long. With impeccable retort, he reasoned that none of these songs are as long as life itself. How dare anyone scorn repitition, given that probably any of these offenders' own music choices contain drum loops or samples repeated 500 times? Bat II is in your face, passionately dramatic, and far more gutwrenchingly moving than even any movie could ever hope to accomplish. If youare questioning why so many people consider Rock and Roll a religion, this album will make you believe. Listen to &quot;Everything Louder than Everything Else:&quot; It's loud, in your face, anthemic, - it's the only thing that matters when you're in that moment. The bagpipes at the end are awesome. The instrumental composition &quot;Back into Hell&quot; is highly impressive and thematic with the album as a whole.<br />When I'm left questioning my purpose on the planet, I take this album for a spin - 10 years later it's just as fresh - I go through the cathartic &quot;Life is a Lemon and I Want My Money Back&quot; (one of the greatest songs ever), into the divine &quot;Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through,&quot; on to the confession stage with &quot;It Just Won't Quit,&quot; and on and on until the only less-than-perfect song &quot;Lost Boys and Golden Girls&quot; concludes this emotional roller coaster of almost 80 minutes. It's the best 12-step program there is. The songs are diverse, rocking, musical, ... perfect. Oh, and the opening ditty &quot;I'd do Anything for Love&quot; doesn't hurt the record either. What better alternative to the uninspired, lackluster 'alternative' music of the nineties. If lightening can strike 3 times with the upcoming Bat 3, then our Savior of Rock and Roll is alive and well. We survived disco (ok i wasn't even born yet), grunge, techno, boy bands, rap, .... and good music always wins out. There is nothing bad about this album and everything good about it. I own a diverse cd collection of almost a thousand cd's, and Bat 2 has earned a solid permanent position in my top 10. If you find Jim Steinman's songwriting to be too over-the-top, than you, my friend, need a cleansing of the soul. Yowsah.<br />In all seriousness: Bat out of Hell II: Back into Hell is one of the best (and cheapest) ways of therapy out there. I could write a doctoral thesis on the power of each song, but find it out for yourself. A review shouldn't give away the ending, but rather it should motivate you to investigate. Not all commercial success sellers are crap. Indeed, this album is the antithesis.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Rabbit Proof Fence is a movie about three girls who get taken away from their mother, then are put in a boarding school. At the boarding school the girls aren't allowed to speak their native language they have to speak English, and they get whipped. So the girls decide to escape. They did escape but they had a tracker tracking them down. The girls were helped by a number of people on their 1500-mile journey across the Australian outback. Two of the girls made the journey but one of them was captured because she gave up. <br />  I think that this is a great movie the actresses that played the three girls did a really good job at making this movie very realistic especially the scene where the three girls get taken away from their mom. As well as being realistic the movie was suspenseful (like where they were being tracked by the tracker) and you never knew if they would get caught.<br /> <BR> In conclusion I think this movie is one that you should definitely watch. The acting, the music, and story are all great. The documentary after the movie is cool because it shows you how they turned those girls into great actresses.
B0001HAISQ|2.0|My wife was dying to see this movie so I recently purchased it for her. Unfortunetly I had to sit threw an hour and a half of boring story telling. For children, they might enjoy this movie. The littler audience 2-6 probably wouldnt enjoy this film. There wasnt enough interesting moments in the movie. Most kids would probably loose interest in the first five minutes and continue to be bored throughout the first 20 minutes. This film does have some enjoyable comedy. But for peter pan, I would much rather watch hook a couple dozen times. But if you really enjoy the peter pan story you may very well love this move as my wife did. But if you loved hook you will not enjoy this movie because it is not as funny nor as interesting. All I can reccomend is rent it before you buy it.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|The chief glory of this Ring, in my view, is the performance of the orchestra of the Met. However, Levine's conducting is at times lethargic. <br />The cast is wildly uneven. The major blot on the set is Hildegard Behrens's unstable and weak Brunnhilde. Some of the cast members are also past their prime. The acting is unremarkable and the production, though loyal to most of Wagner's original instructions, is uninteresting.
B00000IWVS|5.0|I simply can't get over Chopin's 3rd Piano Sonata.  This is the strongest piece on this old, hissy and somewhat muddy and garbled artifact, and they are right to lead off with it.  I have no other recordings of the 3rd to compare with, but Argerich sells the piece very well, I think her aggressive approach is correct.<br />The 3rd movement just slays me.  I want to orchestrate it and just bask in endless variations upon the central arabesque with a full symphony surrounding me on a sunny day.  The piece is like an entire day, or an entire life, it is an 8 minute haiku that captures the entire universe and all that is worth living to appreciate.<br />This sonata I'm already convinced explains not only Debussy's style (he must have played this constantly growing up) but much of what we consider beauty in modern music.  I'm not exaggerating!  Why is this piece not featured more prominently in the repertory?  I guess it is, but in appropriated bits peeled off it and recycled into lesser works.<br />Chopin's genius and immortality is confirmed.  And I will look for additional interpretations of this singular achievement in the hope I might improve upon a first love.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Not like anything I've ever heard before. Brilliant compositions, definitely a must have. Way to go Jared.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I grew up listening to early Billy Joel (Songs in the Attic- not the mediocre stuff he wrote later on) and Elton John. I also listened to a fair amount of Stevie Wonder. I heard one of Gavin's songs on the TV it reminded me of all, or a combination of the above artists. I have been waiting a long time for an authentic New Voice to be represented. Could he receive the torch from Billy Joel, Elton John, etc? Only time will tell. But this much is certain, I haven't been this interested and captivated by a new artist in years. I even pulled out the lyric sheet to add to my enjoyment of the songs. Rich metaphors and deeply meaningful lyrics. I am a generation older, but I truly am &quot;there&quot; when I hear these songs.
B00006879E|5.0|I received this CD from a friend for Christmas, before the band released some of their other singles. I knew right away that this was a hit CD. I have never owned a CD where I can actually listen to all of the songs without skipping 1 or 2, or like so many CDs these days almost the entire album. This CD has so many great songs, I'm surprised they've only released 3 as singles, there could be at least 2 or 3 more that would make substantial play time on the radio. This is by far my favorite CD, and one of the best that I have ever owned. I've given this CD to many of my friends as gifts, and they all agree. I've also seen them in concert, and they rock! They sound really great live! Buy this CD if you haven't already!!
B0001HAHXW|1.0|I bought this CD amd tried to play it but it had a song that stopped right in the middle. I exchanged it for another copy and that one &quot;skipped&quot; and popped in several places.<br />Growing suspicious I did some research and found out that this CD has copy protection on it that can cause it not to even play properly in many CD players.<br />Now, I support artists making money from their work, but I will not support this sort of measure. I returned the CD and got a refund. Should I hear Reprise Records reissuing it without copy protection I will purchase it again.
0425152251|4.0|Sophie Amundsen is a normal teenage girl living with her mom in a small town. Her father works with the U.N. peacekeeping forces and is stationed in Lebanon. When Sophie is about to turn 15, she receives a small note in her mailbox. It has only one question in it:  Who are you?  This event signals Sophies first contact with Philosophy. And as days go by and her birthday gets closer, all sorts of weird things start happening: a dog starts delivering her envelopes, letters for a certain Hilde Moller start arriving at her mailbox,  a Greek city appears before her eyes on video tape, and a mysterious man is determined to teach her Philosophy. Sophie and her friend Jorunn will be drawn into a great adventure and at the same time she (and you) will start a grand tour on philosophy, from mankinds first myths up to the XXth. Century.  Sophies World accomplishes two things: it takes complex ideas and explains them in the most simple language possible (try opening a Kant or Hegel book and reading 10 pages without any formal philosopical background, like me), while keeping enough of a mystery in Sophies journey to keep you turning pages. Theres even a Philosophical plot twist that will make you think.  This book is not for those who study philosophy. It is for those who think philosophy is complex and out of reach. Highly commendable.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Wasssssuppppp! my fellow buyers, I don't understand this Britney haters reviewers, they give too much time to hate Britnet it's like they don't have lives?, wassup with that?, Britney latest combo feauture a more mature venue to her repertuoir, and less ballad to yikes about.  EVERYTIME is a emotional ballad that surpases all her previous romantic-melancolic attemps, this is without a doubt her best downtempo joint, TOXIC well, the song title say it all, it's just toxic, it will get through your brain want it or not, this is what music is all about, becoming a classic. ME AGAINST THE MUSIC although underrated, this is a one time in a lifetime collaboration of two DIVAS, it's like Madonna passing the crown to BRITNEY, just like DIANA ROSS passed it to Madonna years ago with a bottle of champagne.  OUTRAGEOUS is the description of the opulence of Britney life, who don't want to have it all!, THE TOUCH OF MY HAND yes! yes! this is about personal behaviour, SHOWDOWN a personal dislike, just like RED BLOODED WOMAN on Kylie's BODY LANGUAGE, SHADOW, sounds odd, still does not get to my brain, THE HOOKUP, where's SEAN PAUL, this total reggae time, so cheerful, and danceable, BOOM BOOM, it's a dance stomper joint, BREATHE ON ME a-la-minogue, a great track that should become a great international single cos the states side does not embrace dance as well as Europe, EARLY MORNIN' callin' MOBY, this is an odd collaboration, who thought MOBY could produce a perfect POP song like this, BRAVE NEW GIRL filler, yuk!, the remix of ME AGAINST THE MUSIC is unnecesary and the worst of all the mixes made of that song.  IN TH ZONE is not Britney's more intimate a personal album, but it's great grow to her mature state, and it's her best album to date, and a excape from her Martin-Cheiron-Sweden sound.  This is a most have to the POP culture, and besides it's BRITNEY, so Britney haters I know you write bad reviews because you don't have nothing to do, but I'm going to dedicate to write badrevies about INCUBUS, LIMP BIZKIT and all that c... so you will have a taste of your own medicine, besides I don't have nothing to do, hahaha, to any POP lover buy it, you won't regret it.
B0001M0A4I|5.0|What a delight. Still listening to it regularly and finding plenty to enjoy. Played it to my sister who was never interested in Genesis without telling her who it was. Her favourite composers are Chopin and Mozart; she loves it. Her first word was 'Atmospheric' which is probably how the many Genesis fans would describe their rock music. The pieces are quite distinctive with the final 'The spirit of gravity' truly emotional. I'd love to hear more of this from Tony/the LPO.
0060012358|5.0|Wow! Terry Pratchett has done it again! He's managed to creat an excelent book for not only children but all ages. His wonderfull twist on the pied piper was even better than the origanal. This was sertanly the best book I have ever read in my entire life, and Ive read a lot of books. I suggest that you should read it, it would suit all fans of terrys books and great for all ages. This book is not only cunning, but has hints of humor. So definatly read this book and any of Terrys other books... im sure you'll be amazed and never want to put it down!! TAKE MY WORD FOR IT!!
B000000Y27|3.0|This is a great, great album. You need to buy this album if you are interested in jazz guitar or guitar at all. But the sound on this CD is just plain awful. Spend the extra bucks and get the Hybrid SACD version or at least the 24 bit remastering, its worth it.
1592400876|1.0|Dear Ms. Truss,<br />I had settled into my seat in the waiting area at LaGuardia Airport, looking forward to reading this amusing book that had received such good press.<br />Can you imagine my chagrin as my eyes rested on the following sentence (in the Preface, yet!):<BR>Preface, page xxiii - \\"I tend to feel that if a person genuinely wants to know how to spell Connecticut, you see, they will make efforts to look it up.\\" (italics mine)<br />I simply couldn't believe it!  How could you use a plural pronoun to complement a singular subject?  I became very upset and quite angry and felt that I simply could read no farther!  But after an hour or so, I decided that I would try to be forgiving and tolerant and see what else you might have to say.  BUT, here is another example!  (Mind you, we are still at the beginning of the book at this point.)<br />The Tractable Apostrophe, page 35 - ...a singing group called Hear'Say.  The announcement of the Hear'Say name was quite a national occasion, as I recall; people actually went out in very large numbers to buy their records...(italics mine)<br />You state on page 32 that, \\"I am not a grammarian.\\"  Nor am I, but shouldn't you be, if you are dealing so severely with questions of punctuation?  Surely grammar has a lot to do with those \\"traffic signals of language\\".<br />But, apparently you are a grammarian, or else you would not have commented thus:<br />Introduction, page 4 -...\\"eight items or less\\" (because it should be \\"fewer\\")...<br />Introduction, page 5 - \\"When we hear the construction `Mr. Blair was stood' (instead of `standing') we suck our teeth with annoyance, and when words such as `phenomena', `media', `cherubim' are treated as singular (`The media says it was quite a phenomena looking at those cherubims'), some of us cannot suppress actual screams.\\"<br />Where were your editors?  Did they not proof this book?  What happened?  I expect more than this from England, and feel somewhat betrayed by the slipshoddiness(?) of this publication.  (A little melodramatic, perhaps, but nonetheless true.)<br />What to do, what to do - I cannot decide whether or not to finish your book.<br />Sigh.
B000002KBU|5.0|This was the first Joni Mitchell album I ever heard.  It was 1992, and I was in grade 10. My vocal music teacher brought it in to play us a sample...and I felt a whole new world of music opening up for me.  I have been a Joni Mitchell fan ever since.<br />&quot;Blue&quot; is an album that has Joni bearing her soul...leaving no stone unturned, no walls or curtains to hide behind.  It is intensely emotional, and lets the listener get closer to her than any other album.  This album is so special for that reason.  Her playing is stellar...she makes it sound so easy.  Her voice is in top form; singing with such clarity and young wisdom.  I never get sick of this album...from &quot;All I Want&quot; to &quot;The Last Time I Saw Richard.&quot;  Is it folk music?  No...I wouldn't say so.  Has it ever claimed to be a folk album?  If you want &quot;Tom Dooley&quot;, then listen to The Kingston Trio...if you want something deeper and encompassing, listen to Joni Mitchell...no simple 3 chord wonders here. <br />I have read the bad reviews of this album (and also those for &quot;Court and Spark&quot;...yet another piece of Mitchell magic) and I just don't understand it.  Someone reviewing &quot;Court and Spark&quot; said that they didn't like Joni Mitchell's voice...hmmmm...a matter of opinion...from a person who couldn't possibly give a good review of ANY of her albums since she has the AUDACITY to sing on them.  It is the same for &quot;Blue&quot;...Joni needed Prozac...why couldn't she crack a smile...the album is dull and boring...her voice is awful...these negative reviews (for Joni Mitchll albums, they tend to be extremely short, and lacking in any real detail...as different from Joni Mitchell's writing as day is from night...maybe that is why they don't like her) could be sending people away from this album, or others by this absolutely legendary singer/songwriter.  I have no problem with people giving albums negative reviews, but not if it is about criticizing her for hermood at the time of writing the songs...was she not allowed to be reflective of things in her life?<br />Give a negative review based on the musical performance, the lack of lyrical depth, the LACK of emotion, the poor production quality...it won't apply to this album.
B00004R99U|1.0|This movie was soooo BORING!!!!! Well okay it was ok at the beginning but near the end I was thinking to myself &quot;I'll only like this movie if she chooses John Smith!&quot; And guess what? SHE DIDNT!!!!! GRRRR it makes me heartbroken! I looved the Lion King 2, Peter Pan 2, and Aladdin 3 (Aladdin 2 was reeeally bad heheh) and I havnt seen any other sequals unless you count Fantasia 2000 which I think doesnt seem like a sequal at all, more like a whole new movie! But back to Pocahontas... I LOOOOOVED JOHN SMITH!!! I know that the person I borrowed this movie from is only keeping it to expand her disney collection... (she has probably almost all of them) and if Ariel can see Eric once, fall in love, take some time off and finally come up with a plan to see him again (which, when you think about it, must take some time for the movie to progress and such) She still loves him and marries him BUT WHAT ABOUT JOHN SMITH????? IT'S ALMOST THE SAME!!!!!! DONT RENT THIS MOVIE!!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I'm pleased to read so many comments of people who were similarly impacted by this movie. I rented the movie and watched it 6 times before returning it. Each time I was more impressed with the depth of this movie. Watching it the third time with subtitles helped greatly to understand some of the period slang and sailing terminology. Russell Crowe is simply everything a ship captain - or any great leader - should be. His presence captures the screen. You can't get enough of him. One of my favorite moments in the film is a meeting of the ship's officers - the second in command, the Sailing Master, the Surgeon, and the Captain - weighing the damage incurred having almost been sunk in the first encounter with the French frigate, Acheron, which it is their mission to pursue and either sink or take for prize, but it turns out the hunter becomes the hunted. The Captain's officers are all pleading with Captain Aubrey (Crowe) to sail the ship back to port for repairs to which Aubrey flatly replies, \\"we're not going to port. We can refit at sea.\\" In total dismay, the Sailing Master tells him that the French ship \\"is much heavier - she's out of our class. And by the time we're repaired and back in pursuit she'll almost be to Cape Horn.\\" With a wry grin Aubrey replies, \\"Well then....we haven't a moment to lose.\\" It's such an inspiring, thrilling, and realistic journey the viewer almost feels a part of the crew. Master and Commander is one of only six films I call a masterpiece. I'm buying it and I'll never get tired of watching it.
0671027387|3.0|This book is about the daughter of Senator Sedgewick Sexton, who is a presidential candidate.  The senator is winning the campaign by acknoledging the money that NASA has wasted under the current predident's support (Zach Herney).  When NASA makes and incredible discovery, a meteorite with signs of aliens life, Herney brings Sexton's daughter, Rachel, to tell hisstaff about it.  Rachel is willing to do so, because she doesn't like the way her father is campaigning.  This is true, at least, until she discovers that the meteorite could have been placed there.  The team of her and a famous scientist have to dicover the truth and prove it.  Their first suspicion is of course the president himself, but they find out that he may have no idea.  The books presents many suspects working for the president, or not for him.  They don't have all the time in the world, either, because the president is about to tell the world about the discovery, and if he does, the president could likely be decided by it.<br />This story is very well told, like all of Dan Brown's books.  It combines acion, mystery, and politics, and it is very exciting.  Every character is included in the plot, even if they seem unimportant at the beginning.  The mystery isn't revealed until the last page of the book, and the conclusion is also characeristic of Dan Brown, because you can't stop reading it.  I would give this book three stars because compared to Brown's best book, The Da Vinci Code, this book doesn't belong in the same state.  Compared to different authors, however, it is a great book.
B0001V07ZQ|5.0|Okay so I'm not big on action movies but I am big fan of great movies and this is definitely one. Master & Commander is not only visually stunning it is a movie that is true to the era in which it is set.
B000001G8I|5.0|As everybody who saw Amadeus knows, Mozart was writing this requiem for a mysterious stranger when he died.  It is all the more tragic because it shows that he was still at the top of his game when he died.  (The rest of the mass was finished by a student).  Herbert von Karajan did three separate recordings of the requiem for Deutsche Grammaphon and they are all pretty similar.  Get this one, or whichever is cheapest.
B00001QEE5|2.0|I won't lie. It's been over six years since I  have actually seen this movie. Back then I didn't like it. I still don't. But now, I have realized something: there is symbolism in this movie. You see, Peter Pan represents a certain someone. Who, you ask? Come closer. Now, we all know that the character Tinkerbell was modeled after, (or at least drawn to the likeness of), Marilyn Monroe. Coincidence? I don't think so. Can you guess who Pan is yet? Oh-kay, Peter Pan stands for John F. Kennedy- you know, irresponsible, young, womanizing, etc. Don't believe me? Look at Pan! He's dressed in green, the color of the Irish. He associates with not one, not two, but three women in this film. Sounds like JFK to me. Wendy stands as the voice of reason, Jackie. Captain Hook, of course, is Lee Harvey Oswald, and that alligator... or crocodile... thing, is Jack Ruby. Odd, isn't it?<br />Well, I hope you've enjoyed this little essay... or review... or... ah, whatever.
B00005JLR8|5.0|This is what the people at Sundance should watch.  This is what we've come to independent films for since the studios began producing nothing but schlock.  This is a GOOD movie.  <br />It tells the true story of director Jim Sheridan and his family - how they came to America to live in the slums of Manhattan after the death of their little boy.  Things are tough for them at the beginning, but this movie is not so much about the sadness they experience as it is about the simple joys of making a shower work or getting an air conditioner.<br />It's good to watch this movie at this period in history, when America is in trouble and everybody seems to hate us.  Sheridan doesn't sugar-coat the story - they don't get to America and everything magically falls into place.  However, there is a certain magic about America and the Sheridan family finds it.<br />Some of the magic comes from the character of Mateo, wonderfully played by Amistad's Djimon Hounsou.  He's an eccentric artist who lives downstairs and befriends the family.  In America is great because it is primarily seen through the eyes of the little girl, Christy (Sarah Bolger was nominated for an Oscar for this performance).  We see her heartbreak and still her sense of wonder at life.  <br />I won't say they don't make movies like this anymore...but they don't make a lot of them.
B000000W5L|5.0|When the Stones released Exile On Main Street in 1972 it was regarded far and wide as a massive failure.  Seen as a pale imitation of The Beatles \\"White Album\\", this sprawling hodge-podge of mixed song styles was far too much for fans of Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers to wade through.  Although Exile did produce two popular hits (Tumbling Dice and Happy), the album was the butt of numerous jokes for several years.  If you think of what Hudson Hawk almost did to Bruce Willis, you get some sense of what Exile On Main Street was to the Stones.  It was not until nearly the end of the 1970's that \\"received opinion\\" began to change.  Now Exile On Main Street is regarded as the \\"last great\\" Stones album of their \\"golden age\\". Many who hated Exile (you know who you are!) now claim they loved it all along.<br />The album starts with one of the great \\"songs that should have been a hit\\", Rocks Off.  A high-energy romp of sexual tension and ominous mystery, Rocks Off starts off the record with great promise.  What follows is a confusing gumbo of blues, country and rhythm & blues.  In other words, it was what the Stones were all about.  Repeated listenings (especially after all these years) reveal a rich helping of the Stones love for American music (at least as the Stones heard it).  It seems that the Stones have made a career of presenting America's own music back to itself.  Interviews over the years show that the Stones know much more about American music than most Americans do-much to our embarrassment.  From the country flavored \\"Sweet Virginia\\", the southern rock of \\"Tumbling Dice\\", the rambling blues of \\"Turd On the Run\\", the haunting \\"I Just Want To See His Face\\", to the \\"shout-fest\\" of \\"All Down The Line\\", we fall in love with the lovely mess.  Rock And Roll is no pedigree breed.  Instead, it is a mongrel dog with no papers and suspect parentage we love anyway.<br />The quip goes that \\"if the English were any better at soul music they would be terrible\\".  The implication is that the English misunderstand Black music so badly that they end up creating a whole new separate art form when they try to play it themselves.  I am not so sure.  Exile On Main Street does take a while to wade through.  Songs that just \\"lay there\\" suddenly jump to life after listening to them several times-maybe after several years.  It is far more saucy than Let It Bleed and it is not as neat and orderly as Sticky Fingers.  Exile On Main Street is a big sloppy kiss from the girl who is not the most attractive in school-but the one girl who is easy on the eyes and knows all the moves.ion is that the English misunderstand Black music so badly that they end up creating a whole new separate art form when they try to play it themselves.

0316666343|3.0|This is a book with a lot of potential, but somehow it didn't quite turn out.<BR>First of all, in the first few chapters, the main character and narrator Susie sounds like a normal fourteen-year-old. Then she begins to talk like a well-educated adult. It's just not believable. No matter how good it sounds, it isn't what a young teen girl would talk like.<BR>We also don't get to know Susie that well.<BR>Secondly, this book is depressing. I'm not saying that makes it bad... it's just that, everything is depressing. Even the heaven Alice Sebold creates in her story is more of a miserable place where the dead spend their time watching people on earth live their lives and wishing they were alive. All Susie does is watch people on earth. She doesn't really connect with the reader, because basically she is just telling a story.<BR>The most powerful chapter has to be the very first one. It's also the most disturbing. <BR>After the story gets going, though, particularly in the second half of the book, I found myself wanting to skip whole pages because nothing interesting was happening. It seems as though there is so much potential here, for a riveting story, but it doesn't work very well. There were many &quot;missed opportunities&quot; for plot changes or twists that would have made things more interesting.<BR>As a reader, you start to wonder what kind of climax everything is leading up to. You think that, with everything that's going on, it has to be something really compelling. I was very disapointed with the ending, however. It wasn't satisfying.<br />I give this book 3 stars, because I did like some things about it. I liked the character development you can see in Lindsey, Susie's sister, and Ruth, the girl Susie &quot;brushed up against&quot; in a parking lot as she left the world.<BR>Alice Sebold is clearly a very talented writer. She deserves credit. This is a good start for her. I hope she does well in her next books.
B000089RVX|5.0|I saw the video for Bring Me TO Life and i decided i like the song and video but because of music being so terrible these days, a new artist is not a safe bet at least not when losing the bet means youre out $15.  Evanescence has surprised me but even more than evanescence amy lee's solid soprano has surprised me and this CD is definitely a driving CD.  Its dramatic moments Going Under Bring Me To Life Everybody's Fooland then it's slower moments My Immortal and Hello help to keep me both awake and calm when on long drives.  Im not a rock fan usually but this CD is awesome.<br />Final Verdict Buy it! One of the years best
B000002MH5|5.0|To start off with, I must say that I am not one to blurt out grandiose declarative statements about the greatness of something.  I will have to make an exception in the case of D.J.'s Where You Been.  I first discovered Dinosaur Jr. back when this album first came out.  I heard them on the radio and was mightily impressed.  I really hadn't heard anybody quite like them before.  At this time, I was very much interested in the grunge movement, particularly Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains.  I also found I had a strong interest in the Pixies, and a mild interest in Sonic Youth, both of whom hailed from the same Mass. area as DJ.  While I still enjoy all of these groups for myriad of reasons, the one group I never tired of was Dinosaur Jr. and in particular this album.  I actually started out loving &quot;I ain't saying&quot;, but when I bought the cd I lost interest in it.  I really dug &quot;Start Choppin'&quot; for its simple bubbly rhythm.  For me, &quot;Get Me&quot; is a real gem with its astounding guitar solos and mutterings of J.  Most of the other tracks are very good.  Easy to listen all through.  The thing about DJ that I have always found comforting is that vocally it invokes a sort of &quot;throw my hands in the air&quot; apathy that has carried me through some pretty tough times over the years.  Besides, I could actually sing along and very often it would be of a quality near par to J's(lol).  <BR>The music is enough to make even the most dedicated lyricists overlook the scratchy, oft-out of key vocals and generally incomprehensible words.  I would argue that the lyrics and vocals are part and parsal to the overall DJ experience, though.    <br />I have purchased this album twice, and am getting ready to buy another copy of it.  After hearing this album, I started checking out DJ's other albums.  They were hard to find where I lived at the time, but it became a bit of an obsession to find them.  I think GreenMind is a very solid album, maybe even my second favorite and I very much enjoy the EP-Whatever's Cool With Me.  The live version of the GreenMind classic &quot;Thumb&quot; is superb and well-worth the cost of the cd.  I am not a huge fan of DJ's early stuff, though I own all of it and listen to it on occasion.  Fossils is a fun album though.  <br />The album following Where You Been, Without a Sound, was initially disappointing to me.  I was rather possessive of &quot;my&quot; band and when they started to gain a little attention, I resented the &quot;johnny come lately's&quot;  even though I suppose I was one too, as I look back.  I didn't give the cd a chance, but as I have listened to it since, I have gained a healthy respect for it.  Their last original cd, which I can't remember the name of is also a solid effort.<br />All in all, I must say that Where You Been was one of the first cd's that I could listen to not stop all the way through.  I would recommend this to anyone who is nostalgic for the bygone 90's or just those interested in some obscure guitar-driven rock that is fresh and still holds up 10+ years after it was released.  When you look at the poor state of rock these days, DJ really shines, especially to those of you who haven't heard much of their music.
1565123875|4.0|Adichie's &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; will join other notable first novels like &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; in the canon of great African literature.  It is a very good story of the stuggles within one Nigerian family, with a domineering father, a sad, submissive mother, a defiant brother, and a daughter who is torn between following her aunt or her father.  I did like the aunt's perspective, but on the other hand, I don't like the insinoution that pagans are spiritually purer than Christians.  I also thought that the book excused the mother a little too much for how she finally dealt the family problem.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|NOTE: Includes spoilers.<br /><br />All I heard about for months from my American friends was \\"Lost in Translation.\\"  As I live in Japan and actually played piano at the Park Hyatt in the New York Bar & Grill for several years, I finally broke down and bought the DVD. I was expecting to see something wildly different, not to mention gut-bustingly funny, based on the clever trailers.<br /><br />I must honestly say that I almost turned off the film twice - especially during the karaoke sequence. As Sofia Coppola said herself, it was basically like a little \\"home movie.\\"  She went to the places she liked, she had the \\"characters\\" (I use that word loosely) at the hotel she liked, and she kind of followed them around as they floundered about in Tokyo.<br /><br />There were distinct moments when I thought Bill Murray (whom I love) was ad-libbing the scenes.  Also, as others have pointed out, there really isn't a plot.  Things just kind of unfold, and I too, felt the actors were just \\"real\\" people -- not really acting, just standing in front of a camera and making it up as they went along.<br /><br />And yet... by the time the film got to the last minute, I felt something incredibly deep and sad.  I felt like the two leads had each found the right person and yet they would still be going back to the wrong lives.  It was very powerful, and despite the adlib feel of the entire film, when it came to the end, both the actors conveyed the emotion beautifully (something two \\"real\\" people off the street could not do).<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson was so beautiful that it was worth watching the film just to look at her -- although I feel the opening shot was absolutely pointless and my first thought was \\"Is Sofia a lesbian?\\"  I didn't get it at all.<br /><br />The cinematography was great, and living here in Tokyo, I know how hard it was to get some of those incredible shots.<br /><br />As far as the film being \\"racist\\" -- the only moment that I felt uncomfortable with was at the sushi restaurant.  It seemed like a weak, stupid joke, and the comment about the \\"r's\\" and \\"l's\\" was dumb as well -- but, hello, people -- this is how some people think and talk, especially those who have absolutely no understanding about Japan (like the Olsen twins, who said their only Japanese reference was \\"Lost in Translation\\" -- open a book, girls!).<br /><br />One thing that people who rave about this film might consider doing is turning on the English subtitles.  They might be shocked at some of the inexplicable lyrics in the final song.  I don't know what Sofia was thinking, or if she was thinking at all.  She probably just liked the song.  I can't imagine she listened carefully to the words.<br /><br />At any rate, if you don't mind taking a sort of ambling roundabout, strange and lazy journey through Tokyo for a couple of hours, you should (if you feel anything at all) be struck at how the last moment comes up and grabs you and makes you realize that maybe there is a right person in this world for each of us, but we may not realize it until it's too late -- or, even worse, may not make the effort to change our worlds to be with that person.d joke, and the comment about the \\"r's\\" and \\"l's\\" was dumb as well -- but, hello, people -- this is how some people think and talk, especially those who have absolutely no understanding about Japan (like the Olsen twins, who said their only Japanese reference was \\"Lost in Translation\\" -- open a book, girls!).

B00008J4P5|4.0|Why is the simplistic part of this band a bad thing or any band for that matter? They lack talent? Maybe...but WHO CARES? Simplicity and minimalism can be just as good or better than maxed up material. This is them. Let styles vary.
B00006RINF|4.0|I first heard Lacuna Coil in 1997, on the Century Media compilation &quot;Darkness We Feel&quot; (which is actually attached to Rotting Christ's album &quot;A Dead Poem&quot;). The comp's only Lacuna Coil song, &quot;Shallow End,&quot; was never released on their debut (despite the comp's booklet saying it would be). Also, the song was apparently recorded under the band's old moniker of &quot;Ethereal,&quot; but labeled Lacuna Coil for the comp. Unfortunately, the band themselves says that the stuff they recorded under the name &quot;Ethereal&quot; are all out of print (I asked them at a show some years ago), plus there was another band with the same name.<br />The band's old style was a lot more Euro-metal sounding than their last few releases. I generally like all of their stuff either way, so it doesn't matter to me. Here's the lowdown: Get &quot;Comalies&quot; and &quot;Unleashed Memories&quot; if you don't like death metal grunts. Otherwise, check all of their stuff out. Honestly, I didn't really care much at all for this album when it first came out, but I had to get it after I saw the new songs peformed live (I think by then it was like the 3rd of 4th time I saw them supporting headliners I went to see).<br />THE INEVITABLE LACUNA COIL/EVANESCENCE DEBATE:<br />When I was working a summer job in an office last year, a middle-aged coworker woman heard me playing the 2nd to last LC album and asked if it was Evanescence. This apparently seems to be the consensus that Lacuna Coil is either &quot;ripping them off&quot; or at least sound very similar to them. Although they have similar elements, *Lacuna Coil came first* and has a more European influenced-sound (being from Italy -- it makes sense) than the more nu-metal-related Evanescence. Just leave it at that. You don't have to like one to like the other. Funny what some recent airplay in America did fans of each group.
0446677450|1.0|There are two concepts in this book that are worth something. <br />The first is the simple definition of financial independence: you must have income sources (not counting your job) equal to your expenses. (Actually, you need more, because the unexpected always happens.) <br />The second concept is simply that if you're eager to get ahead, then what you learn on the job will be more important than what you earn. <br />If you get these two things, you can toss the rest of the book. All the real information on all the pertinent subjects are covered in much more detail elsewhere; mostly what the rest of this book is pontificating re: his philosophies toward money, education, and what makes a loser vs. a winner. It's his attitude that he is selling. He offers an attractive combination of scorn, pompousness, hope, appeal to greed, and justification.<br />The biggest problem I have with the book is that this guy himself has no recognition of what he has given up. He doesn't understand the concept of 'opportunity cost' at all. This book is really no more than a passionate argument that his values are right and other values are dumb. <br />For instance, after he defines wealth as income > expenses, he says, \\"you can't be too rich\\". Then he describes how he quit a job he loved (flying) to master sales. <br />IMO rich is good *only* insofar as it allows you to pursue your true goals and desires.  This guy seems to me to have it reversed; his goals and desires serve his desire for wealth instead of vice versa. Ironically, he keeps saying, \\"I don't work for money, money works for me!\\" - have you ever been a salesperson? Is there any more servile job? Even a waitress doesn't have to coax the customer to buy something. It's all about what the other guy wants; it's all about being pleasing to other people, and serving them. <br />Also, in another sense, it is entirely possible to be \\"too rich\\"; brazen selfishness of the sort this guy defends begets enemies, and history is littered with unapologetic greed causing chains of events that bring down wealth and power. One does not have to be a passionate believer in karma to be a little wary of anyone who thinks morals are for idiots and losers. (Like his real dad.)<br />His \\"rich dad\\" is the man he wishes were his dad; an 8th grade dropout with (we are told)a reputation for selfishness and exploiting his workers. Reputation is apparently something you should be willing to live without in order to be rich. His employees hate him and, apparently, frequently curse him. This apparently amuses Rich Dad - one more sign of how powerful and cool he is? Rich Dad teaches the author that power means playing petty power trips, intimidating vendors & employees, making people wait in the waiting room, etc. <br />Quite frankly, he neither sounds like someone I'd want to be, nor does he sound like a particularly well-adjusted person. Certainly not very *happy* (which is no doubt why he's so good at defending and justifying his questionable practices).<br />Poor Dad, on the other hand, is the author's own real father. The author showers so much contempt on his unfortunate father that I started imagining this book was written to get a last word in against a dead father who steadfastly refused to 'see reason'. The reason I start thinking this is because the father, as described by the author, claimed he \\"loves teaching\\" (the author absolutely insists that this just means his father was too dumb to figure out he could have made more money elsewhere) and obviously values education. The author, on the other hand, sees value only in \\"financial literacy\\", and describes himself challenging teachers (as in, what has this got to do with earning money? - a question guaranteed to seriously wound any parent who values education).  <br />Personally, I think the author comes across as quite ignorant-sounding, especially when he's talking about politics and history and the like. (At some points so does his Rich Dad, IMO). <br />I also think that when he openly pities the poor idiotic girl who envies him his bestseller status, & he tries to explain to her about how to learn to hype - spend a few years mastering sales and advertising etc., and she walks away - well, it seems  pretty clear to me that *he* is the one who just doesn't 'get it'.  <br />In the end, you get what you chase, what you prioritize. Everyone does. This guy seems continually astounded that anyone could value anything other than cash, and that seems to be the underlying theme of the book.  To get Rich, you have to make money your focus, your goal - you must put it first, you must dedicate yourself to learning the games and strategies of wealth, you must stop thinking like everyone else and learn how to think like rich people.  <br /> If you want to think like a rich person, though, I wouldn't recommend this particular rich person; I'd recommend someone a little less sleazy. Like maybe the guys who run Franklin Covey - I understand they're rich as sin and can still talk about things like \\"integrity\\".
B0001HAHXW|1.0|Eric, Eric, Eric - what WERE you thinking? This album is like paying to be in a plane crash; Thomas Eddison is no doubt turning in his grave!!! The albums one and only saving grace is that those who have heard it, through bitter personal experience can honestly claim to know what the blues is all about - unlike Mr Clapton, who evidently HAS no soul, and is therefore completely unable to produce passionate music. I've experienced greater levels of emotional resonance in the lift going up to the car park!<br />Somewhere up in heaven, Son House, Henry Thomas, Charley Patton, Fred Mcdowell, Blind Lemon and Leadbelly etc are no doubt already sharpening their knives!
B0001HLVSC|4.0|If you like Pirates of the Caribbean or the Columbia Ship at Disneyland, you will probably like this film.   Russell Crowe is the captain of a ship. Some young lads that are part of the crew are on watch.  One of the lads believes he saw something in the fog.  Another ship. Nobody else saw what he glimpsed.  The Captain believes what the lad saw and continues the watch.  Boom! They are attacked. When the battle is over.  The enemy ship is gone.  He's a very nice Captain and knows his business.  He is creative as well.  He makes a map out of food which is dinner.  It is way of showing the crew where the next destination is.  The Galapagos Islands.  There he believes the enemy ship is hiding.    I can not imagine anyone else in this role.  Russell Crowe is perfect.
B0000457HB|5.0|Many people of my generation were probably placed upon this planet because of Barry White. The late master of love was even an icon to the new generation because of his appearances on \\"Ally Mcbeal\\". He provided the soundtrack for sex for the entire disco age. Now with the rerelease of what is astetically a greatest hits collection, he should be discovered by generations to come. He prolonged the seduction. He stretched out the verbal foreplay until there was nothing to do but the physical act. And the songs were foreplay on their own. \\"It's Esctasy When You Lie Next To Me\\",\\"Staying Power\\", and the true classic\\"Can't get Enough of your Love,Babe\\" are just testaments to this man's musical genius and his love of love. Barry White, thanks for putting me here and the fun in Heaven got a lot more vocal and a lot more fun.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|Even with the acting by Russell Crowe this movie seems to go nowhere. It putters along with the climax coming and going with you waiting for something more.  By the time the movie is over you're wondering \\"what just happened.\\" For Crowe this certainly isn't a feather in his cap and they used his name to market an otherwise ho-hum flick. Maybe next time. Stick with Gladiator.
B000056JYC|5.0|Peter Frampton would had been at worst a session musician had it not been for this 1977 triumph. Recorded at the famous Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, this is the definitive look at Frampton's career. From nuggets such as &quot;It's a Plain Shame&quot; and &quot;Something's Happening&quot;, to the cornerstones &quot;Show Me The Way&quot;, and &quot;Baby, I Love Your Way&quot;, Frampton and his bandmates John Siomos, Sidney Sheldon, and the just recently passed away Bob Mayo, show why Frampton was just a live musician and not much of a studio musician. The 25th anniversary remastered version brings the master tapes hopefully back to the day in late 76 when Frampton and A&amp;M record head Jerry Moss heard the live recordings for the first time. And a little snippet of useless trivia. This album originally was going to be a single album without &quot;Show Me The Way&quot; or &quot;Baby, I Love Your Way&quot;. It was at Moss's urging for Frampton to record more dates to make it the double album masterpiece that it is. Think about it, we probably aren't introduced to that fabulous 70's instrument, the talkbox without this album. It was the first album I bought with my own money and it is and should be a cornerstone of any CD collection.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|\\"Master And Commander\\" is one of the top 10 films released in 2003, starring Oscar winner Russell Crowe (\\"Gladiator\\") and Paul Bettany (\\"A Beautiful Mind\\").  The brilliant plot is adapted from Patrick O'Brian's two novels written in the 1800's about war hero Capt. Jack Aubrey, played by Crowe.  No other actor could have played him better.  He proves that he continually evolves as an actor through every film.  His tremendous talents are rare in modern-day entertainment.  Director Peter Weir leads the cast and crew to creating this masterpiece.  All of the realisms and hardtimes are greatly expressed in this film.  Such tremendous film quality offers audiences a great, unforgettable experience.  The action scenes are intense, keeping the battles raging and the ocean storms like a roller coaster.  Yet, the emotional aspect never dies.  During moments of peace and rest, the expressed struggles keep the emotional tides to the fullest, namely depression and fear. <br />The elaborate background settings add the entertainment pleasure.  The Oscar winning sound editing and cinematography wonderfully add intensity to the action scenes and desplict the characters' surroundings fuller.  The costume design are accurate to the actual styles of 1805.  The visual effects greatly desplict the realities of the times.  They make audiences feel like they're living that year.<br />\\"Master And Commander\\" is a great film that will keep audiences watching closely to every scene.  This is sure to continue pleasing audiences for many more years.
0553277472|3.0|Yes, the book had interesting ideas. But the pacing was geriatric. Like watching paint dry. If it had been edited down to half it's size it would have been readable.
0790729725|5.0|Scorsese's &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is a long movie that feels short, thanks to memorable characters, a blazing soundtrack, and expert pacing that only the director is capable of pulling off. The screenplay is so good, that watching episodes of the Sopranos evoke great memories of this film. In fact, any Italian mafia flick that came out after Goodfellas borrows (or steals) at least a little bit from Scorsese and Pileggi. Ray Liotta's narration is perfect. It is as good as Dreyfuss' wonderul narration in &quot;Stand By Me&quot; and is peppered with comedy, poignant emotion, and heart. <br />&quot;Goodfellas&quot; practically made Pesci's career with his explosive performance as Tommy DeVito. Here, Pesci forever silences the theory that short, little guys can't be tough. Robert DeNiro shines equally as the Irishman Jimmy Conway with his famous &quot;Little Bit&quot; scene. <br />The supporting cast of characters is top notch in the tradition of Scorsese with Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, and Frank Vincent creating memorable performances. If you haven't seen Goodfellas, buy it! It changed the way Gangster films were made, as it added a little comedy to the gritty criminal subject matter.
B00006EXL5|3.0|this cd is alright...nothing too special.fans of this should check out a band called ink and dagger a band that mcr owes a lot to. they started the whole vampire/hardcore thing but they had a sense of humor as well. these guys take themselves way too seriously and get a little too emo at times. so yea...check out &quot;fine art of original sin&quot; by ink and dagger cuz it's one ofte best records ever made. as far as this record goes...the best song is &quot;our lady of sorrows&quot;....i think...whatever track five is
B000066NW0|1.0|FYI, I work in the music industry, and I know many sound engineers (some of whom work for the label that carries Avril's stuff), so I know what I'm talking about. IT'S MY JOB TO KNOW THESE THINGS. If you would take the trouble to read my review more carefully, you'd know that I said the songs on the album were fun and catchy. I have no particular problem with the music per se.<br />What I was criticizing is the complete lack of talent in the supposed singer/composer/guitarist. The sad fact is, Avril cannot sing or play or compose. All these things are done for her, by other people. <br />I don't mind good singers who don't compose. I don't mind poor singers who write great songs. I can even understand a beautiful woman without much talent being marketed as a singer, although I don't approve of such a marketing tactic.<br />But I AM annoyed, and mystified, by a girl who has no talent whatsoever and isn't even pretty getting the kind of publicity and concert dates that ought to be going to hundreds of other, far more talented singers and songwriters.<br />So, go ahead and enjoy your Avril CDs. Just don't pretend she's a genuine talent. She's purely the creation of studio execs and engineers, nothing more.
B000148KK2|5.0|My review title is a little misleading, as I feel Diana isn't really so different with 'The Girl in the Other Room'. But so many people think she is. What this album truly is (to me, anyway) is a natural progression in Diana's evolution as a musician.<BR>I can partially understand the scathing negativity spewed by certain reviewers here. After all, so many great musicians - upon moving outside the narrow confines of a genre that seemed to define them - often find themselves abandoned by short-sighted fans who insist the artiste remain a sort of human jukebox. Think Joni Mitchell, as a grand example.<BR>'The Girl in the Other Room', in my opinionated opinion, is a tremendous breakthrough for Krall. Those who stupidly think she's not 'jazz' anymore probably got confused along the way with beautiful and poignant tracks like 'Narrow Daylight' and 'Departure Bay'. Comparisons to Norah Jones are not only laughable; they're insulting.<BR>Just listen to 'Love Me Like a Man'. Listen to 'Stop This World'. Listen to her spot-on cover of 'Black Crow' - if you're even that much of a learned music expert to know it's from Joni Mitchell's legendary album Hejira. <BR>If this review comes over sounding defensive, it is because I am.<BR>It is frustrating to see that so many people are ready to trash this album without truly giving it a thorough listen. <BR>Okay, so it's not 'All For You'. It's not the strings-laden 'The Look of Love'. GET OVER IT. Diana will not be pigeon-holed. There's only so many of those revered standards one can record before it gets old. <BR>Let the girl make some NEW music for a change, and learn to enjoy the ride she takes you on. I guarantee if you listen to 'The Girl in the Other Room' with open ears and an open mind (instead of expecting the same old thing) you will find a new appreciation for Diana's talent.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|This has to be one of the best foreign films that I have ever seen in my life. Kurosawa made a magical film that will stay with me forever. I will never forget &quot;Sunshine Through the Rain&quot; or &quot;Crows&quot;. I loved these two the most. Some of it is almost Lynchian in the way that dream logic is used, but of course, this IS a film about dreams so that is to be expected. Martin Scorsese even has a cameo where he plays Vincent Van Gogh, and he's not all that bad. All in all, I loved this film.<br />I will be adding it to my collection very soon.<br />HIGHLY recommended!
0783225903|5.0|Gilliam built a cult movie in the great sense of the word.<br />His imaginative script turns around the burocracy and the desperation of people who lives with invisible chains in a oppresive world that controls each detail of your private life.<br />Pryce falls in love with a outsider girl, who eventually will let him to break the rules.<br />Watch this movie. De Niro appears has a cameo in one of the most brilliant sequences.<br />Gilliam handles the camera like the Gods and pays his tribute to the eternal tradition of the british comedy.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|After reading many of the more than 250 reviews, this movie seems to be one of those people either love or hate.  Count me as one of the former.  As even many detractors have mentioned, it is a quite realistic look at the Royal Navy of the early 1800's, as well as being beautifully filmed (it earned the Oscar it received for cinematography).  The lead actors did a more than credible job, as did many of the ship's crew.  The point made about the middle of the movie being a bit slow is taken, but to me it was still interesting (I guess I have a longer attention span than 10 minutes).  I deduct 1 star for the lack of extras of any kind on the 1 disc edition, but I will be purchasing the 2 disc edition nonetheless.
0440238609|5.0|In my life I have read a good amount of books and book series, this is the only series that I have read more than once, and every time I read it, I discover something new. The first time I read it I was probably in about 6th or 7th grade. I was hooked by the deep story and plot twists. The Second time was in eight grade, at this time the religious part of the book hit me and I was once again hooked. Finaly was in tenth grade, and I was really sucked into to theories on physics and even more deeper into the religious aspect. When I read it again I am sure I will once again become enthralled with the story and ideas, it is a book that fills you up so much while reading it, then when you finish it you feel like youv'e been cheated, robbed, of a beautiful thing that is once again over. To say I recomend this book is an understatement, I think it should be required reading, to the point that my teachers friends who haven't read it I badger repeatedly until they do read it. In a sentence, read it, love it, learn from it, and think about it.
B0000640VO|5.0|I am 23 years old, and admittedly quite jaded with life, society, and just about everything about the good ole Earth. I got wind of this movie over New Years, and have since watched it several times, always with different people. Not one has been disappointed, so I believe that Amelie is truly a movie that appeals to everyone. For those of you that can't get past subtitles, you probably went and saw the Passion, so you should check this out too. This will contrast that so wonderfully, and probably fill you with a new zest for life. <br />The premise: Amelie is a single waitress that decides to pass on living for herself, and makes an attempt to affect the lives of everyone around her. You might find her meddlesome, but it is never contrived, and normally to a person's benefit. That is until she meets Nino, a pornshop clerk, who has a weird habit of collecting torn photographs from beneath photo booths, and reforming them in albums (I realize that sentence has horrid grammar, but I'm typing faster than I think). This romance is what got me. IF there is something so innocent and pure as the chase depicted here, then perhaps humanity is not all bad. At first, it might seem a tad obsessive, but when placed within the quirkiness and oddities of the characters within the movie, it seems completely normal. <br />I took many things from this movie. Aside from some profound discussion with my friends after seeing it, I got a newfound desire to actually give people a chance. In addition, I also got a rather insatiable appetite for Audrey Tautou, whose childlike innocence, alabaster skin, and melodic voice is something to behold. This is probably the best film made within my lifetime; not because of special effects or cinematography, but because it tells a wonderful story in a wonderful way. You should see it, it's only $4 or so.
B0001UZZWW|5.0|I didn't read how long the movie was, my mistake.  My children were very disappointed.  They love the movie, but it was really short and they cried.  They didn't understand that it was just a quick movie.  It was still worth it to me, because we had the movie in VHS, I did want the original movie in DVD, so it really wasn't a waste.  Would like to know where to get more glasses, only four pairs come inside the box.  It was a good cut before we see the actual Shrek  movie.
B0000DJZ8R|1.0|I could not understand this movie.  No starships, no capt kirk, no klingons, just old people in an old movie.  By the way, there are NO GRAPES in this movie!!!!!!  Now 'Wrath of KaHn', THAT WAS A MOVIE!!!! Still, I liked the part where there wuz some drinkin.....and that is my ekspert opinion.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|This movie is the most authentic presentation of the age of \\"wooden ships and iron men\\" ever to grace the silver screen.  There is simply no doubt about that.  The viewer is literally transported and immersed into the brutal and harsh service of the Royal Navy during the era of the Napoleonic Wars.  Russell Crowe perfectly portrays Captain Jack Aubrey (\\"lucky Jack\\") of the Patrick O'Brian novels.  The acting, sets, everything, simply crackle with authenticity.  The attention to detail in this film is astounding.<br />The storyline is not bad either, although in my opinion it moves a bit slowly.  But the relatively slow pace of the storyline is for a purpose, to draw the viewer into the subtle nuances that the film is trying to convey--that this was a hard age, the Royal Navy of the times was a brutal and merciless service which brooked no disobedience and yet was not lacking in humanity.  Russell Crowe portrays a Captain Aubrey who is both harsh and humane in an age of hardship and adventure.<br />I deprived this film of the fifth star because I did feel that the storyline could have been made to move at a brisker pace without sacrificing the nuances that the film accomplishes so well.  Others may disagree, and I can understand that.  It may be that with repeated viewings I too will decide that this is a five-star film.  In any case, it is an excellent film, featuring excellent performances, authenticity, and an interesting storyline.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Arnold Schwarzeneger returns as a T-101 cyborg to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) and his old classmate Kate Brewster (Clare Danes) from being destroyed by a more powerful cyborg, a T-X played by the gorgeous Kristanna Loken. The prophesized Judgment Day will soon arrive in the form of nuclear destruction when a computer virus called Skynet is activated by Kate's father who thinks that he is activating a defense mechanism.<br />This was a fun film and does not take itself too seriously. Arnie is in good form when he arrives into the past from the future, butt naked, with ripling muscles. Not bad for a guy in his fifties! Kristanna Loken is great as the leather clad deadly T-X robot. There is possibly one of the longest car chase sequences in cinema history involving a huge crane and a fire engine. Clare Danes must have been seriously bruised riding in the back of her animals rescue truck driven by Nick Stahl during the chase sequence. This is an action packed film which is also filled with humour. Recommended to Arnie fans and all alike.<br />Lealing
B0001906O0|4.0|The Cure's four disc \\"Join The Dots\\" boxed set is the rare box set that is a must have for both comnpletists and novists alike.  <br />Completists need it as it shows a complete alternate reality/history of The Cure (not to mention the wonderfully direct history of the band included in the liner notes).  It parallels the many stages, phases, and styles that Robert Smith and the boys have experimented with and morphed in to (and out of) while gathering the numerous rarities, b-sides, alternate versions and non-album tracks that The Cure have recorded over their 25 year career.  <br />Novists need this set because to be honest - nearly all of the songs are damn good.  Many of these songs could have been on the albums proper (sometimes they were left off simply because they didn't fit the style of the album, or sometimes the band had written an overabundance of quality material).  \\"Pillbox Tales\\" (with Banshee Siouxsie Sioux on background wailing) is good enough to be on either \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" or \\"Seventeen Seconds\\" but doesn't really fit into the style of either album.  While \\"Charlotte Sometimes\\" b-side \\"Splintered In Her Head\\" would have fit in on \\"Pornography\\" perfectly and foreshadowed what was to come with that classic album.<br />From there the songs even get better:  \\"The Exploding Boy\\", \\"A Few Hours After This...\\", and \\"Stop Dead\\" all could have been on \\"The Head on the Door\\" and likely would have been had this album been made in the CD, rather than the casette, era.  The tracks from the \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\\" era are good typical cure tracks from that era with two standouts in \\"A Japanese Dream\\" and \\"Sugar Girl\\" that would have been great on the album. The \\"Disintegration\\" album is near perfect as is and I wouldn't mess with it.  That said, \\"Fear of Ghosts\\" is a perfect fit for that album, while \\"To The Sky\\", \\"2 Late\\", and \\"Out Of Mind\\" are all good tracks that simply would not have fit in on \\"Disintegration\\" and were rightly left off for stylistic reasons despite the fact that the songs are all very good.  \\"Babble\\" is of a little lower quality but is a sonic cousin of the song \\"Disintegration\\".<br />The songs that are from the \\"Wish\\" era on these CD's are among some of the strongest and I can't for the life of me understand why some of these tracks were left off of that album. \\"This Twilight Garden\\" is a flat-out masterpiece that would have fit in on \\"Wish\\" or \\"Disintegration\\", while \\"Play\\" is an elegant and understated ballad.  Furthermore, both \\"The Big Hand\\" and \\"A Foolish Arrangement\\" would have fit nicely as well as they are both moody pop gems that are similar to much of \\"Wish\\".  Heck, the cover art of \\"Wish\\" is even based on \\"The Big Hand\\".<br />Interestingly, many of the tracks included on \\"Join The Dots\\" that were outtakes from \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" are more \\"classic\\" sounding Cure than much of that album.  \\"It Used To Be Me\\", \\"Ocean\\", and \\"Adonais\\" are all maudlin Cure-esque ballads while \\"A Pink Dream\\" is a frothy latter day Cure pop piece ala \\"Friday I'm In Love\\", \\"High\\", or \\"Mint Car\\".<br />Finally, \\"Coming Up\\" and \\"Possession\\" are \\"Bloodflowers\\" outtakes that indicate the original direction that album was to take.  Both tracks are solid with hard rock/techno beat overtones in the general tone of \\"Wrong Number\\" from \\"Galore\\".  I will admit while I like these tracks I prefer the direction \\"Bloodflowers\\" ended up going in.<br />Finally, \\"Join The Dots\\" collects the various soundtrack and compilation album songs the Cure have done.  Some are excellent, like \\"Burn\\" from The Crow and \\"More Than This\\" from the X-Files.  Others are interesting such as the Jimi Hendrix and Doors covers, while a couple are misses - Judge Dredd's \\"Dredd Song\\".  Finally, the amazing \\"Greatest Hits\\" outtake \\"Signal To Noise\\" which can serve as the single for this box set (although not officially) which is a good enough song to beg the question as to why they are not recording a new album.<br />If you own everything Cure or just theGreatest Hits - spend the $60 and get \\"Join The Dots\\".
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I can't believe that neither Reloaded or Revolutions were even nominated for the 2004 Academy Awards, and I'm not saying that they deserved the &quot;best movie&quot; award, but I think (and I believe a lot of people do) that these movies REALLY deserved at least a nomination for &quot;best special effects&quot;. Come on, everyone knows that the Matrix trilogy opened a whole new world on the special effects area, and Revolutions it's no exception, since it has the best special effects ever seen on a movie. All of these can be confirmed when you watch the &quot;special features DVD&quot; (which, by the way, is loaded with tons of cool extras) that comes with the movie, where you can see some of the amazing and exhausting job that all the team did to make us &quot;believe the unbelievable&quot;. So, don't you think it's unbelievable that The LOR won the &quot;special effects&quot; award? I do, but I also think now that most of these &quot;award shows&quot; are just that: Shows.<br />Give it a try and decide for yourself.

B000066NW0|2.0|Reviewer Hilary Miller states (about Avril Lavigne) &quot;They think she's so edgy and punk just because she wears sloppy clothes and poses with her guitar&quot;, while attempting to laud the so-so talent that is Liz Phair. Some might even think that Lavigne is a sugar-coated, much younger version of Liz, but...Certainly not a fan of Avril's by any means, but the last time I looked at a Liz Phair album cover, wearing sloppy clothes and posing with her guitar (see Liz Phair: Liz Phair) was EXACTLY what Ms. Phair was doing. Surely a case of the pot calling the kettle black, but no matter...Neither Liz Phair's self-absorption nor Avril Lavigne's immature whininess belong in my cd collection. If you want to hear a woman who can truly sing, without all the hyperbole and trumped-up &quot;rock-n-roll&quot; attitude, go buy yourself a Kate Bush album...SHE can sing, write AND dance circles around either one of the aforementioned bimbos any day of the week (Liz Phair's saving grace is that she KNOWS she's never been in the same class as Kate).

1592400876|2.0|A book like this has needed to be written for a while. It's not a definitive guide to punctuation by any means, but it it aims to be a readble, fairly thorough romp through the little squiggles that make language intelligible.<br />It's just such a shame that it had to be written by Lynn Truss, whose voice throughout is spiked with a false sense of bon homie and a very real smarminess. I heard her on the radio recently and she ain't funny in person at all, so why try in print?<br />And another thing, she's pictured posing on the back flap about to add an apostrophe to an advertisement for the film 'Two Weeks Notice'. Why didn't she? I get the sense that all her talk of 'zero tolerance' and ambitions of literary militias are strictly posing as well.
B000002UAU|5.0|There's still not one album in the world that can compare to this masterpiece, it stands strong, #1 on Rollingstone.com, This album provides many different styles of music, as well as their other masterpieces &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot;, and of course &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. The Beatles were one of the first bands to introduce Rock to the world, it's almost hard to believe this great music was made such a long time ago. This review isn't very long, but I just thought I'd give my props to this stunning album. Pick it up today!
B00005AQF7|1.0|Through the deluge of what is obviously an inability to communicate through anything other than profanity, it is evident that the only thing going for this &quot;artist&quot; is his oozing gangster appeal. It is oozing through the speakers. If you do not listen, you are in danger, yo. And I am shaking in my boots.<br />It took me years to summon the courage to write this review. And now that I have, I feel very relieved. I feel that it is my duty as your fellow brother to warn you of this: there is no obvious talent, stream-of-consciousness words are scrawled onto bits of toilet tissue and set against a skeletal backdrop provided by what sounds like a Casio Keyboard. Then, when the finished product spews it's way out of the dope-smokey studio room(s), it is taken in truckloads to the eager, clutching, fumbling hands of the minions, clad in their phAt (fat?) baggy-yo (larger than necessary) jackets and pants, and consumed in copious amounts. Be it a party, a gathering, a drive-by, or a lonely reflection, this album serves it's purpose: I use it as a coaster.
B00003CXE7|5.0|After forty years the Epic Roman film is revised and reborn in unmatched magnificence. The new age of the ancient world in film arises under the vision of Ridley Scott and presents us with the Oscar winning star making performance by Russell Crowe.<br />  Now that we have the wonders of computer graphics there is no place that film makers can not take us and no world past, present of future they can not create in ways that would a few years ago proven cost prohibitive.<br />  The demise of the ancient Epic of the early 60's may have been in part due to the fact that to recreate Rome, Greece, or Egypt with any degree of splendor studios had to build full sized sets and people them with thousands of extras. See as superb examples of this real time expensive film style illustrated in \\"Cleopatra\\" 1963 or \\"The Fall of the Roman Empire\\" 1964 (Which has many parallels to \\"Gladiator\\"). But today we can revisit this old genre and make it exciting and new with our technological advancements in film.<br />  Scott and his collaborators have given new life and spawned a new generation of epic such as the upcoming \\"Troy\\" and \\"Alexander\\" with this impressive and exciting film.<br />  The only thing I found disturbing in the recreation of Rome was that it was painted in terracotta's and blacks. I would have preferred to see the riot of color that Rome actually was. But beyond this nitpicking I am thrilled by what I see on the screen.<br />  But for the first time viewer there awaits the visceral impact of Russell Crowe's creation of Maximus.  Truly a star turn that few actors of his generation could achieve. He fills the screen, the film, the very era with authority, strength, and even tenderness and proves here that there is nothing this fine talent cannot do. With Maximus he transfigures his screen persona to the Elysium of the greats such as Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable, and Paul Newman.<br />  Scott has surrounded his star with stellar supporting performers who add to the film with talent and in some cases just the right touch of humor.<br />  The music by Hans Zimmer, which by now is much imitated in TV miniseries of late, recalls the greatness of Rozsa and Alex North and adds dimension and scope to the picture.<br />  The cinematography by John Mathieson, particularly in the opening scenes in Germania is of such skill and beauty that the viewer is transported to the 1st Century A.D.<br />  The DVD is chock full of wonderful extras including a hilarious parody trailer for \\"Chicken Run\\" (this is an Easter egg. Just look for the Roman eagle on Richard Harris' breastplate.)<br />  \\"Gladiator\\" is a supreme effort and well deserving of it's many laurels.talent and in some cases just the right touch of humor. <BR>   The music by Hans Zimmer, which by now is much imitated in TV miniseries of late, recalls the greatness of Rozsa and Alex North and adds dimension and scope to the picture. <BR>  The cinematography by John Mathieson, particularly in the opening scenes in Germania is of such skill and beauty that the viewer is transported to the 1st Century A.D. <BR>  The DVD is chock full of wonderful extras including a hilarious parody trailer for \\"Chicken Run\\" (this is an Easter egg.

B000002H33|1.0|I believe that in this day and age, the term 'genius' is being used far too loosely. Since when did this apply to 4 would-be-mechanics, whose main artistic feat thus far is breaking the record for smallest pair of pants squeezed into, and most horse-like haircut? I am appalled. I haven't even touched on the 'music' yet.<br />The 'music'? Well, if you believe that many painful minutes of buzzsaw guitars combined with a drummer, adding unnecessary fills to satisfy his vanity, combined with the monotonous roar of...a...horse in pain (or so it seems), is genius, well then YOU need to look in the mirror...and ask..<br />...why... do I look just like my idols?<br />Nay!<br />It gets a star for the front cover.

B00006RAKP|3.0|While I thought the 2-CD &quot;Very Best of Elton John&quot; from 1990 missed quite a few gems, I feel it was a much better compilation than this effort.  What we have here is also a 2-CD set, but there are many hits missing, despite their being room for them.  For example, on Disc 2 they have put what I call &quot;fillers&quot; or songs which were minor hits like &quot;This Train Don't Stop&quot; or &quot;I Want Love&quot;.  On the Australian edition, they've put on his duet with Blue for &quot; Sorry seems to be the hardest word&quot;.  Once again, this space could have been better used, since this reworking was not a hit in Australia. <br />Where are the classics such as &quot;Blue Eyes&quot;, &quot;Empty Garden&quot;, &quot;Mama Cant Buy You Love&quot; and the true classic &quot;Border Song&quot;.  Not to be found on this CD yet all were greatest hits.<br />This is not a definitive compilation by any means.  To date, no Elton John compilation has been.  It should be noted that the UK edition of this CD contains an even different and longer track list ... and could be considered closer to the mark.
B00000JCB2|1.0|As it has become painfully obvious to my contemporaries that I only bother to review bands and/or albums that I loathe, I will now launch into a scathing criticism on both this band and this album.<br />This is a bloated and conceited effort at venting, through the eyes of a fourteen year old, the troubles and turmoils of the modern middle-aged man. Surrounded by, if not drowning in, a sea of mediocre musical masturbation, we hear a complacent Durst whinge and whine his way through a maelstrom of real-life issues such as fumbling first sexual experience, anger, hatred, disgust, boobs, girlfriends who cheat and the like.<br />The only reason this album is worth pursuing is the guitarist, and he left, and good on him. <br />I sold this album on the flea market. And like a flea, it is minute, will irritate you, and takes weeks to rid yourself of.<br />I am the dog.
B000002AS3|5.0|This was just their debut. Most of the good bands around mature, grow. Most of them get criticized for it. Why? I don't know -really-. This is the beggining of a great band, and like the band itself, it is amazing. No Beatles-remaking here: this is a sound that shocked the world, the sound of a very creative mind with some good musical influences (Noel Gallagher). How's that sound? Well, imagine some rocking guitars combined with cymbal-driven drums and the arrogant and irresistible vocals of the hysterical Liam Gallagher. A lot of cigarretes and alcohol through the album, but mostly fun and un-understandable lyrics that talk about a girl called Elsa who's &quot;into Alka Seltzer, and sniffs it through a cane in a supersonic train&quot; and stuff like that. Really, really, a classic of 90's rock.
0060574216|4.0|Some time ago my wife and I were had a big fight. It left each one of us feeling as the offended party, and waiting for the other to apologize: I thought she kept complaining about everything I did, she felt I did not care about her. Really angry, I bought the book, and after reading a few pages I was able to understand her point of view. As soon as I tried to explain how she felt (not why), we got out of the cycle.<br />The book has very helpful insights. The author mentions that differences get stronger when people are in a close relationship, and almost disappear when people have been single for a while. I agree: I'd recommend the book to newlyweds after they start disagreeing about trivial stuff, but not during their honeymoon.<br />Why, then, four stars only? Because the first few chapters are much more useful than the last ones; I don't agree completely with the book; the Mars-Venus analogy gets tiresome: I'd rather read: &quot;Men do this, Women do that&quot; instead of &quot;Martians do this, Venusians do that&quot;; and finally, the author incesantly promotes his other books and products throughout the book.<br />In spite of those issues that made it a little less enjoyable, the book has really helped me improve my marriage, and I highly recommend it.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|My Peter Pan movie review -- <br />I have been waiting forever for this DVD to come out...now its out...FINALLY. <br />First things first - Trailers. The trailers should be like any other movie, you can just easily press the menu button and let it take you there. But I guess Universal wants to promote their other 2 big movies &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; and &quot;Two Brothers&quot; <br />Then we're shown flying to Neverland with clips from the movie. The main title consists of &quot;Play movie&quot; &quot;Bonus features&quot; &quot;Set up&quot; and &quot;Scenes&quot; the first thing I clicked was BONUS FEATURES. <br />Then Tinkerbell flies us to the bonus features menu with 5 options - &quot;The Pirate's Ship&quot;, &quot;The Black Castle&quot;, &quot;The Darling House&quot;, &quot;The neverland forest&quot;, and &quot;The Home underground&quot; I'll just go one by one down the list <br />&quot;The Pirate's ship&quot; shows the children atop the clouds then zooms into the Jolly Roger, playing &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; from the soundtrack. You get an inside look onto the making of the ship, through the eyes of captain hook which takes you through Jason Isaac's POV camera, and you get to meet the other cast members and learn many things. The Pirates Vs. the lost boys is which is better -- pirates or lost boys? I vote lost boys :D and also the lost pirate song which sounds like it wouldn't go with the movie. 3 songs for Jason? Ack <br />&quot;The Black Castle&quot; plays the ending of &quot;Mermaids&quot; and has the picture of the Black Castle in the background and has options to see them making the black castle. Learning to fly is kind of self explanatory. You get to see the inside look on how the harness and the blue screens work. The Mermaids tale I personally enjoyed because the mermaids are all eery looking and could give you nightmares for months <br />&quot;The Darling House&quot; doesn't play anything from the soundtrack :( they of course have the alternate ending, in which Peter takes Jane to Neverland with him. No music, bad editing. I didn't like it lol. The doghouse scene is obviously for little children...I didn't really like it. It wouldn't work, except that it shows he's &quot;brave&quot;, thinking of others before himself. Me and my shadow I found REALLY interesting. I loved how they showed how they did the shadow work with Aunt Millicent -- one of my favorite scenes. It's too bad the shadow doesnt really look like Peter as my being thrown off by the spikey hair. In the dog house with nana is cool too, how they trained them to slip around and &quot;carry&quot; a boy down the hallway into the bathtub. It makes me feel like crap with my dogs who don't even know how to sit for more than 5 minutes lol. <br />&quot;Neverland forest&quot; plays &quot;Flying&quot; from the soundtrack and you're shown in the neverland forest. You get to see what they do to make the forest, the insider on Ludvigne aka Tinkerbell, the insider on the fairies and the fairy dance (another favorite scene) and the I do believe in fairies scene! I also liked learning what Tiger Lily says in that indian language to Hook at that one point. <br />&quot;Home Under the ground&quot; not really interesting...plays one of my favorite tracks &quot;Flying Jolly Roger&quot; I didn't get the time to watch most of the Sarah Ferguson thing but I will ASAP. The duchess's outtakes should be the movie outtakes that'd be a little more interesting...sorry to Ferguson fans but I'm sure most of you might agree. I liked watching them make the home and the interviews with the lost boys <br />The movie is the same as always - I love it! Even more now that I can watch it every time I want to without having to drive 5 miles and spend 10 dollars. I hope next time I can get widescreen. I was so excited I didn't check the label until I got home and it said full screen. Now there's 5 lost boys LOL
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have just bought the complete series on DVD in the UK on a whim as I had never heard of the show, despite being a very big sci-fi fan of other US shows.  This was the best and most impressive and fresh concept I have ever seen and for the money I paid I consider it a real bargain.<br />I can barely believe that they cancelled it but hope that it will somehow survive and prosper as it deserves to do so for so many reasons, not least of which is the inspired casting.  What a crying shame it will be if we don't get to see the story develop.<br />Good luck with the movie.<br />Tim Simmons<BR>London, England
0446677450|5.0|There are three types of people who will read this book:<BR>1. The ones who like it but don't get it<BR>2. The ones who bash it but don't get it<BR>3. The ones that truly get the point and change their lives<br />To write books which simply expose the basic concepts of how financially-independent people think and drill these basic ideas into your head through repetitive story telling is genius.  People complain about the lack of a specific outline of steps and the repetitive nature of the writing.  These are the principles which make these books work.      <br />As a side note, I'm very perplexed by people who have read John T. Reed's picky and vindictive attack on these books and come away calling it 'insiteful'.  Reed's web site reads like the unibomber's manifesto.  If you know nothing of Kiwosaki's books, Reed's books, Investing, or real estate you would still have to question Reed's comments on the style of writing and logic he chooses to use alone.
B000002UCN|4.0|This is simply a song-for-song re-issue of the 1976 lp. It contains some of his Beatles songs and some of his pre-1976 solo works. He had several hits post-1976, so an update of this or an all new complete greatest hits package is long overdue. That's not to say that this isn't a good cd, it is, but it is woefully incomplete. Hopefully they will come out with a truly comprehensive greatest hits collection in the near future (as has been done for John Lennon and Paul McCartney & Wings).
0684833395|1.0|With the United States currently in a position of faltering patriotism, Catch 22 was a very difficult book to read.  I felt that it transcended time boundaries, and the horror of war that Heller effectively described in World War II could be held applicable to the current situation our country is in.  Through humor and circular logic, Heller accurately portrays the concept behind Catch 22 as not just being a military law, but how those with power can justify their actions over the powerless.  Each character Heller introduces to the reader is easy to relate to, for each represents a different type of conflict that each individual undergoes in his or her life.  Milo Minderbinder's character represents the temptation of big business and profit which still drives and corrupts people to this very day.  The chaplain, representing the loss of religious faith when faced with the hard circumstances of life and war, relates to many people in their questioning of a God in the midst of hatred, terrorism, and useless death.  Colonel Cathcart, representing corrupt military and governmental bureaucracy, is a portrayal of how many people in life desire to uphold their status and power at the expense of those below them in the social ladder.  Lastly there is Yossarian, a character portrayed by Heller to be both crazy and pitiable, is motivated in his actions solely by his longing to survive and his right to life.  <BR> What impressed me the most about this book was Heller's complicated writing style which was in itself a tool to portray to the reader the ridiculousness of the whole justification and reason behind the concept of Catch 22.  Whereas Heller uses the military law prohibiting bombardiers from avoiding flying combat missions as the actual embodiment of the Catch 22 trap, Heller's haphazard writing style and interaction between characters is a Catch 22 in itself.  In this way, Heller makes Catch 22 extend beyond the war to apply to life itself, and the traps that we encounter in our journey to save ourselves amidst tough circumstances.<BR>Heller succeeds tremendously in giving a moving portrayal of the atrocities of war while maintaining a humorous and satirical tone.  The reader will go through ups and downs, from laughing at the ridiculous dialogue between characters to being shocked by the useless death of many of the characters due to the inevitable death occurring in war.  Though I was confused most of the time through the circular logic Heller portrays throughout the novel to emphasize the trapping quality of Catch 22, at the end of the book I was horrified and moved by how World War II can destroy people's lives.
B000148KK2|2.0|THIS IS CLEARLY NOT THE KRALL I AM USED TO OR EXPECTED ON THIS CD.  <BR>ON MOST TRACKS IT SEEMS AS IF SHE TOOK A PARAGRAPH FROM A MICKEY SPILANE NOVEL AND TRIED TO ADD MUSIC TO IT.  IT DOESNT WORK.  MELODIES ARE HARD TO FOLLOW, LYRICS (BY THE WAY, ARE WRITTEN BY HER NEW SPOUSE, ELVIS COSTELLO???)MAKE LITTLE SENSE.  <BR>KRALL, LET'S GET BACK TO COVERING THE STANDARDS LIKE YOU DO SO WELL WITH YOUR BAND.  UNTIL THEN, YOU ARE OFF OF MY BUY LIST.<br />GORDON
B00008S2VG|5.0|love it, intervention classic madonna song ,a differnt type of love  ballad.the music is diffrent , madonna always stay true to herself and express her self differently as the times and her state of mind reflects. nothing fails, mother father, holly wood all great songs. the album works as a whole. she gets 5 stars as she does not play it safe. she talks about the the times and how she feels and the music is experimental. love u madonna  hook me up.
B00004XOWM|5.0|this is my favorite album of all time. i remember i got it for christmas a few years ago and i still listen to it all the time. i remember the guy who plays gutar for them left the band, but i can't remember his name. awesome gutar player. a new guy, whos name i don't remember is with them now though. however, what really makes this album great is Fred Durst. He is the best singer in metal music in my opinion. he has awesum rhymes and is very cool. if you don't like this album, you dont like metal music, end of story. get this and get linkin park 'meteora' for two awesum metal cds. get their older cd 'signifigant other', that's thier sexond best cd. peace
B000075BFK|5.0|Fantastic album from the greatest MC ever. From start to finish it's a solid effort. And Amaru Records did a great job on this one. My only and ONLY beef with it, is they remixed the track with BCC. That original track was already an underground classic! And should have NEVER been touched. But.. they're still building his discography. None better. Period. GRAB THIS ALBUM!!<BR>NOW!!!!!<BR>2pac is timeless. Dude is STILL relevant with his work till this day. Yet another reason why the world will never forget him.
B000084T18|5.0|50 Cent Iz my favorite rapper eva. He's got awesome Flow and his beatz and lyrixxx are the best. My Fav songz on dis Cd are &quot;in da club&quot; and &quot;21 questions&quot;. I llisten to this CD almost evry day and there are no bad songs on this so if u don't own it, get it now. i also recommend getting chingy 'jackpot' if you don't have it yet, for real rap. if you want real metal, get linkin park 'meteora', limpbizkit 'chocolate starfish and the hot tog falvored water' or better yet, get them all!!!!11!!!
B00008J4P5|4.0|I must say that Mr. Eoin & thebluetape have given debatable reviews about this album, but the fact that most tracks are soo catchy is exactly what has made this album soo damn good. Never underestimate the power of simplicity, even though Meg does sound like a beginner drummer. Personally, \\"Elephant\\" wore off quickly, but I will never forget the sexy feeling \\"Ball & Biscuit\\" gave me the first time I heard it. It's a great song to strip to! \\"Hardest Button to Button\\" & \\"In The Cold, Cold Night\\" are groovin' catchy songs aswell & I will forever keep putting this album back into my cd player when those songs pop back into my head. I've unfortunatly missed out on the oppurtunity to see The White Stripes live when they came to my town but I heard they put on a very loud & fantastic show. I, unfortuantly, think The White Stripes will fade away, if they do not beat (it shouldn't be too hard) what they accomplished on \\"Elephant\\" (they just need to try & attain more abstract musical construction) or they will always remain the little rock band that could.
B000088E6P|1.0|I love 50 cent and i love this cd, however, i think it was kind of dumb to make a version of the album which has no curse words on it. i didn't see the point of that. i own the dirty version and it's a million times greater. i give the dirty version five stars, but i only give the Clean version one star out of five. the dirty version is the greatess rap album evr. that and 'jackpot' by chingy. for real good metal albums, buy limpbizkit 'Chocolate Starfish and the hotdog flavored water' and or linkin park 'meteora'.
0385510438|2.0|I enjoy Grisham. The man can tell a story! But this time, it was a slow, boring story. This is even worse than Bleachers. It's predictable, it's uneventful,.....<BR>Very disappointing.
B000002H2H|1.0|I went to a friend's house to take back the copy of limp bizkit 'results may vary' he had borrowed off of me. then his older brother came home with this cd. we listened to it and I didn't like it at all. I mean, I like a feew of mettalica's songs, such s I disappear and enter sandman, but i didnt like this album, not even a little bit. go and buys ome real metal instead.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Jerry Seinfeld was on the Jay Leno show on May 12th, 2004 and announced that the \\"Seinfeld DVD's\\", assuming he ment the first Season, would be released in November of 2004. Great News!! He said that the actors have added a lot of \\"extras\\" to the episode with commentraies and documentaries of each episode, which is why it has taken so long to produce.
B0000CABBW|4.0|This is one of those rare movies that really qualify as &quot;family entertainment&quot; -- suitable for kids and grown-ups alike. It's touching without being sappy, and you learn a fair amount about the Maori culture in New Zealand as the movie unfolds.  Definitely worth watching, and worth buying if you have youngsters in your household.
B00007KMP1|5.0|This review is of the 5.1 SACD mix specifically.  When I received this disc in the mail, my girlfriend happened to be at my place, so I popped it in my SACD player.  Upon hearing the first few chords I noticed my girlfriend was fully absorbed in this music.  Her ears perked up and she was mesmerized.  I joined her on the couch and we both just sat there and listed to the entire album all the way through.  That is the only time in my life that I have sat still in my house and listened to an entire album.  <br />My favorite songs on this album are 5, 3, and 1, although the first six tracks are all winners but for track 2.  The rest of the album is less memorable.<br />If you have an SACD system and are dying to flex its muscle I highly recommend this disc.
B0000A36J5|5.0|I've already reviewed the original version of \\"The Two Towers\\" but I can't help but feel compelled to give my views on the \\"Extended Edition Collector's Gift Set\\" which is by far the greatest DVD set that has ever been made along side the \\"Gift Set\\" edition of \\"The Fellowship of The Rings\\".<br />The movie itself is a stunning masterpiece but The extended edition of TTT virtually renders the theatrical edition almost irrevelent to me because the newly incorporated footage, all 43 minutes of it, virtually expands the entire scope of an already great epic and the new footage gives this movie a whole new look from my perspective. No offense to whose who like the theatrical edition, it's still amazing, but it's almost like cut up compared the the \\"Extended Edition\\". Many scenes which seemed unimportant are greatly expanded and there are also some new scenes which are completely left out of the theatrical DVD edition one of which was very heartbreaking but I'm not going to say what it is out of fear of spoiling it.<br /> The first two DVDs contain excellent commentary by Peter Jackson, by the design crew, and also by the stellar 16 member cast of this stunning masterpiece. Even then, there's also lots more of what's on them than just what I mentioned.<br /> The third and fourth DVDs however are the real treats! As for all of the many fans including myself out there who are baffled and awe-struck at how they could possibly have made such an incredible epic movie like this, well these third and fourth DVDs delve deep into the making of this movie. The documentaries contained are absolutely stunning and worth watching over and over again! The humongous scope of the massive work done with making all of the many things for this movie is phenomenal and beyond imagination! Would you believe all of the hard work that was put into making not just the movie but even the movie sets themselves. I have never before seen such a mind-blowing `behind the scenes' DVD like the \\"Gift Set\\" edition. Both the third and fourth discs are enough to warrant buying this awesome Gift Set. There are so many more treats on this gift Set that I could never do this DVD any justice with this review nor do I want to spoil it.<br /> This set also comes with a statue of Gollum which is actually quite cool and makes for good decorative use for my desktop and also a fifth DVD of artwork of Gollum and how the statue of him was made but it's not a whole lot to write home about in my opinion  but even if you just get the `regular' \\"Extended Edition\\" you have no idea of the many, MANY Easter Eggs that are found on this set. This set may be a bit on the expensive side but trust me, this item is worth more than the price tag slapped on it. Just the box packaging is worth keeping forever! The bottom line: I say get this DVD and throw out the VHS!!<br /> Okay, I'll stop here but before I go, I just want to say thank you to Peter Jackson and the entire crew for not only creating three stunning masterpieces but also putting out incredible DVD sets for \\"The Two Towers\\"t\\" edition.

B00006JIA4|4.0|Although this is by no means a &quot;definitive&quot; collection it is a good introduction to those who may be new to Queens music, and a worthy addition to any existing fans home library. The chronological format demonstrates well the broad range of the bands talents, and their ability to grow and adapt to the music scene around them, coming back contantly into the charts for over 30 years. Gifted multi talented musicians in their own right, and long time friends, the flawless studio session reproduction is superb, the band who bragged about never using synthesizers (until the mid 80's when they had to give in)used a host of intruments and music styles throughout their long career, and after the tragic loss of Freddie Mercury in the 90's, consolidated their material, and added some new versions. The third disc is more eclectic, and although not personally my favorite has some good covers of the bands songs (with their participation) by other well known artists, as well as the excellent Under Pressue &amp; Barcelona, and almost painfully bittersweet These are the Days of Our Lives. At under $30 for a 51 track anthology this really is GREAT value, and a timeless collection that will continue to enthrall each subsequent generation of listeners.
B000092Q8M|5.0|Six years after the 1986 commercial breakthrough SO, Gabriel returned in 1992 with the follow-up album US. This album unlike SO is brighter and has a lot more worldly sounds than SO. The theme of this album is alot like Phil Collins underrated album Both Sides which came out the following year after this one. The thing that in my opinion makes US a little better than Both Sides is that while US has very similar themes to Both Sides, US has warmth and a bit more depth where as while Both Sides is also an amazing album it sometimes is a bit cold and dreary in atmosphere.<br />Enought about the US vs. Both Sides ranting. This 1992 album while it is generally melancholy in sound it has it's share of humor. US finds Pete embracing the colorful worldly African sounds but not forgetting his rock roots. Steam was the big hit off this CD and with a video that in my opinion surpasses it's companion video Sledgehammer by a hair mainly because of the more cutting-edge technology. Steam is alot like Sledgehammer with lots of the trumpets, humor, creativity, and sex appeal. However on the flip side there are some very melancholy tunes like the gentle Washing Of The Water and the eerie 14 Black Paintings which I consider to be the echoing effects of Passion. Overall though, this CD isn't very dark and is actually quite joyous in spite of it's moody content. The album closes with the warmth and joyous atmosphere of the final track Secret World. Love To Be Loved is absolutely gorgeous with a very dramatic melody not all that dissimilar to Red Rain although maybe not as intense. Overall in fact, I think that US is actually brighter and less ominous than SO and while I think UP is a bit more consistent, US has some warmth, and joy that is mostly missing off that dark masterpiece.<br />This album was very well produced but the remastering improves it and brings out more dimensional details in the music, especially on Digging In The Dirt, and Washing Of The Water. In fact, it's so well improved in the remastering that it almost feels like a new Peter Gabriel album.<br />The limited edition digipak that the remastered edition was packaged in, is inferior to the older jewelcase cover. The digipak is mostly made of some kind of cardboard paper and there is little if any difference in the liner notes between the limited digipak and the regular clear jewel case. Also what's wrong is that when the hinge in digipak breaks, there's no way to replace it like a regular CD jewelcase. I have no idea why they still release CDs with this idiotic packaging design nor do I see any appeal in the flimsy design of the digipak.<br />Sadly, there aren't any bonus tracks included on here. I would've been more than happy to hear the hidden gems that Gabriel recorded but did not put on the album. It also would've been better to hear outtake or alternate demos of the songs. In fact, I think the limited edition should've done that, have bonus material included. Geffen should've looked at Tears For Fears first three albums being re-issued with the bonus tracks and liner notes. Unfortunately, there aren't liner notes telling about the history of the albums making either.<br />A great album that was poorly handled in it's re-issue, US is nonetheless another greal album that deserves a place in every PG fans' collection. At least it didn't have the track list reshuffled like SO was. It's a pity that the re-issuing couldn't have been better than it was.improved in the remastering that it almost feels like a new Peter Gabriel album. <br />The limited edition digipak that the remastered edition was packaged in, is inferior to the older jewelcase cover.

0553275976|4.0|I can understand how this book was such a milestone. True genius, in the journalistic style--for portraying so well the status and money-obsessed nature of New York, which still holds true today. Wolfe does a terrific, and I mean really terrific, job at describing the city's political climate and how easily people can be taken advantage of once power and money are thrown into the mix. <BR>Each character's intense need to better his or her own situation is at the center of how each of them relate to the story. In that, the story is essentially a description of how five New Yorkers cross paths and manage to further and better their personal situations, at the expense of a rich Wall Street trader's criminal mistake and inward feelings of guilt. Even though Sherman McCoy's character is portrayed as your typical snooty financial industry professional, the way in which he is brought down is dismaying in itself. He is used as a scapegoat for the ills of the White Establishment by a crooked, black political figure (using the hypocrisy of the church to better himself); used as &quot;the Great White Defendant&quot; by an insecure, self-critical assistant DA to make his career as a trial lawyer; used as centerpiece of a tabloid story to build a shallow, alcoholic reporter's journalist career; used to displace blame  by a promiscuous, sleek money-hungry trophy wife...  The Bonfire shows the lengths people will go to in order to get ahead and the lack of underlying trust for others, irregardless of money and status. The book is a lesson in city life, opportunism, greed, and a fundamental lesson in our very nature and how we operate, in the strict, economic sense of the term. <BR>In another vein, the plot takes some movie-like twists and turns that dont necessarily work well in writing. Overall, an amazing piece of work, but seems very well suited to the screen more than anything else...I still have to rent the movie!!! Overall, a gripping and very accurate rendition of the citylives we all dream of living.
B00005JMEW|4.0|... but we should le him make some more movies first. I admit anyone who even watches this is probably a little messed up, but oh well. This movie is fantastic, loads of awesome stunts, great action, and interesting plot. Although at times it could be a little boring, or a little too bizarre for me. It was still a wonderful movie! Everyone (provided they're old enough to handle it) should see it! And don't forget volume 2!
B000001XN2|5.0|This is a fabulous Trovatore but the &quot;Spotlight Reviewer&quot; seems not to know the opera at all! The heroine of &quot;Il Trovatore&quot; is called LEONORA, not ELVIRA. He wrote his review to bash Maria Callas who is still the greatest Leonora to this day. (I'm quoting PRICE here!) <br />Anyway, Price, Corelli and Simionato made MAGIC here. Not to be missed!
0316666343|2.0|Although I read this book in Spanish I agree with those people who think that it was, generally speaking, a very good beginning and a very bad ending. Is an example about what a writer shouldn't do with a good idea. Ms. Sebold had the characters in her hands and made up a very sympathetic heaven. She had it all, so I don't know why she spoiled it. Unfortunately she betrayed her own work by rising up some ingenuous ghost like Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in \\"Ghost\\".<br />  In the end: the winners take nothing.
B000002LRX|5.0|Faith No More, with out them many bands now adays (Papa Roach for example) would not be around. Their third (?) album, Angel Dust, is quite different then their previous release &quot;The Real Thing.&quot; and their last (?) album &quot;King for a Day: Fool for a Life Time&quot; in fact at times this album could be considered a &quot;Novelty&quot; album. There are many notable songs on this disc, the main track &quot;Land of Sunshine&quot; actually features a &quot;Conversation&quot; between a Psychiatrist and his Paitent and has Mike Patton's mad man laguther. The track  Midlife Crisis features a line that is very interesting and easy to remember &quot;Your perfect, yes its true, but without me you're only you.&quot; amazing track. A rather paculiar track is R.V. a balad about a middle aged white trash guy.<br />Overall this album is amazing, and features tracks that fans of hard rock would like, and tracks fans of rap would like.<br />I suguest this album to all. AND! it has a great price.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|As long as you have a decent cd player!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|The first time I saw this movie it was funny. With actors like Mke Myers and Eeddy Murephy was a hit. Then add Camron and John it was very funny. <br />I rate this a five because even now I will watch it again and again. And I also garuntee that I will be one of the first 100 people to watch Sherk2 opening May 21st. <br />Yes Really, Really.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Never hearing any of her music because I am an ole hippie and listen to Eagles ect. all I can say is WOW! I had the TV on while I was on my laptop one night and the song &quot;The Voice Within&quot; caught my full attention. Just the first few words. I stopped everything and was amazed at who was singing this song.<br />Had to have it, so out I went to buy the CD not expecting to like another song on it. WAS I WRONG! It is now one of my favorites and stays in the CD player. &quot;Walk Away&quot; is another excellent song. In lyric, voice and words this one has it all. The depth of this CD is amazing and painfully raw.<br />Forget the bubblegum marketing of what was, take a look and listen to the stripped soul of what is. Keep it up on this level. I have new faith in what they call music today.
B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden wrote and recorded many great songs. Perhaps my favorites are songs like The Rhime of the Ancient Mariner, based on the Coleridge poem of the same name, Alexander the Great, and To Tame a Land. These epics told stories while combining a landscape of top notch instrumentals. Truly Maiden is one of best metal bands period.
1878424319|5.0|During and after this book my life has evolved and continues. I can no longer look at another person and *blame them* for the misery that was/is my life. I will not let another person's *black magic* [negative] words influence me to become angry. I have broken the agreement that says I must absorb what you say. One of the Four Agreements that states this outright is that what anyone else says is never about me. [Don't take ANYTHING personally.] What another person says is the mirror of their own dream, not mine. I have several new agreements today because of this book, rooting them in four.<br />I have learned that when I apply [after understanding why I *should* apply] them my life is in a different universe. My serenity and peace of mind and comfort in dealings in all situations - particularly where malcontent people are concerned, has increased and reached into all areas of my life and I thank Mr. Ruiz' book for this.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This miniseries is incredible. From start to finish, I was in complete awe during all ten parts. It is difficult to comprehend what it must have been like for those young men to go to war. They certainly possessed a courage that I don't think I have. You get to know many of the soldiers throughout the miniseries, and your heart breaks when they die. This series does not glorify war, but instead depicts all of the horrors that actually take place during wartime.<br />I highly recommend &quot;Band of Brothers.&quot; The DVD set is great because it has bonus features, including interviews with the real-life soldiers who were depicted in the series. Sixty years later, these men still get choked up when they recall their time of war. Just seeing this raw emotion and knowing how it has affected them all these years later is very touching. It certainly makes me appreciate all the more the sacrifices that they made for our country.
0064407667|4.0|The Baudelaire siblings are enjoying a day at the beach when Mr. Poe comes walking through the fog to find them.  He has very bad news.  Their house has burned to the ground and their parents are dead.  To honor their father's wishes, they are sent to live with Count Olaf across town.  He treats them like slaves.  But that's just the beginning.  He also wants to take over their trust fund, and will stop at nothing to do so.<br />I really didn't know what to think about this series.  But some friends highly recommended it to me, so I decided to give it a try.  And I'm glad I did.  This book is rather dark for a kid's book, with lots of sarcasm and dark humor, as well as some tragic events.  It does require a certainly level of maturity to be appreciated by kids or adults.  I was really taken with the kids, however.  Violet and Klaus pull together and don't let anything stop them from trying to make the most of a bad situation.  I wish more people, including me, were like that.  And Sunny constantly made me smile with her sudden outbursts.  The set up of the plot was fairly obvious to me, but I didn't see the ending coming before it happened.  My only real complaint was the narrator's habit of interrupting a story to define a word that had just been used.  It got annoying seeing this on every few pages.<br />Take the warning on the back seriously.  These are dark books.  But they are certainly enjoyable as well.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears is the Britny Fox of her generation. Not that she's as hairy as the O.G. original Britny), but they're both users of tushy wipes and the music industry. Like Britny Fox, Ms. Spears(Mrs. Spears for a day, until she realized she didn't want to spend the rest of her life making croissant rolls for her childhood friend hubby meister hunker burger) is fat. With a ph(d). But I can tell you about how I had a kiss-off on stage at one of their concerts(actually, it was on the \\"Whoomp, Here We Are\\" tour)and later gave a duct tape wedding ring to the skinny one(can't remember names too wel). I kissde him under the milky twilight(NOT the milky way candy bar!). I like him.

0140288503|5.0|&quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; by Mark Bowden was one of the best war book that I have read. The story is a true story about 500 American soilders and Marines who go to Somalia(Which is located in east Africa) to bring food to all the starving people but War Lord Mohammed Farid Aidid siezes control of the ports where the Americans are giving the food to the people. Mohammed is taking the food to his army. The Americans come and try to arrest some of Mohammed's top Officers. Everything was going as planned. They were ready to transport the prisoners until Wolcott Black Hawk was shot downand 100 American soldiers were pinned down against 1000 angry Somalians. They set up a perimitor around the crash site untill Mike Durrant Black Hawk was hit  and they had two blawk hawks in the city and now the whole city is against them. If you want to hear more you should read this book. This is a good book for anybody who likes true storys or war books. Personally, I think it was the best war book I have ever read.
014028009X|3.0|I'm glad I read Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging before reading Bridget Jones's Diary. The parody is far more entertaining the National Bestseller. Where I could relate to Georgia and laugh at her 14 year old views of the world and dating, Bridget as a 30ish naive diary writer comes off as self obsessed and pathetic.
0140177396|5.0|This book is one of the classics of American literature, and it's easy to see why. Rarely in history has so perfect a novel been written, has an author so brilliantly made use of language and story, have characters so vivid and human and real been created. This does not mean merely Lennie and George, but the secondary characters as well; any of them could have their own novel, so complete has Steinbeck made them. Even Curley's wife, who is not even given a name, comes to life for the reader in ways that few authors can achieve. The ending will leave you breathless and overwhelmed.<br />The story? Simplicity itself. Two men, seeking something better than they have, bound by friendship in a world where such a thing is rare in the extreme. It's a theme that resonates at the very definition of humanity itself, and which Steinbeck handles with the touch of a master.<br />It is hard to rate such a book; it deserves ten stars. There are other good books about friendship out there, but fine though these may be, they will forever be in the shadow of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;. Steinbeck's was one Nobel Prize that was unquestionably deserved.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is, in my opinion, the most historically important album ever released.  This album revolutionized the rock and roll industry; often imitated but never duplicated, it continues to exert a significant influence on the very business of singing and recording music.  Even the timing of the album was perfect; the year was 1967, the Summer of Love, and this album captured the spirit of the times in such an amazing fashion that other recording artists immediately recognized the profound significance of what the Beatles had just succeeded in doing.  I remember seeing an interview with David Crosby, who basically said that Sgt. Pepper accomplished what he and so many other artists of that war-torn generation had been trying to achieve themselves - musically, artistically, and culturally.<br />There had never been an album like Sgt. Pepper's before 1967.  Before then, an album was simply a collection of songs; since Sgt. Pepper's, an album has been looked upon as more than the sum of its parts.  The Beatles were determined to break new ground, putting in an estimated 700 hours in the studio to produce the thirteen songs you find here (three additional songs were also recording during the Sgt. Pepper sessions but went on to be released separately: Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, and It's Only a Northern Song) .  The amazing stereo sound was borne of carefully placed microphones all over the studio, including the insides of instruments.  All manner of mixing, tape speed manipulation, and other elaborate technological twists were done to the recordings to make each of them sound unlike anything ever heard before.  There were no breaks between songs, so each side of the original long-playing record played without pausing from beginning to end.  In the case of the second side, you could even say that there was no end to the music; John Lennon, after adding several seconds of a high-pitched tone near the end of A Day in the Life, had several seconds of inane chatter stuck at the very end - this chatter played over and over again in one continuous groove until the listener lifted the needle (unless the record player featured auto return).  The historic evolution of the album went far beyond the individual song tracks.  The album cover, featuring a gallery of familiar men and women is famous in and of itself - as much for those individuals who were rejected as too controversial as it is for the faces you do see (many of whom had to be paid for the use of their likenesses).  Sgt. Pepper was also the first album to come with the lyrics of the songs printed on the sleeve.<br />You can already see the importance of this album, and I haven't even discussed the song selection yet.  What's to say, really, when every single track is a classic?  The title track gets the music off to a rousing start before bridging smoothly into With a Little Help From My Friends featuring Ringo on lead vocals.  Then you have John's remarkable Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.  Paul jumps out front on Getting Better, Fixing a Hole, and She's Leaving Home, followed up by John on Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite.  The next track is the most unusual song on the album: George Harrison's Within You Without You.  At first, this song - with its Oriental, psychedelic sound - doesn't seem to fit in with the surrounding songs, but all it takes is a couple of listens to see just how important the track is to the album itself.  Next comes Paul with the jaunty When I'm Sixty-Four, followed by Lovely Rita, the most entertaining and enjoyable song on the album in my opinion.  After John says Good Morning, Good Morning, the band is back for a reprise of the title track and an encore of sorts in the form of A Day in the Life, a particularly unusual track that changes drastically in terms of sound and singer midway through.<br />It is hard to do justice to this album in words; as important and influential as it is enjoyable to listen to over andover again, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band represents The Beatles at its very best, and this CD really should find a home somewhere in the collections of music lovers everywhere.and over again, Sgt.

B0000959N0|4.0|Daredevil comes to life! Rex Smith's take on the Daredevil was okay, but Affleck really nails it. The DVD contains an interview with Frank Miller who says that Superman should go after Wonder Woman not Lois. He's got a point. I never bought Heather Locklear's attraction to the Swamp Thing (then again, she was a vegetarian), Kilmer and Kiddman in Batman Returns, or Dr Who's fling with Grace. Relationships in these kind of things are often crappy, but I must admit that Jen and Ben fit well together. Daredevil and Elektra &quot;click&quot;. <BR>The dark side of Daredevil is handled well in the movie too. His anger issues are understandable. His religous side is shown too. Some wanted more, but I lked how it was presented. True, we don't hear the entire confession when he tells the priest he was wrong, but I don't think we have to. The scene is left open ended for a reason. The point that he confesses is clearly made.<BR>It doesn't always make sense that Daredevil is as gymnastic as he is, but logic can kill the fun of most fantastic fiction so why bother? Bad guys often steal the show in these types of movies. Nicholson's Joker did it in Batman. Treat Williams' Xander Drax did it in the Phantom. Hackman's Luthor stole the show from Superman, and then General Zod and his crew did the same in the sequel. It's a tradition going back to the days of Charles Middleton's Ming the Merciless. He always stole the show too. Bullseye is no exception. Kingpin is a good baddie, but Farrell takes the cake.<BR>The bonus materials are outstanding. The outtakes from the playground scene are a riot. The interviews with the likes of Stan Lee and Kevin Smith are informative. The director provides great commentary too. All of these, and much more, make for an enjoyable movie experience. While it's not Birth of a Nation, the double disc Daredevil provides plenty for fans of popcorn, action movies, and superheroes to enjoy.

B0001L3LUE|4.0|Stated simply, this movie is brilliant.  McNamara bears his soul to the camera, yet keeps his cards close to his chest at the same time.  I am utterly facsinated by his role in this film, as well as his explanation of the events of his life.<br />As one can imagine, he avoids the topic of Vietnam as much as possible.  As a result, more interesting facets of his life are explored, such as his involvement in WWII and his time with the Ford Motor Company.  Unfortunately, his time as the President of the World Bank is not really discussed.  (There are three bits about this in the deleted scenes).  Of course, his time as President of the World Bank did not directly deal with war.<br />What is important to note is that McNamara is very quick to pat himself on the back and push his accomplishments.  However, he is just as quick to run away from responsibility for tragic events in which he is involved.  This is especially true when it comes to Vietnam.  As I can imagine, this is a tough topic for him and I can only imagine what lies in his heart with respect to this issue.  Also, thinking specifically of his comment regarding Agent Orange, I am sure that there are some attorneys out there that would not mind suing him personally over the injury that Agent Orange caused.<br />Nonetheless, I think that The Fog of War is an important piece of living history.  It should be required viewing for all high school students.  More importantly, it should be required viewing for ALL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.<br />The deleted sceens that are on the DVD are also great.  I would have enjoyed them more if Morris had added the scenes into the film itself.  The very first deleted scene is very telling of who McNamara is.  It discusses a famous poem by Kipling about a king that wished to build a palace that would be the envy of the world and, at the end of his life, he realized that all he had was a pile of rubble.  I think that McNamara wanted to help build a \\"palace.\\"  At the end of his term asSecretary of Defense, U.S. military policy was rubble and we were engaged in a war that we could not win or withdraw from.<br />I really do believe that this is great film and highly recommend it to everyone.
0804102988|5.0|This is a well written historical novel.  It spans a huge period in history, from 10,000 years before Christ until the 1980's.  Sarum follows the fortunes and failures of 6 families in the Salisbury area of England.  While this book is quite long, it is easy to look past that as each chapter is broken down into a certain era of history.  <br />Rutherford takes a complex idea and makes it so well written that one tends to forget how long it is.  This is one of those books where you can pick it up and find yourself lost in the past.  At times it will be quite hard to put it down.  Sarum is also full of fun little tidbits such as how people acquired their last names in the UK.  The most amazing and best part of Sarum, is how Rutherford weaves his characters and plot lines into actual events in history.  Read about his take on how Stonehenge was built (quite ingenious) to the Roman conquest and settlement of Britain to the English Civil War and its affects on everyday Brits.<br />This is one book that is well worth the money.  If you are a fan of historical novels you will appreciate it.  If you are a fan of British history you will appreciate it.  If you are a fan of great writing and look past page amount, you will appreciate it.
B000148KK2|5.0|After reading the horrible customer reviews, it is clear that they didn't listen to this album with an open mind. I am a big fan of Diana Krall and thinks she's a major talent. And this album proves just that. It's innovative and bold. Sometimes love and loss makes a singer sappy,maudlin,and full of self pity. But Krall proves that you can be sad,but not pitiful.<br />The jazz is subtle, but there is no mistake that it's a jazz record.  So,I say kudos to you Diana for taking a brave step forward,branching out and making jazz more accessible. It is far more interesting than anything on pop radio.  <br />So,here's a talented musician growing leaps and bounds and all the jazz purist can do is cry foul! To anyone who really listens to this album and doesn't think that it's a jazz record,then my advise to you is \\"You ought to get that checked.\\"
B00006LLLN|4.0|This is a great CD.  It is a perfect mix of old and new, rock and bluegrass.  The only thing that I did not like about the recording was what sounded like one obnoxious person, in the audience,that kept making loud noises and remarks.  I still recommend it highly.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Yup. it's the best. It's as if you took everything that was great about every movie ever made about WWII and distilled it into a 10 hour epic.<br />It's all here. The training film. The airplane/parachute jumper film. The forest/jungle combat film. The urban warfare film. The concentration camp film. <BR>You have your veteran soldiers, your newbies, heroes galore, mangled extremities, merciless firefights, harrowing escapes...<br />...seriously, it is ALL here.<br />You will grow to love these characters. Except they're not characters.<BR>They're real guys. Just like you and me...except they're not.<BR>These are the bravest, most noble men our country has ever produced. &quot;Ordinary&quot; guys doing the most extraordinary things. It's inspiring in the way few movies ever could be.<BR>There is not one moment in the entire miniseries that feels fake or forced. It has an air of authenticity rarely encountered in this genre. Having the real guys make a few comments before each episode grounds the subsequent hour into reality. It also serves to make it all the more amazing.<br />The acting is superb, right down the line. You will be shocked at how perfect the depiction of the actor portraying &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Guarniere is, when you see the real one in the accompanying  documentary. It is a MUST see after you finish the entire set, but wait a day or two to recover. This movie will leave you spent, and the documentary is almost a little too much to handle right afterwards.<br />The cinematography in particular is flat out awesome. The direction, handled by several supremely capable hands, is wonderful without drawing too much attention to itself, and surprisingly consistent throughout the production. The score is haunting.<br />Top to bottom, I don't think I've seen anything better on TV.<BR>Or elsewhere.<BR>Impressive to an overwhelming extent.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I won't say any more for fear of spoiling it for you. =)<br />The soundtrack is also excellent, as is the cast and script.
B0001US8EO|5.0|Clearly there is plenty of debate over which is better--Wyatt Earp or Tombstone.  Those of you who enjoy splashy hollywood fluff and don't care to think, stick to the latter.  The former, on the other hand, is one of the greatest modern westerns available--no doubt in a league including Open Range and Unforgiven--showing the heroic mythical figure along with the \\"warts and all\\" realistic character that was more likely.  <br />Although it is certainly longer than Tombstone, I don't think this takes away from Wyatt Earp.  Rather the subtle character touches, the incredible cinematography, and overwhelmingly stunning soundtrack by James Newton Howard make this film something of a wonder to watch and listen to.  Kevin Costner is magnetic as a heroic character who has the ultimate flaw of being a man of his times--a scoundrel and womanizer who puts himself and his family first.  Dennis Quaid is equally convincing and intense as Doc Holliday, Earp's skeletal side-kick.<br />The laserdisc transfer a few years ago (10 years already??) made Wyatt Earp incredible to experience--I cannot wait until the DVD release!!  This is the sort of film that DVD was made for!

B00005JMJ4|2.0|I didn't really dislike this movie per se.  I think that it's strengths lie in its cinematography and art direction.  Also, I found the dialogue to be subtle, understated, nuanced, and compelling.  <br />Other than that, the movie did not really impress me.  First off, this film falls into the genre of \\"Emo-type Americans who travel to a non-English speaking country and try to `find themselves.'\\"  What usually happens is that world-weary protagonists travel to foreign countries where they are unable to communicate with the native population because they are not able to speak the language of the country they are visiting (in this case Japanese).  Thus, the native population comes off as mysterious and inscrutable, their customs strange and exotic, and their culture beautiful but ultimately unknowable.  This irreconcilable gulf between the protagonists and the native population helps to highlight and symbolize the alienation and isolation that the protagonist feels toward the rest of humanity.  It also leads to many humorous scenes when the protagonists are arbitrarily thrown into disorienting and/or stereotype-reinforcing situations, such as a protagonist finding himself taller than the rest of the Asian men in an elevator, or a protagonist being beset by an E.S.L. prostitute who no doubt caters to all sort of deviant sexual fantasies for the native men, fantasies that the foreign protagonist cannot begin to fathom.  The movie is beautifully shot, full of soul, and the dialogue and interactions between characters ring true to life.  The problem is that the movie falls into this whole obnoxious genre of a stranger in a strange land.  It is the film's only flaw, but it is fatal to the integrity of the movie.<br />Both Murray and Johansson burn brightly in their respective roles.  Giovanni Ribisi delivers a brilliant performance as a preoccupied and distant husband.  Even Anna Faris makes an endearing appearance as a vapid, giggly blonde starlet shooting a Matrix-like action flick in Tokyo.  Not surprisingly, none of the Japanese characters are in any way developed.  (This, of course, would entail treating the Japanese characters as actual three-dimensional people instead of movie props, a possible complicating dynamic that Coppola is never in danger of broaching.)  Despite the skillfully executed performances, the actors and actresses still far short of the Herculean task of animating this lifeless material.  <br />If you want a more satisfying film based on the same themes of lonely people finding each other in a cold and indifferent world, watch the British classic, \\"Brief Encounter\\" written by Noel Coward and directed by David Lean.  Instead of taking the easy way out and giving his character passports to an exotic and distant destination somewhere in the British Empire, Coward makes the decisive choice to couch the entire film in drab suburban England.  The sense of estrangement he creates is all the more heightened precisely because he doesn't flinch from the unrelenting loneliness and seclusion that one can find in the mundane and trivial setting of one's own home and community.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|I was looking forward to Russell Crowes performance but this movie did him no justice. What should have tipped me off was the assanine box cover, however I was duped by the clever reviews mentioned thereon. Do not be mislead, this movie is as bad as the art work on the cover. Boring to the point of tears and fatigue I was literally exhausted after watching this movie and had to receive shock treatments to revive my will to live. Do yourselves a favor and stick to \\"The Gladiator\\".

B00001U0DP|5.0|Life is Beautiful is an excellent film portraying the life of an Italian family during WWII.  Everything from the storyline to the cinematography was as near perfect as one can ask.  This story of a father's love shows that life is in fact beautiful.
B00006F83Y|2.0|this album bites, plain and simple<br />first theres the production. Whats the point of having (apparently) the worlds greatest drummer in your band when you cant even hear him. Theres no treble whatsoever. The drums have been pushed entirely into the background so thier almost inaudible. Needless to say this does take away significantly from the appeal and power of the music, which is especially important in a rock band.<br />Then theres the band themselves. I'll admit i am a QOTSA fan and loved thier first 2 albums, but this time around they just sound like thier playing for themselves, and couldn't give a damn what anyone else thinks of em.<br />And as for the album, all the songs sound the same. This is partially because of the shoddy production, but also because of a lack of creativity on the bands part. The least they could've done was throw in a few mellow songs to break the cycle, like they did with 'R'. Speaking of 'R', its a superior album, buy that and thier self-titled debut, forget about this garbage.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I agree with a number of others who believe that everyone should see this film.  McNamara doesn't apologize (although he admist where he was wrong), he doesn't try to persuade; he just provides the facts and the context and lets the viewer decide for himself how we should view him. Most importantly, it shows a conscience of which all people should try to emulate.<br />This is neither a partisan film nor a mea culpa.  Watch this film, you will not be disappointed.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Somehow, everything Edward Bloom did took on mythic proportions - at least, for him. His hard-headed and down-to-earth son would have none of it. Bloom's son drew a sharp line between fact and fable, and between him and his father.<br />Most of the film is Edward's version, filled with prophecy, a modern-day Brigadoon, giants, circuses, and above all the untamed river spirit. The film also takes place during Edward's last days, with his son desperately trying to reconcile himself to the father's apparent inability to tell the truth.<br />Bloom's wife is a wonderful character, and should have gotten a lot more attention. She was completely dedicated to Bloom, tolerated his tall tales and even loved him for them. Just by being there, she seems to catalyze the rapprochement between father and son. (That's not a spoiler - you saw it coming, right?)<br />In the end, the son joins in Bloom's world beyond reality, while Bloom is still alive to welcome him there. The son also finds out that there was a lot more literal truth in Bloom's stories than he could ever have believed. Even more, at least one fantastical story was literally true and never told. Father and son are reunited, son's world is expanded beyond the mundane, and the hankies are passed. If there were such thing as a modern-day fairy tale, it would look like this.<br />The gentle action and family feeling make this mostly a chick flick. To tell the truth, I wanted to give this movie three stars. I am told that the chick-flick side of it is worth five, though, and I know not to argue: four stars over all.

I felt I was actually transported to this era. Enjoyed it very much.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I only bought this CD due to Chris Cornell, whom I think is one of the best singers and songwriters around. I've always been into Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, who sound similar. So I was intrigued to see how well Cornell blends with the rest of RATM, who I have been a casual fan to be honest. Personally I think it's a shame Soundgarden had to split, I would much prefer to see a new album by them instead of Audioslave, but I know a lot of people think otherwise.<br />The first thing that struck me was the typical RATM style guitar intro for Cochise, a common trick Morello uses is to flick the distortion switch very fast. I've seen RATM live once and saw how different his guitar layout was, the switch is was very loose and closer than usual to the strings so he can flick easily to create the unique sound. Which is cool, I suppose, but I prefer the more straightforward guitar solos from Kim Thayill or Stone Gossard. One thing I have to say about Morello is that he does play some extremely powerful riffs that work wonders with Cornell's voice, examples are Cochise, Show Me How To Live (best riff on the album), Gasoline and the underrated Light My Way. But there comes a point were powerful riffs become the norm, and a slick solo is required, and Morello just doesn't deliver any solo worth noting, which is a great shame considering Soundgarden used to pride themselves on being a `guitar band', and I was hoping Audioslave would follow. The first four songs, Cochise, Show Me How To Live, Gasoline and What You Are all hit hard, albeit fairly generic. The vocals are top notch, the drum playing from Brad Wilk is solid and the guitars are solid. Then comes my problem, the next ten songs, with a few exceptions, are ordinary, which is not what a band of such calibre should be doing. Shadow On The Sun is slower and less aggressive, and has a the best climax of any Audioslave song, where Cornell is practically screaming with all his heart.<br />I suppose the album is solid, but lacks flair, with the exception of Cornell who gives it all he's got. They are all good enough musicians, but the drums and guitars become very samish, Wilk never explores, he always tends to play a dull beat very loudly, there's no inspiration, no drum fills, NO DRUM FILLS!!!. The guitar playing is unique from Morello, but I would be much happier if he could just rip an amazing solo for three minutes, which I'm sure he can do. ALL ROCK BANDS NEED SOLOS. Except Audioslave, obviously.<br />Maybe I'm being too harsh, its not a disaster, its solid stuff, but they need to explore, push the boundaries. Maybe they didn't want to be too flamboyant in case people didn't like it, who knows? Still, a solid CD worthy of a place in any rock fans collection.ks flair, with the exception of Cornell who gives it all he's got.

B0000029GA|5.0|This is Nas' first lp and it's his best lp.  The only thing that this album lacks is the number of tracks it has.  It's only got 9 songs but they are very very good songs.  His rhyming on this album is unbelievable and they'll amaze you even if you're not a rap fan.  All, and I mean all rap fans need to buy this album.  There's no doubt that this is his best album he's put out.  The best songs are \\"N.Y. State of Mind\\" \\"Halftime\\" and \\"The World is Yours.\\"  I suggest that everybody, I don't care who you are, buy this album when you get a chance.
B00006879E|3.0|While Maroon 5 does include some nice elements into their music it would be interesting to learn a bit about this bands past and hear what they sounded like before being produced and put out. Also the lead singer tends to sound either angry about past relationships or like he's trying to get somebodies clothes off. While this is sometimes nice after repeated listens forced upon me by others I must say that they get old, fast.

B00005JLSE|3.0|Granted this movie is very well made, great Jazz, quality acting. But Oscar best film award? Hell no! Shame on the Academy to fall on a ripple effect - Moulin Rouge should be the true worthy winner the previous year, but unfortunately it has to take a whole year for them to realize the success of the musical genre, and as a &quot;felt guilty&quot; payback, to give the award to another just so-so musical - &quot;Chicago&quot;. This makes it the most unworthy Oscar ever. If you want to watch a true masterpiece of musical, go buy Moulin Rouge instead, it beats Chicago hands down in every aspects of movie making - the visual and musical effects are stunning. Remember, it is the pioneer work of Moulin Rouge that reinvented musical genre and reawakened people's interests toward the musical genre. Academy has no way to payback for what Moulin Rouge did for the industry.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Even if it doesn't measure up ith the original release, it'll still be great to see.  Out of the entire trilogy, this prequel was the most amazing.  Set around the 1861-1865 era of the Civil War, it's obviously chronologically before the 1870's era (Like the headstones say) of A Fitful of Dollars.<br />But chronological issues aside, the other two are in as much need of a disc set.  They were the only ones non-anamorphic.  So I'm buying this, not only for the new stuff, but to up the sales for MGM to release the other two.  This movie, alone with the sequels, are the best westerns ever!
B00005JLEX|5.0|On the Tonight Show, Jerry Seinfeld confirmed that the DVDs will be released this November and it is proven to be the greatest TV special edition DVDS ever.  Seinfeld claims that the reason that it took so long for the DVDs to be released was because they wanted to include everything in it.  But of course, an obvivous reason is the high ratings.
0783232039|1.0|I saw this film on the Sci-Fi channel.  And I'm glad I did, cause this movie, simply put; is a turd.  I would never pay to see this flick.  Not scary, whoever thought of turning chucky into humor should be fired.  I've only seen Childs play 3 and this piece of crap.  Now I found 3 to be a lot more fun to watch then this piece of ... (fill in the blank) Whoever thought this film was scary needs to see some real stuff.  And to make things worse I've heard they are making Seed of Chucky.  That will probably be worse.  Avoid this film at all costs unless you want to see cr@ppy films and make fun of them.

What a wonderful treat! If you missed it in the theatre, go buy this DVD immediately. The sound track is a worthy buy as well, great original songs plus interesting variations of many familiar tunes. This movie as whole package (acting, music, cinematography) is exactly what a musical should be. It's a milestone and benchmark, it will trigger (has already triggered) a lot of spin-offs like Chicago trying to catch up with it.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is very funny without mocking personal and religious beliefs.  It was enjoyable and entertaining.
0783225857|4.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is immensely simple, echoing the languid mood of a small town, pre-television, pre-suburban isolation, and very much in the midst of ignorance and prejudice. Main character is Scout, a child growing up with older brother Jem who longs for manhood and her father Atticus Finch, a uniquely dedicated lawyer and good man. Racism is the issue that stands out in the end, but TKAM is more an exploration of a time and place that most of us will never--and might never hope to--know. What action exists is observed by a mysterious neighbor and the stoic dad. Don't be fooled by the slow pace; there are myriad joys and hopes to be found in this film.    Collector's Edition DVD includes Fearful Symmetry, a wonderfully illuminating documentary about the making of the film and the basis for its story and characters. It starts slow but the messages (some rathy wordy) are poignant. Narration includes many quotes from the book, details that are left out of the movie in effort to translate to screen. For anyone unsure of the value of movie and its story, this feature-length documentary is a wonderful introduction or alternative.
B0001CNPLI|4.0|&quot;Choose the ball and you join your mother&quot;.....&quot;I know you dont understand my words, but you must choose.&quot;....<br />Shogun Assassin is just the first part of the many films in the Lone Wolf series, and the best! The film was BANNED SINCE 1983 in the UK, and the most bloody of the series. There are 2 parts to Shogun Assassin, so if you just get the first one you will be left hanging.<BR>Basiclly, HE WHIPS OUT HIS SWORD AND RELIEVES HIS VICTIMS OF THEIR HEADS AND LIMBS!! THE BLOOD GUSHES OUT ALL OVER THE SCREEN - AS IF BEING HOSED INTO THE CAMERA! <br />Yea, This film is Pretty violent, it reminds me of Kill Bill Vol 1. Shogun was some of QT's insperation to Kill Bill and he included some of it in Vol. 2. Shogun Assassin tells the story of Lone Wolf a powerful and feared &quot;Masterless&quot; samurai who lives a peaceful existence with his wife and his son. When he refuses to swear allegiance to Kurando the most vicious Shogun in Japanese history, Kurando orders the death of Lone Wolf's wife Azame. Lone Wolf vows to avenge her death, taking his son Tizuro with him on the path to darkness and retribution. Soon Lone Wolf's sword of vengeance is unleashed upon many victims,including the evil Shogun's son and the legendary &quot;Masters of Death&quot;. <br />If you have ever heard the Wu Tang, GZA albulm &quot;liquid swords&quot; you would of heard many samples that came from this movie. This movie is pretty good, (considering its not kung fu.)Very entertaining, and the kid is pretty cute, watch for the part when he counts the victims, pretty funny...Tomisaburo Wakayama plays the Lone Wolf.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|After reading reviews alerting me to Universal's obnoxious policy of prefacing its releases with commercials that CAN'T be skipped, I've decided not to purchase the Double Secret Probation release. I recently purchased their Monster Legacy Collection WITHOUT reading the reviews, only to have my worst fears realized (loose, scratched disks, mangled program sheets, bad transfers, etc.). This prompted me to send Universal a &quot;tastefully outraged&quot; e-mail detailing my complaints. My suggestion is that other purchasers do the same (please keep it clean), as well as boycotting their products. And please continue to keep future purchasers informed through your Amazon reviews by mentioning the technical details of your purchases. Commercials are appropriate ONLY when they can be skipped. It's a shame that a studio with such an illustrious history has descended to this level. Let the (presumed) Gen X-ers in charge know that profits accrue as the result of the LONG-TERM good will that results from providing quality and value, NOT as the impressive figures on this quarter's balance sheet that resulted from cutting corners. Unfortunately, they seem unable to even do a good job of resting on their laurels.
0385484518|5.0|There is no doubt about it: Mitch Albom struck more than a chord with this homage to the life and passing of outstanding professor Morrie Schwartz. Telling the story of his weekly Tuesday meetings with Morrie, his old professor that was going through the pains of degenerative disease ALS, Albom evolves as a human being as Morrie approaches his final days, and he realizes how much we place importance on the wrong things in life and how much we fear leaving life altogether.<br />It is practically impossible to quote the book without leaving out something meaningful: that powerful (yet simple) is this tale, to the point of being the only book I can recall having read once again after I read it the first time. And nowadays Morrie's message is as important as it was a few years ago, when the book first came out: &quot;Be compassionate, and take responsibility for each other. If we only learned those lessons, this world would be so much better a place... Love each other or die.&quot;

B00005JMEW|1.0|This movie is really dull. I saw it in the theater and wished I had a remote. Let's have a long scene where Uma Thurman pretends that she can't speak Japanese but maybe she really can even though she can't even pronounce &quot;yakuza&quot; correctly. Let's have this go on for five minutes and then find out that it is completely unimportant and irrelevant to the story. What fun. There's a reason those bad kung fu movies were only shown in &quot;grindhouses&quot; - they were crappy and very few people wanted to see them. Okay, let's be cool and say that bad is good, and pretend we're the first ever to say that things are relative. That will really show our parents, huh? This is a movie for fourteen year old boys. Dumb ones.
B00009Z576|5.0|I remember defending Drama as my choice of Yes albums to a friend in college 10 years ago. He couldn't believe I could like a Yes album that wasn't really Yes. Well, Drama outperforms the post Tales From Topographic Oceans albums and I believe is on-par with my second fav Yes album Close To the Edge. Here's why:<br />1. Yes are much more aggressive on this album than they've ever been before or since (though parts of Close To the Edge are, well, edgy.) the drums have a lot of room ambience to them, Chris Squire's bass is at its trebly, overdriven Rickenbacker best and Steve Howe is just slaying with his larger-than-life hard rock guitars (a far-cry from his chicken pickin' from the earlier albums.) The band have never rocked so hard and frenetic than they did on Tempus Fugit and the opening 90 seconds of Machine Messiah.<BR>2. The songs are super-catchy and not bogged-down in prog-minutiae. The arrangements are just as tight as the musicianship.<BR>3. Trevor Horn does a pretty-good job of stretching himself towards Jon anderson territory without sounding like a pale imitation. And I can't believe he doesn't get more recognition for his jaw-dropping fretless basslines on &quot;Run Through the Light.&quot; I love Chris Squire's bass playing, but Horn's fluid lines just really make that song (as do Alan White's Jerry Marotta-esque cymbal-less drumming.) Geoff Downes, well, I don't know that he really adds anything but doesn't take anything away either.<br />The bonus tracks on this deluxe edition are good and insightful, but I'd rather Rhino had dug up some of the live tracks from the Drama tour. One of the Madison Square Garden shows from that tour was broadcast on the radio so I know tapes exist somewhere.
0060589272|4.0|If taken literally, this book is nothing more than a glorified romance/bodice ripper/Cinderella story.  To really understand what the author is trying to say, you must read beyond the words.  The central character, Maria, is a prositute - earning money, doing something that she does not like, thinking all the while she'd rather be somewhere else, all to achieve her goal of going home and impressing her friends and family with the entrapments the perfect life.  Wouldn't that describe most of us? Don't we all sell a piece of ourselves - whether literally or figuratively - to attain the &quot;good life&quot;?<br />What foils Maria's plans is love.  A love so supreme, so whole, that it is beyond her control.  It stirs her to her very core and shakes the very foundation of her idea of a perfect life.  She spends a great deal of time trying to keep herself on her life plan, but is continually drawn to this man who &quot;has seen her light&quot;. Her anguish over whether to do what is expected or to follow her soul, is described so subtly by Coehlo, that those readers just skimming the surface of the book, will miss it.<br />Any reader who had experienced the mystical power of this type of love, will recognize him or herself immediately.  What's truly amazing is that the author has managed to describe this complex union of souls, minds and bodies, so simply that it's beautiful.<br />Read it once.  Put it away for a month.  Read it again - but really read it this time.  It's worth it.
B00005JLO2|5.0|This movie moved me to tears on several occassions. The soundtrack is very moving itself - particularly when using surroundsound headphones, which I strongly suggest. The cinematography is nothing short of artistic. The family can watch it, good friends can enjoy it. It would make a greatly inspirational gift for anyone in the military. The comparison to world events [of our time] is noticable and sobering. This one is a keeper.
B00005JKJA|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie yet, you won't be the same until you do.<br />I'm not the biggest fan David Lynch has ever had on this planet. But this movie is _so_ good that I'm finally willing to forgive him for his treatment of _Dune_ (1984).<br />_Mulholland Dr._ is mesmerizing. It will suck you in, chew you up, and never let you out. You will rewatch it many times, and every time you do, you will notice (or think of) something you haven't noticed (or thought of) before.<br />As you probably know from the other reviews, there is a division point about four-fifths of the way through the movie. You may find it confusing -- and you _will_ find it disorienting -- the first time you see it. But bear with it and let the movie soak into your subconscious for a couple of days, and then watch it again. It does make sense, I promise. (And this isn't just a cinematic Rorschach test; there really is an intelligible plot here. Pay close attention to the details Lynch points out in his 'ten clues', included with the DVD.)<br />I won't give anything else away. Just be warned: if you're the sort of person who obsesses over movies, this one will give you plenty to obsess about. Not only is it gorgeously filmed and tantalyzingly paced, its rich symbolic texture and all-around oneiric quality will involve parts of you that you may not have known existed. You will wake up in the middle of the night thinking, 'Aha! So _that's_ what that meant.'<br />The two leads (Laura Elena Harring and Naomi Watts) are spot-on in these very demanding roles -- especially Watts, about whose performance I can't say anything concrete without including major spoilers, but _boy_, is she good. And for whatever it's worth, be aware that there are a couple of really steamy lesbian sex scenes. Some viewers (which kind am I? you guess) will regard this as a huge plus; others maybe not so much. But either way, these scenes are not gratuitous.<br />Lynch gives a number of cinematic nods to lots of predecessors that can broadly be classified as films noirs (notably, and pretty obviously, Billy Wilder's _Sunset Blvd._). But this is not your standard film noir; it's a David Lynch movie, with everything that entails. Don't be quick to classify it.<br />It will haunt you. I strongly recommend that you let it.<br />(_A note on the DVD_: One thing you probably won't like about it is that the usual divisions aren't there; the _entire_ movie is just one long 'scene' or 'chapter'. That makes it a real pain in the posterior to flip back and forth while you're trying to remember where you spotted someone or something before. Lynch says it's because movies, unlike books, don't divide into 'chapters'. Fair enough -- but they _do_ divide into 'scenes'. And at any rate, there's such a thing as the viewers' convenience. So feh to that.)that can broadly be classified as films noirs (notably, and pretty obviously, Billy Wilder's _Sunset Blvd._).

B0001L3LUE|5.0|Erroll Morris has a very specific style that brings you slowly but surely into his world. He is a master at revealing frightening, all too human truths about his subjects. the Fog of War is no exception. McNamara is yet another complex being that Morris puts in front of us. Is he a war criminal, a reformed murderer, a thoughtful elder statesman? The viewer decides. There are all too few films like this. Others that come to mind are &quot;The Trials Of Henry Kissinger&quot; and in a more universal and emotional vein, &quot;USA The Movie&quot; both of which are available through Amazon and other outlets. Great viewing.
B000002GA8|5.0|First of all, it's great. But I did not hear it until I heard its sequel, the Return, which admittedly is 25 odd years behind the rest of you prog fans, but hey. It was because I liked the sequel that I bought the Journey. It is admittedly not of the best sound quality but that's to be expected with a live disk. None the less the music is well crafted and of typical Wakeman style. If you have and enjoy any other of his albums then this will be the perfect one for you. Wakeman is at his best with twiddleing his fingers across those synthes, monogons and keyboards, making the rest of us who have tried to play a keyboard feel quite innadequate.<BR>  However, since I pesonnally am not trying to sell the album, I will inform you that there is a live DVD of the entire Journey and several other songs, available, most probably from Amazon. The DVD comes with the CD of the Journey so it is worth considering.<BR> Whichever you will get/have got I'm sure you will enjoy/have enjoyed the feast that is Journey to the Center of the Earth. If only Jules Verne were here to listen to it now...
B00006CXSS|5.0|A very thorough and complete telling of Charlie Company in the European Theater of World War II.  Amazingly shot.  Superior character development.  Great music.  Perfect cinematography.  Editing is great.  By the end of the last DVD I was just speachless.  This would have no doubt won an Oscar had it somehow been a feature film.<br />This is the quintesential WWII film.  If you liked Saving Private Ryan, this is an absolute must see.  Also good for fans of Schindler's List, The Pianist, Sohpie's Choice.<br />From bootcamp to the fall of Hitler, this DVD set is exquisite.  BUY IT NOW.
0060920432|5.0|Judging by the 1 star reviews, it is painfully obvious that:<br />1) Those 1 star reviewers have never read the book<BR>2) They have no earthly clue what this book is all about.<br />HINT: Flow is a state of consiousness.

This book has helped me with my golf game, my performance on the job and in relationships with my spouse and family.<br />Great book. 1 star reviewers, try reading the book and then come back and place your review.
1400034779|3.0|This book shows the mysteries of Mma Ramotske, an African detective.  She solves case after case of fellow villagers.  These cases involve a man who's accused of stealing a car, a daughter who might be involved in a relationship, and a mysterious disappearance of an 11-year old boy.<br />Although the story was enjoyable, I thought it was very low on plotline.  It just switches from case to case.  The book might have been better if each case was a short story and had its own chapter.<br />Otherwise, if you enjoy reading mysteries, you may like this book.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|What \\"Love Actually\\" is not is great cinema. \\"Love Actually\\" is, however, two hours of very enjoyable entertainment. The script is well written with a very appealing cast of characters. It's evident that Richard Curtis' previous screenplays (\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\", \\"Notting Hill,\\" and \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\") were no flukes - the guy writes good romantic comedy! And his directorial debut is, as far as I'm concerned, as entertaining as any of the movies listed above. <br />I hadn't heard much about this movie. I pulled it from the rack  based solely on the cast, most of whom could be entertaining reading the phone book. None of them disappointed me. Each was enjoyable and believable in his or her role. Curtis says that the original cut ran nearly three hours long. In viewing the deleted scenes on the DVD, you have to believe that a lot of wonderful material ended up on the cutting room floor. I honestly think I could have watched a three hour version and still have been thoroughly entertained (with my posterior intact at the conclusion) because of both the story and the characterizations by the cast.<br />I think \\"Love Actually\\" is a little gem. Every once in awhile, a movie strikes a chord with me and I'll watch it two or three times in a row. I watched this movie once, then watched it with the director's commentary, then watched it a third time, and enjoyed it a little more with each viewing. (The last time that happened to me was when I saw \\"Last Orders\\" starring Michael Caine, Bob Hoskins, and Helen Mirren. It's also a gem that I highly recommend.) When sitting down in a theater or in front of the TV to watch any movie, you have to check a certain amount of your disbelief at the door. \\"Love Actually\\" requires some of that, but it also gives an entertaining look at how important finding, losing, and keeping love is for each of us. In the future, when I see that \\"Love Actually\\" is being shown on TV, I'll make a point of watching it again, just as I do with \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" and \\"Notting Hill.\\" I can't say that about many movies.<br />Oh, I almost forgot. The soundtrack is terrific! Buy it, too.<br />Watch \\"Love Actually\\" and enjoy yourself.

B0001GOH6Q|4.0|&#34;Big Fish&#34; has been adapted from the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace and directed by Tim Burton. This whimsical tale of a strained parent-child relationship is Burton's most personal film to date. It's a story of a son returning to his childhood home, where his father is fatally ill, in hopes of discovering the man behind the myth that his father has always cultivated. &#34;Big Fish&#34; is in many ways a family drama with typical family themes, yet its otherworldly elements lend the film a distinct Burtonesque tone and appearance.<br /><br />Edward Bloom has been a personable man and a great storyteller all his life. His fantastic tales have been loved by all, no matter how much truth or myth they may contain. But ever since his son, Will Bloom (Billy Crudup), was old enough to realize the stories couldn't be entirely true, he has resented his father's unwillingness to say things the way they are. Estranged as adults, Will visits his dying father (Albert Finney) in hopes of learning the truth behind the magnificent tales of Edward's youth and gaining an understanding of the man he has known only through elaborate myths.<br /><br />Although &#34;Big Fish&#34; is telling us the story of Edward and Will's relationship, Edward, true to form, tells us his life's story in fantastic tales. So the film spends most of its time recounting Edward Bloom's life story as he tells it, with young Edward played with great charm by Ewan McGregor. These adventures are a visual feast and don't seem to compete with the film's present-tense father-son drama. The myth and the drama are blended seamlessly, much to Tim Burton's and screenwriter John August's credit. The faults I find with &#34;Big Fish&#34; are that some of its stories would have been more interesting told rather than seen, and the odd conglomeration of stories that constitute Edward's repertoire sometimes give the film  an uneven pace. It goes without saying that &#34;Big Fish&#34; is sentimental. It most closely resembles Burton's &#34;Edward Scissorhands&#34; in tone.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include two multi-part featurettes, which can also be viewed during the film by activating a feature called &#34;Fish Tales&#34;, a trivia quiz, and an audio commentary by director Tim Burton. When activated, &#34;Fish Tales&#34; displays an icon on your screen during the film's playback that will take you to the relevant featurette.

Tim Burton's audio commentary has an unusual format. It's an interview, so there is someone asking Burton specific questions as the subjects come up during the movie.

B00005AQE8|5.0|This is the very first Hip-Hop album l ever bought, back in 2002... I wasnt really into Hip Hop until a friend of mine to me it could be a good way for me to step into Hip hops world , no matter how violent and agressive the lyrics may be... And what a surprise!! Thers a lot of good songs, some to shake ya ass on (&quot;All About U&quot;.. Wow!!, &quot;california Love&quot;, oh la la!, &quot;Cant C Me&quot;, wonderful, &quot;All Eyes on Me&quot;.. Shake it baby!!), others melancolic and filled with emotion (&quot;life Goes On&quot;, &quot;I Aint Mad atcha&quot;...), and the bEST, those songs about his experience, his frustration, his anger (&quot;No More Pain&quot;.. A highlight!!). l think this is THE ONLY perfect hip hop album outta there (Well, U know, just like Michael Jacksons &quot;Thriller&quot; among every Pop album..), very versatile, filled with orinality... 27 tracks!! Wow!! So so hot... Maybe he should be able to tell us If &quot;Heaven aint Hard to Find&quot; or if its &quot;got a ghetto&quot;.. RIP Homie
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved this show when it was on the air and I now have had the chance to share it with my husband, with the DVD set.  He really enjoyed it and wanted to know if there were more shows he could watch.  I get so frustrated with the network's brass when they don't give a show the chance to make it!  This is a GREAT and a worthwhile DVD set. Too bad we can't find a way to get it back on the air!

If you make nothing else, try the recipes for their famous cupcakes (I like the chocolate ones especially) - makes the book worth getting.

I would recommend this book to people who like to read series and enjoy reading things that have a ending that you want to read more.
B0000AOV85|5.0|As a big Floyd fan, purchased this out of curiosity.  DSotM was not my top PF album, but certainly a favorite.  I watched this on a flight and was upset when we started to land because I had to close the laptop!  When I got to my hotel, I couldn't do anything before watching the rest of the DVD.<br />The interviews are great.  There are discussions with each band member, the engineer and the mixer.  Great background conversations and real insight into what Waters was thinking when writing a lot of these songs.  If you enjoy Pink Floyd and want a little better understanding on the whys _and_ hows of the making of the album, get this DVD!
0374384576|5.0|The Witches is about a little orphaned boy who lives with his grandmother.  Before bedtime each night his grandmother would tell him stories, and his favorite story was always about the Witches.  His grandmother seemed to know everything about them and told him how to recognize and stay away from them.  The boy never knew his grandmother to lie, so he listened and followed her advice on the subject.  When the boy finds out that Witches really do exist, his grandmother's advice comes in handy to help the little boy escape them for a long period time, but they eventually catch up to him half way through the book and turn him into a mouse.  You would think that this would be a very sad thing, but the boy loves being a mouse.  Actually while reading this book to my five and seven year old daughters, the youngest one said that she thought being a mouse would be a very neat thing and asked if it was possible for me to turn her into one.  I told her that even if I could I wouldn't since I would miss having my little girl too much.  As a mouse the boy realizes he can do a lot of things he couldn't have done otherwise if he was still a little boy, so with the help of his grandmother they comes up with a plan to get rid of all the witches in England.  It was a great story.  Unlike Roald Dahl's other books which touch upon scary subject's but in a humorous way, this one without a doubt is trying to scare your kids.  Rather then giving my girls nightmares however, it was more along the lines of them listening to a good ghost story around the fire while you are away at camp, and they just found it very entertaining.  Quintin Blake once again drew some wonderful illustrations to capture the action which added to the story.
B000000W5L|5.0|When I first purchased this album, I hated it.  I listened to it many MANY times wondering what was so great about it.  I had heard and read that it was the Stones' best album, and among the best rock n' roll albums released by ANYONE.  Needless to say, I had to check it out.  But I was disappointed with it.  I thought the album was overrated and too long.  I didn't get into the country music and overblown use of gospel choirs and a brass section.  I dug a few songs right away like &quot;Rocks Off&quot; and &quot;Happy&quot; and &quot;Loving Cup&quot; but it was nowhere near the masterpeice I had expected.  Within 9 months or so, I traded it in.<BR>After a while, I was eventually turned on to their other albums like &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; which is awesome and more enjoyable to listen to from your first listen ever that &quot;Exile&quot; ever had been.  That lead me to their other masterpeices like &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; and the wonderful &quot;Beggar's Banquet&quot; and I was instantly hooked onto the band.  Soon after, I swallowed my pride and got another copy of &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; and rediscovered the phenominal music that I didn't appreciate the first time through.  I no longer felt that it was an overblown production, but that the band was inspired and delivered the goods.  I realized that almost EVERY song was great, rather than three or four.  <BR>So, for those rock fans that are just now getting into the Stones, I HIGHLY recommend you listen to &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; or &quot;Beggar's Banquet&quot; first, and if you're into those albums, then check out &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;  I say this because I feel that new fans need a little warming up Stones style before they dive into &quot;Exile.&quot;
B000148KK2|2.0|While Diana Krall is an amazing pianist and singer, even she needs decent material to work with.  The songs on this CD were written by Elvis Costello and the lyrics remind me of children trying to make everything rhyme. Even though I am a Diana Krall fan, I had difficulty staying with this CD through the last song.
0440228921|5.0|The Giver, written by Lois Lowry, takes the reader into a different world, very different then what we currently see ourselves in today.  Actually, imagine our world without any surprises or different circumstances.  A life lived the same way, everday.  Instead of picking what you want to be in life, the task is given to you.  Jonas, the main character, lives this utopian lifestyle at the age of eleven when the book starts out.  At the age of twelve he recieves his assignment or job.  Except he recieves a very rare and honorable position.  Scared and confused, he recieves his \\"training\\" for his new \\"selected\\" occupation and takes on a new lifestyle that others in his community are lacking.  A real world!<br />I wasn't able to read this book in school because of the english courses I was taking.  Thankfully I went back and read these books in my free time, for fun.  The Giver is a great and very different read.  I highly recommend it.
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold captures readers in the beginning of the story with the interesting narration. The plot is a generally a murder mystery yet somewhat comforting at the same time. It touches your emotions and makes it a difficult book to put down. I recommend this book to everyone,and had purchased it originally by a recommendation of a co-worker. The style of writing is so different as the murder victim is narrating her own murder and observing the effects of her death on her family. She watches as her murderer carries about his everyday activities and even joins in the mourning of the victim. It is almost as if you have a backstge pass or behind the scenes footage on an average murder mystery. Alice Sebold's creativity shines as I along with many others give this book a top rating!New
B00007L4OM|4.0|It's not the greatest, deepest movie ever filmed.  But it doesn't aim to be.  Luc Besson provides a light, humorous, and easy-on-the-brain flick that leaves a clean taste behind.  Great for casual rental or to have in your DVD library to entertain friends when they're looking for something to watch.  The pace keeps you engaged, the story is silly but fun, and the actors are more than watchable.
B0001UZZWW|3.0|First, there's the Shrek film, which is not only an Academy Award winning Animated film...It's one of the best Films I've ever seen. I HIGHLY recommend that you buy the ASIN=B00003CXXJ version of Shrek which is both Widescreen and Fullscreen DVD, with great extras. The Shrek in this DVD pack is just Full Screen, which is an insult to this amazing film.<br />Then, there's Shrek 3-D, which is a great &quot;4-D&quot; theme park attraction at Universal Studios. It looses some of it's funniness going from 4-D to 3-D...so see it at the theme park, in all it's glory. Here, it is only presented in Anaglyph (Latin for &quot;annoying&quot;). The 15 minute short is presented in 2 formats, 2-D (why?!?) and Anaglyph (Red/Cyan glasses). Very bad move not to have included a Field Sequential 3-D version, which is what all the 3-D film lovers were readying their wallets for. Anaglyph looks like bad 3-D on all TVs, while Field Sequential looks great, but only works some TVs. Including both would've sold very well.<BR>Lastly...there's NO &quot;Making Of Shrek 3-D&quot; on the 3-D DVD...just 2 versions of a 15 minute short, and an interesting ad/trailer for Shrek 2.<br />Skip this 2 pack. Buy the Widescreen DVD of Shrek. And hope they re-release Shrek 3-D in Field Sequential 3-D, with a Making Of, as a single DVD, later.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|This CDs are a steal at $12.  I paid $18 when it first came out and it was well worth it.<BR>Most people are complaining that there are only 3 new songs.  In this day and age, this is Donna's easiest way to get some new music out there.  Plus this CD was also meant to go with her autobiography so it makes sense that it would be a Greatest Hits.<BR>The three new songs are amazing.  I also had the privilege of hearing Donna sing almost every song on this CD(include the three new ones) at a rare concert in Orlando this year and it's incredible how she sounds better than ever.<br />The remixes are great and they are a great way to play some Donna Summer music at a party.
0671721720|5.0|The other reviewers have amply decribed the storyline, and fully expressed the reasons why you should read all the books in this series.  Unfortunately, some of the other reviewers refer to the Graysons as being misogynists.  Okay, a few of the guys are so insecure and immature that their need to keep the women in their place, so to speak, certainly does look like &quot;woman-hating.&quot;  Once you get to know these noble people, you'll be able to tell the difference between the ones who will murder to preserve their comfortable status quo and those who will die to allow every person, regardless of gender, race, or belief, to meet their own Test.
0800141806|4.0|I finally got around to renting a copy of \\"Philadelphia\\". Honestly, I was bored and nothing seemed interesting in the video store at the time. I paid my money, took it home, popped it in, and watched for two hours. The plot is inherently well-known so I won't rehash it here. However, I do find the film to take their viewpoint in treating homosexuals as regular people to almost bashing you over the head extreme. I'm no longer a subscriber to any faith. I'm skeptical of all religions, but I still maintain a study to better understand people and show respect where I can. I respect the fact that one's personal preference in bedroom activites should not be included in workplace policy, or any other public discourse, unless mutually agreed upon. I tend to keep it behind the bedroom door. Whatever two consenting adults do is none of my business. However, if a religion states in it's holy book that the deity who inspired said holy book isn't pleased with same-sex relations, that is their belief and I respect it. Does that mean that religious people should be blindly labeled as \\"Homophobes\\"? No, only if they engage in the typical intolerance and prejudice shown to various ethnic groups the world over and apply that to actions consenting adults engage in, in the privacy of their bedroom. I've known and have worked with homosexuals in various jobs and also studied with in course during my college days, and I actually found a few to be more enjoyable and a breath of fresh air compared to some heterosexual people. I don't consider myself to be \\"Enlightened\\" (I have no time for people who claim to be anyways), but I eventually came to my current outlook in life long before I saw Philadelphia. I enjoyed the film for it's themes in removing intolerance, but the film just was a tad too preachy at times. Do I recommend it, yes, but I do know some won't change in their views no matter how foolish.
B000148KK2|4.0|I agree with most of what the previous reviews have to say, so I wont repeat it. This album is a departure and I was somewhat disappointed after listening to it through for the first time. But do have to applaud Diana in trying something different from what we have come to expect.<br />Good Production value and excellent performance by the musicians.
0440237688|5.0|First, I an an eighth grader at deerpath middle school, in lake forest, Il. Our class read this book as a project. I am in the lowest level of L.A.(our district's name for english) and I am not a great writer or reader, but after I got past the first three chapters, I finished this book in a day. This is amazing for me, I am a relativly slow reader, yet this book is so in depth,I found it impossable to but it down (I finished it 10 minutes ago) I have alwys been interstes in si-fi/futeristic books. The giver isnt si-fi at all, but it shows the terrors of communism and blindness in a easy to understand, and hard to out down package.
B000063WDH|5.0|in your review you said we should all start listening to &quot;music.&quot;the you started bitching about the black keys being compared to the white stripes and how the white stripes play blues and only u know that because YOU listen to &quot;MUSIC.&quot; the two bands should not be compared because they are completely different sounds. you see there are different types of blues and there is a difference between playing the blues and being influenced by the blues but im sure you know that because you listne to &quot;music&quot; unlike the rest of us
0880389052|5.0|In a community, individuals must work together. They must work as one single unit in order to achieve the ultimate goal: survival. However, in the great city of Menzobaranzan, this basic rule of survival is not obeyed, quite the opposite is followed in fact. Instead of working together as a coloney, dark Elves, or Drow are killing each other to gain personal elevation on the mountain of social status that makes up Menzobaranzan. The Dark Elves thrive in a world that rejects integrity, all except one, that is.<BR>    The first book in the &quot;Dark Elf Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Homeland&quot; relates how one Dark Elf rebels against the chaotically cruel world of the Drow. Drizzt Do'Urden is a skilled warrior and a noble of house Do'Urden, 9th house and only one step away from a seat on the ruling council of Menzobaranzan. There is no apparent reason why he should not thrive in the murderous society that is his home, however, by reading the first chapter of this book, one can easily tell that Drizzt Do'Urden is not an average Dark elf. For some reason, this one is different.<BR>    By the time that he was just one decade old, still considdered an infant by drow society, Drizzt knew that his society was sick and twisted. How can a society hope to survive when they are busy attempting to assassinate each other? It is no secret that Drow Elves have numerous enemies. Drizzt knows he has to escape, but as the time of his escape draws nearer, an impending threat to his house becomes more obvious. Should he help fight in the epic battle that could make or break house Do'Urden, or should he flee to the dangerous enexplored terrain of the Underdark?<BR>    R.A. Salvator's method of writing has a way of making one feel that he or she is trapped inside the Underdark along with the treacherous Drow. I would reccomend this book to any reader who has a strong love for fantasy, or who feels alone or out of place in their environment. This book demonstrates that there is more than one place to find acceptance, and that there are no ties that can't be broken. The complexity of this story has as many layers as the Dark Elves hatred, and there are as many twists and turns in the plot as there are tunnels in the Underdark. R.A. Salvator's talent is apparent in this wonderful story of acceptance and escape.
0141301155|4.0|There's plenty that adults can learn from children's books. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is such a book. Not only is it a great read, it says something about greed, gluttony, and the dangers of the fantastic.<br />The story is probably familiar to many (thanks to the 1971 film adaptation), but the basic plot is this: Willy Wonka, a reclusive, famous (almost Howard Huges-like) owner of the largest candy factory in the world wraps five golden tickets in candy bars and distributes them to the world. No one has been in or out of Wonka's factory in years, but these tickets allow the ticket finders access to it for one day, as well as a lifetime supply of world-famous Wonka candy. Four tickets are quickly found by families who have the money and the means to do so (one of the finder's father even stops production in his factory so that his voluminous workers can unwrap the thousands of candy bars he's purchased in hope of finding one of the tickets). This is discouraging to Charlie Bucket, who comes from a destitute family who eat mostly watery cabbage and boiled potatoes. Charlie only gets one chocolate bar a year for his birthday - his father's job screwing on the tops of toothpaste tubes doesn't bring much income. Charlie's luck changes when he finds a dollar bill in the snow (after his father loses his job in the toothpaste factory the family begins to starve, and Charlie conserves energy by walking slowly, which helps him find the dollar). Luck leads to luck, as Charlie buys two candy bars and the second one contains a golden ticket. Charlie's 95 year-old (wow!) grandfather agrees to accompany Charlie. So, Along with four other spoiled brats and their families, Charlie and Grandpa Joe tour the Wonka factory. Inside, the factory is filled with amazing things, and the spoiled brats show their worst side and also expose the dangerous side of the fantastic. A river of chocolate is great until you fall into it. Trained squirrels are great unless they mistake you for a bad nut and through you in the chute. Chewing gum that tastes and nourishes as though it were an entire three course meal is great as long as the forumla is right and doesn't turn you into a giant blueberry. Being allowed into the Wonka factory is an amazing experience unless you're a spoiled brat who needs to grab, chew, eat, or touch everything you see. In this case being a brat brings dire consequences. The reward for not being a brat is something unbelievable, but the \\"losers\\" still get a lifetime supply of candy and chocolate.<br />Fans of the film (which is mistitled \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" because Charlie is really supposed to be the hero here) will notice some great differences in the story. The famous \\"Oompa Loompa\\" song is not in the book, but they do sing, but they sing longer and more detailed songs than in the movie. One of the songs goes on about the evils of television:<br />The most important thing we've learned<br />So far as children are concerned,<br />Is never, never, NEVER let<br />Them near your television set -<br />Or better still, just don't install<br />The idiotic thing at all.<br />They do not sing \\"Oompa Oompa Ommpity Doo, I've got another problem for you\\" such as in the movie. They also give credit where credit is due: the brattiness of the kids is also blamed on the parents. So in a way the story also becomes a lesson in parenting. The Oompa Loompas sing:<br />For though she's spoiled, and dreadfully so,<br />A girl can't spoil herself, you know.<br />Alas! you needn't look so far<br />To find out who these sinners are.<br />They are (and this is very sad)<br />Her loving parents, MUM and DAD.<br />In this way the Oompa Loompas almost serve the purpose of a Greek chorus. Whenever of the brats \\"gets it\\" they sing about the tragedy and probable causes of the event. This book is a very enjoyable read for any age. If you're an adult, don't deprive yourself of great children's books such as this one. If you're a kid, don'tdeprive your parents of your great books such as this one. Make them read it. Force them to read it. You know you want to.arents of your great books such as this one. Make them read it. Force them to read it. You know you want to.
0920668364|5.0|My whole family loves this book.  I thought it was sort of odd at first, but once you've read it with a child a couple of times you'll be hooked.<br />It's a simple book, but the theme of \\"I'm your parent, and I'm with you through it all\\" is well done, and can be very comforting when you read it to your child.  The illustrations aren't intended to be overly humorous (I think), but my son and I laugh every time we see the little old lady rocking the full-grown son.<br />We used this book extensively with our oldest child after the second child was born.  It can be a great aid in getting over the rough spots (jealousy, competition, sibling rivalry etc) and reinforcing your bond with your first-born.
0393324818|4.0|I just finished \\"Moneyball\\" and found it a fascinating read. While I am neither a huge baseball fan nor an expert in statistics, I nevertheless found the blending of the two subjects quite captivating. I also found the style of the writing that author Michael Lewis uses to be very conversational and accessible to the reader.<br />I can see why this book, and the events it chronicles, caused such an uproar in the baseball world. The crux of the conflict seems to be theory vs. theater. The approach of Billy Beane and others has proved that using certain statistics to choose a team and project where they will go during the season is a valid, successful approach to the game.<br />However, there is a case to be made for their opposition's claim that such an approach takes the flair and theater out of baseball. I recall that someone once said, \\"We don't know how the game will turn out. If we did, it wouldn't be worth playing.\\" It's that peppering of random chance that creates the theater of a baseball game. Sometimes the crowd wants to see flashy, dramatic and unexpected plays.<br />My sense is that ultimately some combination of the statistical and the traditional will come about. That team managers will be able to use both the flash and the stillness to achieve victory.<br />I definitely recommend this book, whether you're a baseball fan or not. Also, if you are interested in reading about the inside story of the bond markets during the mid and late 80s, Lewis's first book, \\"Liar's Poker,\\" offers the reader the same accessible style.
B000000OQF|5.0|There's no question here, this album is perfect. And quite possibly the greatest rock and roll masterpiece of all time. It's a brilliant combination of jaw-dropping solos and riffs plus some of the greatest vocals you'll ever hear. The lyrics are excellent too. Not as thought-provoking as some deep material in the later \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums. But excellent nonetheless. The theme of this album is \\"sex and drugs\\" and does an incredible job presenting these themes. This album represents the turning point in the late-80s for rock and metal and sets the bar for the years to come.<br />Now, the breakdown:<br />1. \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" ***** <BR>2. \\"It's So Easy\\" ****1/2<BR>3. \\"Night Train\\" *****<BR>4. \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" *****<BR>5. \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" ****1/2<BR>6. \\"Paradise City\\" *****<BR>7. \\"My Michelle\\" ****1/2<BR>8. \\"Think About You\\" ****1/2<BR>9. \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" *****<BR>10. \\"You're Crazy\\" *****<BR>11. \\"Anything Goes\\" ****<BR>12. \\"Rocket Queen\\" *****<br />Overall, a mind-blowing album that never goes out of style. If you like hard rock/metal, this is a must-have.
0156027321|5.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" is quite possibly one of the best novels that I have ever read in my life.  It is funny, touching, intriguing, it provokes many thoughts about many subjects, and is, in a word, captivating.  <BR>\\"Life of Pi\\" addresses a touchy issue - religion - in a way that makes one wonder about the same things Pi ponders and struggles with.  One truly begins to question the way society functions and why it is not possible to simply love God, which is Pi's desire, but he wants to do so through different religions.  The novel raises questions like these and has a serious side, but throughout the entire book Yann Martel always keeps a comical side and makes even the simplest description of a person or place extremely entertaining.  From the stories about Pi's early childhood years to anecdotes about his family, to Richard Parker, Martel's humor is priceless.<BR>\\"Life of Pi\\" is very well written, but there are things that do at times get in the way of it being a so called easy read.  The sections in italic words are often a little bit confusing because it is jumping to another time and place, but eventually it is not such a problem.  <BR>One of the most interesting things about \\"Life of Pi\\" is the zoological references that Martel works into the book.  Chances are the average reader will not be a zoo keeper, and so all of this information will be strikingly new and unknown to them.  The idea of a zoo and its many facets and characteristics are portrayed in a way that addresses human society.  You have to think about why zoos are good and bad, how they work, and the fact that the human is the most dangerous animal in the zoo.  The minute details that Martel gives about certain animals and their habits immediately made me want to go to the zoo and just observe the animals to watch for these things that are described!<BR>The story of Pi's adventure is somewhat unbelievable and far fetched.  With faith, however, I think that it is feasible - and that is what this book is about, faith.  As Martel said in an interview, \\"Fanatics do not have faith - they have belief.  With faith you let go.  You trust.  Whereas with belief you cling.\\"  With faith, this novel becomes much more meaningful.  It allows you to absorb the thoughts and emotion that Pi experiences.  At the end of the book, when he presents two stories about what had happened to him, it is difficult to decide which of the two outcomes is true, and/or which of the two you prefer.  But it is maybe this unknowing that increases faith, because when things are unclear, it is the faith that you have in whatever guides you that brings them to light.<BR>\\"Life of Pi\\" is an equally wonderful read for pleasure or for intellectual challenge.  I would recommend it to everyone as a must-read, and say with confidence that anyone who reads it will be fascinated and touched.
B00005UKKF|1.0|For all of the praise and acclaim that Britney Spears receives from the media and from fans worldwide (what they see in her, I still don't know), there isn't much Spears has done to justify it - basically she comes off to me as someone that got by on pure luck rather than talent. She can't sing a note in tune, her dancing is substandard, the songs are accompanied by cheesy outdated sequencers, and the lyrics are nothing short of abominable - and this DVD proves it.  If the vocals have a pre-recorded sound to them, that's because they WERE pre-recorded - Spears is lip-synching throughout the whole \\"live\\" performance!<br />I'm sure Spears is aware of her many shortcomings - she hopes to distract everyone from them by wearing as little clothing as possible, including plenty of gratuitous cleavage shots (A note to parents: Keep this in mind when one of your children asks for this DVD). If there's anything I'll give her credit for, she sets a record for the amount of outfit changes she goes through during her performance - and that's about all I'll give her credit for. This DVD is all the proof you need that she is a lip-synching flunky and an average dancer at best - the only thing she's got going for her is her sex appeal, but that shouldn't translate to a successful career in the music industry. <br />In summary: This DVD is not worth your time or money. Spears can't decide whether she wants to appeal to children (through her cheesy bubblegum pop songs) or teenage boys and unmarried middle-aged men (through her revealing outfits), and comes up with something that's a complete waste of time, totally lacking purpose or substance. Basically, combine Teletubbies with a movie like \\"Showgirls\\", and you have Britney Spears: Live From Las Vegas in a nutshell - a concept that is as ridiculous as it is pointless.
1577311523|5.0|Great book based on Zen philosophy - but with a &quot;western spin&quot;. I have the audio version and Eckhart Tolle's voice is calm and soothing!  Great book!!
B00004TX5F|5.0|This DVD comes equipped with English translation from the Italian that this movie was made in. There are also subtitles in French and Spanish, as well as scene selections. French director Gerard Corbiau decided to make a lush film about the life of Farinelli, the greatest castrato singer in all history, portrayed by Italian actor Stefano Dionisi. On DVD, this film looks exquisite. It's a film of adult material (nudity and sex) and for specialized interests. Opera buffs will want to take a glimpse back to the early days of Baroque Opera when the castrati were the music idols of their day, enjoying rockstar status and great wealth. Everything about this film is really engaging to look at. The authentic historic costumes and the precise European locations provide the film with an immediacy and virtual historic escape. We are there in 17th century Italy following this dramatically heightened take on the career of Farinelli. Stefano Dionisi does a great performance, though his effiminate looks, mischief and diva temperament reveals something of a homosexual but this notion is taken into question when we see him in the love scenes with the many beautiful women that are his groupies and loyal admirers of his voice.<br />This drama may not be entirely true. The story of how the two brothers who are at conflict (one brother reaps the benefits the other is left frustrated and obscure) may be a deliberate attempt to resemble Milos Forman's Amadeus.Farinelli came from a family of musical ambitions and when he was about to hit puberty he wanted to be castrated for the sole purpose of making millions of money and acquiring world fame as a singer. Castrating male youth so as to keep their high-pitched soprano range was an Italian custom, which died out in the 18th century where women began to enjoy more prominet roles in opera, such as the operas of Mozart. Farinelli was the greatest castrato singer of his day. He was incredibly rich and enjoyed the company of royalty. After his many theatrical performances in operas by Handel and other composers, he gave up the stage to sing in the private chambers of Spanish King Phillip V. He lived in luxury there for the rest of his life.<br />The film is exotic and beautiful to look at and to listen. The music of Handel is prominent, since it was Handel who most wrote for the castrati voice. Impressive are the scenes at the opera, where Farinelli dazzles and mesmerizes his audience against the colorful and elaborate Baroque stage sets. In one scene early in the film, he sings what looks like the sun god Apollo, in a feathered helmet, and is briefly interrupted by a young lady's turning the pages to a libretto. He continues his singing and finishes with an elongated note that is impossible to hold for any tenor or soprano nowadays. Today, the castrati vocal sound is extinct. Perhaps close to it, and even this by a little off, is the male countertenor or a highly developed falsetto. I find that the female mezzo soprano voice is the closest to castrati singing, especially Cecilia Bartoli. Her singing in the recent Salieri Album comes dangerously close to sounding like castrati.<BR>In the movie, creative editing and synthesizing combined a tenor's lung power and a soprano's high top register to effectively portray the sound of a castrati, which sounded like a weird blend of male and female voices, with the female being the stronger range. With that voice, coloratura is unleashed with freedom, agility and high-flung acrobatics.

But within a matter of 2 songs KANYE blows those worries away. His delivery is totally on point and his rhymes have some of the freshest and funniest lines you'll hear this year, on any album.<BR>Everybody and his mama knows that his production is 1st rate and cant be messed with, and what's best is, he seems to have saved some of the best beats he's done for himself. (as he said on 1 of his joints). There's really no weak song on the album, but obviously i like some more than others, but my favourite are &quot;jesus walks&quot;, &quot;spaceship&quot;, &quot;breathe in, breathe out&quot;, &quot;school spirit&quot;, &quot;we dont care&quot;, &quot;all falls down&quot; and the bomb &quot;last call&quot; (co-produced by evidence). Go cop this a.s.a.p.
B0001Z363W|5.0|I swear, some of these reviewers are out of their damn minds.  &quot;Hangover Music Vol. 6&quot; is perhaps Zakk Wylde and Black Label Society's most well-rounded, complete effort to date.<br />I love all of Zakk's other releases, too.  &quot;Stronger Than Death,&quot; &quot;1919 Eternal,&quot; &quot;Pride and Glory,&quot; &quot;Alcohol Fueled Brewtality,&quot; and &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; are among my favorite albums.<br />But this most recent album showcases an artist unafraid to continue his own evolution, effortlessly integrating beautiful ballads, a distinctive vocal style, and heart-felt compositions with scintillating axe chops and competent piano work.  The signature Zakk Wylde sound is still here, but in a different way (which is good).  <br />For those fearing this great musician has gone pop/soft, fear not.  His shredding is better than ever.  I dare say Zakk's fretwork possesses just as much, if not more, dimension than in his prior releases. IMHO, this is a significant step up from his last outing, &quot;The Blessed Hellride,&quot; which is excellent in its own right.<br />To all of you &quot;Hangover Music&quot; bashers, do as the Beastie Boys say and CHECK YOUR HEAD, because some of you need serious help.  This is a first-rate release by Zakk Wylde and BLS.<br />SDMF forever!!!
B00018D44U|2.0|I really thought that after hearing Miss Jones' first album &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, ranting about her  to anyone that would listen, &amp; then giving it a five star rating that she and I would become the best of friends, musically speaking.  Not so, in her poorly written &amp; produced sad sack of a Sophomoric attempt with &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;.<br />Instead of the funky, blues, jazz mix infused with a tiny bit of country thrown in for good measure, which REALLY WORKED on &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, we instead get a totally COUNTRIFIED, WATERED-DOWN version of Norah and her so-called friends. Don't get me wrong, I like country music. However, this is not what I was expecting at all. The song, &quot;Creepin' In&quot; with none other than guest artist Dolly Parton grates on the nerves like fingernails down a chalkboard. Most of the other selections are just &quot;so, so&quot; and nothing like what we were able to experience on &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;.<br />However, I do enjoy the single &quot;Sunrise&quot; a little, Tom Waits' &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; is fine, and &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot; is mediocre at best. Thus the two stars instead of one.<br />Hopefully, if Norah releases a third album, she will go back to the roots of &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;.  I can't really even recommend this CD to the country music lover.  This album just fails and fails miserably.  If THIS is WHAT HOME FEELS LIKE, then I WANNA MOVE!
B00005ASHM|5.0|Does everyone already know that the title track, Pet Sounds, was an instrumental piece written specifically for a James Bond movie and then rejected by the film's producers? <br />For anyone who thinks they know or love this album, the Pet Sounds Box Set is a must.  People will never fully realize the Perfected Magnificence of Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys until they analyze these Pet Sounds compositions and arrangements broken down - 'instrumental only' and 'vocals only' - through a pair of really high-quality headphones.
B0000025F7|5.0|...and this album is a good reason why. Fill of pop sensibility, funk and disco punctuated together to make an eclectic sound, and the finest soul, rock and jazz, not to mention the usual ballad that makes you choke up inside, this album definitely should be an essential piece for everyone to listen to. This album is not just for the Disco lovers, it's also for those who love soul, who loves R&amp;B, pop, funk, and who loves Michael Jackson period. This album is all for you. Definitely and possibly the man's best work ever!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is one the best-written, well acted shows on television.  The program bounces along at a breakneck pace, filled witty dialogue and banter between characters that are reminiscent of Hollywood films of the 30's and 40's.  The show focuses on the mother-daughter relationship between Lorelei (Lauren Graham) &amp; Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) who are really best friends. Lorelei comes from a wealthy Hartford family and got pregnant at sixteen and moved to a small Connecticut hamlet called Stars Hollow to raise Rory. Lorelei runs the local Independence Inn and Rory is an incredibly gifted high school student.  The show's plots are built around the girl's relationship which each other and the conflicting lives Lorelei leads.  One is her life in Stars Hollow, which is filled with quirky residents and odd town events.  The other is with her estranged parents (Kelly Bishop &amp; Edward Hermann), whose blue-blooded ways rankle with her free spirit.  Lorelei is forced to take her parents help in order to pay for Rory's tuition at the prestigious Chilton School which will help Rory try to fulfill her dream of going to Harvard.  As a condition of giving her the money, Lorelei and Rory must attend weekly Friday dinners at their house.  These dinners lead to numerous confrontations between Lorelei and her parents throughout the season.  The residents of Stars Hollow provide comfort and friendship to the Gilmores.  Among them are the gruff and grumpy Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) who owns the local diner, Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy) who is Lorelei's best friend and chef at the inn and Michel Gerard (Yanic Truesdale) who is desk manager at the inn and is incredibly sarcastic.  Ms. Graham is a revelation in her role.  She commands every scene she is in and she can deftly deliver the rapid-fire dialogue that is in every show.  She is one of the most over-looked and underrated actresses on television.  The extras on the disk are as good as any on tv show box set.  One interesting extra is a pop-up video version of the \\"Rory's Dance\\" episode.  A big trademark of the show are the incredible amount of pop culture references included in each episode.  This extra provides you with a pop-up each time one is made and in the pop-up, it tells you where the reference is from.  If you've overlooked this quality show in the past, the you should check out this excellent package that gives the show its due.ne interesting extra is a pop-up video version of the \\"Rory's Dance\\" episode.

B000063147|4.0|Yeah I like this CD, but it was a little of the undeveloped voice from M.Shadows that gave this a 4 star rating. I still like it, don't get me wrong but M.Shadow's voice really improved.<BR>But I still recommend this CD for Hardcore and emo fans and owners of Waking the Fallen who don't have this. Also Streets kinda sounds like an Offspring song.<br />Best Songs:<BR>1.To End the Rapture(intro)<BR>2.Turn the Other Way<BR>3.Lips of Deceit<BR>4.Warmness on the Soul<BR>5.Breaking Their Hold<BR>6.Shattered By Broken Dreams
B00006I53S|5.0|These are great multi-purpose lens for the Canon Digital Rebel. The lens are fast and quiet, and the image stabilizer works like a charm. They just suere cost a lot.<br />I ordered this from J&amp;R and they are indeed US ones with full canon warranty and warranty card.
B000002J2F|4.0|Trickoftail and the &quot;anonymous&quot; reviewer from Chicago are obviously the same person.  I'm starting to think Wendy Trainor is the same person also.  &quot;She&quot; says basically the same thing as trickoftail has the same babyish way of writing.<br />Anyway trickoftail/Wendy, if you don't like this era of Genesis then fine, you don't have to like it.  But please stop calling those of us who do like some of the post-Hackett albums &quot;posers.&quot;  Believe it or not, most of us do own the Gabriel/Hackett albums and have listened to them many times, and we have good reasons for liking this stuff as well.  Maybe you need to expand your horizons beyond the old progressive rock bands like ELP, Yes and Crimson and listen to some other bands.  Then maybe you'll understand why, at least for a few albums after Steve left, Genesis was still a great band that had not sold out.
B00000729S|5.0|Is it punk or psychedelia ?  Is it psychedelic punk ?  Whatever label you attempt to put on this album it fails to describe just what is ezactly going on in this sonic document from 1966.  Whatever the case may be this is highly original and enjoyable music.  The Monks were the garage band from outside of time and they deserve a special place in rock and roll history-for their spirit as well as their originality.  Thank God for cool DJs and cool radio stations (not to mention record companies) who see to it that music like this doesn&quot;t get buried in absolute obscurity.
B000002L9J|5.0|Makes Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and all those others sound like a custard-cream pie commercial.<br />One song is worth a career of others!
B000002KB8|5.0|I first heard Black Sabbath on a rock compilation when I was 14 and have been listening to them for 17 years, in which time this album has not worn thin. Even apart from the whole &quot;they invented heavy metal&quot; thing and the patent influence of this album and what came after on all rock music thereafter, this album stands on its own as a brilliant piece of music from the early 70s. It is the musical equivalent of a Hammer Horror film, but has aged much better!

Highly recommend this CD and really hope that many saw the concert. Lingering &quot;your halo's slipping down&quot;....
B000002H6C|5.0|To produce such an amazing album after the death of much loved bassist,Cliff Burton is nothing short of extraordinary. The riffs, solos &amp; Drums in ...And Justice For All are worthy of my 5 stars. Blackened is an amazing opener, Fast paced and brutal. One is an epic song which unfortunatly came after Burton but features a solo which is magnificent. ( At this point I have to mention that I couldnt be bothered with filling in reviews on the other songs but take my word for it, they are great). The last song on the album, Dyers Eve is ... it leaves me lost for words. An unofficial showcase for the bands talents, Dyers Eve features fast &amp; catchy riffing, An amazing Guitar solo, great lyrics and manic drums. In fact Lars Ulrich is unable to play this song anymore because it is so diffucult. For anyone who wishes to experience metal &amp; Metallica buy this album, In fact its so good if you write to me I will give you a grant! <BR>   So please fo Metals sake Get this, Thank you.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|If I could rate this album a zero or below I certainly would.  I was not impressed with this album at all, because these guys could do so much better than this.  Right from the start, &quot;As I Am&quot; seems to be an attempt at a single and getting nu-metal mallgoths into Dream Theater, and this is so not like them.  I burnt this album off Best Buy Rhapsody, and it was free since it was my first burn, but man....what a waste of a perfect, blank, unused CD-R.  I'm SO glad I DIDN'T have to pay for this piece of garbage.  The songs are just not interesting.  The music SOUNDS good, but it just does not have that special stuff that Dream Theater have always brought to their previous albums.  I was not interested and quite angry at what these guys &quot;accomplished.&quot;  IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not buy this album, if you think you may like it then do yourself a favor and burn it from someone else.  Although you may of course find it to be a waste of a blank CD-R, so try to get a rewritable.
0312995423|5.0|This novel was a very interesting look at technology and the cryptogrophy world.  The technology described was very interesting, and made me wonder what the government has exaclty.  It was a fun book that kept you guessing almost non-stop throughout.  The characters were fun to get along with, and the plot very understandable.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun read.  It incorporated many fun elements into it.  Unfortunatly, it followed standard Dan Brown book type, but it was good enough to overlook that.  This book is a must read for anyone who likes a good adventure and technology.
0316666343|4.0|I completely loved this book. It was so interesting. Alice Sebold portrays the rape with her own experiences and ends it with a murder which I think she felt like when she was raped. I think she felt like she was dead and she was really watching from afar what happens and being helpless, unable to do anything about what was happening. All she could do was hope that everything goes well. Anyone that reads this book I think should pick up her memoir Lucky. It's her story of when she was raped and beaten. I think the two books are very alike in some aspects and I can relate them easily. It's fun reading the two and seeing how alike and different they are.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|Thank god, that we still have groups like Marillion, this album is fantastic, each song is superb, try to buy the two disc version, which includes the 17th minute master piece &quot;Ocean Cloud&quot;, trust me you wont be disappointed.
0140277447|5.0|Her inclusion of over 50 pages of references backing up her findings and statements is a good indication that Iris Chang values integrity and authenticity.  This well-researched, thoroughly-documented account of the atrocities brought onto the Chinese people brings light to one of history's darkest events.  Let us try to cast our biases and prejudices aside, and read this book for the sake of truth and humanity.  Is that too much to ask?
6305657947|5.0|This is a movie of surprise and surprise again.  Every time you think you have it figured out, you are fooled by a beautiful twist right until the last scene of the movie.  But the real treat, is the action between Brosnan and Russo.  She is sexuality personified . . . and focused on Crown with a purpose.  Brosnan (Crown) becomes intriqued by her determination and falls for her and begins to play her game.  The action between the two crackles and sparkles.<BR>It is a great movie.  Much better than the orginal (can't say that very often) and writing and camera work is excellent.  This is a movie to own and see over and over again.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This movie has been discussed in great detail in these reviews. I want to add one more 5-star vote to this epic tale of love for its sweeping cinematography and its historical story, which place it in the same class as some of the other top films of 2003, including \\"Master and Commander\\" or even\\"Lost In Translation.\\" To me this was a movie to sit back and enjoy in all its epic grandeur. The movie can be divided into 3 parts in chronological order, much as North Carolina itself is divided into three parts: coastal plain, piedmont, and mountains: the first part is where Ada and Inman meet and includes Inman's participation in the Civil War, ending with his injury and his escape from the hospital; the second part is his Odyssey-like journey back to Cold Mountain, the strange people he meets on the journey, and the simultaneous story of Ada and Ruby's struggles to keep Ada's farm going after Ada's father's death; and the third part is the conclusion when they meet again. There are also at least 2 strong secondary plots:  1) Ruby's derelict father who is also a fine traditional mountain musician; 2)the vigilantes who root out and kill Confederate Civil War deserters.
B00005JLYW|3.0|This movie is the exact same as the first - just with different hairstyles, no Bill Murray, and Demi Moore making her comeback. There are a few laugh out loud moments, especially when I realised that the old grey haired man (who appears for one scene, and wasn't even credited) was infact Bruce Willis.<br />What's great about this movie once more, is the Angels never use guns - unless you count the fallen Angel, played by Demi Moore. Who used this movie to make her comeback. And has since done nothing but appear in the papers with Ashton Kutcher. And how much did she look like Catherine Zeta Jones in certain shots? When her hair wasn't poker straight, and was actually nice and wavy, and the makeup was the exact same as Mrs Douglas herself. No matter what the press say about Demi, she still looks good, although she'll never be as pretty as she was in Ghost. And no amount of Botox can remove those lines around your mouth honey!<br />There's a lot of allusions to other movies in this - Flashdance, Sound of Music, Singin' In The Rain, and even Grease gets a mention! (Cameron Diaz's boyfriend in the movie, goes to his high school reunion at Rydell!)<br />Apart from that, this movie is just the same as the first. Still good to watch, doesn't use up much brain cells to watch, and entertaining. They could have attempted something different though.
B0000959N0|3.0|People say Daredevil never confesses, but how many times do you see somebody in a movie sit down and look at a menu. If we don't see em eat it dont mean that they dont eat. Daredevil starts to confess in the standard way and is cut off by the padre. He goes back later. Who knows what he says? Where's the problem with that? Its not a problem. He's talking to his padre. It shows he has soul. He's not heartless. He's got conscience. Some people are waaay too serious and stuffy. This movie is supposed to be fun. It is. I liked the action. Bullseye is a trip! The subway scene is off the hook! There's touching scenes too. It's a good. Not great, but good for sure.
014028009X|4.0|This book was absolutely hilarious.  I laughed through the entire thing.  Helen fielding made it really easy to identify with the characters and to love bridget.  This is a great book that makes you feel good when you read it.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost in Translation, Sofia Coppola's latest work, is without question one of the finer films of the year. The stylistic transition from her last feature, The Virgin Suicides, to Lost in Translation is not exactly obvious, but nonetheless shows Coppola directing a more mature-natured picture than she previously has. Lost in Translation's subtleties are its greatest achievements, while the actor's performances are the impressive allies to a compelling story of love, life, chemistry, and respect. If at least one Oscar is not garnered from this combination of elements, I will find myself sadly disappointed. <br />The movie begins with Bob Harris (Bill Murray) arriving in Tokyo, Japan to shoot a commercial for a Japanese-brand whisky. Upon arriving in the country, it's immediately obvious that he is not completely up for this task. He arrives at a beautiful hotel where he is lavishly welcomed by the hotel's staff before retreating to his room to alienate himself from the experience. Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansson, is also at the hotel. She is staying with her photographer husband while his is in the country for work.<br />The next evening, Charlotte sees Bob having a less than fulfilling time in the hotel's lounge and sends him a drink. Later that evening, they meet again in the lounge when both are unable to sleep. An instant bond is established and the two slowly begin to realize that they are the best suited company for one another. <br />Eventually Bob and Charlotte go out together on the town. In the midst of being in a completely different culture, where more than the language is a barrier, the two find themselves meeting on a much deeper level than they had originally planned. The fact that the age difference is obvious to the audience makes some of the subsequent scenes more intense. You're left to question if the two are going to take the relationship to a sexual level. You're left to question if the two are truly falling in love. You're left to question if the age really has any bearing on the chemistry that they feel together.<br />Therein lays the true beauty of this film. Although it would be extremely easy to have these two romantically fall in love, they're simply two people that meet on an emotional level. For lack of better words, they just understand each other. For the next couple of days they utilize their time to the fullest by enjoying their time together. They don't want the time to end, but realize that in just a few short days everything in their lives will go back to normal. <br />During the last evening of the trip, a fire alarm is sounded in the hotel forcing everyone outside until all is clear. At this point, Bob sees Charlotte and approaches her. The moment is uncomfortable because, through no intention of his own, Charlotte becomes aware of the fact that Bob has unexpectedly had another woman in his room the night before. Unable to deny the fact that she has become emotionally attached, Charlotte asks Bob when he is going home. He replies, \\"In the morning.\\" At this point, it's in the open and the two realize just exactly how much fun they've had together over the course of their visit to Japan. This is a friendship that could very easily be taken to the next level, but somehow the two are smart enough to understand that this is something that just needs remain where it's at. <br />After leaving the hotel to catch his plane home, Bob sees Charlotte walking down the streets of Tokyo and implores the driver to pull over so he can say what he wanted to say earlier. Unfortunately, and fortunately, we are unable to hear what he tells Charlotte. We're only left to speculate what it is. I'm sure most people agree that it can only be one or two things. It's such a beautiful scene, though. It's one of the true highlights of cinema in the past several years.<br />Everything about Lost in Translation is in the right place. As I stated before, it's the subtleties that make it so great. Whether it's the witty humor of Murray, the innocence of Johansson, the brief appearances of the small handful of cast members, or the beautiful imagery of Tokyo, nothing has been overdone.<br />Finally, as I left the theatre, I realized just exactly how much my emotions had been played with. However, it wasn't until the second time I saw this film that I fully understood why. On some level I guess I had wanted things to turn out differently, but maturity of the writing actually made this movie ten times more enjoyable than it would have been had it ended the way I wanted it to the first time.

B00003CXI1|5.0|After reading Rowling's book, I was expecting a total disaster of a movie. I couldn't imagine the possibility of a decent film version of such a great book. I was gladly wrong! HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE translates perfectly to the screen. The story is faithfully engaging and the characters are played as if they walked off the pages of the book. When I first saw Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, and Richard Harris as Dumbledore, I was amazed at how much they WERE the characters! Harry himself (Daniel Radcliffe) is perfectly cast, as are his friends, Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). Even Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) is captured in all his warm, grizzly bear-sized glory! The story is well known: Harry grows up with his dastardly mean muggle (non-magical folk) aunt, uncle, and cousin Dudley, not knowing that all along, he's the legendary hero of the entire wizarding world! One day, Harry begins to find out who / what he really is. An entirely new universe opens up before him, leading him into the great adventure that is his true destiny. A riveting tale of discovery, courage, and friendship. HPATSS is very well-written fantasy fiction, turned into a wonderful family movie. Highly recommended...
B0001D0FTW|4.0|that a band could have a potential top 40 single with the song &quot;Lavatory Love Machine&quot;??? Wicked chorus...release it as a single, guys.  Oh yeah, the rest of the album is pretty good too.  These guys were getting pretty cookie cutter a la Stratovarius (most of their previous albums all sound relatively the same). It's nice to see some originality in the now (sadly)insipid genre of power metal.
B0001LJCPC|2.0|to paraphrase Mr. Rodriquez, thatis.<br />check out the real thing by looking into Del Castillo's music.<br />The one cut on this and few cuts on other soundtracks do not touch their music.<br />They will be big, and Texas will miss them......
B00004XONN|3.0|An overview of Radiohead so far.<BR>Pablo Honey - debut; a little uninspired; featuring the hit &quot;creep&quot;<BR>The Bends - a beautiful melancholic album <BR>OK Computer - an intense and passionate album<BR>Kid A - a dark album that can have a depressing as well as addictive influence<br />Kid A is very compelling but very touch and go at the beginning and extremely hard to get into. You have to be in that particular mood to listen to it.It is not always easy to listen to dark music. However, aside the fact that there are no outstanding tracks, one should not override Kid A as being out of the Radiohead music collection. The level of creativity that Radiohead develop here is quite something.<BR>Kid A is not a rock album, it would appear to be more of a mix between post rock-prog rock-electro-beats-techno and jazz.I raise my hats to the Oxford students for achieving such a difficult outcome. But, the fact that Radiohead have achieved material surpassing my expectations previously makes it hard for me to judge Kid A objectively. I guess it is about being prepared to go further in musical abstraction, i.e.listening and not judging.And yes, if one is prepared to go up to that level of abstraction, Kid A can ends up growing more and more on you. I am caught between two opinions.I agree that good music does not have to be what one expects to be good but I still prefer the stuff which stands out.<br />Song analysis<BR>1):interesting mix of overlapping delayed voices and synthesizer loop. Not bad.<BR>2):The least accessible piece at first.Does not readily invite the listener.It does not have any genre but it becomes indeed very interesting the more you listen to it.There are a lot of hidden sounds and secrets in this &quot;electronic&quot; track. Quite fantastic really.A work of art.Maybe a vision of music in the future.Who knows?<BR>3):One of the catchier rythms.Starts off with a grounding bass line, follows a funky beat trance with Thom singing a repetitive formula and ends up being an explosive electro-jazz climax.Improvised and Impressive.<BR>4):A slow beautiful melancholic ballad, picking up kind of where &quot;Lucky&quot; left us but in a more classical music approach with violins and horns.Not as striking as &quot;OK Computer&quot; ballads but more dramatic and still powerful.<BR>5):An interesting interlude which one would not think was made by Radiohead but more,say, Brian Eno.A bit unhappening on the surface but fits in alright in the album as a moment of transition.Peaceful music.<br />6):A completely different Radiohead, back to raw guitars and drums.Name it the rock song that every body is looking for on Kid A, but it doesn't sound like classic Radiohead either.Not optimistic but deep.<BR>7):Another &quot;unlike Radiohead&quot; track.I would call it a 3-minute interlude of impro combining all sorts of styles.Rock? Jazz? Electro? Sounds more like Thom's state of mind if anything.Drifty, rythmic, smooth experimentation.<BR>8):Back into Thom's schizophrenic visions.That comes out as panicked repetitive whining fueled with pounding techno beats and hard synthesizer riffs.Brings you back into reality and the world of chaos.Extreme, driven and troubling.I love the end. <BR>9):Thom murmurs his depressed feelings along with soft bell-like sounding synthesizers and drum rythm sounding like the ticking of a clock.Tender and morose at the sime time.Not the particularly uplifting song on a rainy day.I like the end.<BR>10):One of my least favorite Radiohead tracks, unfotunately. Not really original too long and depressing.I rarely listen to this track.Maybe it gets me down too much.

B00000JLWW|1.0|As you watch Leonardo Di Caprio drown, frozen in the cruel arctic waters, it is hard not to experience a tremendous feeling of satisfaction.  The catharsis is overwhelming.  For more than two hours you have been wishing that Leonardo, along with most of the cast and crew, were dead, and then there they are, breathing their last.  It is enough to make you want to shake James Cameron's hand.  *  The film begins brilliantly with some lively and vulgar wordplay from an underwater salvage team.  You could be forgiven for thinking that you have inserted the wrong film (say, a made-for-video teen action exploitation flick)into your DVD player, but no, Mr.Cameron is masterfully toying with your expectations.    *  Quickly we meet Jack (Leonardo) and, my, what a snivelling little weasel he is; within minutes a deep enmity is established between him and the gentle viewer.  From then on Jack is placed in perilous situations where one might quite reasonably expect his imminent demise; thus, Kate Winslett (Rose) could have easily pushed him overboard on any number of occasions, and smothered him bodily on at least one other; Billy Zane could, by simply replacing a blank with a live bullet, have shot him - in fact, rumour has it that this in fact occurred, and consequently most of the budget of the film was dedicated to the CGI recreation of Leonardo in the last ninety minutes of screentime, and in the subsequent Oscar ceremonies, as well as in his so-called 'real life' ever since.    *    In any case, the appearance of the iceberg is truly cause for celebration.  What a good iceberg it is, searching out and destroying this disgraceful cast and scuppering the film good and proper.  As the water itself, the very stuff of life, hunts Leonardo down through the murky corridors one feels sure that justice is about to be dispensed.  The denouement is delicious.  *  A lovely postscript shows Rose throwing her priceless jewel into the depths of the Atlantic.  Rather than selling her treasure, and using the proceeds to feed the hungry or to heal the sick, she chooses to throw perhaps the equivalent of two hundred million dollars into the ocean, down the proverbial drain, as it were - surely a wonderful symbol for the movie as a whole.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|I have been a big fan of Simply Red's since 1985 when Picture Book came out. I have owned most of their albums at some point, but none had excited me as much as this one. <br />I first heard Sunrise while shopping at my local Nordstrom store. Later heard You Make Me Feel Brand New in Nordstrom as well. I had no idea that this was one of my 80's favorites until I saw their excellent performance on One Life to Live on February 13 (anyone else see it? It was great!). You should have seen the look on my face as I realized how awesome these songs were. Sunrise is absolutely the best modern pop song that I have heard in ages.<br />I purchased the album a few weeks ago &amp; have not stoped playing it since. Even the more mediocre songs still merit a good rating. That says something for much of today's music. Pick this up today ... you will not be disappointed I promise!
B0000VAFO0|2.0|I was wary of this movie when I first saw the previews. It was touted as a Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves. GROAN! Okay, bad enough, really but I still had an open mind, even though I knew of NO ONE who gave it a good review. Well, tut to them, I would see it anyway though it was against my better judgement. Really, I had to work up the courage to watch this one. Blatantly, it was a waste of courage. I should have listened to my inner monolgoue and gone with my gut. This movie STINKS. There was no dialogue. You could easily go ten minutes without a single word being spoken which was fine considering the caliber of the actors, but when they *did* finally speak, it was completely predictable. I had delivered the line on the couch 30 seconds before it was spoken on screen. That is not a good sign, my friends. The costumes were nice but very overdone; yes, even clothing can become cliche and worn out. Can you say Matrix? I knew you could. Same for the special effects, the feel, the darkness of the movie, the character types, the cinematography... heck, *everything*. Oh yeah, but cleverly the writers added the extra depth and dimension of... Vampires and Werewolves! ...Waitaminnut. Thay had those in Matrix, too! So never mind, nothing original in here at all, not one iota. Except maybe for that STUPIDEST of stupid invention lovingly monickered 'sunshine bullets'. The heck?? The poster/money shot wasn't even cool. The female vampire drowned... DROWNED! Vamps don't even BREATHE, for crying out loud! They reflect, too. I could have handled reflections, actually, but the drowning part? NO. Guess they have souls and are not undead in this movie which, I thought, was the very definition of a vampire. Silly me. And for heaven's sake, don't look for anything but wooden performances from the lead actors. The vampie lead chick was uninspiring. The lead werewolf -Romeo, I guess- was unlikable, static, and did not nurture any kind of response from me other than boredom. Ho hum. There are a couple of points that were not so bad. One, the old vampire dude. He was kinda cool. Two, the silver injection for werewolves. Not bad. The only thing that keeps this from getting one star is the fact the editing wasn't bad. The rest, however, is old and tired and stinky... And friends, those two points of interest are not enough to change what this movie really is: two kernals of golden corn stuck in a big steamy pile of crap. Not pretty, but true.
0694003735|5.0|My son and I read this book for the very first time this past week.  At only 7 days old, Gavin found this book fascinating! I was amazed how he stared at the pictures, taking it all in.  He loves this book!  I sit the bunny next to him and we read the book every night at bedtime - usually 3 times through and he is quiet and attentive the whole time.  He's only 2 weeks old now and I can't wait for him to grow older with this book so he can start pointing out the things in the pictures that have him so spellbound.  I plan to get this book for all my expecting friends.
B0001I55OC|1.0|Ok, I read Timeline in I think January, and was a bit anxious to see how the movie would relate to the book. Boy, what a waste of a rental...Let me tell you something...read the book, please do. Use your imagination...when you're reading the book, dont think about Paul Walker in the place of Chris...it just ruins everything. I mean, this movie was so different than the book, that they shouldn't share the same name. They DESTROYED! Chricthon's awesome book. Ya'll, really go read the book, its soo good...watch the movie afterwards and see what im talking about. Possibly the worse acting ive ever seen, and the worse adaptaption of a book ive seen.
B0000DIXN7|5.0|Though the lyrics of Winehouse's songs make more sense and hold more meaning for urban Brits, there's no reason why Americans can't identify with her frank music.  It's a great combination of jazz, soul, and r&amp;b.  If I had to pin it down, I'd say she's Billie Holiday meets Esthero.  I just can't believe she's only 19.  <br />Every single song is fantastic, but I think You Sent Me Flying, Take The Box, Know You Now, and Help Yourself are the standouts on the album.  I can't stop playing them.  Island needs to release this in the States.  It's outrageous that the CD is over $30; I bought it for £9.79 at Sainsbury's!
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem's sophmore album, The &quot;Marshall Mathers LP&quot; tops every lyrical performance on any other CD. Eminem's CD is a classic for the ages. Every track on this CD is a masterpiece. The guest appearances make all the songs great, from D12 to Dr.Dre the song go off. Eminem's seems to be at the tops of his performance when he appears solo. Tracks like Criminal, Kill You, Who Knew, and the best lyrical song The Way I Am point at Marshall's lyrical power. Tracks like Remember Me, Under The Influence, and Atymile gives the finishing touches to an amazing performance from Slim. Even the skits on these CD are funny overall this CD desrves five stars.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|The truth for me, like Edward Bloom, is that I have never been a reasonable man. I believe that this fact taints my views on Big Fish the movie. (I confess I have yet to read the book.)<br />The thing about movies of late is that the public, though demanding more and more in the way of special effects, is less and less willing to suspend their disbelief. This kills a culture's ability to hear (or view) story.<br />Yet Big Fish is FULL of story.<br />Big Fish is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. As much as I loved Return of the King's apocryphal Lord of the Rings, Big Fish was the best picture last year (incidentally, Finding Nemo receives my vote for runner up).<br />So why the dirth of recognition elsewhere?<br />Our culture has stuck its head in the sand when it comes to accepting the wonderful. By wonderful I do not mean &quot;great.&quot; I mean those things that are full of wonder. Be they things that put us in awe, or things that merely make us smile, we have all forsaken, at least to a degree, the wide-open life before us. Have we become too seared by a false sense of maturity and the tepid self-assuredness in the everyday to ever wake to the true and the beautiful?<br />Not really...<br />...though some of us, if we are not terribly care-full, will never know the difference.<br />Get a copy of Big Fish. It is not The Answer, though it may &quot;prime&quot; you--may open your eyes. Your heart may just follow.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Ohmigod,if I had to choose one Roberto Benigini movie, it'd would have to be Life is Beautiful. After this movie, I did realize that life really is beautiful. This movie is about Gweeno...the main character. He keeps bumping into Dora, a schoolteacher. They soon marry and have a son, who they named, Joshua. On Joshua's birthday, Gweeno and his son are taken to a concentration camp. Dora finds out and wants to be taken to the camp as well. At the end of the movie, Gweeno dies and Joshua gets his wish to ride in a tank...how beautiful..

B00005V3Z4|5.0|_Donnie Darko_ is an amazing film that is so original that it shakes up your average, movie watching experience.  In the film, Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Donnie, an incredibly sharp teen who becomes fascinated with the ideas of time travel due to the visions he suffers from.  His schizophrenic visions add an intensity to the film that keeps you on the edge of your seat trying to piece together all that is happening.  The acting in this film is quite good, but it is the film's originality that will grab you and shake your spinal column.<br />The soundtrack is superb and the plotline is very engaging.  One can characterize this film has having some elements of tragedy under its belt as we watch Donnie, a character that we become sympathetic towards despite his mental instability, following the groove of fate to its inevitable conclusion.  The real question the film explores is the degree to which we should consider Donnie mentally unstable-perhaps he has tapped into truth that is beyond our grasp.  I highly recommend this film for those who enjoy a bit of a hallucinatory ride and exploring darker themes.  The film has developed a cult following and promises to continue-this film is still being reviewed on a frequent basis three years after its release.

B00005YU1O|3.0|Waking Life_ is certainly an intense film, quite unlike anything that is currently out there.  Overall, I enjoyed the film, but it took a couple of viewings to fully absorb everything.  Throughout the film, our protagonist wanders around trying to navigate the gap between dreaming and reality, listening to everyone who has a mind to talk to him.  Naturally, some of the monologues are interesting and stimulating, while some of them are pure rants.  Even the more philosophical talks are delivered with an ordinary language that renders them a bit childish: \\"It's like, quantum physics, man.  You know, like, the real stuff that's out there, man.\\"  This is not an actual quote, but rather a demonstration of the kind of speech to which I am referring.  I get tired of the surfer speech and agree with other reviewers who have called the philosophies \\"juvenile\\" at times.  There are many points in the film where we get to listen to your average Joe spout off about \\"the truth\\" when it is obvious that he probably couldn't even pass his driver's exam.<br />Still, the animation in this film is truly unique and interesting to watch.  Despite the film's rambling nature and absence of plot, the spliced sequences make for an interesting ride that definitely breaks the norm.  If you enjoy animated films that are a bit \\"out there,\\" you should see _Waking Life_.
