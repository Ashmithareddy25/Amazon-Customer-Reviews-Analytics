B003Z0BWR2|5.0|A very easy book to read but not in a childish way. Cassandra Clare is a good author and I will be following her books
B00CNEVHMG|3.0|evidently the compression on the original tapes was extreme.there are times it sound's as if recorded in mono.almost no bass,even with sub turned up.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book. I'm so glad they are doing a movie on this. I love the relationship between all the characters in this. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00AHJL7BK|3.0|This game is OK as number games go.  It can be very frustrating at times which I'm sure will please those who love this type of game.
B003Z0BWRM|4.0|I did like this book,always reading fantasy,it's young and fresh,enjoyed the trilogy altogether. I have already recommended it to friends.
1447231171|3.0|I thought it would come sooner but I got it within 2 weeks...its ok. Im reading it now so I'l let you know...
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|there's no way to correct a mistake, and it froze up several times, which is why I finally uninstalled it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I live in a high storm area and was looking for something with an active and customizable radar, this did not fit the bill at all
B007THA4FI|5.0|I'm amazed at the intimate and detailed knowledge of small town life Rowling brings to her story, especially of such a wide range of social strata.  She makes the reader feel compassion even for the most despicable of her characters.  I can hardly put it down, and I don't have a clue how she's going to end it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The writing is sensitive, touching and a wonderful story.  The author handled this situation which is so current in our world today in a most understanding manner.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I play this on Facebook, now I can enjoy this on my Kindle Fire HD too! So Much fun to play.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Excellent. Well written and acted. A classic movie for Morgan Freeman fans. Tim Robbins is brilliant from start to finish.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I use the goggle search all of the time. I like the way I am able to type in some or part of a subject and I am able to get it fast.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It kept me guessing and when the twists started happening I couldn't put it down.  I need five more words.
0812973992|5.0|READ THIS BOOK TWICE IN PREPARATION FOR A BOOK CLUB DISCUSSION; ENJOYED IT EVEN MORE THE 2ND TIME AROUND. MCCAN'S CHARACTER DEPICTIONS ARE SENSITIVE AND BUBBLING IN INTENSITY AND TRUTH. IN THE MIDST OF SQUALLER AND GRIEF THERE IS STILL HOPE, THERE IS STILL THE RISK TO REACH OUT AND LIVE LIFE, TO REACH FOR AND MOUNT THE WIRE. INSPIRATIONAL.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|This documentary single handedly got me into Formula 1 and Aryton Senna. I've watched it 3 times in the past month!
B00338QENI|3.0|In the beginning, the book was very interesting but it was difficult to follow at times. In the end I lost interest in the story. Since then I have read an article in The Washing Post about Henrietta's family having more say about how her cells are used.
B003H9MSPG|3.0|This item was OK. I knew this item was used but the box was kind of old and the Nerf shot gun wasnt in the box it was in a separate box and it did not fit in its original box.
B008L5G4I8|4.0|I found the story interesting and intriguing. I was surprised by the ending because I did not know who the murderer was .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good graphics. Pretty good gameplay. Always keeps me coming back to play. Getting energy is an awful pain. The mini games are cute.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I waited on pins and needles every week for the next episode of Downton Abbey.  Thoughtful, complex characters are created by amazing writers, incredible actors portray those complex characters, the setting is unbelievably gorgeous, and you get a history lesson while you watch.  What more could an audience want?
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's a totally cool and fun game  I'm 9 1/2 years old and I still like to play it and I think you would enjoy it
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|No real scary images! My daughter laugh at the horses antics the most but then so did I... a really cute movie even 1 year olds can watch. Thank God!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game helps me work on my thinking skills and knowledge to learn and think faster better than normal.....good game....emoji pop shall i say
B005OGYH90|5.0|Incredibly friggin awesome CD!!! I've seen Slash Live 7 times since 1988 and this cd comes pretty dang close to the real thing!! Myles' voice is amazing!! He does Slash's song like he was there in the beginning. I haven't heard anyone come close to Axl's voice 20+ years ago. Myles with Slash comes pretty close to my love of the old GN'R!! The interview with Slash on the DVD is awesome and bonus...it comes with a mini Slash poster!! I'm SO HAPPY that I ordered this!!! Coming from a diehard GN'R/Slash fan...I totally recommend this to everyone.
B009CGAB9S|2.0|Boring, slow moving movie, which, given the great cast and story material, could have been a smash. The writers blew it and deNiro wound up directing a dirge. Too bad.
B0001I561E|5.0|thank you for helping me to restore my Disney collection of movies on DVD. some day will be able to share these movies with my grandkids.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Branagh's Hamlet is far and away the best version of the play ever made -- bar none, including Olivier, Burton and Williamson.
B0016CVN02|5.0|This 2-disc set is pretty awesome as a whole. Disc one starts with some slower tunes like Time Is On My Side, Heart of Stone, and Play With Fire then it jumps right into (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction to help pick up the pace a bit. After As Tears Go By plays then the best part of the Disc gets going with Get Off of My Cloud, Mother's Little Helper, 19th Nervous Breakdown, Paint It, Black, and Under My Thumb. Then to finish the first disc you get Ruby Tuesday and Let's Spend the Night Together.<br /><br />The first disc is a smash and the second disc rolls with it by starting with Jumpin' Jack Flash and Street Fighting Man. Then the tone changes as you get into Sympathy For The Devil, Honky Tonk Women, Gimme Shelter, and Midnight Rambler. Normally what I have seen in the past with compilations of a bands work is the back end of the record is filler but that is not the case here as they close with You Can't Always Get What You Want, Brown Sugar, and Wild Horses.<br /><br />Overall Hot Rocks is superb and a great collection of The Stones' work. I recommend it.
0812979656|5.0|I'm always hoping that Arundhati Roy will write another novel, or that The God of Small Things will be made into a movie. This is the most beautifully crafted story, with characters so well developed that it feels biographical. I read this book often, and teach it in my college Literature classes. It never fails to move me all over again. Roy weaves personal tragedy, Indian history, and cultural colonialism together, seamlessly.
B00005MP58|3.0|Had a problem viewing it on one of my DVD players was in a different format but was able to view on a newer player. perhaps not set to all Australian DVD format
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is beautiful!  The gameplay is really fun and easy to understand.  I do have one warning though:  addicting!  Have fun!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes your brain think. I like challenges like this. Very clever! I think the best one is the race horse picture.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I love this series. Completely draws you in! The costumes and characters are well done and well scripted.
B009LQKHIO|2.0|Book was Fine No book that I would tell people you gotta read It kept you reading but just wasn't spicy enough
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great fun way to spend some down time . cant stop playing all the day long . fun challenge. great graphics.
B0033VUH6A|4.0|It was a pretty good movie. It kept me interested the whole time. I'd watch it again and recommend it
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Full of adventure.  Just enough tension but not too much for kids.  It was a little too dark in parts; but it did not take away from the story.  The characters were likable.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My children love it, of course I play a little time to time. Very addictive in every way.<br />I love how such a great game can be free!
B005HEPIDS|4.0|I loved the characters.  You have a crew with all the usual flaws, add Seven of Nine who has more social issues than a Vulcan.  The idea of being stranded on an island among the stars with frequent alien visitors was definitely for me.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|A Perfect Classic,<br /><br />Cherish this Blu Ray and pass it on to Generation To Generation if you are a Science Fiction Fan
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|BBC at its best. Daring and realistic. Life is not always a bed of roses for the haves or always a pile of manure for the have nots.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|You can remotely  play steam games!! And the mobile way to get games and chat!! This is a good app for gamers!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book has a lot of heart and is such a sweet read for any age.  I would definitely recommend it!
140006922X|5.0|I've seen where some folks are calling for Fox to apologize to Resa Azlan for their interview. Actually, I think old Reza needs to send Lauren Green a thank-you note. You just can't buy that kind of marketing. In one short segment Fox again confirmed they are a bunch ideological idiots and they managed to ensure Mr. Azlan a best-seller. If his agents had planned it, it could not have worked any better for Zealot sales.<br /><br />I just finished the book, which I thoroughly enjoyed both as a work of light history and good writing. This work is also an excellent book-end to 'No God, but God'. For those of us that have not been brainwashed since birth to believe in Abrahamic superstition, I find no great revelations. But, what Azlan does is provide some historical context not only to who Jesus actually was, but how and why his philosophy became so distorted. It is also a good reminder (for those who didn't know it or have been taught to forget it) that Jesus was a Jew - an illiterate Jew from Galilee who only knew Judaism from oral history and little else. What Jesus thought, taught and did wasn't unique. In fact, the whole messiah thing was so common at that time the Romans were playing whack-a-mole with them. Jesus didn't set the foundation for Christianity, Paul did. Jesus, as a Jew, would have found most of Paul's writings, and consequently today's Christianity, blasphemy (as did the disciples who actually knew him.)<br /><br />If this book causes even a few people to at least consider the idea that what we know as Christianity is a distortion and learn more it will serve a real purpose. Personally, I think the fastest path to atheism is actually reading the bible - but that's just me (there was a reason the early church didn't want common folk to read the good book.)<br /><br />One other thing. The end notes of the book are a great source for information on both sides of most of the positions in the book. I always appreciate when an author of controversial subject offers the opportunity to read contrary source material.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was halfway through this book and almost ready to give up when it finally got interesting, interesting enough for me to finish it. Only to be disappointed at the end with a cliff hanger. After all the twists and turns in the last half of the book, I was not happy to be left with an unfinished ending.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|A great classic on Blu-ray that was easy to shop for and had a trouble free trade.  Packaged well and played great with no complaints.  Recommended.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I had never heard of Lee Child before he was recommended to me. It reminded a bit of Matthew Reilly except the setting wasn't anywhere exotic. This is the first book I've read in a long time that kept me glued to the pages.<br /><br />I will now be going straight on to buy the second book in the series.
0143039881|5.0|because Arendt never ever used the term. Not even once.<br /><br />Her point is much more profound. It is not so much that Eichmann was a mere cog, a faceless bureaucrat, not too bright, who was simply following orders. That is NOT her argument. Her argument is that Eichmann wanted to belong, wanted to join something larger than himself, and once he had done so, gave his allegiance (and his conscience) over to a higher \\"power\\". This is what explains soldiers committing unspeakable crimes, or people aiming drones at innocent people. It is not that they are cogs, but rather that they embrace a higher allegiance (God or country or whatever) that absolves them (in their minds) of moral culpability. One could better call it \\"the enthusiasm of evil\\".<br /><br />This book is even better today than when it was written, and one of the most important books of its, or any, time.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Its so fun and addicting, i love it. You play against real people and your competitive side really comes out :) i would suggest this game to any uno lovers
0767919408|5.0|Bill Bryson is one of those guys that just can't write a bad book.  His books are insightful, hilarious, informative and inspiring. This one did not disappoint.  Who ever paid attention to 1927? it was not a year we remember in history but was pivotal in our development as a culture.  That year saw the changes in economics, sports (Babe Ruth!), Lindbergh flight, Al Capone and I never gave much thought to Coolidge before but now realize how important his presidency was to America.  It's lengthy, over 500 pages but impossible to put down!  Loved every word of it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read all of Vince's novels, unfortunately his passing leave a gap in my readings.  I'm waiting for his last to become available, I'm sure it will be as good as the others.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|It kept me awake and it had some good moments to it. I would recommend it to anyone. Good cast and worth the money.
1439153663|5.0|I'm not a very big reader and found this book one I had a hard time putting down. It was easy enough to read, and the story line kept me engaged.
B0044IABFS|4.0|Had to come to an end and this series did a good job with it. Stayed exciting although became somewhat predictable which may be a good thing, characters stayed true to their role throughout.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have been using them for more than 1 year now and I have to say, I love everything about these headphones. The quality of sound is fantastic and very true to the source, the bass is strong and clean, and the treble are just right. The cable is long enough to work and be flexible while the construction for he headphones is trudy as I have traveled with them many times while in my bag and they still look and feel brand new. Amazing headphones that I recommend for everyone in the marked for headphones to check out!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing.  Cass took me through a rollercoaster of emotions through your the entire book. It was a great second book and I can't wait for the third book to come out.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|I heard clips of this CD on my local radio station so I ordered it. I was not disappointed. Great music. Reminds me of 'OLD SCHOOL' music. I would recommend this CD. Great music that you can dance to.
B009NLC1D6|3.0|This is not, by any means, a new biographical film. The picture and sound quality are not so great. However, the acting is great compared to a lot of stuff around that time. Maybe not something I'd watch more than once, but I am still happy to have seen it the one time.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Excellent review of the historic Jesus.  Gives much insight in the man, the times, and the establishment of a religion.  A must read.
B000GCFY0I|3.0|This appeared to be a high school or middle school book, but its more of an elementary school book. Easy read, but easily written and no interesting vocabulary. Interesting idea, but poor writing. Went off on many random tangents, I easily got bored. But still good enough that I finished it. Not bad, not good.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|I didn't see GI Joe 1 and glad I didn't first.  GI Joe 2 was awesome.  I think if I had seen 1 first I wouldn't have watched the second.  The actors were great.  The action was thrilling and the fights were suspenful.  I loved it!  Wish it had made it to the IMAX.  I recommend everyone to see this movie.  I am buying it because its great for kids and adults.  It was an over the top action movie!
B009PAETCG|4.0|This app is very addicting. However, unless you want to spend $20, only go to normal mode. That is what prevented it from being rated a 5 star app.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Overall this is a good game. it seems to be hard to get friends and energy goes too fast. Gave it a good rating though.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I wanted to be able to get the weather reports in detail without the computer. The Kindle Fire makes that available. I don't have an Android phone - now I can use the Kindle Fire. When there is lightening in the area I unplug my computer as a precaution against a strike
0307352145|5.0|This is an amazing book. It changed my life. If you want a short highlight of the book, check out Susan Cain's TED talk.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Sights &amp;sounds are gratifying. Makes you think for yourself. This is for you if you truly love puzzles. More. More.
B004H83IM8|5.0|Austin Powers movies have their own special appeal, quirky and poking fun at the &#34;serious&#34; spy movies!  And having it as a collection leaves room for other movies on the shelf!
B004RFWZNY|5.0|Wow, what a show!  The Allman Brothers are the ultimate bands band.  What I mean by that is they are more in there element live than in the studio.  This is a phenomenal two hour live set of the band in 1991 right after the release of there Seven Turns album.  They do many cuts from that album and while they are absolutely spirited with there new material, its the classics that really get the crowd and viewer at home movin and shakin.  Greg seems to be almost totally coherent during this set, (I said almost).  His vocals are as strong and raspy and bluesy as ever.  Dicky is a beast on the guitar and can smoke just about anyone who has ever picked up the instrument.  Warren really mad my jaw drop a few times. One of the greatest slide guitarist of all time and a more than worthy replacement for the original master Duane.  As I mentioned previously this concert clocks in at a lengthy two hours.  Whipping post, Elizabeth Reed, Jessica, Ramblin Man and many more are given the full ABB treatment.  If I had one complaint it would be a minor one.  I wished the band would have unplugged for about fifteen minutes and done some acustic numbers like Melissa, Pony Boy, or even Martha.  Oh well.  This concert dvd was going for about four times as much as it is now just a few months ago.  If you have the chance to purchase this for under fifteen dollars you are getting a great deal.  As a huge fan of the band I Give this one an A+.
B00008G8M3|5.0|Will Smith was probably the best part of the cast for me.  The effects are great, except a few items that weren't right, and the idea that an alien craft would use the same kinds of digital processing to make it subject to a digital virus??  Well, that's Hollywood!!
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|I loved the puzzles and kept my attention. The only problem I have is that it has a cliff hanger ending. I will defiantly wait and look for a second part to this app. My girls loved it as well.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|Good in parts..but I didn't feel very attached to Harold, or his pilgrimage, there was something lacking in the story to make it either more credible or even more mythical.
B00AEBB89W|4.0|I would think that with all of the technology that is out there today, this &#34;true story&#34; could have been solved...
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I Love this man's books; he illustrates with tenderness and clarity the tragedy that is Afghanistan both past and present.
B004VS4KLW|4.0|I love movies with hilarious, insane and ridiculous car chases. If you watch De Niro doing the chasing, he looks scared to death while he is chasing the woman who is hardly rattled...
B003F3PMYI|4.0|This was a good read with applicable daily uses.  I've started using some of the techniques are they do work.  Happiness is not something you find it is something you choose.  I'm thankful this book was recommended to me by my sweet sister.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game, however when it updated it would not load for a couple of days, some how it work itself out.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Very easy game great way to pass the time.I am glad that I was able to finish it and watch the tree bloom!
1451626096|5.0|Gregory is one of my favorite authors. She brings an interesting twist to historical novels. This one just continued her great reads. I just wonder if she is right as to her speculations on the 2 princes.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I don't know why I never read this as a kid!  I thoroughly enjoyed this tale of high adventure. This would be a great read aloud with kids.
B003ELKNP4|5.0|As a Bon Jovi fan, this is one of my favorites!!  I listen to it when I am on the road or when like I need some<br />up lifting music.  I recommend this one!!
B00D6BQG1W|3.0|Movie is okay, pretty typical movie for the young set. I did find it entertaining and the kid does a real decent job of acting in it.
B002SQFZ68|5.0|I first saw this on TV, Palladia station, and decided I wanted to relive it over again...made me so happy!!!  I am<br />a big Bon Jovi fan and this was the icing on the cake!!  I recommend this in blu-ray and with a great sound<br />system to enjoy every part of this wonderful DVD.  You'll be singing the songs for days after!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this book. Very well written.I am recommending it for its sensitivity to the handicapped. Also,I think the title reveals a struggle we all have seeing another persons needs and when to put ourselves first.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Awesome!! You won't be able to put it down!! Don't let the chocolate get the best of you!! Good luck!!
B008N1LL42|5.0|Where to start? I don't want to spoil it by revealing too much. Special effects are off the charts! Story line? Loser punk kid becomes the hero, aided by a 21st century crew of young fighting sailors, a retired heroic (real life) Army colonel, a cadre of 20th century fighting &#34;old salts&#34; and the &#34;Mighty Mo&#34;... A precious heirloom of American greatness combine to win the day in the face of impossible odds. You will cheer at the cleverness that won the fight(s). You will form a bond with these characters. I have to abandon the critical thinking that one engages in during his 2nd, 3rd, 4th viewing in order to rate it for the first time viewer. If military action movies against aliens on the high seas are up your tree, you'll blow a gasket once the action starts. If not, you might just become an enthusiast for the military action movie on the high seas against aliens! The morphing process is painless!
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|This show touches many different values that kids aren't taught anymore.  They are plain and simple to see in this movie.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|A lot of fun. Cant wait to see the sequel. I hope they keep making mark millar pictures in the future.
B00AALX5SI|5.0|Katy Perry, unique, beautiful and talented!  This vid gives great insight into who she is, and her star power!  Loved it!
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|This was a good CD and I will definitely buy more music from him.  He has an awesome voice and I will listen to more and then buy another one.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Best show ever! Cheap price and easy to stream. I do not want this show to end. I love Jason Segel.
B0018QOIXU|1.0|I didn't like ANY of the songs on this CD, I will try to listen to all of the songs before I buy one of hers again.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|How neat. Fun...and friendly. Get this one! I know what time it is...but to see the temp displayed and more with it...that is very smooth.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|In a time that originality is difficult in the movie industry... this was a great movie that children (not to young) and adults can enjoy together.  The characters were fun.  A different kind of love story.
B0054S6N04|5.0|This is my favorite book by Linda Howard. Well crafted suspense,sensuality and some fun! On first read I didn't guess who dun it. Of course there's the trick, I have to reread every couple years. Thank you Linda!<br />BTW all this is a 2000 release.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Enjoyed this movie.  Started off really strong... got weak. The characters and story line were very similar to the original Clash of the Titans.  Overall enjoyed it.
B002QYSZBO|5.0|A dark and wonderfully inventive story line by action screenwriter Shane Black—also making his masterful directorial debut—and excellent performances from Robert Downey, Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan make Kiss Kiss Bang Bang a greatly entertaining ride.  There are so many things about this film that work on so many levels:  the strange amalgam of edgy intelligence and hopeless naïveté of Downey's petty thief, the sardonic wit and savoir-faire of Kilmer's gay shamus, the unhinged and deeply alluring quality of Monaghan's struggling actress, the crackling energy of the intricate screenplay, the grittiness and sheer brutality of the Los Angeles underworld.  All in all, a must-see.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|A bit too much gratuitous nudity<br />good acting by all<br />Half way through the season and can't wait to watch some more
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this book, it is fun to work through and I have had some success with the exercises. Illuminating.
140006922X|5.0|Several years ago, I tried to make my way through a very scholarly work titled: The Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide by Theissen and Merz.  It is a very complex textbook. (Think terms like \\"eschatological\\", \\"exegesis\\", \\"epimythion\\", etc.)  Zealot provides the same broad and meticulous historical research but puts it into easy to understand words with a clear writing style.  Zealot is not beholden to dogma or fantasy.  It simply provides a reliable guide into this most exciting field of Jesus research.
1608871827|5.0|I really like this book a lot. I like the layout and design of the book. The only disappointment was the lack of the finished renders for each of the Kaiju and Jaegers. I was hoping to see clear full body shots of each of the Kaiju. Still, this book is very cool.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love this game it plays great and looks great fun for all ages I just wish all of my friends played as well
0062200909|5.0|Great layout, concepts, art, and photography. I really love this volume! I've seen the second volume, but don't like it nearly as well as this first one. I love the way this first volume really focuses on the dwarves, and was hoping the second volume would focus on the Elves of Mirkwood, but it hardly touches on them. BUT, this volume is exceptional!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|It's Adele,what more can I say?Good sound,package intact,I play it while working around the house,my canary likes to sing along too.
0785153942|4.0|I enjoyed getting a look at the early years of the Kaiju attacks, and more back story to the characters from Pacific Rim. I would have liked better art in this book, and also would have preferred it as a TPB, but it was a fun addition to the story. Was a bit pricey too for the amount of content.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|A fine book. It makes one proud to be American and even more proud of the many fine young men who strive to become Navy Seals.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Pam explains why things work & don't work in this book & it comes complete with actual exercises. I love Pam's wit & how she explains how things actually manifest in our lives.
B009UMTMKS|5.0|I Loved this book a lot.<br />It will completely change your view on what is important in your business.<br />Get rid of the time wasting efforts and concentrate on what your customers want even if they don't know what that is yet.<br />If you have an idea and want to develop it into a product you can sell, then you need to read this book.
B002JXK5VU|3.0|It is okay, not the best I have seen but not the worse either?  It gets pretty farfetched sometimes, but I do like some of the actors.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|This is a wonderful, classic kid's adventure film where the kids save the day and the parents are nowhere to be seen. It's one of those quintessential childhood films that should be considered a 'must see'. This film does include some language profanity, but overall, it's a movie that is a thrilling, entertainer.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved it!  A very unique love story with a lot of twist along the way. It is very graphic but worth the read.
1781162646|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Such a great thriller and this book was perfect read for our book club.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Well written, thoughtful, insightful.  Author clearly has done large amounts of research and thought into the subject and it shows.  Although everyone may not agree with his take on the historical Jesus, it is nevertheless a fascinating and intriguing read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love the game. Fast pay outs and easy to get families. The kung fu scat game gives great prizes.<br />Can't stop playing ...it's addicting.
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|Ms Streisand's first opportunity to show off her tremendous talent. Her voice, movements, expressions and beauty are flawless. I could watch it over and over.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like t his app a lot. It gives a 3d image of horse care and I think it is brilliant, fun, and very addicting to play.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|freezes sometimes but I still play everyday. super fun game! you can sell your prides for more coins, so I never have to buy any.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because it keeps me entertained ,and Is a very fun game to play!!You should get this app if you love horses and don't have one at your home!!:)
B001O1O71C|5.0|Tweens/teens will enjoy story & unexpected ending...a great and different perspective...a must read for our youth...as an adult I read this story and really enjoyed it
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is my first &quot;escape&quot; game. It was very easy to get the hang of. It is challenging enough I suppose, but I think that I will get bored fast. Not something I will play again and again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|In a good way :)<br />This game really exercises your mind. Should give it a try, wish there were more levels....
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Truthfully, the movies should have been named. &#34;13th amendment&#34;.  Tommy Lee Jones had, in my opinion, a much more extensive part than Daniel Day-Lewis.  James Spader was good also.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app it's so feel. You can train,feed,groom,and much more with your horse. I recommend it to everyone who loves horses.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good intro to &#34;Red 2&#34;.  Having seen it once before it jogged my memory.<br />Recommended to anyone going to see &#34;Red 2&#34;.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is just amazing I play it all day long because it is just so addictive. Play this game now.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not as much action as I had hoped for.  Funny in spots yet typical Tom Cruise.  If you've nothing else to do, see it.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|this was as good as the first time I saw it loved the songs brought back many memories for me
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I love games like this. When I can play a game over and over again,  and not get bored you know its a well made game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We didn't watch this series until mid season or the 3rd year and then got hooked. Great characters and they come and go quickly.  We've been catching up from the beginning.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This book is surprisingly inspiring and thought provoking for anyone with children and/or a stake in our educational system. It gives a clear message to anxious parents for how they can help their children succeed, while also offering hope for the children who are currently being left behind. And it nicely confronts the blind spots of both conservatives and liberals.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Haven't had any issues with it. It does exactly as it should.If you complain about the price or having to carry it, then you shouldn't have spent more on the Retina MBP
B001POX73C|5.0|This novel by Georgette Heyer is one of my favorites. Her romances are always very witty and the characters fully developed. In this particular story she has chosen an unusual character 'type' to figure as the 'hero' of the tale, unexpectedly, and it was a real delight to read!  I have read and re-read all of her novels many times over and never tire of them. Now that they're available on my Kindle Fire I always have some of her books along with me, which is so handy!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|If your battery is getting low, and alarm let's you know you are going to need to recharge soon. Also lets you know how much time you have to do various tasks. Glad I have this one.
156898443X|5.0|Life can change in an instant - Danny Gregory shares the 'instant' change . . . fast and strong story - making the values of every day matters - matter
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Spectacular stories with believable characters and backgrounds and landscapes easily imagined due to the descriptive text. Similar to the tv show yet different. If you love the show, you'll probably love the books as well.<br /><br />If you haven't watched the show, anyone that enjoys good fantasy with knights, and royalty, and good and evil people will enjoy it. Written in modern language without the thees and thous we find in far too many stories of this nature.<br /><br />Many surprising, even shocking twists and turns.<br /><br />Love it.
B001I45UFC|5.0|great book! great for all ages.  Gives an amazing glimpse into God's love for us.  Beautiful story!  read all 7 books
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Brilliant all the way around. Don't miss this series. Maggie Smith is always brilliant and so happy she's still working.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I can't get the game to play on my kindle fire hd! It keeps crashing! Is anyone else having the same problem?
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Fantastic. I loved seeing how all these stories fit together to form a big picture and just seeing each individual story and struggle was amazing.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Short,sweet,to the point. Thank goodness. Helpful for validating that is occasionally needed by creative people. Presented in a humorous manner that is easy on the overloaded mind.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Daughter loved it.  She already read the 2nd book and went to the library for the third book.  Expect that book to be complete in no time as well
B00821PCJS|5.0|I like that this series is clean, interesting and with a good plot. A good flick to watch with the family and on the weekends if possible. Not big on watching much TV but good to go.
0385349947|5.0|I found this book to be full of practical advice, inspiring, and actionable. It's also an entertaining and fast read. I felt very comforted actually, to read about workplace dynamics I've experienced first hand and realize it wasn't just me. And that there are things I can do about it. This is the kind of thinking necessary if we want to stop pretending there is equality in this country and actually achieve it for the benefit of ourselves, children, husbands and corporations. Groundbreaking and yet full of relatively simple solutions. Not sure why it's been &#34;controversial&#34;. Yes, women already do and have done a lot. We may as well look at some new strategies. I got so much out of this book and am grateful it's out there. Making my husband read it.
B00942Y0TM|5.0|Maybe not one of the mainstream Disney flicks, but a favorite in our house.  Definitely re-watchable.  Check it out today!
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|Best album so far from them, just purchased the new one. Who knows which will be the best now? lol
B008JFUREC|3.0|Unlike the cartoon version, the films are strictly for kids and not much entertainment for adults. The second installment assumes you know the characters from the first feature. In this feature, Gargamel (Hank Azaria) manages to kidnap Smurfette (Katy Perry) to CG Paris. The Smurfs mount a rescue.<br /><br />The film is simple enough for a 5 year old. Older kids might have trouble sitting still through it. The movie makes light of peanut allergies, in spite of them being deadly. Many famous character voices: Jonathan Winters, Christina Ricci, Shaq, Jeff Foxworthy, Jimmy Kimmel, J.B. Smoove, and Peewee Herman.<br /><br />My suggestion is to make this one a rental unless you have money to burn.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love this game because it is so realistic. But I don't like that its so hard to get gems
B0090SI56Y|4.0|Perhaps \\"Wolverine 3\\" would be a better title considering all the times we have seen Jackman in this role. The film opens with a flashback dream within a flashback dream as Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) continues playing Jeremiah Johnson. He is persuaded to go to Japan by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) to pay his last respects. While in Japan, Wolverine encounters Viper woman (Svetlana Khodchenkova) his \\"Kryptonite,\\" and gets involved in a plot that gave me flashbacks to fine films like \\"Toxic Avenger II\\" and \\"Nazis at the Center of the Earth.\\"<br /><br />The plot had more complexity than what I expected or wanted to see. The action scenes were shot by shaking the camera at odd angles so we could feel the intensity. Instead I thought \\"Why the low budget effect?\\" The film started out with some comedy and dark comedy, but that aspect quickly died when they went to Japan.<br /><br />Considering the fine Avenger/Mutant films that have come out, this one was a let down. Film seems to have been designed to introduce Yukio.<br /><br />Worth a rental. Most likely I will buy it since I own all the other ones, but I will wait for the big price drop.<br /><br />Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb. Implied morning after sex. Jackman rear nudity.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This was my first Persona series experience, and I was amazed at how great it is. If you love a good story and want to take part in all that this RPG has to offer, you can easily put in well over 100 hours. Even after you finish this game, you will want to start over again.
B0090XO57C|5.0|i orderd this movie for my friend, she loves it, its great to watch<br />with kids, my kids really enjoy this and they learn.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Keeps me watching for next unknown think to happen and the next character that she may play -- does a great job playing each character
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is as far as I know Khaled Hosseini's third book and  not quite as good as the other two.  Quite heavy.  The writing is excellent and the story good.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I started this book last night and could not wait to get up this morning to finish it.  Its a fascinating account of three women in distress, whose lives intersect in unexpected ways.  Its also an excellent reflection on grief and the way it permeates and distorts your life.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great app. I love this app. Does everything it is suppose to do. I recommend this to everyone. Helps save your device from slowing down.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|it work on my HP NC768AA#ABA DESTOP COMPUTER<br />it nice and big heat sink fan. if your motherboard is a 3 pin you going have to get the another peace to connect<br />it the motherboard
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Great show very funny. had me laughing out loud. Makes you glad hour high school days are over wether you were a Geek, Freak, or Jock you will enjoy this one
072325804X|5.0|I love this book. It has all of Beatrix Potter's stories (at least, I think it's all of them), with the beautiful color pictures (and a few black and white sketches) that I grew up loving! The book is large enough, with large enough text, that you can read aloud while sitting with your child as they listen and look at the pictures.<br />I highly recommend Beatrix Potter, for the young and the old!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a funny, exciting, and touching movie.  My 3 1/2 year old grandson watches it over and over, laughing quite frequently.  Although the story line is pure fantasy, one can relate to the characters and situations easily.  Very cute and funny.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Once again Jeffrey Archer keeps the saga rolling along as in previous models, and once again ends on a cliffhanger that needs another volume.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|This movie is a good time.  So many great stars (Stockard Channing).  But John Travolta is great - the charisma and talent.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Good. UI isn't perfect. I miss a lot of moves cause of timer going too fast or not finding the right time to play a card or use an ability. I still have not successfully regenerated a creature.
B000MCIBB6|5.0|I listened to this as a kid when it first came out in the 1960s and now I love it even more.  Great.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A beautiful story. The bond between a dog and his master. The love of family. Triumph over tragedy. The story had it all. Just make sure you have tissues handy to dry your eyes.
B004LROMQG|5.0|I have been watching this series on Sci Fi and missed several episodes.  It is nice to be able to play catchup.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|The toy is rated for a 5 year old or older child ... I'd not give it to any child under 10 and then I'm not sure I'd give it as a gift at all. The cap on the switch will not stay in place. The pen end comes off if you bump it. It is poorly secured and just barely able to stay in place if you try to write with it. The sound effects are so faint that they are barely audible. As a display piece ... maybe but unfortunately it looks cheaper than the price would indicate. Overall I am very dissatisfied with the quality of this toy.<br /><br />Buyer beware.
B001LF347E|5.0|I have been watching this series on Sci Fi and missed several episodes.  It is nice to be able to play catchup.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|At first I wasn't going to read the book, the movie doesn't appeal to me that much. But I ended up reading and found it easy to read and enjoyable. I liked the idea of Shadowhunters, demon killers, and the a world within our own that not everyone could see. I have not started the 2nd book but will read it eventually because I'd like to see where this story takes Clarissa.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|A well written novel that finds strength in a well developed world with a protagonist you'll grow to love quickly. Look forward to future books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I may be late to reading this, but it was a great book! I read it very quickly because I hooked! The story had great twist and turns, both in the plot, and your connection to the characters. I found myself liking, hating, sympathizing, and cheering for each character at different times.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I was using Weather Channel ap until their recent update which made it less user friendly and more advertising.  Found this app to replace it and it works GREAT.
B001MSMULG|4.0|1st Daniel Silva book I've read & a very good one at that. Reading another in the Gabriel Allon series.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This game is just jerky and does not provide a great game experience. Plus the in game purchases are deceptively listed as 33% free to trick young kids into clicking on them. My five year old just saw free and almost purchased a power pack for $45! Thank God for parental controls! Not cool Gameloft. Delete!
B0026O475M|5.0|Watched this show with our kids. It was a great great movie about survival and determination.  I would highly recommend this
B000FC13Y0|5.0|This grown up fairy tale was a wonderful read. Vivid yet easy to digest and truly entertaining. Looking forward to reading more of Gaiman's work.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very nice game. Thank you.<br />I enjoyed playing this game while on an airplane. A great way to pass time.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Scrivener for all my writing needs and really never thought I needed Evernote. However having put it on both my Computer and Kindle Recently it made it possible for me to sync my writing between the two and it has been really a great experience. I would recommend this to anyone needing to keep writing between multiple devices.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is just like temple run but better I'm having a party of the minions go and get it its free
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator.  Nice big numbers, easy to use.  I use this a lot and like it as well as a full size desk calculator.  I was an accountant before retiring and used a lot of different calculators - this is one of my favorites.
B00BI745AA|5.0|I love everything about this movie. Even those who don't like musicals will love this one. I cried through the entire thing.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Just saw the blu ray...one word...wow. It's a must see for science fiction fans. The special effects, story and acting kept me interested for the whole movie. My wife said \\"meh too long!\\". Rolled eyes. Obviously I didn't agree. She didn't like the end of the film but it made sense to me. I'd definitely would be watching this again.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|lots of cheesey action not that great of a flick lots of top notch action stars. blah blah blah balh
B00005JNS0|5.0|We love this movie.  My 3 year-old and 5 year-old both enjoy watching it, and my husband and I laugh along as well.  I like that it is not scary, and is appropriate for the whole family.
B000CNESU8|5.0|great acting, love the movie.<br />you would not be disappointed if you buy this movie<br />i could not stop watching it until it was finnish
B00160FBWK|5.0|By far one of my favorite titles, really hate how the game was a pile of shit though. Hopefully one day in my future they will choose to make a badass remake of it :)
B00C061I3K|4.0|Technically good music.  Nice addition to my collection. A bit repetitive but overall a good listen.  I would recommend it.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|It's not bad in the beginning, but the ending was sloppy. The move was similar to  the 1991 film Sleeping With The Enemy. Julia Roberts as a woman who flees from her abusive husband.
1400069289|5.0|Interesting look into why we do what we do and how this knowledge can be applied personally and businesses alike.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the Downton Abby series, I look forward to season 4!  I enjoy alot of the English series. they are so enjoyable!
B008JFUO4U|1.0|It was long and not comprehensible. I never understood the purpose of the &#34;cloning&#34;. I would not recommend this movie.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is awesome.  Takes a bit to learn, but then it's something you can always keep playing and won't get bored of.  Only downfall is you can only play with 4 people - unless you buy the expansion pack.  Fun stuff though!  Long games allow for eating/drinking/conversation while you're playing.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Rental service worked pretty well with basic cable Internet service.  Movie was pretty good. What else is there to say about it?
B00DF2AF96|5.0|Love the amazing ability, especially for the technology and work at the time as compared to newer musicians have available.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Wonderful movie for kids...and adults! Good theme, good acting by the kids. Matuszak played the misshapen monster who was a kind soul inside.
B007Y36K46|5.0|This film is the complete sci-fi adventure of our time. If you like Star Wars or any adventure/sci fi/time travel story you must not miss this film. The amount of hard work, care and attention put into the making of it is extraordinary. You will want to watch this film again and again.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Daines has made several movies or TV shows in which she plays characters who have a series of challenges that are hard for persons without the disorder to mimic. I was incredibly impressed with her ability to mimic Grandin's mannerisms, as well as the obvious care she took to ensure that Grandin was a complex figure. It's easy for movies about people with these sorts of challenges to sink into sentimentality or be unbelievable. Daines was ultimately believable, sympathetic (and as someone with some of Grandin's problems) ultimately realistic.<br /><br />I have no particular problems to pick with the movie (other than the desire to see a little past the final talk that ostensibly launched Grandin's career as a speaker.)
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Its great to have and a great to way to keep in touch with other people, not sure what i'd do with out it!
B00CL68NOG|3.0|This was ok.  I expected more with Barbara Streisand.  I expected really funny and I got kinda of humorous.  It was just ok.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This has been a great addition!  I like being able to read the kindle books on my phone.  I also download books for my daughter and she can read them when we are waiting.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This book is a complicated page turner. I enjoyed the characters and their development. Sean and Michelle are a good compliment to each other. Way to go David Baldacci!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app provides an excellent and varied selection of background noise. Rain, wind chimes, ocean, and many more for relaxation or meditation.  It is a superior product compared with similar products on the market.<br />BCF7836
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I absolutely loved the book and would highly recommend it.  Its a very easy reading book but gives you so much to think about.  A very moving piece of writing that kept me &#34;hoping and praying&#34; until the end.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|Let my teenage daughter watch so she could see how things can get messed up.  She loved it too.  A must see for teenagers
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I Liked it, I loved book three. Book four and five were good reads. I can see where 4&5 should of been one book but it was too much info. Not sure where the rest of the story is going. Good that he left everything up in the air, I guess to make us crazy wondering what's next. All the books were good but Book 3, is my pick for best.<br /><br />Thanks, Diana
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It is a quick easy access to my ebay :) I recommend it if you like quick access to your ebay
B001NLL93W|5.0|ERMEHGERD!!!! i love this book soooooooooo MUCH!!! its my Favorite book & fandom EVAAAAA!!! i have read the hunger games and divergent and now the mortal instruments and TMI beats THG and Divergent by farrrrrrrrrrrrrr. i totally recommend this book!!! But you need to start from the beginning aka City of Bones!! READ ITTTTTTTT!!!!
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Nice story - nice as a flight book . it is readable and you wish to see how it is progressed.
B00633W614|4.0|The bad guys are definitely a stretch, but I have loved all three books and will look forward to # 4 coming out in 2014
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Ihave only used it a couple of times , but this is a tool that if you don't have it, you immediatly wished you did.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|One good thing about this book is that I got more questions answered from the previous books, like the lipstick question thats been slowly eating away at my soul.<br /><br />Entwined with You didnt stir up any emotion for me at all. Nothing really significant happened until about the last 25% of the book. Everything before that was a lot of the same with the only exception that Gideon and Eva really trusted each other this time around.<br /><br />However, the last 25% of the book was new territory and Im left with more 'new' questions. I also want to claw Elizabeth's (Gideon's mom) eyes out.  So, whats going on with Bret? What will Cary do about Tatiana (who is another person I dont like) and the Trey triangle? Where in the world did Megumi go? Im really worried about her. Will Elizabeth ever admit to anything? What is going on with Gideon's brother Chris? Whats going to happen to Corinne? Actually, I dont care what happens to her because big badass karma is knocking on her door right now. Who is connected with the Russian Mob? What is up Ann Lucas' revenge sleeve (Dr. Terrance Lucas wife)? And the million dollar question.... Will Gideon ever deal with his demons? Because that is still a very much untouched subject.<br /><br />Over all it was ok. The sex was super hot as usual, but seemed to overshadow the entire story. There is only one sex scene on the plane that I absolutely loved. The story is still intriguing and I will continue to read the rest of the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. Especially the Beijing game. Everyone try this game my baby niece knows how to play and she is really good.
0385523912|5.0|Nothing to Envy:  Ordinary Lives in North Korea is a fascinating book.  It is a look inside North Korea as told by several individuals who managed to get out.<br /><br />I listened to the audio book, so I can't go back and look up the specific names of the individuals.  But the stories they tell are amazing and shocking.  The way they are so totally brainwashed, how common niceties are withheld (even food is withheld), how little they know about the rest of the world.<br /><br />I found story after story so interesting.  How the people kept working long after they stopped receiving any kind of paycheck.  Kindergarten teachers, watching their students die slowly right in front of them from starvation.  Doctors having to go off into the woods to look for herbs to use for medicine.<br /><br />One story that stuck with me was from a woman who had really believed in everything that she was taught.  She believed in everything that North Korea stood for.  Even as her husband and son died from complications of being malnourished.  When she does cross over to China, one of the first things she encounters in a residential yard is a bowl of rice and meat out in the yard.  She slowly realizes that this food is for the dog.  It's been months and months since she had any rice and she couldn't even remember when she last had meat.  With a shock, she realizes that dogs in China eat better than people in North Korea.<br /><br />A completely fascinating book.  A look at a country that we know so little about.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|A great product to enable one to see at a glance how much charge left or how the charging is progressing.
B005I3PAUO|5.0|what's not to like about any David Baldacci book - this one introduces a new character, so now I'm off to read the second &#34;Puller&#34;
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP ITS STRATEGY AND I LIVE STRATEGY<br />IT'S FUN WHEN YOUR TRAVELING I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS APP TO EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BF11STU|5.0|I would not want Jessica Chastain chasing me.  Wait.  Yes, I would.  The cast is excellent.  Hard to see what is happening in the compound.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|A wonderful account of learning to fly helicopters and then flying unarmed insertion and retrieval missions in Vietnam.  The author always had a sense of humor in describing the sometimes deadly missions that they flew.  Combat required flying the Hueys on the extreme edge of their flight capabilities.  He describes maneuvers in very restricted spaces even using the rotor blades to prune vegetation as they descended into an opening in the jungle no bigger than the rotor blades themselves.  Mason is also very honest about his difficulties in life after leaving the army in the prologue to the book.  This is a great read and if you fly as a pilot or just love aviation it should be on your list of required reading.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This is a good game, it's fun and entertaining. It gets your brain working. Only downside you is that you can't skip the ones you don't know.
006224454X|2.0|I don't get it. IMHO, the book was repetitive, predictable, cliched, and written with zero flair.  There's not one turn of phrase, not one description that made me admire the writing. It was all plot, and a twist/reveal that was soo obvious that when I guessed it 1/3 of the way through the book, I figured it can't be that cuz well, its too obvious. But that was it...  All of the plot/character points are created to maintain the ruse. It's a house of cards. And a flimsy one at that....
B0072NWJRK|4.0|Based on a true story - I like how he wove in mostly fact with fiction. A great way to learn the history of that time
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Having a son who is a quadriplegic, I wasn't sure that I could get through this book.  I was warned ahead of time.  The author was &#34;spot on&#34; in her descriptions of situations and complications from the injury. Well researched. There is a lot to ponder in this book.  I rarely had a dry eye.  Character development was very good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|my husband and I really enjoyed this game. we even got stumped a couple of times. the big kids liked it too.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|I love this paper and read it several times a day.  MailOnline has the news so fast that the TV stations get around to mentioning two days later.  It is a must in my life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|simple fun. love it! easy to use. I like that I can pick it up and put it down quickly. not too involved and very entertaining!
1608871827|5.0|I have several &#34;art of...&#34; movie books, and this is the best so far.<br /><br />It is a remarkably comprehensive study of all the aspects of the movie, going from concept to final design of the robots, monsters, main characters and principal settings. Dense with illustration and information, it even includes a lot of removable inserts: blueprints of the robots, ID passes for the characters, field sketches of the monsters. There is a pocket inside the back cover that includes two anti-kaiju propaganda posters for the movie (one in Russian!).<br /><br />If you are even slightly a fan of the movie, or interested in this kind of thing, this is one of the best offerings of its kind.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Absolute perfection. This is probably this best book I have read in my entire career as a journalist. It is absolutely amazing. Bravo.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|It's a &#34;rent&#34; movie with many of the UK's best actors. It's predictable, but a lot of fun. I watch it several times a year for a pick-me-up. There's tension, hope, and some reality.
B00D6SBOWG|3.0|I loved playing it while it lasted but very quickly I was finished with the free version games and the rest are locked until you buy the advanced version.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't think I ever put this book down until I do finished it! Would definitely recommend. Suzanne Collins is the best author ever in my opinion.
B001F4UHFI|4.0|An exciting, twisting look at the underground arms industry.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Cage does a wonderful job playing the nonplussed &#34;Lord of War.&#34; He is restrained and doesn't fall into the &#34;goofy cage&#34; category of some of his recent films<br />-Niccol's script is not overly political, but still touches on the situations and motivations that drive arms dealing<br />-gorgeous cinematography, with a standout sequence through a drug tinged city at night<br /><br />Cons<br />-Cage at times seems too calm with his narration delivery
B0050VA428|4.0|I was tempted to give it five stars because I am such a big fan but decided to go for four as the tale occasionally drags a little in between some really fun plot twists and surprises.If you like mystery novels this book is an absolute &#34;must read&#34;.
B00847KFDS|4.0|One of the many great song writers of the era,<br />I would recommend this album to anyone, especially to any Fogerty fans
B00005JKZV|4.0|The second part of this trilogy is full of battle.  Although impressive, it is not as satisfying to me as part one.  The fellowship of the rings is scattered and the story jumps back and forth between the three groups as each faces its particular challenges.  Most interesting to me was the character of Gollum/Smeagol, who externalizes the internal voices most of us hear in some form.  Frodo and Sam's relationship to Gollum is indicative of the problem we all face with one another.  Frodo calls him Smeagol, encouraging the best in him.  Sam never trusts him, realizing his potential to betray at the slightest upset.  Another strong aspect of the film is the inspiring words of Gandalf and Aragorn spoken to their companions  when they  are tempted to despair.
0061906220|5.0|I love this whole book:  the pictures, the rhyme, the cadence.  Books are my favorite baby shower gifts, and Pete the Cat is always at the top of the list.  Kids LOVE Pete!
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence refers to a fence built across Australia by settlers as protection from the rabbits they had introduced to the land.  The movie is based on the true story of the 1200-mile trek of three young Aborigine girls in 1931. They skillfully and bravely made their way home following the fence after escaping the re-culturalization settlement to which they were taken after being stolen from their Aborigine mothers.  Their fathers were white (the men who built the fence).  The removal of the girls from their homes was part of a governmental program to deal with the \\"half-caste problem\\" by training them as domestic workers.  This program went on until 1970, but its consequences are still suffered by many.  This is a remarkable account of a dark episode in Australian history.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Great little physics game, very addictive, cute graphics and sound.  Extremely well made, easy to play... tough to master.  A load of fun.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|One of the better free jewel games available for kindle that I have tried.  I do NOT like how it held my game hostage until I wrote this review.
B00C04H2VO|5.0|I purchased these for my 2 year old granddaughter because she LOVES the movie so much . I read the reviews and some people thought they were a little small , which of course is a concern when children put everything in their mouths .  She and her parents love them and other than Gru's nose being bitten off.....they are a huge hit ! That is the only time she put them in her mouth !
B007IXWKUK|5.0|An upsetting story about a weird business man persouing his own own fantasy's with multiple women with vague and weird demands. Hard to believe or put down
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|spending way too much time with bananas and minions. the app is great. a lot of fun and has interest built up thrum a variety of challenges.
B003E6LC6I|4.0|That keep u watching episode after episode - great writers and interesting actors to play the roles of characters whose lives so often parallel one another in ironic ways
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|When I started reading I thought it was gonna stink but I loved it<br />I laughed and laughed at this
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|With google you can search for everything you need! I like the google maps the most. Need to log in on google. You won't be disappointed .
B008JFUPFI|5.0|This isn't your dad's Super Man. He's much more grounded and the writers made a valiant attempt to explain his abilities with science. The plot of Man of Steel appears to have gone way over peoples heads with it's complexity. Of all the people I've spoken with about the movie very few had any clue about what was really going on. I loved it of course. Fortunately the action and quality provide something for everybody. This is the Batman Begins of the Superman story and I highly recommend it.
B007KDFWRG|3.0|Some great tracks like &#34;Everybody's Talkin'&#34; and &#34;Bound for Glory&#34;, however in between there are few primarily instrumental tracks that had me cringing.  I rarely will skip over tracks on an album and give them their do.  I have found some great music by giving songs a second chance....unfortunately not here.  Obviously  they are all very talented musicians and Susan has a fabulous voice.  Maybe it is to bluesy for my taste?  This is one of the very few CD's that I own that I will only transfer certain tracks to my iPod instead of the whole album.<br /><br />They were performing not to far from me recently and I found out too late to get tickets and was bummed.  Maybe they are more of a band that you need to see live as from what I heard the overall take on the performance was that it was great.  Oh well, can't win them all!
B00846REIS|5.0|The book was so good it makes you buy the next book.  I have read all 3 and can't wait for the fourth book to come out.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I lime this app and so do my friends<br />They like it because it is easy fun and some times complicated it freezes regularly but I still like it
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love playing UNO, now it's even more fun than ever because you get to play with complete strangers, and over time those strangers may become your friends. No doubt it's a need for any UNO lover to download this game and have a blast!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It is a constant documentary of what happened  in several different countries and by many types of people from poor to professional. Not what I expected, I am not turning the pages to see what happens cause I already know. Wanted to read about the character Brad Pitt plays and his family and more about the virus and how is got out.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Excellent game. There's no limit on shuffles and the game automatically &quot;graduates&quot; you to the next level. Definitely recommend downloading.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Downton Abbey is a splendid production with amazing characters.  I had no problem with the download.  The quality was good
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Well if you are you will be unhappy with some of the liberties Hollywood has taken with the Tudors.  Saying that, if you would like to imagine you are in the world for a brief period of time, you will love it.  The costumes alone are worth watching.  The scenery is splendid.  I have not researched where it was filmed, but would like to believe in England.  Love all the seasons, but my favorites are all the ones up to sixth wife Katherine Howard.  I found it more sexual for my taste at this point, and I personal did not care for her has an actress. Watch them all.  You will be most entertained, especially if you enjoy English history, and if you do not this may send you on to study more.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Gives a good picture about the NYC office and legal scene. Things are beginning to get a bit redundant though I would still watch it.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I have all of his albums... will have seen him in person by the end of September ( 2 shows).  I love the way he sings.
B0061S0A64|2.0|music with motion, if you like tech you may have an interest in it.  As a traditionalist it didn't do much for me
B0028T6XXY|5.0|I of course like all his music...I think the DVD was great also.  I will probably purchase whatever he puts out.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Another good die hard movie Bruce Willis dose good job as McClain like the story line and where they go
B004HWYTP4|4.0|After I saw this film, I immediately the next day in fact, went to See Red 2.  Both films were very entertaining.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good movie a little hard to follow but all together not bad movie thought the scenery of was well done
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Fantastic book! Vivid writing style and I love the different chapters from different characters' points of view. Highly recommend- so mucho for detail than the HBO shows.
B00DBSZ6ZC|5.0|Good movie tho not to thrilled with the way the subject maker was treated if this was done about main stream religions there would be sever out cries
B0089LOG02|5.0|Once I started this book I didn't want to stop. Stayed up until I finished the entire book. A must read for sure.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Thought it was very well done never read book but thought the movie was very well done think it would be worth reading the book
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|it's cute and funny, par for a kids movie but also engaging enough and with a few joke that adults will appreciate.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|For and reselling of the jack an the bean stalk fable this was very well done thought it was very exciting action movie
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This isn't very helpful without the real game. Why would you put this app up before the real game is in the app store? So could you please add the real game in the app store soon.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Like the movie but not as much as I like the first one don't like that they killed off actor from last movie and replaced him with the Rock
B0060QM09M|5.0|A delightful read and insight in a bygone and colorful world.<br />The author is one in a million - a very talented writer with a wonderful sense of humor and an extraordinary sensibility to all that surrounds him.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|loved this movie, wish I had seen it at the theather.. was good and entertaining for kids as well. Loved it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really enjoyed the game. It was hard enough to be challenging but not too hard to lose all fun!<br /> Can not wait for next game!
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I love this series. I started watching season one and could no stop. I went right away to season two and then 3 and ended being able to watch on Sunday nights. I hope they keep this series going. It is every entertaining. I love it
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I have enjoyed watching this series though I didn't care for the ending in Season 3l  I joined Amazon prime specifically to see episodes 2 and 3 as Netflex didn't have access.  I am looking forwardi to Season 4.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Do not update this game there is lava and water so do not update this game and ad pokeymon bye
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Charactersi enjoyed the characters and their complexity. I wish I knew what happened to all the characters but that must wait for another book
B000301YY8|5.0|I heard this album at a party, and fell in love with his voice, and his lyrics. I went home and ordered it.The well known &#34;Beautiful&#34; is a wonderful, joyous song, and anyone who has lived, loved and lost that love, will be moved to tears listening to &#34;Goodbye My Lover&#34;. I went thru a divorce 4 years ago, and I credit that song with helping me to bring out those buried feelings of loss, and deal with them. It is amazing what healing comes out of music. I was a child of the 60's and 70's, so my taste in music is everything from Motown to Queen, the Beatles, Janis Joplin, but the music that I &#34;felt&#34; the most was Bob Dylan. This album, and the music of Damien Rice bring me back to those days.
B003WG3222|5.0|Amazing record. I downloaded Thin Lizzy's stuff via torrent years ago to get see if I'd like them and I've wound up buying just about all their records because they're so wonderful.
B000YGP6YU|5.0|I only discovered Damien Rice when I heard a contestant on American Idol sing &#34;Volcano&#34;.  I loved it, but then promptly forgot about it. Now, a couple of years later I heard it again and went and bought the original version with this album. I fell in love with Damien Rice, and often keep this record playing in the background. very soothing, at the same time as it is haunting.
B0091REZMW|4.0|You need to wait. I refused to spend money. Fun game it has great graphics and is challenging. Well worth the effort.
B00932DCS8|5.0|a totally unexpected brilliant thriller. Best movie I've seen for years; can thoroughly recommend even if you're not a fan of watching movies with sub tittles.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|As in all Reacher novels,one just can't put it down until, bleary eyed, it is finished. Another in a string of great reading by a very talented author. I think I have read all the Reacher books at least twice and can't wait for the next round.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|This is a great update of a Movie Classic using all of today's technology to make an exciting  period piece.  The recreation of early thirties New York is spectacular.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Great cast, can't wait for the third.  Especially since they have Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson.  Just loved it all
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  A suspenseful page turner....  The story is told alternating between present day and a time leading up to a trauma that happened a few years ago. I liked this back and forth formula.  Really loved this book....  Highly recommend.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Entertaining,funny,human and real.really gives an idea of what it must be like to be trapped inside your body and the impact it has on all around you.
B00DNLXDUW|3.0|It is ok. I think people will use it eventually. It is a good app. I will use it a little.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|From calculating payroll to adding up my groceries walking through the store. Great app!  Thank you for this trustworthy app.
B007WPM4P0|4.0|Good acting. Ending was sappy but appropriately good.  Enough drama and war that my husband could watch it as well.
0684857219|5.0|ARNOLD!! is the best in the world! 7 time mr olypia! The autrian superman! yea baby yea! Get this book!
B00005N6KG|4.0|These are my favorite headphones. Plastic ear buds are too big for my ears. I don't like the rubber, chageable ear buds. These are great for smaller ears and after exercising can easily be wiped off.  Sound quality is good. I have had several pairs of these headphones and they are not that durable, but there is nothing else in this configuration and these are not available in stores anymore. I bought 5 pairs so I'm set for a while.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|you could dj with it like a real dj great affect cool features but you pay a lot but you get what you pay for
8866135763|5.0|I have an iPhone and use the calendar on it but I still like to back up my work schedule and appointments on paper. This does the trick. I have the 2013 and now the 2014. Great product.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Same as playing with the cards. Need a way to earn more coins to be able to play more often. I'm not willing to spend $ to play. But over all, I like it.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I think there should be more books. There is too little. I am sad. Please make more. That is my review on the hunger games
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was hesitant to read this thinking it may not be any different from previous books by K. Hossenini - but it was and I was hooked from the beginning.  My only somewhat negative comment is that, at times, it was a little challenging to remember/follow all the various characters, but in the end this only enhanced the story line.
B001H9JBW6|5.0|Is the government watching every move you make?  YES!!!<br />Great mini-series with many twists and turns.<br />Great acting - especially by the two leads.<br />Only issues - mumbling by the cast is difficult to discern (try watching with closed captions).
B00E1LT41K|4.0|there is a way to watch bbc as it plays in England, and so i have seen parts 1-8.  two more to go.  i have not been this pleased by a docu drama in a long time, and this one is right up there with the tudors.  the writer is a history teacher at one of the prestigious colleges in uk, and she writes with passion and accuracy.  its about the cousins war, or war of the roses.  The writer concentrates not on the men involved but the 3 women behind the scene.  The costumes are documented, and the buildings are historical.  the women are powerful, clever, driven, and with elizabeth, in love. its about protecting their right to the throne, and they do it vengeance and devotion to their cause and families.  it is rich in colour, and i was wishing there was 15 parts, not 10!  if you liked the tudors, you will love this, minus some of the fun but sometimes brutal sex scenes. there were a couple but tastefully done, the concentration being on family pride.<br />enjoy!
B000W796OM|3.0|I only recently started reading and watching everything in the franchise that I could get my hands on. \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is my favourite book in the series, mainly because it heavily features many characters I like, and the explanation in the Shrieking Shack is my favourite scene out of all seven books (the Department of Mysteries in \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" and the Resurrection Stone scene in \\"Deathly Hallows\\" being runner-ups). However, I have to admit that the movie is not an improvement.<br />I don't think this is a bad movie, by any means. I do enjoy it, and there are some good things, such as the clues to Ron and Hermione possibly ending up together, and the wonderful performances by several new cast members, as well as the returning cast. Emma Watson's performance as Hermione is especially good here. However, there are still problems.<br />There will be spoilers from here on in:<br />The biggest problem is the lack of explanations. There is a complicated explanation in the book, about how Harry's parents were betrayed and how everyone had the wrong person. Also, there is a lot of background provided to explain the amazing \\"Marauder's Map\\" as to who the Marauders were. In the movie, we only get the barest amount of background, and NO explanation of the Marauders.<br />Overall, this movie isn't bad, but you'd be better off reading the book for this one. The movie may be good, but the book is phenomenal.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game. I wish it were possible to have more than one game running with a friend, like word games allow.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|I got this for my son and he loves batman and legos and he has the game so I got it for his birthday
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Enjoying the show! Good acting and plot twists. Sci-fi but not a tired story line and manages to avoid sounding preachy.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|I am 3/4 of the way through this book and decided to download the movie.  I have to say it truly lives up to the book, did not want to even pause it.  Quite disturbing but so well done-  Tilda Swinton was fantastic, as was Ezra Miller as Kevin.
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|This band never ceases to amaze. After all these years they still give a high octane ROCK N ROLL performance. The music we all know, no need to comment on that. The opener \\"Draw The Line\\" is a great choice. Steven Tyler's entrance on the stage leaves no doubt that he is the alpha male in this band looking every bit the part of rock star. Perry as usual makes it look so easy. The rhythm section is as tight as Joey Kramer's snare. The interviews in between the songs and documentary of their visit I think is interesting and lets you in on what they experienced. I was especially moved when Tyler THANKED the two servicemen for keeping our country safe. If some people want to whine like a bunch of (fill in the blank) about the interviews and commentary in between songs, go ahead on. Man up dog.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|This game is not very enjoyable because I would be playing for a little bit but then it says game server not accessible this happens for at least 5 or 6times in a row before the game comes on and you can play it. This game is frustrating to me. I would not recommend to anybody with little kids.
B000FQIRXQ|5.0|I'm generally not a huge fan of BBC/Masterpiece Theatre productions, just because I have a hard time getting involved with the characters. David Copperfield is one that I love to watch every 3-6 months. Every one of the characters is awesome, but I especially love Maggie Smith's portrayal of Betsey Trotwood. I laugh out loud every time she shows up for the birth of her \\"goddaughter\\", and I cry every time David walks across her green to meet her for the first time.<br /><br />The other production I watch over and over is the 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice. It's a total \\"chick flick\\", but it's so masterfully made, and the characters are so well cast (especially Mr. and Mrs. Bennett), I can't pull myself away from it.
B0000714BP|5.0|I had heard of this video long ago and decided I wanted it for my collection.  Imagine Patrick Swayze playing a drag queen.. yeah, that weird and funny.  Nice, feel good story.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Into the dead is the perfect game for zombie lovers. It is challenging and exciting, it offers chances to skip achievements through payments of earned coins, yet I choose not to skip anything because I don't want to miss a moment of playtime. It's so addictive that after playing before bed the first thing I see when I close my eyes is myself dodging through hordes of zombies. Simply amazing! and the fact that its free makes it unbelievable
B00E193TM2|5.0|Stellar album form these guys and with the addition of the almighty Mr. Halford on their lead song, the album is nothing short of awesome!
B00BB8OHMW|4.0|I enjoyed the comedy in this movie. It was funny how a lady wanted so much to act but it was for men only no women allowed on the stage. The differences in the classes of people is very evident with the romance of Shakespeare; which adds to the humor of some of the situations.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You never stop learning this app rules pleas get it this is my bros favourite app oh man get it get it
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Drama with a crazy twist.  It started off a bit slow but then became interestingly intriguing. Better than I expected.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I initially bought this because John Green said on twitter it was a fantastic read. But I gotta confess to you the first quarter of the book was very slow, and I left it unread for a couple of months. Then last month I told myself I would read some more and it immediately picked up the pace and started to become very interesting.<br /><br />The character arcs are very nicely done and it feels very real. There's nothing in this book that was far fetched or away from the reality that has struck teenagers since the beginning of bullying and abuse in general.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />For me, the ending was kind of a disappointment because I wanted to see more conflict between the families and it feels very weird that suddenly a year has passed and no one knows what has happened to the rest of Eleanor's family. You only get a clue that they have left Richie but it's not very clear. And it seemed very weird for me that Eleanor hadn't wanted to read Park's letters after everything he had done for her.
0812550706|5.0|I seldom read fiction. If I do, I rarely finish it. I could not put down Ender's Game. It was so good I'm afraid to read other Ender books lest they tarnish the story that is Ender's Game.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This game is worth the coins. I wish there were more like it in other genres not just tower defense.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I found this to be a book that is hard to put down.  It is difficult with my schedule to make time to read for enjoyment.  This book is the exception.  Wow!  I am very happy this was suggested by a friend.  The biography is truly unique with many revealing stories about Steve Jobs.  This is an EXCELLENT book.
1442359315|4.0|I have read several books that talk about spending time in heaven after death and returning to a skeptical world but this one is more convincing since it comes from a member of the medical field who himself was a skeptic. I love how scientists and doctors are always trying to disprove everything that alludes to the Divine. Religion and the Bible are a joke to most of them because they cannot explain it away. I think it scares them so they want to get rid of it. I am very pleased to see a member of their little club coming to the realization that there is something greater in this universe than pure science. On the down side I found the audio tape to be a little hard to hear at times and it made me realize that when I read a book instead of listening I see the words and understand what the author is trying to convey.
B001676320|5.0|These are two bands comprised of amazing musicians.  The concert is incredible.  I have seen both bands live and still found this DVD a thrill to watch.  I am very happy that I made this purchase.
B002ZG974M|5.0|A wonderful, gentle look at babies around the globe!  How similar they explore their worlds!  No language skills are required!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is by FAAAAAR the best game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fun, uses your brain, it's very fun! ^_^ I recommend it, for everyone! It's cute, u can start from a the small reef shark, to the huge megalodon. Have fun with all your new friends on this game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very in depth game once you start you can't stop till you match the color or find the code it's very entertaining!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game, just enough brain stimulation to be worth playing but easy enough to play while relaxing. I like this game.
1476734941|5.0|very practical and hassle free meals recommende for those who are undergoing  medical treatment for heart attacks,strokes and severe diabetes
193700788X|1.0|One of the problems with long series books, is authors tend to get sloppy if they stretch out a series for far too long.  CH is completely entitled to write the way she pleases, but there ARE consequences for lazy writing and disintegrating beloved characters (eh-hmm, Eric).  Namely, I would never recommend this series to anyone because I know they would more than likely be disappointed with the end (as many reviewers are) and I don't like to disappoint (unlike Ms. Harris).  These one star reviews are spot on.  CH could write a book entitled, \\"How to P*ss Off Your Fan Base - A Series Writer's Tale.\\"  DEA is a sad, pathetic, feeble tie up that is so far removed from the beginning of the series.  Don't waste your time.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|The game is a bit laggy but very rare but it can crash. That's about it for bad.. I love this app and it is a very good time killer just very unpredictable :) I would say get it!
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|If you like the Lord of the Rings, this is a nice continuation. I enjoyed it.  Rest of the family had enough of hobbits prior to this.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I enjoyed this book, although I had to read it in small doses, as the details and circumstances were quite disturbing.  So glad she was found and is now dedicating her life to helping others!
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I read on average one novel a month - about 350 pages - for a book club, and sometimes do not get through that.  I have been unable to put down the entire Mistborn trilogy - will finish all three books in under 3 weeks!  The characters are so vivid - and the twists and turns in the plot amazing - the complexity and consistency of the fantasy allomancers and their powers is amazing!
B0052FG750|5.0|Being a Doors fan from the 60s I had some of this music on 8 tracks, album and cassette. Now with CDs I have come full circle with some now in MP3s form. I have told my age.
B00821PCJS|5.0|like this show. glad there will be a season 4. I'm half way thru season 2 and I am hooked.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the only trilogy I have read twice and I would read it again. I love this book .
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Loved this film. Well written and strong acting. I am not a huge McConnaughey fan but he was great in this film
B00E8B1358|1.0|No story at all in this movie. Should have kept original cast. Taking out Channing Tatum was dumb. Terrible script.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Helps me look up the weather quickly and accurately. Very useful an  easy to use. Five stars for sure. Go ahead and get the app if you are looking for a simple weather app.
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|Yes, there is an 11 year old girl who uses foul language.  Yes, she flat out murders multiple bad guys.  Yes, there is ton of violence.  And, yes, this movie kicks ass.  It is a comic book.  It is not meant to be high art or deep.  Oh, it's a dude movie also.  Check out Nicholas Cage channeling Adam West.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|The game is good but the car can flip a little too easy. But it is easy to play and can be good for the kids if you have some.
B0097C8XL0|1.0|this is a game for young people.  I don't even klnow why I got it in the first place.  only recommend it for kids!
0061673730|2.0|How do you know if you have press-in slow jets or the screw in type? Do you need to remove all of the rubber parts and soak the carb body carb cleaner, or is it enough to soak the jets, float bowl, etc., in the carb cleaner and simply wipe down the carb body? Admittedly this book was written in '74, but we could all use some guidance on whether the float bowl gaskets should be re-used or replaced. Also, don't be surprised if you can't find anything helping you tune the valve timing on your DOHC. Honda didn't introduce those until '79, if memory serves.<br /><br />All you need to know is that this book takes you no further than your Clymer manual. Not really worth the money.
B009O2XY12|5.0|very good for mind and reflexes .  this is an enjoyable game of all ages!  my friends and the grandkids love it
B004E547D8|5.0|not to mention John Malcovich too.  This is a spectacular adventure suspense thriller that is both funny and entertaining<br />A honestly great movie I recommend that doesn't have to have swearing to make it good.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I discovered Bruno Mars long after everyone else, but I'm glad I did. I love this album. It makes me happy when I hear it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this trilogy. I have already read it twice and I am not one to normally read a book twice.
B00BXLU1EU|2.0|If you are into impressing or tricking your friends, this app will help with the deception.  It is fully functional and works perfectly however, unless your name is NSA, CIA, FBI or US Government, you cannot legally crack passwords on WiFi or the internet.  Great fun but I deleted it after using it one time on my Grandson because any non productive app takes up space.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was told very strange story which is true, but certainly  kept your interest.  Never sure who to believe in the beginning.  Would recommend
B000002NAK|3.0|it  is not the high quality recording, it can be better, I am afraid this copy after copy, I wonder who pirate this?
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Hilariously told in Drew's ( male lead) POV. A man who doesn't need to want anything because everything comes easy... until Kate...This is a must read for men and women alike. Miss Chase you are one funny lady and Im loving it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, NEVER A DULL MOMENT ON EACH PAGE!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Thought provoking would we all turn out like this? At what is our breaking point that survival is beyond all?
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|Really loved all the songs on this latest release from Selena Gomez. If you're looking for pop music to get your feet tapping then this is a great one for you.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Americanah gives details of the lives of modern day young Africans, both abroad and within the African continent. The characters are alive and the writing is so vivid that one can imagine being in the plot as the story unfolds. I wish I was this talented! Thank you Chimamanda for giving us young Africans the literature that we crave. Thank you for telling our stories.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|I love the cast in this movie.  Not a blockbuster, but it was still entertaining and &#34;all's well that ends well&#34; type movie.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|This is the ONLY TV show that I have ever watched every single episode and bought.  This show gets better every year and I could watch J2 for hours on end (actually some days I do!).  The chemistry they have as brothers is wonderful.  They act very much like my two sons only more funny.  I would give this show 10 stars if I could!!  Can't wait for the new season to start.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love the game way interactive then the old SIM city games. The game should tell u the fastest way to progress is by following the goals top to bottom
B00CS0XOQW|1.0|A poor release from the Cafe Del Mar stable. Gone are the albums of old featuring stand-out tracks amidst a collection of likeable Balearic beats.<br />Instead we get track after track of humdrum chillout fodder that is found on so many competing albums. There's nothing memorable here.<br />The best offerings on Cafe 19 wouldn't have made it onto the first five or six Cafe Del Mar compilations full stop.<br />Listening through, it was screaming out for a Talvin Singh's Traveller or D*Note's Devotion, something to gladen the heart, lift spirits and ultimately give the listenere some 'wow' factor.<br />I own every Cafe release and it's had its peaks and troughs - but this is so lacking it could be the worst compilation yet.<br />A rethink is needed or the series will die very soon. And that's something none of us fans want to see.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is one of the &#34;very best&#34; programs that I have ever seen.  It is very &#34;adult&#34; oriented, and slanted towards people who like complex interactions going on in the background while the foreground is extreme.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really love this show, good content, good quality played off of Amazon. Well done, you guys, well done everyone.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Well done, liked the character and would like to see a sequel. Hope they don't miss the mark by watering down the next issue !
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love it my kids love it<br />they are funny<br />game is sweet<br />just too many app purchases<br />need to check if my kids made purchases daily
B00BVYNM4K|5.0|Never grows old ! Brilliant acting, well written ! Love the ability to go back and look at episodes that I didn't get to see on TV.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|Very bad movie; acting and plot. This is a senior citizen heros special. It took a lot of Botox and steroids to make these guys look kinda of tough.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was in my opinion even better than the first and I can't wait to see how it is finished in the third book
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|This is a MUST for every Beatles Fan. Great video and even better audio. Really does justice to the great music.
B008TRH5N6|5.0|IF you want to change your life for the Positive...This book is for you, There is a lot of information in this book...Follow this book and watch your Reality change over night...The Force is real, How you use that Force is up to you, I hope you use it to do Good in the world...
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend who has a friend with the same disabilities as August. This book talks about real friendships and all the traps that pre-teens fall into with friendships. Enjoy and have a tissue for the end!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I can't imagine anyone giving this book more than 2 stars!<br />It was mindless...did not keep me guessing, but made me skip entire paragraphs because it repeated parts of their thoughts over and over again.<br />As for the ending....there was none!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is a great app. I can use it on my computer or kindle fire. It doesn't require internet (+!) And you can attach photos to your note. You can tag it, make different notebooks and create shortcuts. I really like it. The only thing you have to get used to is putting it in the right notebook. It switches back to the main notebook for each new note. Other than that AWESOME  app.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't put it down. The story is intriguing, the characters well developed. The suspense was intense! His use of foreshadowing builds the dread and drives the story.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|It is fun and makes you think ; very addictive and I love it; glad there isn't a time limit on it because some puzzles are a little hard to solve
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app has so many sounds to choose from. Everything you can think of from rain, birds, lullabies, instruments and so much more.
B00005M989|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter in law and she loved it. It was exactly what she wanted.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It works great on my kindle.  I did not think it would be easy to navigate.  I don't have any more words.
B002M9WW30|4.0|Video quality was great. All the movies were excellent except Rocky 5 which I did not have the heart to even attempt to watch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Yep this is a good game. I enjoyed it and play it all the time. If you like subway surfer then you will like this.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My friend downloaded this app and now I am always playing and cross breeding dragons so I don't have to buy them with gems. I know anyone who gets this  game will love playing it
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game is too easy to play. I think it should be a lot harder or at least a little harder.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It was a breeze to set up and it's so convenient being able to cast my computer to my tv.  I can control Netflix from my phone, tablets and Chromebook.  I do wish that I could cast HBO Go or Pandora, but this device is brand new so it's a work in progress.  I think it'll only get better from here.  I'm impressed, Google!<br /><br />Tip: Chromecast Can Cast Your Entire Desktop Screen Too, Not Just Tabs:<br />[...]<br /><br />\\"To access this experimental entire screen casting, all you have to do is tap the Cast button in Chrome (assuming you installed the Chrome extension), tap the little down arrow box in the pop-up, and select \\"Cast entire screen (experiemental).\\" Once you have that option checked, you'll then tell the Cast extension to cast to a Chromecast.\\"
B00992CF6W|4.0|In the new update it won't let me and my friends play together locally can someone tell me me how to make realms work?
B008I43DYU|5.0|I like the font size, color and transforming ability of this calculator. It can be used in the simple mode without any complexities that even a 1st grader would have fun using it. And it can be transformed into a more complex and advance instrument for higher grades and college students. It's a great app to have.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is way better than the original game. It's super fun and challenging. I love how the animations look so real and the sound effects are amazing. This game is worth six stars!
B008XJM86Y|5.0|I bought this CD when it first came out while mourning the break up of Creed.  I have listened to it many, many times.  It finally got too many scratches so I had to have another one.  Mark Tremonti so very talented.  Love Metallingus!!!  I really appreciate the unique sound of Myles Kennedy's voice.  The lyrics on these songs seem to have very deep spiritual meaning.  One of my all-time favorite CD's!
159463176X|3.0|Khaled Hosseini is a great or possibly a brilliant storyteller.  I read this book in two short sittings, and it went down like butter.  However, the story he's chosen to tell struck me as entirely predictable, as were the characters (actually, caricatures would be a better term) and their dialogue.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a horrifically poor brother and sister in rural Afghanistan who are devoted to each other but who are separated (I won't say how), and the rest of the story concerns how they lead their separate lives and how others in their circles live theirs and how those circles intersect.  There is not much tension in the plot (though perhaps more could have been generated), and you can see the ending coming from miles (or pages) away.  The characters who live the stories in these intersecting circles are stick figures and in many cases stereotypes or caricatures of themselves, and as their goal is merely to carry out the flaccid plot and get to the long-anticipated ending, they don't have much originality and don't hold one's interest.  As for the dialogue, what can you expect from stick figure characters but stick-figure dialogues?<br /><br />I would love to see something really challenging from Mr. Hosseini; something that conveys the anguish of the Afghan people or of what appears to be his own anguish as an expat who feels for his native country.  But the anguish in this book is that of a sound stage; it's artificial and sterile.<br /><br />Sorry!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Warm, unusual and little scary. Help to resurface some of the childhood fillings and perceptions. Excellent writing and a  recommended reading.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This movie does an excellent job of tying up some loose ends that were unresolved when the TV series was cancelled; and answers some questions that were left hanging.  It's also a great finale, with no need for a sequel (spoiler alert: two of the characters die in this film).  If you loved the series, do get this movie--it will really round out your Firefly collection.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|Great guitar work and lyrics, right up my alley, touches of Allman Brothers, Zac Brown and Soul Asylum, good harmonies and song writing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Since I don't have cable TV, I was unaware of this series while it was being shown.  I rented it through a popular online movie site and after watching the first disk I said, &#34;I gotta have this series!&#34; This 4-disc set allows the viewer to see every episode in order, without commercials or having to wait until next week for the next.  I've watched it numerous times and have shown it to others who had never heard of it; they've become fans as well.  Apparently &#34;Firefly&#34; fans are legion, and after watching just the pilot episode I could see why. Has a lot of &#34;steampunk&#34; elements to it; and all of the characters are wonderful in their own individual way--there won't be any of them that you don't like, and it will be hard to choose a favorite.  Do yourself a favor and get this set, and also the full-length movie made after the series was cancelled!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Truly enjoyed the first couple of levels.  But I'm stuck on level 6 and don't understand the numbers in the box under the ship.  Would be nice to get a hint some how.
6305428557|5.0|Enjoyable with some laughs. It is a fun, clean fun with no sex scenes or curse words in this movie.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|the movie was not only pixelated, but the quality of this movie in comparison to the first transformers has declined
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|This was a great movie. Thwe MLP show dynamic is alive and well in this full feature film.<br /><br />All the Niegh sayers are just trolling, this was thouroughly enjoyable with a great story line and perfect character adaption.<br /><br />the only thing i would have liked would be to have an extra from the backround makers that shows each and every pony adaption... but i'm sure fans will have something put out there shortly... if not already :)
B004A8ZWT2|5.0|This is an excellent movie!  I love the twist at the end. It came in good time and in excellent condition. I'm glad I got the two-disc edition so I can share it with my friends who don't have Blu-ray.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|The plot is somewhat unique, but there are some inconsistencies. How come the clones of Tom Cruise never ran into each other for the time they were tera farming the earth. How come only one clone went rogue and the others were perfect ? If you overlook some obvious flaws I think the movie was okay.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW FROM SO MANY YEARS BACK, I DON'T THINK I EVER MISSED AN EPISODE AND IF I KNEW I WAS GOING TO, I RECORDED IT!  NOW I OWN ALL SEVEN SEASONS OF IT!!!  I WATCH IT ANY TIME I WANNA LAUGH, ANY TIME I DON'T FEEL WELL, JUST ANY TIME WILL REALLY DO!!!  :)  I ALWAYS GET THINGS I ORDER FROM AMAZON, OR A THIRD PARTY ON TIME!  I ORDERED THIS QUITE A WHILE BACK AND I GUESS I DIDN'T LOG IN OFTEN ENOUGH BACK THEN TO REALIZE I NEEDED TO WRITE A REVIEW, SO HERE IT IS!  THANK YOU!!!!!!
B00DU74U74|2.0|My wife saw trailers for this and said she thought it looked decent.  The trailers lied.  Probably only good for 12-year-old Twilight fans.  Some semi-interesting plot elements but premise went nowhere and acting and script were stilted and annoyingly predictable.  Ultimately this is just an emo teen romance movie with aliens (not scary or amazing aliens - just boring teen aliens).  Sad to see Bill Hurt part of such a dog.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Difficult situation dealt with superficially. You know where it's going well before it gets there - I wouldn't recommend it -
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Too many advertisements causing distractions from counting.  With the ads changing during calculations, causing problems on being focus and having to start over.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Great series my whole family loves to watch it! Fun scifi show great characters it is very unique in a fun way.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The killer gene aspect of the novel was interesting.  I felt somewhat manipulated by the storyline.  I couldn't accept the lack of acknowledgement by the father of Jacob's alter ego.
B007P2DQJI|1.0|The battery worked well for the first few weeks requiring only one charge over night. However, shortly thereafter it started to hold its charge for only about half a day (requiring an additional afternoon charge).
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing it's had me hooked from the very beginning.. it's a must read if you have read the first one
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS is a great game for any person young or old. I would like to see the nether in the game because pigmen are already. You have to use a MC editor to get pigmen btw. Well even without the nether it still is an amazing app.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What seems like a simple kind of game is actually a tough challenge that makes you work for the next part of the mystery. I can't wait for the sequel!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got so many levels on my daughters tablet that she made me get my own and play on it...  this game is so addicting and I love that if you get stuck you can move around and go back to ones that you didn't complete.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|An entirely original take on the afterlife. What happens when you die? Trust me you never imagined this. A fun satire of life and death from several perspectives. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend you give it a watch
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the best! It takes a while for the games to get started, but is awesome when they do! I think it should be for ages 10 and up. Totally awesome!
B0016492BW|5.0|I was able to introduce my kids to this movie and we laughed our butts off for weeks.  Great movie, fun times as I recall my younger years and all the fun quotes that come from this.<br /><br />The blu-ray was a great adaption!
B005544TRQ|5.0|i was drawn to this series immediately by it,s clever premise. i continued to watch it catch up, on my kindle fire and loved it all the way through each season,, looking forward to watch it now new season is ready to begin.
B00338QELU|4.0|The story line spans centuries and continents.  I found the book hard to put down because there would always be another twist or turn in the plot where I wanted to read further so, consequently, I really plowed through the book.  The ending faded a bit for me and was perhaps a little anti=climatic. but overall I thought it was a very engaging and interesting story.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Hey, I think you need an instruction manual to learn how to use this app. I am not up for lessons on how to use a search engine I just want to search the internet and have fun.
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|I re read the book the after seeing the movie and the adaption in some ways is the closest I have ever seen in matching scene order and dialog. The relationship between Nick and Jordan was reduced, and Nick's post climax analysis of the story was given details that were not in the book. Otherwise, you may be hard pressed to spot differences between this movie and book.<br />The noticable differences come from the stylization of some key scenes: Nick's visit to Tom's apartment in the city, Gatsby's party when Daisy shows up, and others. Personally I found these scenes a visual and audio delight--a reason for going to the movies.
B0058W74UY|2.0|No all of us are super geeks and can figure out what to do with this type of browser. I am still whirling from this app. It does not provide any directions and is not very user friendly.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Her best classic stands the test of time.. It is all here in the original richness and openness of her vocals and lyrics
B00DW475CC|5.0|This movie came out in black and white, Then later they colorized it. I'm very much hoping for both versions on this blu ray - that would be so great. They did it with Miracle on 34th street so seems a waste if they don't do it one this one.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|This was a fun watch when it first came out..and it still is!!!  Good escapisim and family fun with out being played down for content and charter developement!
B007P7UF0G|5.0|haven't viewed yet  It should  be perfect, the DVD arrived in mint condition and I will view it in the near future.
B006P0FICE|5.0|An interestesting update and even without the 3-D effects not in play.. it is an entertaining fun romp! Worth the watch.
B0086700CM|3.0|I've only had this game for a short time, but it is not as good as Temple Run 2 as far as I'm concerned.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books because of the very active nature of Katniss.  While the satire and politics of the story are still intriguing, there is way more moping and naval-gazing in this chapter, with a protracted finale that other than one brief moment feels drawn out and anti-climatic.  Tell, a worthwhile read for fans of the series.
B00DURILJ2|1.0|This movie is soooooo boring and drama-y yet pointless. It has one of those endings where you go- \\"That's it? What did I just watch?!\\" To those who say this is a coming-of-age story, what on earth lesson was learned- just life experiences? Sorry that doesn't cut it for me. Lame movie, don't waste your time.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|lots of action, not much of a story. I like Bruce Willis and his action movies would have enjoyed it more if it had a better story line.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very addicting! I can't stop playing every chance I get. If you have a creative personality, then you will love this game. Best of all, it's free.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Spoiler Alert:<br /><br />Should have been called Alien: Genesis. The beginning of the Alien saga. I didn't know this going in. Maybe a good thing because I would have expected more of the movie. As it was, it was just okay. There were clues as the movie went along that hinted at Alien, but I really didn't put them all together until the movie was almost over. Then it was obvious in hindsight.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Very pleased with this purchase.  The movie is pretty funny (adult humor) and well written.  The only part I did not like was...ha ha - just joking.  The entire movie is AWESOME!  I know, not very detailed, but true.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Not the best movie Cruise has ever made, but it has its moments. Morgan Freeman, as usual, is great. The rest of the cast is suitable for this type of flick. I don't see anybody winning any awards for it; there is just nothing really outstanding or new about it. Mean ol' aliens attack Earth, humanity fights back and in the words of Will Smith's character from Independence Day, &#34;Whoop ET's ass.&#34;<br /><br />A few plot twists that you might or might not see coming. Overall, a good flick to kill a couple of hours, but if you want to buy it, wait until you can get it cheap; or maybe rent it one more time if you're into watching it a movie more than once (I am). I'll probably buy the dvd when it's down around 9 or 10 bucks. That's 2 rentals.
0061122416|5.0|This is a masterpiece, well written in a simple form.<br /><br />One that inspires me to listen to my truth.<br /><br />One that encourages me to go for my dream, despite how insignificant it seems at first.<br /><br />A great book like this reminds me of life's magnificence in the everyday mundane. If you enjoy the Alchemist, check out another incredible book by Ariel and Shya Kane. [[ASIN:1888043024 How to Have A Match Made in Heaven: A Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating, and Marriage]]<br /><br />I had never read a book that's done in a more creative format: you get to watch stories coming alive through the video links in the book. These are videos of real people in their real lives; how their lives transformed as they discovered that new possibilities open up in their relationships. It is down to earth yet nothing ordinary.<br /><br />The Alchemist, even though structured in a different way, is such a gem that inspires me over and over again.  I gain new perspectives for life and feel renewed and refreshed whenever I read them. I highly recommend both books!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is an easy review. LOVE IT!<br />All the great pockets, spaces for my lens's and I can adjust the space size.<br />Only one little wish, that it came with more straps to hold my camera and items in place.<br />I balances well on one shoulder or both. Best Xmas present to myself!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|First, this films plot makes this one of the greatest Sci-Fi films I have ever watched, many great scientists have warned us that searching for alien life could be catastrophic! That being said; the acting was excellent, the sound and visual effect's are superb. This film will go into my personal collection. I recommend you purchase this film for your collection as well.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|It works fine on my Kindle Fire HD. It's a great app. No disappointment :) just great. Good for the price.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This has to be the most underrated album of all time. People who miss the message in the album are missing out on a lot. I'm sick of hearing about the fillers on this album, since there are 8 full length songs I don't think it's an issue at all. Amazing album by a legendary band and I can't wait for the new album!<br /><br />Tool Army
B0031RS8UI|5.0|I LOVED this book - brilliant Sophie! My heart ached for Samantha - laugh out loud funny! One of the better Kinsella books I have read!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I really have a better grasp of what is great food. Thanks Anthony for a wild ride through the kitchens of New York!,
B000V4UFZK|5.0|I was excited to show my pre-teen kids this old favorite from my earlier years. It was actually a little scarier than I remembered. but my 11 year old handled it well. Compared to today's horror movies, this one is tame.
B00932A4XE|5.0|This was super funny and had a few tearjerker moments as well. Both me and my man enjoyed it...yes it appeals to men too (not just a chick flick!)
B000A2IPP0|5.0|This is truly the best kids movie of all time. My heart breaks for any kids around the globe who don't have an opportunity to see this while they are young. I love to see it ever now and then as an adult and relive the thrill of the first time I saw it.  Watch it with your kids and create a great family memory together.
B001NYEL9S|3.0|Most of the songs on this cd I'm not a big fan of, but I and my husband are a big fan of the movie. The few songs I wanted I felt were worth getting the whole album.
B007X4N0DU|5.0|P.O.D. ~ Murdered Love (2012) is by far the BEST album from these Christian/raggae/rap-core/metalers since Satellite! The songs are varied and fresh and full of raw energy!!! Songs like EYEZ, HIGHER, are great but BEAUTIFUL (a ballad) and MURDERED LOVE will blow you away with it's originality and positive messages!!!! Check this disc out and you will become a fan of Payable On Death!
B0097JYVAU|4.0|I learned a lot. It was a worthwhile read but sometimes dwells on certain cases such as those in sport and gambling a bit too much
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I LOVE ROBB STARK!!!!!!!!!! This book is even more amazing than the series....I highly recommend it.<br />&#34; The North will never forget &#34;
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I got completely hooked on this show. Watched season 1 and season 2 in 3 days.<br />Think Easy A, but as a series...
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Good Game, child really likes it, however it reset during gameplay and forced them to start over.<br />It would be 5 stars if this had not occurred.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey (2012) [HD]<br />4 STAR RATING - I LIKE IT. A++++.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Great show detailing the plight of the English from the Titanic to World War 1. Amazing season finale. Must-see from the beginning.  Can't wait to see how the family fares in season 4.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Oz The Great And Powerful [HD]<br />4 Star Rating - I Like It A++++. Thank you very much. Have a great day!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Few dare write the sardonic lead as well as Lee Child. Always a great read, but why did they cast Tom Cruise as Reacher?
B008RA3X5E|4.0|My wife bought a radio alarm clock at target yesterday.  I came home and downloaded this for free.  I'll probably buy the paid version for $.99 and itwill be better than hers...she paid $15.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Good plot, good pace ( sometimes very fast paced books more than page turners are roller-coaster rides not everybody particularly likes), Definitely one of Harry Bosch best.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I adore lauryn hill. she is a total package. shes beautiful, she can rap better than these rappers today, and can sing her booty off. but this album if you want to know what real music sounds like
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It keeps you on your toes I love challenge and that's exactly what you I do when playing with family-friends  lol there's some range and motion in this game
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|j cole is a beast.  its gonna be a cole world. cant wait for his next piece of work<br />swag
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great read, excellent moments.  Many great bits are references from other great movies and minutia from my youth, so I had that familiarity and recognition factor in play.  But this is not just a compilation album, it does have some real moments of its own which were what elevated it from the \\"geeks greatest hits\\".  Hollywood, when you make this, and you will, pay attention to the characters as described.  The heroes are ordinary and that makes them extraordinary.
B00BU987C8|5.0|this album is definitely amazing. great songs and Kendrick does a fantastic job telling you his story through music. while listening it feels like you were there with him in compton
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|It keeps me chuckling I am truely enjoying this game.It keeps. You guessing what your next move will be.Still learning the game.
B003L7DK74|5.0|funny. every episode gets even more funnier.all the actors do a fantastic job. I hope there is a third season
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is one of the best games I've played to date. I would recommend this to anyone. I love the challenge of beating my own high score!
0689878451|5.0|I bought this book for two male friends who are married and in the process of adopting their first child. This story is sweet and something that children and adults can connect with. This story discusses the life of a family of penguins, their habits, lifestyles and more. It then introduces two male penguins who adopt an egg that another penguin couple couldn't care for and raise it as their own. I would highly recommend this book!
B0026Q8EWW|4.0|Matt Damon is a great actor and does a good job in this movie.  The plot seemed a bit slow to me though.
B00BEWCIJY|5.0|slayer is the black sabbath of thrash never have to worry about suffering through their version of &#34;enter the sandman&#34;
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I love this show and won't bother to echo the many good reviews.  I'm just adding my hit on the symbolism of the names.  \\"Walter\\" is reminiscent of \\"Walter Mitty\\" the repressed, nerdy guy who dreamed of bigger things. \\"White\\"---well he is the prototype good guy, lilly white and always doing the right thing. (This is great fodder for Jungian analysts.) \\"Schwartz\\" as they explain, his ex-colleague in grad school, means \\"black\\" and he has stolen Walt's ideas and made a fortune from them.  They had together formed \\"Gray Matter\\" which included both of them but apparently Schwartz got greedy and cheated out Mr. White.  Then there is the interesting Jesse Pinkman---who is neither all white in his behavior nor all bad. (I came to love Jesse.)  He spills his share of blood but shows a good heart.  Then...the sexy, hot and beautiful assistant principal, Carmen, (red, if you don't already know) who seems to have the hots for the suffering White.  I'm only in the beginning of the second series so I hope to see more of Senorita Carmen.<br /><br />So far, so good....looking forward to more..in spite of too much violence for my taste.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of those home homes don't look like any I've seen in Albuquerque and I've lived there.  All those leafy trees and green lawns....looks more like Southern California or Michigan than anything I've seen in New Mexico.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's easy to use and gives me updates automatically. I recommend you download this app, there is no other like it.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|A fantastic follow-up to Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's 2004 Shaun of the Dead. Many fans of the so-called &#34;Cornetto Trilogy&#34; prefer Hot Fuzz; personally, I love them both equally. It features a slightly different tone but maintains the same quirky, deadpan humor that made Shaun so brilliant. The primary flaw is the over-the-top action ending that many viewers may find alienating, particularly Americans unaccustomed to surreal comedy. I would recommend a purchase, simply because there are so many details that can only be caught upon multiple viewings.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fabulous game full of surprises and wonderful puzzles.  Very entertaining!!  I could not put it down. Highly recommended!  Wonderful FUN.
0812550706|5.0|This book was in good condition.  I bought it for my son's friend and he is enjoying the story and waiting for the movie!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really enjoyed the first two books by Khaled Hosseini, but found this one even more well-written.  There were multiple subplots and characters, all woven together.  Certainly there is much sadness in this book, but not so much as the Kite Runner in my opion.
037582913X|5.0|This was my favorite book as a child.  My big sister used to read it to me.  It was fun to send a copy of it to her, and she enjoyed reading it to her children.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Harry Hole is a main character who is more complex than Harry Bosch, but has some similarities.  I think the author is an excellent writer, rivaling the Stieg Larsen Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series.
B00BX8PG4S|4.0|The film is well written, the actors are well matched, it's based on a true story, it does make you think about the things that happened during the cold war.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I simply love these &#34;lets psychoanalyze society by throwing some strange catastrophe at it&#34; books. Highly recommend it.<br /><br />If you are expecting something like the movie, then don't buy this. The only similarities between this book and the movie by the same name is the name, and it is about zombies (not really. The book is less about zombies and more about how humans react to the whole catastrophy).
B007I1Q4W2|3.0|Had thought this would be a better film from other reviews, it's slow, they use cartoons in certain scenes, the feel of the film is cheap, gave it away after watching.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but I am an adult.  And while it does carry a PG 13 rating, the advertising seems to be geared toward ages even younger than this.  The movie can be a bit disturbing for even 13 yr olds since the main point of the movie is kids killing eachother.  So what kind of example is this setting for them?
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This is a really long movie, but it is a feast for the eyes and senses, the actors play more than one character, the story pulls you in and you don't realize how long the movie has been going, not for everyone, but if you are after an intelligent story and some fantastic effects, this is the one for you.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I haven't been this hooked to a show forever... come to think of it, I don't remember the last one.<br /><br />Very compelling, fast-paced and engaging content/story. The actors do a great job of the chemistry between the two main characters and all the other characters as well. Writing is excellent and acting is excellent.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|The adventures of Tom Sawyer make a great bedtime story for kids of all ages. I enjoyed returning to my early childhood memories.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As with seasons one and two, there was a perfect mix of romance, intrigue, suspense and of course, humor. The season finale left me torn between the need to weep and a desire to throw the TV out the window! Can't wait to see what season four brings.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I enjoyed reading and returning to the classic style of books. A great bedtime story for kids of all ages.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|It would be easy to ignore this release were it not for the catchy songs and great arrangements. Yes, this Simon Collins who plays drums and sings is the son of a certain Phil Collins. There are similarities at times, it comes with the territory.<br /><br />This is modern progressive rock with a few nods to the past masters; all in all I like it much more than I expected. The lyrics might seem cosmic but I think it's more introspective. There are passages that give rise to authentic goosebumps, all too rare anymore. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea anymore but it's exciting to have some new material to believe in.<br /><br />Had tickets to their show in Atlanta but the tour has now been postponed due to work visa issues until next spring. I do look forward to seeing them perform this album eventually.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|This is one of those movie I would much rather watch from my home HD TV<br />rather then pay the high prices in the theaters
B00BSWMITK|4.0|As usual, Joe has made a great record. It's a little less predicable this time because Mike Keneally is being given some room here to work his magic (keyboards and guitar0 and the other supporting musicians are different people this time.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it's not his best work perhaps, but better than the last couple and I'll be enjoying it this summer.<br /><br />Really looking forward to seeing Joe perform with Mike K and the incredible rhythm section of Bryan Beller and Marco Minneman in a few weeks. Should be a smoking good evening with this crew!
B009EBLCK8|5.0|I am hooked! This is such a good take on the classic black and white TV shows but with a wonderful modern cutting edge; can't wait for the next season to begin.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely adore this app. I love to waste hours and hours pinning, but watch out. It is very very addictive!
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Can't wait for season 3; I hope they do more than 3 shows for that season. The second show for this season was a little weak, but the third show came right back with a bang.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|too short but at least you don't have tobuy your way to the next level. will be interested. to see what the future floors bring.
B00CLD65X0|4.0|I am Looking forward to the next season and this series has made me look into other BBC shows available from Amazon.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|I didn't pay enough attention  before buying this.  It's TINY.  400 pieces, but the whole thing is maybe 4x4x4 inches when it's put together. Beware scalpers asking for $50 or more for this: even the original asking price of $35 is probably too much.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|A dozen different disconnected storyline in a dozen disconnected settings, featuring dozens of people speaking unintelligible gibberish in monotonic voices and absurd idiosyncratic dialects with absolutely no hint of a singular purpose to it all, even after the first 45 minutes...<br />Well, that is all I can stand.  Tom Hanks has made a lot of boring films, but this one goes beyond boring.  This farce is definitely for that select group of hipster/posers that thought \\"Lost\\" was good drama with \\"deep insight and profound meaning\\".  Two thumbs down.<br />If you can find a written review with full spoilers that can be read in less than two minutes, you will have saved yourself some considerable agony by reading it and then passing this film by.<br /><br />On the other hand, of course, if you are the sort of person who feels compelled to agree with those who feel that Carl Jung and Edgar Cayce were brilliant men of science out of a need for \\"belonging\\", then this movie is probably ripe for you. After all, the book was written for the herd, and this movie was made to capitalize on that herds' bankroll.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A good, trashy mystery novel with lots of twists and turns and a macho tough guy hero that is fun to get behind.  A good, quick, entertaining read.
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|I really liked this game, if anything was wrong with it it was too short. I wanted more levels. I found the story line sweet and sad. The game play was fun and you really had to think about how to solve the puzzles. Very well done.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Here we have 3 dudes that can really play.  Sometimes when bands come together and they are just 3 individuals that can jam, it doesn't work.  That is NOT the case here.  These guys mesh WELL.  The sounds are unique, energetic, and addictive.  I love hearing bass solos and drum solos again.  If you are sick of the Pop movement with autotune and no talent, here is your remedy.  I would love to see these guys live.  Catchy hooks, lead guitar singing lead vocals, but all 3 guys add vocals to the mix.  A+  Buy this now.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Needs ways to EARN coins to play instead of buying coins this would make the game more fun. Everyone is not rich.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The first season was one of optimism, redemption.  It brought me in.  I was cheering and booing and feeling the angst of being number one and the price that had to be paid.<br /><br />Season 2 is edgier.  There is more to lose and less to gain.  I know that sounds like a slam, but it's actually a true reflection of the world.  Principles have a price.  I am very pleased with where season two has gone.  Can't wait to dive into season 3!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think this game is addictive. I plays everyday and its new happy that I got a game that I like to play
B001ANYDAO|5.0|If you like nonfiction with lots of aha moments, this one is a good choice.  My son and I took a driving trip, and the non-driver read it to the driver.  We spent lots of time talking about the contents.  A really good aha read!

B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always enjoyed playing solitaire with regular cards so this just makes it easier for me to play the game.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|This is a brilliant science fiction series, and actress Tatiana Masly deserves an Emmy for portraying six different characters with the same face.  In technical terms, these discs arrive uncut--no need to order from a different region--with a spectacular picture and sound.  Haven't gotten to the extras yet.  Totally enthralled with the show.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy placing the cards in the respective locations and try to do it faster each time that I do it.  It is a lot of fun while I am sitting around
B009AMALLM|4.0|This was a great value for the price I paid. The dvd and blu-ray combo containing the rated and unrated versions of this film are great!.Love this series of films!

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Simple, fun, addicting.  Takes some practice as you get further, but makes you want to keep trying.  Good buy, I'd recommend to others
B00876TJ2E|5.0|This is a good adaptation of the book.  For an oldie, this is definitely a pretty good film.  I'd always rather stick to the old adaptations of King's books.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I watched the show before getting this on DVD but I love the storyline so I just had to buy it!  Would recommend for anyone who likes fantasy/werewolf/action/romance/mystery stories.
B000FA675C|5.0|You won't want to put it down! As always with a Robert Langdon story, suspenseful, surprising and addictive. As soon as I finished this one, I dove into Angels & Demons and can't wait for the next.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|PDF files are quick to load and easy to navigate.  Better than the Kindle App for sure.  I couldn't ask for more.
0800177177|5.0|Gary Oldman is his typical self. Sort of creepy but plays many different characters well. This movie is visually beautiful and a little haunting. Flows nicely. Not a fan of Keanu Reeves but plays the part well. This movie is worth the watch or adding it to your collection at home.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I really loved this game. It is really fun and stuff. I don't know if its just me but after a while the screen goes black and I can't load it anymore. If it wasn't for that it would be 5 stars
B000GTCZWQ|5.0|Well beyond her years in this movie. Inspiring, passionate, and sad. One of my favorite's. Well worth the watch. Enjoy!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is a great series and you'll definitely be sucked in. If you're a fan of the mythical and fantastical commercial fiction, this book is great for you. But don't be expecting a work of literary genius. It's pure fun.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|If you like puppets, raw explicit comedy, and 'Merica then you will like this movie! Full of bust out loud laughter! Had me in tears! And the theme song, I mean c'mon, GENIUS! You will never forget this movie once you have watched it! I WOULDNT RECOMMEND this for the kiddos or anyone who has a light sense of humor. So delicate ears and eyes look away. The rest of us will enjoy this hilarious comedy!  Definitely add this to your collection! Sherpa sherpa bak alah durka durka! :-D
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game.  I like how creative you can be and how it grows with you and all the great information it gives you on real reefs and fish.  Highly recommend.

0062255657|5.0|If Ray Bradbury had been born in England and hobnobbed with Clive Staples Lewis, he might've written a book similar to this short novel.  (Before I begin my short review -- no need to wax lenghty and deconstruct it to death -- I have to point out that Amazon reviewers complaining that this book is too short, or that it's akin to a fairytale,  have obviously missed two important facts about Gaiman: 1) MOST of his work has been at shorter length, and 2) At least half of his oeuvre, maybe more, was written for children, or with children in mind as part of the audience).  Or, as the narrator of THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE so succinctly puts it: \\"Adult stores never made sense, and they were slow to start. They made me feel like there were secrets, Masonic, mythic secrets, to adulthood. Why didn't adults want to read about Narnia, about secret islands and smugglers and dangerous fairies?\\"<br /><br />Like Bradbury did with his Midwestern fairy tales (most prominently, SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES), Gaiman first grounds his tale in a bit of reality. In this case, it is a funeral which the first-person narrator is to attend, in his former hometown, in England.  Once there, he wanders down the lane to a house he used to visit as a child, and memories of his childhood come flooding back.  Among those memories, that of a lodger -- an opal miner from Australia -- who committed suicide in his family's car.  That traumatic event -- the narrator's seven-year-old self also sees the body -- leads to a meeting with Lettie Hempstock, and eleven-year-old girl who lives down the lane, her mother Ginnie, and her grandmother \\"Old Mrs. Hempstock.  And that meeting leads to a brush with a world that may or may not abutt our own (much like a parallel dimension).  It's a world full of magic (full moons that can appear at the will of Ginnie Hempstock) and monsters (Manta Wolves, and strange worm-like things).  One of the monsters appears in the form of Ursula Monkton, a parasitical temptress who charms the narrator's family and tempts his father, with the intention of spreading her evil even further.  Only Lettie Hempstock and her family can help drive Ursula back to where she came from.<br /><br />There is an interesting -- interwoven -- sub-theme about memory and perception, and that is both icing _and_ cake, which works quite well with the poetic musings sprinkled throughout the tale.  And while the main story -- and tropes -- stem classic myths and fairytales, the overal, underlying, theme lies closer to the heart of something Gaiman, as a writer, holds dear. Indeed, it's a theme Ray Bradbury often visited: the need to retain the childlike joy and wonder with which we are all born. For the purposes of the tale, it is, in fact, something which is essential to one's survival.  Here's hoping most of Gaiman's audience for this bestseller walk away retaining that lesson; and, if they have lost touch with them, go out in search of their own childhood selves.tress who charms the narrator's family and tempts his father, with the intention of spreading her evil even further.

B000HSKUBE|5.0|I couldn't stop watching this show; the main character is so deliciously evil and yet, I found myself rallying behind him.  Great show.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love this game so much but it&rsquo;s starting to get old.  Even though the scenery changes every free weeks, I feel that the course is very repetitive.  Would like to see it switched up a bit.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you like the series you'll love the novel.  It's really convenient getting all 4 books in one purchase.  I'm half way through the second book and I'm sure I'll buy book 5 when I finish this.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|The overall sound of ...Like Clockwork is obviously a culmination of things learned and explored during Homme's foray into Them Crooked Vultures which results in something that sounds like a halfway point between the traditional Queens sound and what came from Vultures. I can completely understand those who aren't happy with this evolution, wishing that the two endeavors were like walled cities that had no influence on each other. However, I like whats happening and am perfectly happy with the results.
B00A12VW86|3.0|I haven't completely loved the trio of albums yet, like I did with most past Green Day albums.  This is not to say it's bad, just not a 5-star typical Green Day album.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The Mortal Instruments series is nothing short of addicting! Once you start, you won't want to put then down.<br /><br />I have to say, I very much enjoyed the first installment, but found this, the second, to be even better! Clare expands on the various mythologies in an often unique manner, and more so on her characters, which are honestly the driving force  for the story.<br /><br />I highly recommend them to anyone, they won't regret it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandson plays this all the time when he is here and it seem to be one of his favorites.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|G.I. Joe the movie two. This one is a whole lot better and the first one I just didn't like the one seen by a had a whole lot more action. If you're a G.I. Joe fan and you like the original cartoons the cobra commander in this one actually looks like cobra commander from the cartoons. So that was a big selling point for me on this one also and the action the snake eyes, storm shadow and Jinks, but is totally awesome. So 10 stars out of 10 I will have to give it a 9 1/2 stars. Is it worth to $20. Maybe it's totally on you guys if you want to buy it or not, but Amazon video on command. I say this was really good. You could ran it like I did for $3.99 and see if you want spend a $20-$30 for this anyway. You'll find out if you want to buy or not stay safe and have a good day.
B0031RSA24|5.0|Reading this book I finally became aware of something: over the years I have always been skeptic about Religion, and became basically uninterested in the topic. However, revisiting all the teachings I was indoctrinated with as a child with the eyes of an educated adult suddenly made me aware how ludicrous, absurd and inconsistent all the teachings and claims of religion were. It made me realise not only was I uninterested in religion, I simply could not with a good consciousness say that I belong to that religion. More, I finally realised how dangerous religion ( i.e. committing yourself to non-thinking and non critically questioning) really was. Thank you Richard for opening my eyes. I will definitely not indoctrinate my children, so that they can as educated adults recognise religion as the nonsense that it is.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I cannot wait for the next season to start.  The BBC is know for their drama and actors and this one is especially good.  I really would not like to see it end.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Non-stop, twist and turn intrigue is the hallmark of this series. Beautifully acted, especially by stars Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, this story of the quest for power among Washington politicos is full of surprises, not the least of which is the lead character's engagement with the audience through frequent &#34;asides.&#34; The drama is innovative and intense and a refreshing departure from usual TV fare.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|Fans of NXNW who have not seen this blu-ray version should DEFINITELY make the effort to do so.  The clarity of the blu-ray picture and sound surpass the high standard already set by the excellent DVD version and more than justify buying this pioneering spy caper anew.<br /><br />NXNW is rightly acclaimed as a classic and most definitely still delivers as an engaging and fun relic of its time, abundant in 1959 elegance, style, droll wit, & class.  In many ways this (and its Hitchcock/Cary Grant predecessor [[ASIN:B00AEBB8H4 To Catch a Thief [Blu-ray]]]) were truly the first James Bond movies, as becomes glaringly apparent after even casual comparison.  Sean Connery's Bond was monumental, but it's just hard to imagine how the entire Bond series would have fared without having the suave, debonair Cary Grant there to blaze the trail as \\"The Cat\\" John Robbie in \\"TCAT\\" and of course as Roger Thornhill in \\"NXNW\\".<br /><br />Now let's concede up front: you MUST disconnect your plausibility radar and just go along for the ride with NXNW and all its howling impossibilities.  Let's not even dig into them too much EXCEPT TO suggest that if you're looking to bump off a rival spy, are you REALLY going to try to lure him onto a dusty Indiana highway and try to puree him with the propeller of a biplane?  How does it happen that Thornhill (Grant) and the rival agents (James Mason, Martin Landau, Eva Marie Saint) all wind up on the 20th Century Limited after Thornhill goes on the lam from the UN?  For that matter, how likely is it that Thornhill even gets OUT of the UN after getting framed for the murder there?  --NEVER MIND!  You simply have to surrender to the night-at-the-movies popcorn FUN of it, and enjoy the rollercoaster of thrills, chills, romance & spy intrigue Hitchcock serves up here.  Sure, it's easy to chuckle at the stratospheric \\"suspension of disbelief\\" necessary to properly enjoy NXNW but really I think it's a deliberate part of the fun and not meant to stand up to serious scrutiny.<br /><br />Cary Grant, in his fourth and final outing with Hitchcock delivers a knockout performance as the Madison Avenue adman on the run Roger Thornhill.  James Mason shines here also as the oh-so-elegant (but deadly) \\"enemy agent\\" Phillip Van Damme, with outstanding support from his menacing secretary Leonard, played with beady-eyed malice by Martin Landau.  Eva Marie Saint obviously owns the role of Eve Kendall, glamorous double-agent torn between her duty to maintain her cover and her growing love for Roger, but I personally still can't fully \\"buy\\" Eva as a \\"femme fatale\\" as depicted in NXNW. No complaints about her performance--she's excellent, and again, her name goes into immortality for this role, BUT I still think another actress would have been more credible as the \\"morally flexible\\" Eve Kendall than Eva Marie was able to project.  By her appearance and temperament, I think Eva was much better matched to her \\"good girl\\" roles, as in \\"[[ASIN:B00A8QDIMS On the Waterfront (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]]\\", which played to her strengths much more than NXNW would allow.  Hitch already had two better qualified actresses \\"in his company\\" already in Ingrid Bergman (\\"[[ASIN:B0065N6K9Q Notorious [Blu-ray]]]\\") and obviously Grace Kelly (\\"To Catch a Thief\\").  STILL--I'm just offering my opinion here; Eva was great and more than nailed the part.<br /><br />As other reviewers affirm, in many ways \\"NXNW\\" was the pinnacle of Hitchcock's career.  All the stars converged for this one; OUTSTANDING cast, script, cinematography, locations and all those intangibles necessary to create a CLASSIC which no one can deliberately conjure into being.  Let me pay special tribute here to that high-style Frank Lloyd Wright/\\"Mid-Century Modern\\" style chateau all the principals converge on prior to their \\"face-off\\" grand finale on Mt Rushmore!  If such a house doesn't actually exist, well, it should!  I'm willing to cast my vote for NXNW as Hitchcock's greatest film,but I respect anyone who prefers \\"[[ASIN:B000I9YLXU Vertigo]]\\" or \\"[[ASIN:B000I9YLWG Psycho (1960)]]\\" or maybe even another.  No one's personal favorite is ever \\"wrong\\".<br /><br />HOWEVER--here, in this luxuriant 50th Anniversary blu-ray, we're privileged to enjoy what may prove to be the BEST restoration & presentation of this classic movie EVER.  The colors, picture and sound are all STUNNING and exceed the already high standard set by the previous DVD release of NXNW.  I see this as an absolute \\"demo quality\\" blu-ray disc, a tour-de-force of what the format can deliver to re-ignite our appreciation of these old movies through OBSESSIVELY fastidious restoration and renewal.  (Another knockout example of classic movie restoration that will scorch your eyeballs with its beauty: [[ASIN:B0076I6242 Pillow Talk (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy)]].)<br /><br />Blu ray EXTRAS abound here as well, including a fascinating documentary on the life & career of Cary Grant; obviously relevant and well worth viewer's time & interest.  The NXNW documentary hosted by Eva Marie is the same one provided on the original DVD, but it is likewise a worthy and a great bonus feature to enjoy after seeing the movie again.  My only gripe is that the sole commentary track, by writer Ernest Lehman, while certainly worthy of inclusion, isn't enough by itself.  A film of the stature of NXNW deserves one or more commentary tracks by some historians or directors who can offer insight into the historical context of the Cold War, Hitchcock's intentions/techniques, NXNW's influence on its times and later films, etc.  Stay tuned to see whether a 4K \\"Special Sixtieth Anniversary Edition\\" doesn't hit the Amazon pre-orders in 2019 to pick our pockets anew!<br /><br />Until such a re-release appears on the horizon, THIS 50th Anniversary Edition certainly remains the ABSOLUTE \\"Gold Standard\\" for seeing and re-discovering the excellence and fun of NXNW.  If you've never seen NXNW before, maybe watch a Netflix or Amazon download (or check out a DVD from your local library); established fans of NXNW however, MUST see this exquisite blu-ray reissue to be awed by just what the blu-ray format is capable of with a movie you THINK you've already fully experienced and appreciated.<br /><br />Finally: in a world overrun with movie kitsch and \\"Gone With The Wind\\" Barbies, and other assorted junk, there are only TWO movie props I would like to have for myself: FIRST (and most essential) the gold phone in the lobby of the Plaza Hotel Cary uses to call up to George Kaplan's room.  Second (and something I WOULD actually wear), how about one of the \\"red caps\\", the scarlet cabbie-style hats scurrying in herds in the Chicago train station where Cary & EMS disembark from the 20th Century.  WHERE can I find either (or both) of those for my personal \\"NXNW\\" appreciation shrine?but I respect anyone who prefers \\"[[ASIN:B000I9YLXU Vertigo]]\\" or \\"[[ASIN:B000I9YLWG Psycho (1960)]]\\" or maybe even another.

B005LAIIHG|4.0|I purchased this movie for the grand-kids. I usually watch a movie first to make sure they are age appropriate.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I was intrigued by the moving castle.  It wasn't as important to the plot as some other characteristics of the castle, such as doors which open to other places - depending on the orientation of the door knob, but still fun.  Characters as well-drawn and easy to relate to.  Overall, a satisfying read.
B00AG297GK|3.0|It's the same story about a bumbling foreigner stuck somewhere in the U.S., who discovers something about himself along the way. Pretty much the same movie as Borat and Brüno. Sacha Baron Cohen is really making his horrible foreign person accent pay off.<br /><br />That being said, it was enjoyable enough. There were more than enough laughs to keep most people interested. But if you're looking for a cinematic masterpiece, or a more serious movie, this isn't for you.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|William O'Brien has crafted an imaginative fairytale, reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland. On Peter's tenth birthday, a magic key will unlock a portal to other worlds and the adventure of a lifetime. The narrative is whimsical and enchanting, carrying the reader on a fascinating journey through the amazing worlds Mr. O'Brien has created. A entertaining and worthwhile read.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|A great read!!! I laughed throughout this entire book.  Every woman should read this book!!!  Enjoy and then  tell a friend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best game ever. I love minecraft. How can mojang make this game? However I just love it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was the kind of book you want to read all at I once because  you don't want to put it down.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Looks like the producers were trying to maybe start a new franchise (similar to Bond?) but they did not pull it off. It really doesnt add anything to the previous films and really just feels like a money grab.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Very interesting book.  Very educational read regarding the bible and his &#34;take&#34; on it opens up a different way of looking at it than most of us have been taught...and all you have to do is read what he writes about and know it true - the bible is a violent document.  Not sure I agree with everything but found most to be quite compelling.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|This movie does not need to exist and it was predictable and not very enjoyable to watch. Don't bother. Try something that isnt a sequel instead.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very addictive for me and my 3 year old. She is able to play all the mini games without help and she could play for hours.
B005HP2J66|5.0|If you are a fan of Werner Herzog, then do not hesitate to watch this film. Well shot and narrated as only Herzog can do it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|A fantastic read I'm not done yet but I will be in a few weeks. Then I will be ready for the others!
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Well acted...particularly Mr. McConaughey, but also the other great young actors. The story really draws you in...rent this one, you won't regret the choice.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|now i can keep up with the millions of sites i love. i love the whole internet, lol. i like how it gives a preview of the articles i want to read and sorts them by category and everything.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My family and I loved this movie, we had to take my 5 year old to the theatre to see the 2nd one the next day.<br />The truth is that I wanted to see the sequel as much as he did.
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|Slow at first, this film picks up and answers a lot of questions that the original Wizard of Oz brings up. James Franco is charming and Michelle Williams is good as well!
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|This was one of the best movies that I have seen with Kirsten Dunst.<br />It was an original action/romantic movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved this book. Was so cute. Makes u really think about Heaven. Just opens you mind more to what is out there.
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|It was a good movie, and seems to lead for a possible television series, that never happened, but could have been good.
0399226907|5.0|I purchased this for my grandson.<br />My kids loved this book when they were little, and this was one of my daughter wanted me to get for him.<br />He's just a baby no, but I'm sure he will have the book for a long time.<br />It is very well constructed and heavy duty.<br />Excellent quality.
B009AJD5E0|4.0|I liked this movie, it is not the same hide and scare movie as the other aliens movies, but I thought that it was an interesting prequel that provided a lot of insights. I wanted it to answer a few more questions at the end, but hey then there wouldn't be room for another one.
B000002O4X|5.0|My mother just loved her soundtrack!!!!! The soundtrack of the movie really sold the movie for her. Awesome ! Awesome!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app! The minions are so very cute! hard for me to dodge some stuff though. Still in love with the app!
B008XG1X18|2.0|App works fine for browsing only. Searches fine but every time I try to pin anything it crashes and restarts.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Worth watching. I especially liked how this movie tied in and clarified so much of the old movie. I will watch it again sometime.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft - Pocket Edition is a really great app that allows you to be creative!!! With every update comes more interesting ideas that spark creativity. Minecraft is fun for all ages but the creepers, skeletons, zombies, and spiders may scare young children so make sure you tone down the difficulty. Overall Minecraft - Pocket Edition is a great app.
1416987118|5.0|This book has it all - great story, great suspense, great illustration.  The only way to make it better is to view Michael Rosen reading the book on You Tube - hilarious fun!
140006922X|4.0|I found this to be a very interesting read. Aslan covers alot of information here and has an engaging writing style. I'm not particularly knowledgeable about Jesus' life or the Gospels so I can't comment on the accuracy of Aslan's arguments. However, he includes alot of information in the end notes so he appears to have done his homework. My only complaint is that there are no footnotes. For someone like me who is new to this topic I had trouble at times telling when Aslan was offering his interpretations or citing the work of others. If you are curious about Jesus the man then this should be at least an interesting read for you. There have been alot of negative reviews based on the author's Muslim faith. I don't see it anywhere in the book. The word \\"Islam\\" is not mentioned. Not once. This is clearly a book about Jesus.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|I like it to protect my kindle makes it easy to handle thinking about getting another one in a different color
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|This movie gave me goosebumps in some scenes. It makes me want to cover my feet when I go to bed at night. It's one of those movies I could watch over and over and still jump and get scared every time. A true classic horror at its best. It kept my interest the whole time. I loved it. Great actors and story. Yes I recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great, had me playing for hours and even getting other family members involved when I got lost or confused. This games is very addictive and I would recommend it to everyone.
B0055J7F40|5.0|Fantastic comedy performance by those 2 brits.  I would recomend it 2 antone who loves adult comedy. I wish u guys would offer Shaun of the dead.
0470901071|5.0|good book, the outhor use easy world to describe a complicate information. it is easy to understand. i love the book so much
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I like it very fun :) I play it everyday just is hard to play this game but it's a fun game! :)
B0001CNRBG|4.0|My wife loves this movie, mostly because she is a Jonny Mathis fan and enjoys that he is singing all through this movie.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Although considered old-fashioned, this book contains many important lessons for those seeking real happiness in today's\\"modern\\" world. That it is beautifully written is the icing on the cake.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the Weather Channel app. I viewed it many times each day and it gave me exactly what I needed, the weather. The new upgrade is terrible. The graphics are awful, I have to move to multiple screens for info, I can't have multiple locations, I can't have my pollen count. I don't want to earn points. I just want my old app back. I have unistalled Weather Channel and am trying Weatherbug.
B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|Well, I could have done without seeing the ginger kids uncircumcised penis, aside from that this was a pretty fun movie. Jason Sudeikis is one of these guys who just gets better and better with every film he does. I used to be a hater, but now I'll see anything that he's in, and We're The Millers is his best movie to date. This story is about a local drug dealer who gets in trouble with his supplier, and the only way out is to become a trafficker. Dave Clark (Sudeikis) decides the best way to do this is to recruit a fake family to make it look like they're just on vacation. Clark recruits his neighbor, a stripper, and a local homeless teen to be his fake family complete and the Millers are born. This film is non-stop laughs, as I said earlier Sudeikis was hilarious, but surprisingly so was Jennifer Aniston. There are a lot of knocks against her, especially when it comes to comedy, but whenever Rachel plays a fowl mouthed, raunchy character, I see her in a whole new light, and she was terrific in this film. Will Poulter is another stand out from the film, he's been acting since a very young age, but to my knowledge has never been in a comedy before. Here he plays a loveable geek that would easily fit in with the cast of the Big Bang Theory. Out of all the funny scenes and outrageous moments, it's Poulter's that made me laugh the hardest. Is this the best movie I've ever seen? Not even close, but it's one of those comedies that just keeps coming at you and never stops. While the story is a bit ridiculous, I promise you will still laugh until you're sides hurt, because We're The Millers is the best new comedy I've seen all year.
B0085G0DH6|5.0|This album reminds us of just how incredible these musicians were when playing together. The more I listen to it,the more convinced I am that this album places Jarrett's European group among the greatest jazz ensembles ever. Of course there will be other opinions, but I assure you that if you love Keith Jarrett (as I have for 40 years), you will love this album! Unfortunately they played together infrequently and for all to brief a period. But we can enjoy the brilliant interplay between these wonderful musicians. Thank you Keith, Jan, Palle, and Jon, and Manfred Eicher for pulling these tapes out of the vault, producing and releasing them. Keith Jarrett has many outstanding albums - this is one of his best.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Awesome set! Way better than expected for the price! The booklet inside is incredible and the movies on blu ray look like they were filmed yesterday! All it's Missing is Prometheus and the set will be complete! I don't consider the AVP movies part of the collection, but more of knockoffs.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|This is a great movie and the music is out of this world. I would recommend for everyone. Gerard, Emmy and cast are fantastic!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I'm a huge Iron Man fan.  When I saw this game I just had to have it. It is pretty fun when you get the hang of it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Notable attempt to deal with the life and times in which Jesus lived.  Brilliant example of how good scholarship can be written in interesting and dramatic ways.  I wish this book was available when I was in seminary.  It gives a vivid picture that which was only a shadow then.  And his analysis of Paul was exciting and thought provoking, to say the least!  All through my ministry I believed Paul was often a hindrance to a true understanding of Jesus and his mission.  What great and important discussions this scholarly book would have created!!!<br /><br />A must read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun &amp; challenging! Love the minions! I'm not sure how easy it would be for younger kids, but maybe I'm just<br /> old and not good at games anymore ;)
B002DEZXOE|5.0|it reminds me of those days as I lived then. With free love, the drugs, and a lot of hot music.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is awesome . I LOVE IT IT WAKES ME UP FOR SCHOOL AND WHEN I RUN IN THE MORNING:)
B008JFUPOY|4.0|I saw this in Theatres, Pixar has done well with the background imagery from Monsters U, its nice to see how Mike and Sulley became such good friends. I like the message it sends to kids to always learn and not to give up on something, when their first choice of college doesn't always work well or when something you wanted so badly falls through and your checking want-ads, it sends a message that even if the educational option you wanted falls through, there may still be options either within a community college or a company to be the best you can be at a Job or a Skill. *I don't know of any bonus features the bluray/dvd/digital copy might have.. its due to be released on oct 29th.**
B005LAII4E|3.0|Okay, I just want to say, this movie was freaking \\"badass\\" and I really mean that!  \\"Roadblock\\" (The Rock), \\"Commander Colton\\" (Bruce Willis), and \\"Snake Eyes\\" (whoever plans Snake Eyes) deliver the most action-packed film ever!<br /><br />The only downside I hated about this movie, is that Channing Tatum's character, Duke, is killed off at the very beginning, just like everyone else.  After surviving huge next-generation starships, master assassins, Rex (aka Cobra Commander), Destro, and nanomites, he is killed by a simple explosion, leaving all the work to his best pal to stop Cobra.  That was the biggest mistake in the film.  The very reason it has three stars!<br /><br />But despite Duke's death, the movie has turned out to be amazing film and a great sequel to the first G.I. Joe movie.  The Rock and Bruce Willis bring out great characters and do their best to save the world.  Along with pretty familiar characters and a good storyline, our heroes are back to deliver one awesome take down on Cobra!<br /><br />The first film will always be my favorite, but to those who say this movie sucked, it actually wasn't bad.  I mean, we have Snake Eyes back and The Rock taking the lead now.  Yes, Duke dies and Storm Shadow's story gets confusing, but the movie was pretty good.  The fight scenes were badass and the characters were amazing.  But as always, the first film was better and nothing will change that.<br /><br />I recommend this movie if you can handle the death of Duke and be preparing for a sequel.  ;)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game wish it didnt cost 20 coins to revive me on the kindle I wish it was only 5 like on the iphone
B0000AVF29|5.0|I owned an earlier cd version of this (One Way I think) and this repertoire remastered edition far exceeds it.  the sound quality is so incredible.  plus 6 mono bonus tracks, plus liner notes/poster.  you can't go wrong.  I do enjoy \\"winds of change\\" and \\"love is\\".  those two are my favorite animal releases.  I like the experimentation and chances they take.  \\"paint it black\\" is my favorite and a standard with eric.  \\"the black plague\\" and great, dark spoken word piece.  \\"hotel hell\\" with great trumpet and noir feel.  anyway I noticed there are several versions floating around and I highly recommend the repertoire version.  \\"winds of change\\" sounds equally fresh today as when it was released back in the 60s.  enjoy!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Not nearly as good as Kite Runner. The plot just hopped around too much and characters got muddied as I read.
034580709X|4.0|I was late in discovering Jo Nesbo's Inspector Hole series. I also started off with his most recent books in the series and have finally made my way to the newly republished \\"The Bat\\" the story that introduced Inspector Hole to the world.  I would not recommend that anyone read a series from new to old but, nonetheless I'm glad I pick this up.<br /><br />Set in Sydney, Australia, Hole travels from Norway to assist the Australia police investigate the murder of a modestly prominent and Norwegian celebrity.  Apart from an interesting digression into Aboriginal culture and history the plotting and developments are fairly straight-forward.  I'll leave details of the plot to others as with any detective story sometimes revealing too much of the plot just spoils the intrigue for other readers.  That said, the primary enjoyment I got from the book was seeing Hole \\"from the beginning\\".  As with most long-running series each volume builds upon the character development and `history' of the previous volumes.  By the time a series gets going a lot of details and developments are presumed to be known to the reader.  These sorts of gaps don't particularly bother me if each book is strong enough to stand on its own.  And these books do stand up.  However, I think my enjoyment and understanding of the books that followed are now enhanced by discovering how and where it all began.<br /><br />All-in-all this is a good mystery standing on its own. For those not familiar with Nesbo this is an excellent place to start, although I'd note that I think the books get better as they go along. For those who already know and like Nesbo and Inspector Hole I think it is good to complete the series!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I am enjoying this game. Some puzzles are super easy but are then followed by something far more tricky which is nicely challenging. I do not like it sticking in places though as I then get timed out and have to restart the whole chapter. Graphics lovely, like that you can zoom in. Music a suspicious copy of Harry Potter.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|I had listened to this on an audio book some years ago. After reading Bill Bryson's 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' I was reminded of how much I had enjoyed 'In a Sunburned Country' and wanted to listen to it again. Unfortunately, it seems to be very difficult to come by on audio book now. However, either way you get this book, it's always entertaining. Worth reading and hanging on to, to read again and again.
B005HCI72O|5.0|enjoyed the book the first time and almost ready to read it for a second time.  Jamie and Clair - you make me wonder about the past.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I like Ellen - I really do! But the style that makes her lovable on screen does not translate well to print. The book almost immediate reminded me of  a creative writing class exercise that involves writing down as quickly as you can, a random stream of consciousness. Valuable as an exercise and maybe even a good launching point for a book but her book seems to have stopped there. I held on for several chapters hoping it might evolve into something more substantial but it didn't and I lost interest. Ellen's a good person and has a spontaneous charm that works wonderfully face-to-face. I'm sure she has stories and thoughts that are well worth reading. My question is, where were her editors to help her put these in a 'reader-friendly' form?
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|Switching from 1968 to 1765 and back again.  Helwater and Ardsmuir.  Poor Jamie - he has endured so much, can't wait to re-read when he sees Claire again.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Of course I've been aware of Tina Fey. It's hard not to know about someone given this much exposure in public in social media, but I would have to say that I was not deep into her work. Not because I didn't like her, but because I'm more of an earlier SNL generation. However, I was looking for a good, light, comic read and thought that her book might be just the thing. She hit the target right on. My admiration for her skyrocketed through this book. Not only did she impress me as a comic genius but she came across as very intelligent, strong and down-to-earth. Exactly the kind of woman I would want any children of mine (male or female) to view as a role model. But don't get me wrong -- she's never preachy, always entertaining. Loved it!
B00881VLCE|1.0|This was my favorite app until the update.  The pieces are smaller and harder to control.  I liked it better when the puzzle used up the whole playing field.  Also this app crashes alot since it has updated.  Would not recommend it if you play with the most puzzle pieces allowed.  Wish I could get old version back.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|What a pleasant way to spend your time on a Saturday morning.  Very insightful and I lived across the block and wasn't even aware that history was being written!
B002XBVQKW|5.0|This is a movie for most ages. It truly is a classic. I love the music, story line and characters. My children ages 10 and 13 recently watched it with me and we all want to see it again. I recommend this movie.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|Love the characters, the story lines and the possibilities.  A little edgy, funny and always entertaining.  I recommend it.  Will be buying the other seasons.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Child reaches back in Reacher's military history to bring us this \\"earth-moving\\" story. As always, a good story told well!
B00AEFXZ1C|4.0|Like the story. It's an old fashioned life experience story that enchants and enlightens. Too bad we don't see many of these anymore.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I had forgotten how much I used to enjoy working on Jigsaw puzzles! This game is perfect for the Jigsaw enthusiast on the go. Portable and fun!
B00634GHJA|5.0|I got photo transfer app. from Amazon App Store which was free and it is great , I would highly recommend<br />it if your looking for that type of app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really fun game would really recommend it! I have become addicted playing multi player. Is fun too. Would be nice if there was a chat feature for it though
B00CISAPJS|5.0|Both of my kids really enjoyed it.  My daughter has watched it three times and will probably watch many more. She loves telling the story to us.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I'm not sure yet....I need more drops...I don't wanna pay for that...so I need y'all to change it....or something. So what we gone do about it...
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|the story line is extryamly interesting, super creapy in a fun kind of way, the chalenges are not to hard and fun to do. i was sad to see it end but now i can try to play it at a harder diffuculy!!!:)
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|This is a great movie and a poignant true story. It show the will power of the human spirit when confronted by seemingly unimagined obstacles. I highly recommend this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game so much! just wish I could get past vector! would regimens it to anyone age five and up!!!
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|The humor is off the wall, but it is very funny.  I recommend everyone give it a shot.  Two more words.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this game puzzles were not to hard but not overly simple either can't wait for number 2 I would recommend this game and most big fish games
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|Loved this movie. It's sad, but beautiful. It really brings you back to earth and reminds you to be thankful for the people you love.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Pretty boring with poor character development. You never really root for the good guys and the bad guys are so far disattached there is no pull one way or another.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|It is an excellent movie which has been enjoyed by everyone who has watched it. It was done very well.<br />.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Informative perspective on middle eastern life and family. Regardless of culture; values, loyalty, and respect should always be fthe foundation of family.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|have read all his books and was so happy to see a new one come out. Never missed one. Loved it.
B005JR47R6|5.0|I couldn't think of any other way to END completely... but I'm glad it happened the way it did. I think the writers have done rather well this time around. I'm still sad to see my House go.
B0037RDPEG|2.0|Likes: The idea of the book and the journey that the character (author) followed to arrive at a place that might be considered &#34;balanced&#34; or &#34;happy&#34;.<br /><br />Dislikes: The book is more about the authors thoughts - I didn't find this to be to my liking. The book went into too much detail about certain aspects that overloads the reader (for example; Hinduism, yoga, etc). This is my personal views; if this appeals to you, then you will probably enjoy it more than I did.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Just excellent.  Easy read.  More detail than other life after experiences I've read.  The author is a brain surgeon and knows brain possibilities.  He did not believe in God before his experience.  I've known we are all one for a long time, but this books makes my belief stronger.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I would tecemend this to anyone with kids or that likes temple run and likes despicable me and is a fun person

B003TSEEDY|3.0|A friend recommended it to me and it took a while to get into it, but it was not bad.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|seems ok so far. controls not really reading alot of the time but that may just be me. other then that seems fine
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game for college students and their friends to take a break from studying or just get together for a challenging time.
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|Predicable and boring.  I love the Batman (Nolan) franchise and hoped that this would be on par.. It's not.  Could have been good but it missed the mark by a lot.
B008M4MB8K|4.0|Descriptive text makes it seem as if you might be buying the super-duper special edition that comes in a replica of Deckard's briefcase.  It isn't, and that text seems lifted directly from the text for that edition or a catch-all release from the studio.  Still, I got it at a great price and it includes the elusive Theatrical Cut (still the best in my opinion.)  Even so, it's a nice package with four versions of the film (Theatrical, International Theatrical, Director's, and Final Cuts) and a smattering of concept art, stills, and storyboards included (not to mention the bonus materials on the third disc.)  Looks good on the shelf and a good buy for fans that aren't superfans.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Big fish games are always fun and enjoyable to play. Just wish that you did not have to pay to play the whole game.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|It's the Alien Anthology, man, what needs to be said?  Nicely packaged and looks good on the shelf or the coffee table.  Back of the sleeve has a slick print attached to it describing the thing, which peels off to reveal a pseudo-holographic Alien egg.  A reasonably priced addition if you don't already own it or a fancier version.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|It is a very entertaining game, I wasted hours and hours on this game and I still do from time to time.
B00574P9EQ|4.0|Great family movie. We all laughed.  We look forward to seeing more of this franchise of film.  Lots of fun.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|As an avid classic JRPG fan, Symphony of Eternity fills in a void that's missing in my game library. It has a solid storyline for a budget game. My only peeve is the short gameplay, I finished the game in under 8 hours, but theres still the extra dungeons after beating the final boss. After playing the sequel, Symphony of the Origin, I really want to know what happens to Kreis and company inbetween the events of Origin and Eternity.
B007R0WHMK|5.0|Quite a visually interesting movie it was so authentic looking I thought I could not only smell the dirt but I could smell the perfume. I did not expect it to turn out as it did but perhaps it was written that way. Usually I can figure out plots, I could not at all with this one.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|THE MOVIE REVEALED MANY OF THE INTENSE EMOTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMARINE WARFARE WHICH LEAVES NO MARGIN FOR ERROR.  OBSERVING THE USE OF &#34;ANCIENT&#34; TECHNOLOGY WAS ALSO AN INTERESTING ASPECT TO THIS EPIC.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story line is so crazy, I have to wonder if the author is just as crazy, ha!  Seriously, I was not impressed for the first 1/2 of the book, but exactly at the half-way point, that's where everything that you thought you were reading suddenly changes - completely!  This book is quite a ride!  Great book.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Movie soundtracks are supposed to match the movie they accompany. Tron: Legacy does this so well that the movie dons the soundtrack like a tailored suit. Really well done.
B00B23O96A|3.0|This album isn't Mr. Clapton's best work, but it showcases his flexibility in the range of songs he plays. After all, the worst EC album is still heads and shoulders above anyone else's best!
B000FCKC4C|1.0|So many raves over, well, nothing! Pretentious, unconvincing writing, a hodge-podge of religions and philosophies going nowhere, unrealistic, shallow personalities, void of moral standards. My 14-year old granddaughter was required to read and review, so I bought the book to read with her. A total waste. I hope her school promotes better literature, higher values and better thinking than this.
B000002GLV|5.0|Saw these guys play live back in '72. John Mayall has interpreted blues for decades and this album takes him a step further than expected. The synergy of these players is palpable.
B00076RT24|5.0|Trolls are gonna troll and haters are gonna hate,but star wars will always be good. Its not the best star wars,but its still a infinite out of ten movie,only other star wars films can beat it.

1609611543|5.0|I started to reduce wheat consumption several years ago as suggested by web guru Dr. Susan Lark and noted that some inflammation symptoms reduced or disappeared.  I got really more serious about it about two years ago and lost 20 pounds which I have kept off without &#34;dieting&#34;.  When I read Wheat Belly it really added some very useful knowledge that has increased my motivation to stay off the stuff they call wheat today.  It has also changed my taste buds and sense of smell.  I no longer like the aroma at either the bakery or the bread aisle.  My sugar cravings are virtually gone and so is the arthritis that was hurting me enough to wake me up at night.  This book confirmed Dr. Lark's suggestions and went way beyond them.  Now, so many people have become aware of the fact that we cannot rely on the FDA to protect us, that there are gluten-free menu items, products, stores, and even Italian restaurants advertising their gluten-free menu items.  It has become easier and easier for me to continue eating defensively.  The connection between the &#34;Standard American Diet&#34; (SAD) and the obesity epidemic can't be ignored.  This book is a wonderful motivator.  Best of luck to all readers; stick with it.<br /><br />From a woman who buys 6-8 instead of 10-12 (and sometimes beyond),<br /><br />sandychat
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If wanting to switch to digital avoiding buying dvds, buying off instant is a good way to go.  It showed just as clear on my phone as it did on my tv.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Not a fan of the back and forth alternating chapters, but that is the only way this book could be written - and read.  What a web of deceipt and planning existed in this book!  Language not the best at times, but otherwise a psychological thriller.
B000I9UA30|5.0|Easier access, given the age of the movie, the price was reasonable, and much better than  toting around a bunch of dvds and vhs
B0084AXZK0|5.0|It's Oscar Wilde - what else is there to say?  Vivid, graphic descriptions, very thought provoking.  Imagery is everything in this book.  A must-read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever<br />Good graphics would recommend this game for all ages.<br />My children love the game they play it all the time
0525952926|5.0|The first book in Ken Follett's trilogy, Fall of Giants, was a summer reading assignment for our book club.  Read the book in four days and immediately ordered Winter of the World.  Just started it and it also looks to be another great book.  Ordered the book new, and it arrived quickly and in pristine condition.  Can't wait for the third Century book to become available!
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller is great. I actually selected a used one and it came to me looking brand new, and I really like that the surface of the controller is a matte black. I like it better than the controller my PS3 came with, and I keep this one as mine and shall allow no one else to use it. Meh!
0525951652|5.0|Read the book in four days and found it completely absorbing.  Looking forward to reading the next installment, Winter of the World!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Good solid writing style. Lee Child has a knack for story telling and this story is a page turner. Fun summer read.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A short, easy read.  One of my favorites from Mitch Albom!  Makes you take stock of your life and the valuable time we squander.<br />Would definitely recommend.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Works as advertised. Very convenient and stays on my key ring. Very fast transfer rates in my opinion. couldn't ask for more at a price like this.

B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was so funny.  I wasn't sure if I would like a book written from the guy's perspective.  But when you have a character as funny, sexy, egotistical, and admittedly a douche, you can't help but love him. I laughed the whole way through.  The sex scenes were pretty steamy too. I can't wait for another book by Emma Chase.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|It's great to have a tv version off terminator it's a great movie I want to watch it with my son but the language is to strong but so far I love the story line
B001RMYWG8|4.0|I didn't see Serpico when it was first released.  I was a year out of high school and was doing other things with my time and money rather than going to a lot of movies.  But Al Pacino was a hot property in those days. The movies were replete with new themes, reflective of the times, (the end of the 1960's) and it was interesting to see the images from 40 years ago.<br />  I met Sidney Lumet, years later, on another movie set.  By then, I'd forgotten that he'd directed one of my earlier favorites, &#34;Fail Safe.&#34;  It generated quite a buzz in 1964.  Anyone wanting to understand the zeitgeist of the Cold War would do him or herself a favor by watching that movie.  Then ponder what a cultural distance was traveled between &#34;Fail Safe&#34; and Serpico.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I loved the city of glass so much. It had just enough action but a lot more romance than in the previous books. I can't wait to buy city of fallen angels to see what happens next.
B000OLROWC|5.0|I enjoyed introducing my 8-year-old to this movie. It's a great opportunity to talk about martial arts as a way to avoid violence, not perpetuate or escalate it. And the contrast between the two teachers also provides plenty of great&#34;teachable moment&#34; material. But hey, it's also just a really good movie.
B009GXHOW4|3.0|i like the free one but the pro version just spawns mobs and edits chest/furnaces i wouldn't buy that but if they made it 1cent then i would buy it
B004LWZWGA|5.0|While Christopher Nolan's series of Batman flicks could likely have gone on forever -- earning fistfuls of cash for its producers while forever cluttering shelves with an endless barrage of merchandise -- the director does what any visionary worth his salt would do: He returns to his franchise to put it to rest, effectively quitting while he's ahead. No doubt, Warner Bros. will re-team with DC in a not-too-distant future, inevitably re-booting the series yet again for a new audience and a new profit margin, but in the meantime Nolan's closing chapter, \\"The Dark Knight Rises,\\" provides satisfying closure to a series that has been as brief as it has been remarkable.<br /><br />Re-teaming with his screenwriter/brother Jonathan as well as mythology-maestro David S. Goyer, Nolan laces his final Bat saga with enough character torment, thinly-veiled political musings and crowd-pleasing, fist-pumping action to flood the Bat Cave. In the eight years since the events of \\"The Dark Knight,\\" Gotham City is a little safer, even if its protectors are a little bitter. Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) lives with a dirty little secret that stands between a peaceful city and total anarchy. Meanwhile, on the other side of the town and taking it harder than anyone else is Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), who limps around the shadows of his mansion while his alter-ego lays dormant. It's only when a mercenary hell-bent on bringing Gotham to its knees (isn't that always the case with these guys?) emerges that The Dark Knight snaps out of his funk and busts out some new gadgets to once again save his broken city from itself. This new threat to Gotham, known only as Bane (Tom Hardy), literally pushes Batman to his breaking point, leaving a rookie detective (Joseph Gordon Levitt) to defend his hero and manipulative jewel-thief Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) to claw away at whatever is left.<br /><br />While the film admittedly lacks the magnetism of Heath Ledger's performance of The Joker in the previous film, Tom Hardy's formidable Bane does his best to compensate. From the opening scene, Bane's presence is a force to be reckoned with and a far-cry from the hulking, dumb-as-a-brick, WWE-rejected (WWF in those days) mutant he was presented as in 1997's franchise-killing \\"Batman & Robin.\\" Hardy's physical presence as well as his deliciously creepy voice leave a similar impression to Ledger, lending credence to the school of thought that says Batman's villains are just as interesting as the title character himself. Hathaway's take on Catwoman is smart and sleek and true to form, if a bit underdeveloped. Thankfully her presence is a plus, providing a bit of sweetness to Bane's saltiness. Joseph Gordon Levitt, meanwhile, emerges as a new kind of hero who has Bruce Wayne pegged from the get-go and who insists on doing the right thing even as the world crumbles around him. Levitt, who himself has emerged as one of his generations greatest talents in recent years, is another asset to a film that threatens to be over-crowded but thankfully makes room for just about everyone. It's not surprising then that Michael Caine's Alfred and Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox are pushed into the background a bit.<br /><br />Not only is this the longest of Nolan's Bat flicks, it is also perhaps the most dense and ambitious of them all. With so many subplots and so much subtext to juggle, it's a wonder Nolan doesn't drop the ball. It's a testament to the director's vision, as well as that of his collaborators, that the film doesn't falter. Tension escalates from the opening frames and doesn't let up until the film's mind-blowing and thoroughly satisfying conclusion. In many ways, the film will leave you wanting more and more and that's what makes it work so well. While another reboot and perhaps a spinoff (or two) will likely be in order, the fact of the matter is that what Nolan set out to say and do has been effectively said and done by the time the credits roll. The Dark Knight truly rises above and beyond the average superhero fodder, and when all is said and done, Nolan's legacy will stand in limited company. All hype and heroics aside, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is a film that lives up to its own promise.y rises above and beyond the average superhero fodder, and when all is said and done, Nolan's legacy will stand in limited company.

B003KRJNBW|1.0|The movie is a good movie.  I easily give it 4 stars.  Good actor, good plot, good plot twist, great action.<br />Amazon's instant video service, however, sucks.  Half way through the movie the streaming speed dropped so much that the movie would not play; so I did not get to watch all of it.<br />The problem is NOT! with my system or my internet connection.  I am a computer professional and checked everything.  Netflix streamed with no problem.  Speed tests on my connection showed max speed  ...10 meg down, if you must know.<br />This is the second time I've tried to use this service and the first time had problems also.  I will not try again and will go elsewhere for my streaming video.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|First, I must say that I hate myself for not getting this book early and procrastinate for almost a year before I finally do it.  Secondly, I didn't read till a month later...  Once, I started reading and I must say that I fall in love with this novel.  The simple yet easy understanding makes me complete the book in less than 8 hours over a 3-day read.<br /><br />There are a lot of cheers and tears in this novel but these (cheers and tears) are great learning points that will benefit anyone who can read.  The notion of this book repeatedly tell us &#34;Be Kinder&#34; whenever necessary.  We know that we have to be kind but to be kinder is something &#34;new&#34;.  I love the precept of &#34;Given the choice of being RIGHT or KIND,  CHOOSE BEING KIND&#34;.  Wow, this is totally throw me off hook.  Since young (and Asian),  we are told to do the right things and not so much emphasis on the doing the kind actions.  This story humbles me greatly.<br /><br />We might not be receiving awards throughout our lifetime but the hero of the story, August, mentioned that we must at least had a ovation, at least once in our lives.  It might not be easy but we have to be ourselves to have this moment (big or small).<br /><br />The other part of the novel that I greatly love is that RJ Palacio also reflect the other characters' perspective on themselves and life/time with August.  I think this is great as in life, we must look things/situations in more than one angle.<br /><br />This book looks like a book about a boy with a deficiency and how he overcome the situations and won against all odds.  I mirror this to each of us in the real world,  it is also about world of cruelties and kindness that we experience in both fear and uncertainties.  At the end of each challenge, we might lose but we do win too.  For those situations that we didn't quite make it, we can do it again (if we can) differently and learn.  On those areas that we &#34;win&#34;,  we celebrate victories and share the moments humbly.<br /><br />Yes, i love this book and it has been quite some time that I had a good read.  I definitely recommend this book to my friends.  Great book, simple yet meaningful.he moments humbly.<br /><br />Yes, i love this book and it has been quite some time that I had a good read.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|lSo many of the puzzle or hidden object games here have poor production values or insultingly obvious solutions.  This game delivers us from these problems, with a thought-provoking backstory that explains the mystical design of the puzzles.  The challenges are designed like those wonderful 19th and early 20th Century mechanical automatons, with intricate and ornate designs that work logically in the real world, not just some dystopian fantasy world game designers came up with.  Two thumbs up, I'll happily pay for robust games like this.

B004DMIIVO|5.0|There are any number of other reviews to tell you about the plot and characters in this fine Fine FINE animation feature by Mamoru Hosada - who may well be the next Miyazaki-San... here's hoping that's true!<br /><br />What I will tell you is that few things EVER move me to 1) get teary and / or 2) watch the feature more than once immediately following the credits; well, there are onions hereabouts and I'm on the third time through and this \\"rental\\" copy doesn't even have director or performer commentary [if there is such a thing @ English language] so...<br /><br />This is quite a rare thing in ANY film medium & it is HIGHLY recommended; purchase, rental, streaming... this one is worth it.<br /><br />ps - like Miyazaki's works this one is safe for all ages, even though it does have a scary moment or two, it also contains multiple positive life lessons that are rarely found in any medium so mark this one as \\"for family\\" even if they claim not to like anime... people need to get over that anyway, don'tcha think...

Again, didnt know what to expect but my perception changed and have become a real fan of Katy Perry!
B000VK99Z6|5.0|This is my favorite of the Write/Pegg/Frost movies so far. While Shaun of the Dead has more comedy, this has a tighter plot with more humanity and significantly better referential treatment to other movies. Angel as the straight man is also a welcome change for Pegg.

B008JFUO4U|5.0|I almost didn't buy this because I didn't want to buy the line, \\"it's got to be good because Tom cruise did this\\". But you know what, \\"Tom cruise only does A movies and he pours his soul into everything he does\\".  I'm glad I purchased this movie and in blu ray, it's worthy of the blu ray treatment and it merits being in my collection.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Strong actors (I don't just mean Tom but, Morgan Freeman, Andrea Riseborough, Olga Kurylenko, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Memissa Leo -- they were all fantastic actors in this)<br />-Strong characters<br />-Storyline that keeps giving<br />-Cool concept<br />-It's got Tom cruise (I'm one of those people that don't want to like Tom just because every second of his real-life life is examined under a microscope and marketed to the ends of the world...in end I do like the actor....he's a talented hardworking actor and deserves the A listing)  This movie brought me back to respecting the actor.<br />-Good character development (even the minor characters have a depth to them like Nikolaj Coster-Waldau who only gets a few minutes on camera but wow does he make the best of them! And Victoria, wow, she and Tom have to carry a good third of the movie alone and together so she does a tremendous job here -- best supporting comes to mind.)<br /><br />CONS<br />None<br /><br />No spoilers here.  You really have to watch the movie. The aliens invade, we push them back, Tom cruise is some kind of drone repair guy.<br /><br />Are there unanswered questions in the Movie?....yes most certainly but the movie is very good at helping you suspend disbelief with its strong visual portrayal, sound, strong acting.  To me two phrases are very important in sci fi: rational acting and plausible reality ---<br /><br />- Are the actors doing rational things in the movie?  YES (If you're ask yourself during a movie, \\"why did he do that? that's dumb! Then the actors are not acting rationally)<br /><br />- Is the story plausible?  YES (it's science fiction but yes it's plausible and yes you have to suspend disbelief just a bit)<br /><br />Some have compared this movie to Prometheus, a science fiction \\"mess of a movie\\" and it takes a lot for a guy like me to hang such a label on a movie....in Prometheus the actors are not doing rational things and the story is not really plausible (it makes no sense, the plot is not rational).  So it is categorically unfair to compare these two movies simply because both of their opening sequences are \\"pretty\\" in the visual sense.<br /><br />Oblivion's actors by contrast are strong rational, a tight story & plot that keeps giving (and the story is plausible), that is a huge difference --- couple that with Tom Cruise and the Cast's strong acting & beautiful filming and you have quite literally a masterpiece of science fiction.<br /><br />One final thing, some people critique that they figured it out pretty fast but I sincerely don't think the movie is meant to keep anything secret from the audience, a la sixth sense, I think it's a journey of discovery for Tom Cruise's character.  He's the one figuring things out.  We, the audience, are just along for the ride.tion but yes it's plausible and yes you have to suspend disbelief just a bit)<br /><br />Some have compared this movie to Prometheus, a science fiction \\"mess of a movie\\" and it takes a lot for a guy like me to hang such a label on a movie....in Prometheus the actors are not doing rational things and the story is not really plausible (it makes no sense, the plot is not rational).

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am normally not a fan of this genre, but ran out of interesting shows to watch while walking on the treadmill. This kept coming up as a suggestion from Netflix so I decided to give it a try. I am several episodes into season 3 and I absolutely love this show. There have been times where I have had to look away, but it is one of the best shows that I have ever seen. The characters are so well-written and well-played but I have quickly learned not to get too attached because you never know who won't be around for the next episode.
1452000247|5.0|I received a copy of this book for honest review. 'Peter: A Darkened Fairytale' is the story of a young boy on his tenth birthday who is transported into a mysterious realm of strange creatures and goes off on an enchanting yet perilous adventure.<br /><br />This book hits the right note straight from the start, awakening a sense of wonder as Peter begins his journey and catching the reader unawares with some terrifying moments along the way.  I very much enjoyed my immersion in this strange, dark fairy-tale world and was surprised by just how engaging the story was.<br /><br />Although this is suitable for children, it is well written and captivating enough to hold the attention of adults.  There is also a chapter on poetry after the story ends. I will admit I don't read poems in general so I don't have much of an opinion on them but I think they would make good bedtime reading to children.<br /><br />Overall this is an enchanting read with some excellent dark fantasy material in there.  I highly recommend this book as a fantastic, captivating fantasy story suitable for all ages.

B001LMAK88|5.0|Love Westerns, and this is one of my favorite.  Fun to see Kevin Costner in one of his earlier roles.  This might have been his &#34;break-out&#34; role, as far as I know.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I have just purchased a Kindle Fire and have been adding apps to customize  &amp; make it more useful to me.  The alarm clock is just the latest addition and it is right on time.

B00B7Y0206|3.0|I got this app and it is really good, but just today I got on it and I clicked on a video . Then I heard the last video I watched play. I clicked on other videos and it kept not showing anything on the screen and playing the last video. It is very frustrating! So I decided to uninstall it and then download again. I really hope it works. If it doesn't then it better be fixed.
B005JTAP4S|4.0|I admit I'm not a huge fan of Peter Pan but I do love fairytale retellings! I was pleasantly surprised in this one! I loved it! O'Brien completely pulled me in and left me wanting more! Brilliant brilliant storytelling! He made me fall in love with Peter and his magical world! The poems at the end were an added bonus! Absolutely wonderful!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Though I don't think this book is for everyone, the inner personality of the small British town was an an interesting read.
0399159347|3.0|Does Ms. Moriarty own stock in Tupperware?  Did Tupperware pay for product placement in her novel?  Seriously, it seemed the word Tupperware was on every other page, sometimes twice on a page.  BTW, is Tupperware still a thing?  Hasn't Pampered Chef made its way to Australia yet?
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Amazing story!!! It's incredible the things people can survive and overcome! Truly a great read and absolutely worth the purchase!
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|This app is okay but I've noticed many words that should be listed aren't.  Also, is you want to use it for searching, as in looking for a word while playing Words With Friends, it's limited by not allowing you to see a page at a time but rather having to type each letter combination.  Otherwise, it's OKAY.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|It is not action-packed as the trailers would have you believe and it may be all visual candy with little substance much like Tron: Legacy, but I, nevertheless, found the movie to be a good science fiction movie and would recommend it to sci-fi aficionados.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|Humm, probably would not purchase this again.  Will continue to use it but prefer something more challenging.  Good refresher though.
0756407915|4.0|The \\"name of the wind\\" left me awestruck and begging for more, so when I got my hands on \\"A wise man's fear\\" I read it in two days (sleep is 4 suckers).  I enjoyed  the storytelling on this second day of adventures,  but it did little to answer the many questions I was left with at the end of the first book. We learn a lot more about what makes our hero tick but the major mysteries of the first book are surprisingly left unexplored. I don't see how all will be revealed n the 3rd book, but I am patiently awaiting.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Previewed it several times.  Have since listened to it on three continents and always puts me in a good mood.
B003PJ6UHA|3.0|His poor writing gets a bit in the way of his ideas, but this book does much to further the vision and acceptance of a monumentally new (and old) paradigm.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Unlike candy crush, I can play this any time I want to without waiting for any one to give me life. ..awesome game!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Auggie's handling of his new situation is 'Au-some.' He teaches a lesson in perseverance.  I liked the book's organization, too, going from one character's head to another and viewing the decisions each character makes by knowing what is going on in their lives.  It makes the point that we don't always know why somebody does what they do, and sometimes they do realize that maybe they handled a situation incorrectly.  But mistakes don't always have to be permanent.  I wasn't sure I would like this book, but I ended up loving it.
B009R54MGW|5.0|As always Philippa Gregory takes a piece of history and through her vast imagination takes us into a world of &#34;knights&#34; and &#34;Ladies&#34; , &#34;kings' and &#34;queens&#34; and all the ups and downs of being royal in this era.. Just love it!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Many of my friends are Downton Abbey viewers.<br />They all rave about this series.  I had to see what all the fuss was about.  So glad I did.  This is fabulous!  My husband & I are hooked on Downton Abbey.  The loves & dislikes, the intrigue & manipulation of the family & servants.  Not to mention the incredible clothing.<br />I must find out how to get  season 3 before January's season begins.
B0084FMA56|4.0|I ordered these to replace my Columbia Riptide sandals that are showing signs of age after five years of use. I tried Columbia sandals first but they weren't as good as they used to be. As a result I gave the Tevas a chance and these are great.  The sole and base of the sandal are nice and comfy. There's a little arch support which is great for people with feet like mine. I have only worn it in the city but will take it on a hike soon.<br /><br />Only downside: the left and right sandals are slightly uneven with one sandal being slightly smaller than the other. This doesn't bother me much but could someone else.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Another great Nicholas sparks book! His writing is captivating! Love the unique story line and the characters who I can picture with his descriptions!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am grateful that the movie didn't stray from the book. Each moment I knew what it looked like. It was also great to be in the mind and behind the eyes of katniss.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic book. This read has had an impact on my life that I can't find the words to express.  I am eternally grateful to Father God for the man, the story, the author, and the impact. PLEASE READ THIS ONE!! Give it to a special man in your life, it's a small cost for a huge investment that will yield dividends for a lifetime.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the authentic period costumes, love the depth of even the smallest bit characters, love the gorgeous sets, wonderful, well-written scripts, lush production -- all around lovely experience.  Can't wait for Season 4!
B008LY9AWG|3.0|It's ok for a quick plane ride but it definitely lacks the depth a tension that Connelly usually develops over the length of a full novel (obviously).
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very entertaining. I have fun for hours. I highly recommend this app.<br />Download it now. Worth your time. I promise.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I use this app on my cellphone and it is faster than my friend's phones... so I decided to give it a try on my old Kindle fire and it worth it! Now runs like brandnew :-)
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game too.  You have to concentrate on the next move you will make in order to be the winner
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Since reading the Hunger Games last year, I have been on a search for good Dystopian fiction. Look no further, because Wool will satiate! I was anxious, hopeful, and now sad that its over, but so incredibly satisfied.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie was not what I thought and that is why it took me so long to rent it. It had some really funny and light parts. I had thought it was all really serious because of all the controversy about it. I loved this movie!
B009JK4TK4|5.0|Love this remix, I wish they would make more remixes of there songs though... I think they only have 2 remixes! Please make more!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I really do love this. It's the only one I've had, but I don't regret it at all.  Its very versatile.
B007EG9GQM|5.0|Amazing Album!! Can't wait until they release there next album! Great job One Direction, can't wait! Love how all the songs on here are not available on any other cd! Now I have some that I have never heard before!
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|I haven't played it much yet, but I really like it so far.  Only time will tell if I start to love it.
B008035H16|4.0|I didn't realise this was a comic style book but the core message was the same.  A quick and inspiring read.
B00DDZM0GQ|1.0|Apparently I don't own this app so now it won't work? It'd installed on muy phone. How do I not &quot;own&quot;it? How can this bre fixed?
B007OWRBJK|3.0|This is a book where Pete Townsend defines stupid in his personal life: continually doing the same thing and expecting a different result. After some time in the book it become frustrating.<br /><br />He's clearly a genius in music and, like so many others, socially struggles with the normalcy of life.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The book was a sensitive tale of one young girl's journey. Learning about the language of flowers - a real language in the 19th century was fascination- well written
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I love DA. It is the perfect mix of fictional history, family and love. Can't wait for season 4!
B001RP1G0U|1.0|No plot, poor acting, was very disappointed because the actors could have done much better.  Really, driving around all night looking for condoms on their first date is a quality script?
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great product and would buy again if needed.This company will always be a favorite of mine and will always make quality products.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was unsure of this book when I started it but got hooked quickly. Although its about children, it has adult themes of good vs evil. It applies politics and family concepts in various ways that keep it interesting while behind the playings (or not) of gifted children. I was surprised at some of my emotions while reading toward the end regarding the war but was satisfied in the wrap up.  What a great summer read & ride.
B004ELSDZK|3.0|This game was kind of fun at first. Though I found myself a bit confused at how to play in the beginning. This game is challenging and does make you think before reacting, but I found myself bored of this game pretty fast.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|More fun than any screed about immigration has any right to be, Elysium is a solid bone-shattering body part scattering action movie. It deals with immigration in an interesting fashion, the salient point being that separating the wealthy from the poor with several kilometers of outer space will not stop the influx of immigrants. Nothing would stop the have nots from wanting a better life, so any argument about the legality of immigration is pointless. What makes Elysium fun are the little details and the awesome screen-devouring presence of Sharlto Copley as Kruger. Sporting a thick Afrikaans accent and a riot of armaments, Kruger appears as likely to murder the audience as those on screen with him. Despite having a military ship and his own private army, he spends his days wearing a cloth sack and rooting through garbage for food. And when activated, he goes from hobo mode to shooting down spaceships in low Earth orbit on a moment's notice. Just fantastic.<br />There are political points to be made, but Blomkamp understands that an action movie is fun first and foremost.
B00AK57N00|5.0|This game has very simply graphics, but can be very fun and challenging. Swinging from one platform to another of various sizes, through various wind speeds, makes me feel like I am challenging my brain to think about the physics behind it all. Game play and controls are simple. Graphics are decent, anything more may be too distracting.
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|I recently submitted a reference to the movie, It's Complicated. I got mixed up between that movie and this one. This movie is more like our lifestyle than the other one. It was very funny and inspired us to bring back more romance into our lives. I would highly recommend it to the baby boomers out there. C.Anderson P,S, We also liked the other movie I mentioned, and would recommend it as well. C. Anderson
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This Chromecast device works as advertised. The video streaming and the tab mirroring both work well. Only a few issues I should mention. My Sony Bravia HDTV cannot be turned on from off using this device (I believe I saw this feature on a YouTube video). The tabbed mirror browsing was smooth only after I changed the settings to stream at 480p. Lastly, Play Music only works to stream music to the tv if the songs were downloaded from the Play Music store, side loaded songs will not play.
B002BI6SMI|1.0|If you like wooden acting, cliched writing, flat-out stupid plotting, then have I got a movie for you. The best part of this movie was the key grip. He did a tremendous job and should be given top billing. Bad, badness squared.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|After seeing Science Seed, The Wrath of Khan is the best sequel. Ricardo Montalban plays the perfect role of a vindictive character in Khan's reprising role. The action is believable, the story well-told, and the characters, memorable. They might even feel like part of the family.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My sons William and Mason, aged 4 and 3, loved this movie!! They watched it over and over again. William says his favorite part was \\"all of it\\" and Mason was entranced by the Gruffalo. William said he would also recommend it to his friends.
B00E9PMMX0|3.0|Seriously, Disney should give us what we really want on Blu ray. I Hope Disney will never be like George Lucas.
B00BKRON5K|3.0|The jury is still out on this one.  We will see if this diet is any easier or successful as the others.  I found a lot of the writing to be self serving.  No need to read all that.
B00E0ZEDI6|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase the Acoustic EP after already owning The Midsummer Station. I wondered how much could be improved upon, but as a devoted Owl City fan I should have known better. Though only a few tracks are included in this album, Adam Young transformed Good Time, Shooting Star and Gold into softer, quieter tunes. His unique modifications to these songs (makes sense as it is supposed to be an acoustic version) still make the heart smile. It's hard to believe those 3 songs could get any better, but they are! Plus, it's nice to hear some new songs included (Hey Anna and I Hope you Think of Me). Am I biased? Yes, Adam Young's Owl City is my favorite band and believe it or not, I am a 31 year old father of 3 little girls. I have always enjoyed his work since I heard Fireflies, but dancing to his songs with my girls is icing on the cake. So, check it out for yourself and I think you will find yourself smiling and laughing a bit more.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I must say i really enjoyed this show. The story line is full of suprises. The people are complex and show that they are more than what they seem.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|What can I say, this bag has pockets I still haven't used in 2 months.  It's amazing and has a place for everything that you need to carry.  I use it for work and traveled with 2 laptops with ease.  While the bag did get heavy after a while it never felt out of balance.  It's stylish and very functional.  I saw numerous other travelers with the same bag, so it's clearly a great choice.  If you have to travel with multiple laptops, this is the backpack for you!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved it!! Can't wait for up coming episodes. Keep them coming.<br />I am hooked.<br />I am obsessed !  Love the caricatures
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Never got to see these shows when they originally aired or during syndication. As a recently converted trekie, I was delighted to see Amazon carry the first three seasons of this show. Thank you Amazon.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|ACTUALLY, YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE TO EVEN BE A CAT LOVER, BUT IT DOES ALLOW YOU TO IDENTIFY WITH A LOT OF THE DETAILS IN THE BOOK.  I HAVE ORANGE, PART PERSIAN CAT, NAMED CASEY, WHO IS ABSOLUTELY PRECIOUS - WAS A FERAL CAT THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE, BUT WOULDN'T GIVE HIM UP NOW FOR ANYTHING.
B009EEWZGU|5.0|If you love music. If you love inspiration. If you love the fantastic creativity of Rogers and Hammerstein,<br />then you'll no doubt love this production.<br /><br />In a world of marginal &#34;okay&#34; movies, and &#34;well, I guess it was alright&#34; movies, this landmark creation stands<br />at the top of the pyramid.<br /><br />Simply magnificent!<br /><br />Buy it!  You'll feel better about life and the promise for a better tomorrow during each viewing!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|easy to control fun to play. buying upgrades does slow down game play because buttons are hard to press. shamans rule Hebe just adding words to get to minimum. so how is every one doing
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So, the Google Chromecast just came out last week, and I got mine a couple of days ago, and let me just say, it's awesomely epic. It's a $35 device the size of a thumb drive, that you plug into your HDMI port of your TV to let you stream video and audio to your entertainment system. Here's some of the awesome things about it. 1-When you buy it for $35, it gives you 3 free months of Netflix Instant, even if you're already a customer, therefore $24 you were already going to spend you pay at one time, therefore the end price is only ($35-$24=) $11 for the device. 2-On your iPhone (or other smart phones) when playing a YouTube/Netflix video, a new button appears that says stream to MyTV, when pressed, that happens. It just starts playing the video on your TV and you can adjust volume and press pause, fast-fwd, etc, from your phone. 3-Anyone on your same WiFi network can do this. So if guests are over and want to show you a funny video, they can just stream it to your TV instead of everyone huddling over their small cracked iPhone screen. 4-Anything you have on Google Chrome on your computer, you can stream to the TV. So say, you have a website that you always go to watch old episodes of Friends, but it's not really a legit site that would work with Google. Or if it's a specific TV network's site that uses its own video streaming service... If it plays in the browser, you can play it on your TV, and full-screen it, no problem! It works perfectly. 5-Small videos, large videos, resolution is HD so there's no problems there. 6-This works as good as Apple TV in my mind, but instead of the feature of sharing your iPhone screen, you can share your Google Chrome tabs, which I think is better, for the most part. 7-It's always on, so I don't have to do anything except turn on my TV and switch to that input (no waiting for it to boot up and going to the specific program you want to stream from) and then the video plays. So end result, it's great. I'm very happy with my purchase.
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|Since monument, that first LP released in 2007, Scale The Summit keeps demonstrating why they are one of the top bands in the prog metal scene. This album is insane!<br />The band doesn't stop growing in technique, harmony, taste,etc.<br />They are getting older, wiser and with that they are putting out bigger and better albums!!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I just unistalled The Weather Channel.  Too busy and not as easy to use.  Too bad....new is not always better.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Cheerful songs. Great voice! Wonderful group. Loved it, would buy all there music;) Bruno Mars is one of the best entertainers today.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|As with his other books he keeps you guessing throughout the book and could not guess the ending till the ending
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is the most amazing book I've ever read! It is a wonderful yet sad book about one family and their life. I can't name a better book
1451695195|5.0|I lost my husband 11 months ago, we would have been married 50 years this month.  This is just what I needed, I know he will be waiting for me when pass.

B003M70O5O|5.0|I loved everything about this show.  I saw the first episode and was immediately hooked.  The cast is phenomenal and the plot is as well!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Well it is ok and it is a fun entertaining game but not perfect but I would get it just a new version of temple run
B000FC0V3E|5.0|It came from a time when writing was about the story and not the special  effects just a simple story and that is all is needed. Great book
B000002H4C|5.0|I wanted the CD for one song, however, I became a heavy metal music fan after listening to the other songs.  Well arranged.  Loved the lyrics.  Now, I want to buy the movie.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Didn't give me the same options as the version on the computer,  and that is what I wanted in the first place.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love it.  The caring of each neighbor for each other's needs.  The snobbery of the wealthier.  It's not that far off from every day life yet.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|It s the best blu-ray I ever bought, thank you Amazon! Keep up the good work!<br />I reccomend this product to all Alien fans.
B0047SHEAK|3.0|I enjoyed this, but I have liked all these movies for what they are; violent action filled etc...  If you are looking for something cerebral then this is not your movie, if you want something exciting and violent then this is it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Jodi Picoult! She's a fabulous writer and I am never disappointed after reading one of her books. She has a way of sucking you into the book and you will be up all night just because you want to read 'just one more chapter'. Love this book! I recommend it to everyone!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|also, even if you sideload candycrush on the kindle, you are only limited to the first episode.  you have to have google play store in order to advance, which amazon also banned.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Book was good quick easy reading, kept you wondering about who murdered the sister and if they would be caught.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun. It is also very addicting. I am so glad they made a game for Dispicable Me one of my favorite movies!!!(:
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Enjoy playing Diamond Dash.  Not interested in competing against another person and wish game would continue without always needing to add another feature.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I love Jeffery Archer books. He's the best !!! I've read all his books and he just keeps getting better.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|Was just trying to get started on using my new Kindle, so just used it to figure out how to load a game.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I play it everyday but there is a lot of glitches. LIKE A LOT. I like the computer version! Okay? OKAY!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Being an avid Stephen King fan, I loved this short story written by the Master and his son.  In typical King fashion, it has mystery and suspense, mixed with cringe worthy gore.  It makes your skin crawl.  The book also leaves you wanting more as so many of King's books do.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved it.  Was surprised at one part (which I won't reveal) but it did make sense as you get there.  I figured out part of it and started feeling sad before I got there and still I read on.  Mr. Sparks is a gifted writer and I have thoroughly enjoyed all of his books.  They are all so well written, so descriptive, and touching.  The stories are all of the caliber that keeps you turning the page, eager to find out what happens next, yet hesitant because it may or may not end like you want them too.  And all the while reading, you fall in love with the characters and even grow to hate some too.  The love described in each of these books, this one included, is the kind of love we all want to find.  The book draws you into the lives of the characters and makes you feel what they feel, even if just briefly, through the words.  HIGHLY recommend any of Mr Sparks' work.
B00E8KLWB4|1.0|Does cost money if you have no patience, like me.  Also REALLY wish the zoom was better.  On a small screen some items are extremely difficult to find. That said, fun, quests, ho, puzzles, the gamut keeps you intrigued.  HOWEVER.  After playing since last summer, it crashed, reset itself, wiped everything.  I filed a service request and it took them literal weeks to even assign it.  Then several days for the tech to send me a cookie cutter response.  They never fixed anything, and it showed waiting for my response even after my response.  I deleted all my G5 games.  After spending a good amount of money to make the game playable, their lack of concern or support is disgusting.
B007N8RULO|5.0|So much better than the regular solitare game.Look forward to playing it over and over.Try it you will love it.
B00E1LT41K|4.0|One night early there was a preview showing of this new series from the Brits. It looks promising if a bit unorthodox in its approach to history and slips in the settings and costumes. The series is based on Philippa Gregory's novel, `The Cousins' War' and roughly the story line promises to follow these lines:  Set against the backdrop of the Wars of the Roses, the series is the story of the women caught up in the long-drawn-out conflict for the throne of England. It starts in 1464--the nation has been at war for nine years fighting over who is the rightful King of England, as two sides of the same family, the House of York and the House of Lancaster, are in violent conflict over the throne. The story focuses on three women in their quest for power, as they manipulate behind the scenes of history--Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort and Anne Neville.<br /><br />In the first episode we don't see much more than King Edward's bedding and wedding of Elizabeth, a lot of bickering, some fighting, and some castle intrigue. Rebecca Ferguson plays Queen Elizabeth, Amanda Hale plays Lady Margaret Beaufort, Faye Marsay is Anne Neville, and the remarkable actors are Janet McTeer as Jacquetta Woodville (Elizabeth's magical mum) and Max Irons (handsome son of Jeremy Irons) as King Edward. James Frain is an unusually grumpy and sour Lord Warwick and Caroline Goodall is splendid as the evil Duchess Cicely. It is difficult to tell from an isolated episode, but the series has enough interest in the poorly understood realm of the War of the Roses for American audience that it will probably have staying power. Stay tuned...Grady Harp, August 13

B008X9Z4I8|3.0|Only holds kindle. I would have liked just a tiny more space to hold the stylist and small pad I use for cleaning screen
0345495004|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  We are doing it for book club.  I wasn't prepared for the ending but life is not always and they lived happily ever after.
0307279189|5.0|This was a fascinating book that made me want to go for a run every time I read a little bit of it.  It's very inspirational by making the reader realize just how far the human body can go with the right will power. It's written in a similar style as The Wild Trees and The Lost City of Z. If you read and enjoyed either of those books, you'll like this one. I followed it up with Barefoot Running, which is more of a how to book and have been running in minimalist shoes since.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy playing solitaire with the new quirks this edition has added.  The different styles are great to choose so you don't have to play the same one all the time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|At first I thought this would be a little kiddie game, but turns out to be very enjoyable! Would definitely recommend this game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game and totally worth getting.I was really impressed at the graphics and how you feel like you are in the game.I am really happy I got this game.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This book was everything I expected from the  author.  Always keeping you on the edge of your seat. I am never disappointed in one of his books.  Look forward to reading a lot more of his work.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|for the first time I find myself disappointed with a Reacher novel.the whole plot was just too laboured and just boring.
B00634GHJA|2.0|It's boring,non stimulating and compared to others, leave something to be desired.  /there are other pics out there that could be utilized to stimulate the reader.
B00966TN1Q|5.0|Again a great novel by Michael Connelly. if you're a fan, just buy it right now.<br />Harry Bosch is one of my my favorite crime fighters. A multi dimensional character, with great integrity and a great taste in music;-). Looking forward to his next adventure!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book i couldn put it down when i started. i love this book i recommend this to all my friends. the second book is great too! but the books are wayy better than the movie.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I am a great fan of Lee Child, This one was done by the numbers, it's OK but not so great.  I'm looking forward to his next book, I hope it matches his earlier work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Some people think that I am too old to play this game but I think that it is awesome for all ages. I can't believe that it was FREE. Every one should play this game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is sad and wonderful and full of feelings. I loved it! I definitely suggest for everyone to read it!
B007THA4FI|4.0|I have read A Casual Vacancy at least 4 times.  Each time I have found something new to be amazed by, something new to be touched by, something new to learn from.  It is certainly more Dickens than Wodehouse, a serious work of fiction about social inequality and cruelty and the results of that cruelty.  Rowling is an acute observer of human behavior, and her criticisms are right on the money. The more comical aspects of the story are rather tart; I can see why people missed the dry humor.<br />A Casual Vacancy is not for the faint of heart, and not for those looking for light, uplifting reading.  If you are looking for thoughtful, truthful reading that doesn't pull any punches, I highly recommend it.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I didn't like this book<br />Writing was not my style.  Props to Emma for being able to keep writing from a 5 year olds perspective.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a great game to play . It is also kid appropriate.  This game was basically made for kids. Totally cool dude!
1423107233|5.0|This is the second book I bought for my daughter in this series.  She hopes to one day become an animator for Disney, and these books serve as a constant inspiration to her.  The books are well designed, sturdy and the photos absolutely beautiful. A  must-have for any Disney fan. You won't be disappointed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely Loveeee pinterest.<br />I loved using it on the computer. before but having it on a kindle fire where it is mobile I so nice and handy!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very entertaining, daughter was very entertained anyway! Very similar  to temple run but with another element. Maybe not such a good role model for kids to run on train tracks though!
1490313370|4.0|Choose Yourself! is not for everyone. This book is not for people who have no desire to assume responsibility for their lives. This book is also not for people who are easily offended by perceived `political incorrectness'.<br /><br />Reading Choose Yourself!, I saw similarities to the book The Rhythm of Life by Matthew Kelly. Both authors recognize the need for balance between the four aspects of a person, physical, emotional, mental/intellectual and spiritual. Likewise, both books are about personal growth. While Matthew Kelly calls it, \\"becoming the best version of yourself,\\" James Altucher calls it, \\"seeing how far your potential truly can unravel, simply because you are human.\\" In essence, both authors advocate finding and pursuing your passion.<br /><br />There are distinct differences between the two books. Choose Yourself! seems to approach the topic of personal growth as a need to survive. The paradigm of big organizations employing a person for life and compensating above the general market has been crumbling for the past 30 years. The latest financial `crisis' has simply accelerated the process. In order for people to survive and thrive, they must Choose Themselves to create financial liberty as an entrepreneur. To that end, Altucher offers ideas based on his own experiences and observations. In contrast, Matthew Kelly approaches personal growth from the perspective of Christian faith as a deep religious response to fulfilling the purpose for which God creates each person.<br /><br />Neither perspective is wrong or more right. Altucher and Kelly simply take different approaches to arrive at the conclusion that balance and personal happiness are achieved by striving for personal growth through self-respect, respect for others and finding/pursuing one's passion.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|Fun point and click game. Cheap entertainment.  Interesting to look at. What more could you want for a couple bucks.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun. I also downloaded the other versions. Great puzzle game for an hour or two. Wish there were more levels.
B005HED11Y|4.0|I remember watching these as a teenager and I still love them. Many of the special effects and sound effects are comical by todays standards. Live long and prosper!
0439813786|5.0|The pictures told the story perfectly,and there was a meaning to the story though somewhat sad.  My granddaughter liked it too.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Before reading this I saw a lot of flack about the ending.  I enjoyed this book and thought the ending made a lot of sense.  From the beginning, these stories have been about Sookie.  And all the way through, no matter how outlandish events became, what made us care about Sookie is just how normal she is.  Isn't that the charm of this series, that we have a very normal, working-class character in some very outlandish circumstances?  Seriously, I think there are a LOT more descriptions of making dinner than making love and frankly, that was just fine with me.  (I quit reading Laurel K. Hamilton a long time ago.)  This final installment brings together some of my favorite characters and resolves the questions about Sookie's future in a way that made me feel happy for her.  I think the life she will have is as much of the life she's always wanted as most people get, and that made me happy for a character I've kept company with for years.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I am a weather junkie. With the weather app I can follow a storm in real time and win rewards at the same time. I really enjoy the ability to search for weather all across the country. It's fast and accurate.Keeps my grandchildren busy learning about how weather works. It's a great learning tool !!
B007SGM084|4.0|Who wouldn't love this action packed erotic romance. I am unsure if the writing improved throughout the books or if I was so engrossed that I no longer found it lacking.<br />The only real complaint I have is that the author finds a word and then uses it perennially, to the point of becoming distracting. Like the word &#34;murmur&#34;, I searched the word on my kindle, and it shows up 762 times in all three books.<br />The epilogue was a surprise and it allowed me to see into the story through a different POV, which was refreshing and fun.<br />The plot was pretty fantastic, so I would definitely recommend it to a friend... Just not my mother(I shudder at the thought)
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was an easy read.  Very descriptive.  Kept me wanting to know more throughout the book.  Reading it in anticipation for the movie this winter.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I originally found the Netflix series and then after watching Season 1, downloaded the book to see what was next.<br /><br />I learned so much about the faults of the American prison system, the weaknesses of the criminal justice system, the hypocrisy of sentencing, etc, that I found myself not only enjoying this book as someone's memoirs, but highlighting and jotting down facts and statistics that I found eye-opening.<br /><br />A wonderful story, and a wonderful resource to those interested.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Jojo weaves a great story through different times and different connections.  It is much more than love story.  It is about resilience and survival.
1616550414|5.0|I expected it to be a great timeline with detailed descriptions to include designers pics and notes. Highly recommend it to any Zelda or Nintendo franchise fan!
B00AYB0YFQ|3.0|I forgot how old this is. These actors are actually all fairly successful now. Go figure.  Anna Farris was really homely back then.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I was sad that the story ended.  I would love to read a second story on how they reconnect.  I couldn't put this one down!
B00BYISQTO|5.0|One of the reasons I like The National is that none of their CD's are a carbon copy of the last. At the same time they do mix it up with old and new sounds. For me this CD reminded me a little of their earlier stuff but with a bit of a sharper studio sound.  Definitely recommend &#34;Trouble Will Find Me.&#34;
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|This was one of Tom's worst movies. The plot was never fully developed. The action looked computer generated. The whole premise of the movie was not clear and the purpose of all the clones was not developed.<br />I'm glad I did not spend the usual 10-12 dollars for this movie. It reminded me of a computer game. Totally disappointed.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I think that this is a more interesting book than his more recent book, Inferno. Since the The Lost Symbol is set in Washington, DC, where I spent my career, it had particular interest for me, since the locale was so familier. A very good read!
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, it's one to add to your collection.  Great actors and its based on a true story.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I had been accessing my fb account through the web.  When I downloaded this direct app, it made everything run faster and smoother.  Wish I had gotten this sooner

B008OB1QFK|5.0|This is what country music is.  Simple lyrics from a life being lived.  I don't know what else defines country.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Crashes at times, lots of ads, missing some of the better stuff from the older versions. Needs some more work to be a great app.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|The pace, writing and overall direction of the movie was impressive; then I realised why I liked it so much. Christopher McQuarrie. I happen to appreciate smart, witty dialogue. Three of the principle actors (Cruise, Pike, and Oyelowo) did a great job, and you can't really go wrong with Duvall.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is one I had never read, but I saw half of the movie on television, and decided then and there I wanted to read the book. I enjoyed it very much from start to finish. The story is wonderful, the characters and settings are so believable that the reader is drawn into the story very easily. This isn't even my usual genre, and frankly it is something I would have enjoyed as a young girl. But I'm glad I have read it now.
B0001XPZGA|5.0|first of all the music is great and already commented on . it is too bad there are not more  music albums produced  that shows some of the same type of talent . there are  high schools and colleges everywhere with music departments full of kids that have more talent than what is being recorded today .  we are in the era where true talent does not rise to the top . fortunately for us Nora Jones made it and we have her music to enjoy .<br /><br /> What I want to comment on is the quality of the recording . The recording microphone placement and mixing is close to perfect . I see no improvement areas . The silent parts of the music are BLACK QUIET , I heard no crack or pops on the vinyl recording anywhere on the album or in-between songs  . I do not know of any vinyl record I have ever purchased that didn't have at least one pop or crackle or was this quiet  . This is the vinyl record album to show what your stereo is made of , and will show why you bought your stereo to begin with . it is most enjoyable to listen to .<br /><br />this is a cannot go wrong vinyl purchase .
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I have been reading classics I have either only read under duress in junior high school, or have always seen references to, but never read. In this case, I hadn't read it. It is easy to see why this excellent book is a classic. The way Bronte wrote the story is interesting in the plot, character development and overall &#34;feel.&#34; I loved it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The book was really good. I couldn't put it down. You really like the characters and their idiosyncrasies. They are so incredibly smart and the feeling that their lives are being ripped away from them in their youth is heart wrenching.  Green portrays the ways in which they deal with their illness as cynical, extremely funny at times and extremely tragic at others. It is a very good book about death and dying. A must read.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This was a great app until the latest upgrade. On my Kindle Fire, the new app frequently fails to load, leaving me starring at a blank screen, or worse, requiring me to reboot my Kindle. Old version was much more user friendly! Please bring it back!
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|i had read this during school, instantly fell in love with the book. i was excited to see the movie, it was Sean Penn's first directed movie and was well done the movie and the soundtrack if you love Eddie Vedder.

0062255657|4.0|The first novel for adults since Anansi Boys in 2006, Neil Gaiman succeeds in big ways and small ways, but he also fails in many ways that matter. However, he manages to create a concoction that enchants much like Hendrix's 'Little Wing,' and entertains, even for the short while.<br /><br />It takes a little while to realize that you were never going to find out who the exact narrator's name was, but you figured it never really mattered. Even the place where he lived seemed unremarkable. He grew up in a small town, the unmistakably English town of Sussex, and it seemed the magic he would soon encounter was going to make sense within the context of the locale, but it doesn't.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman, master author as he is, intended this to be about the happenings and the going ons. It may sound questionable at first but at least when you are halfway in, it becomes somewhat like that young adult's novel. Never mind the little hints towards adultery, no one's going to put this book down.<br /><br />It's even structured to read in one sitting, and while it felt like Neil Gaiman did a sort of cop out by phoning it in, well, let's say this plot isn't bad at all because Lettie, Neil's obvious effort to get in some sort of 'boy meets girl' mechanic, seems like a caricature, like everything else was a caricature. The narrator's parents were a caricature, and so was his sister.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman suggested a notion that maybe the magical adventure is far more important than who these people actually are, and that maybe this is how we felt when we ourselves were little lads and lasses. If purely seen as that, it succeeds both in terms of sheer resonance and entertainment. It does make us recall possibly terrible memories like a good 200 plus page novel.<br /><br />Seen from the other angle, it can also be seen as a lazy attempt at carelessly plodding through a nonsensical plot where everything seemed to be steeped in myth and in made up stuff. The narrator had often foundhimself in situations where deep powerful forces reigned, but it seemed a device where Clive Barker books thrived on, largely unbridled imagination with no true source or origin.<br /><br />Even the ending feels like it was unfinished, with little insinuation that maybe we could be pushed beyond the point of almost non-existent characterization into substantial character development, which Neil instead deems to employ in a really strange manner in this book.<br /><br />Neil's language abounds and delights as always, but don't expect anything of the caliber of American Gods, or even Anansi Boys here. Expect to be enthralled by the terribly audacious ideas for a day or so, Neil's most risky work in awhile.<br /><br />Now, wait for the more powerful Neil.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The interesting characters and great ensemble acting make Downton Abbey enjoyable to watch. It's also a fascinating look at English society during that time period. I am looking forward to Season 4.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|This game is really really good. It's kind of the same as the other one it's only in Italia and it has different muisic. But it's good.!))

B001ANSSDC|3.0|This book was a little depressing.  You follow the main character as he tries to find his silver linings, and finally accepts reality.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Puzzles are fun and just the right amount of difficulty. I would definitely recommend this game for ALL ages BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Such a fun read - epic adventure with well-written characters and enough intrigue to keep it interesting throughout.  Thoroughly enjoyed this one.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Just like when I was a kid! We should be able to have unlimited turns though. Have fun everyone :-)
B00153ZC8Q|4.0|It's The Terminator. Arnold being menacing with few words. Practical special effects. 80s synth music and all.  Could have stopped the franchise here.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Enjoy playing this and glad it was available on my new kindle.  Now I can take it with me and play when I have down time.
B000093BDX|5.0|This is a great CD love the old songs. Great shipping and fast.Sure you can download now brings back old times.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|**SPOILERS**<br /><br />I actually liked this movie a lot. Sure, it was different from the book, but if you got over that, the characters were the same, and they went on a quest. It was actually quite an enjoyable movie. I watched it 5 times, and am planning to again soon.<br /><br />I would also recommend the books. I learned a LOT about Greek Mythology from them. Here is a link to the set [[ASIN:1423136802 Percy Jackson pbk 5-book boxed set (Percy Jackson & the Olympians)]]
B00DCRE83S|5.0|Jason Newsted returns!  The EP was awesome, but only 4 songs.  But this disc is really good...really, really good!  It's what metal needed.  It's a shot in the arm & breathing life into the metal scene I grew up with and love.<br /><br />Plus, I saw them on Friday in NJ at Gigantour.  They came on at 4:30, when there were really only a handful of us there.  It didn't matter to them, or to us.  They came out & played like the place was packed!  The band sounds really tight.  You can tell these guys do it because they love it & have passion for it.  Jason seemed sincere when speaking with the crowd, and was pretty funny.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed by this disc.  I highly recommend it.
B00AEFZ560|5.0|This movie is so great..........My husband who is 77 loves it and my 7 year old grandson feels the same. Great entertainment.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|The game is good entertaining for young children. Easy to understand and to play., easy access on all electronics where kindle app is available.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This product definitely protects my kindle. I do find it a little cumbersome and a bit too heavy. I think I will try a skin, if I can figure out from the reviews, the best one. &#34;You just can't please everybody!&#34;
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|This is a really cool game.  I have played both games.  Just wish there were more updates.  Would love to have more stores open.
0345803485|1.0|The immature writing was the worst thing about this mess of a book, terrible, laughable dialog and the story is an unbelievable drag. Leave this one alone, it really is not good.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's a different hidden object game. It's nice for a change. I only hope there's a part two. Maybe in the future if possible.
B004UB9SKS|4.0|I just started using it and in time I might give it a 5 but from what I know now I will give it a 4. I'm always looking for functional tools that can help me communicate quickly. Given that I'm usually out in the community I would like them, as much as possible to work off line. This is my second off line translator. The fist helps with situations that come up. This one is more of a common phrase translator which has spoken phrases. That is a disadvantage with the other translator no audible . Together I feel these two translators give me a good beginning .<br />I would recommend it to anyone needing words at heir finger tips. Someone with no background in the language could use it, but where it really helps if you do have some experience with the language but just need a boost to your recall.

B008B1BL4E|5.0|A slow read, but we'll worth the effort. With the intricate web of self interest that they wove, it would have been a miracle if the statesmen of 1914 had been able to avoid a war.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|By far the best game ou t there, awesome graphics on kindle fire hd. No annoying ads, runs very smooth, an  can play offline. Any thing free is worth saving up for , and this was  worth it.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I have read a lot of books about this era and the Bible. Most authors betray in their writing at least a small amount of bias, whether it is anger over having been indoctrinated in their youth, roots in another religion or whatever. Reza Aslan's only apparent bias, if you can call it that, is for historical accuracy as far as it can be determined from the available evidence.<br /><br />As a historian he examines all of the writings, not just those &#34;approved&#34; and applies his reason to follow where the evidence leads, just as any good investigator does. He explains why he reaches the conclusions he does and supports it with evidence, Perhaps I'm biased in my opinion of him because after reading dozens of similar books I arrived at pretty much the same judgement that he has. Of course we can never know the exact truth about Jesus because the documentation is limited and Jesus never wrote anything to explain himself. That was left for others to write what they believed about him some decades to centuries later but if the truth is what lies between the lines, this is what is between those lines.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|Rick, you must not understand the concept of what this film is about. How many black people would you like?

B00DU74U74|2.0|I'm not of Stephanie Meyer's other, more popular Twilight books.  But I quite liked her book, The Host.  So I had hopes for the movie.  But they took an interesting sci-fi book and turned it into a bad cliché YA film, a la Twilight in feel.  While I like quite many YA books, this movie lived up to a different type of YA book than to its actual inspiration - which had potential for an interesting, strong lead character; nuanced additional cast; and some interesting premise exploration. Just didn't get to see that in the movie.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Classic kid movie. We watched this with our older kids, now in their 30s, and I suspect their kids will also enjoy it when they're old enough. I enjoyed again: You have to get old, but you don't have to grow up!

0743201140|5.0|I just took the StrengthsFinder test and am blown away with the results - it really nailed who I am in five key areas!<br /><br />The book has challenged several assumptions on which I've based my teaching and coaching.  While I've always tried to bolster a client's / student's strengths, I've been equally if not more focused on their weaknesses and on helping them acquire new skills.<br /><br />I think I have wanted to believe that \\"talent\\" could be acquired.  In thinking that, I actually was mis-using the word.  This book has helped me to understand that \\"skill\\" can be acquired; talent is innate.<br /><br />I think the core insights of the book will allow me to help students and clients feel less pressure in their pursuit of \\"talents\\" they don't have and will allow me to help them use new \\"skills\\" in service of protecting the talents they do have.

B005LAII4E|5.0|The gun fights, explosions, vehicles/boats/aircraft, martial arts, etc. make this one great action/adventure film. Even the space weapons were amazingly devastating. Snake eyes & storm shadow are badass, and so is the rock. Nice soundtrack as well. I would recommend to anyone who wants a fun popcorn movie & likes the kickass action. Tis better than the first one IMO. I wish it was longer so they could develop the characters more and had an R rating so it could be more violent & bloody. The BD features reference quality picture and sound.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|great movies, great blu ray transfers for older movies.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|But I do enjoy the characters that are presented by premium venerable actors (both male and female.) It could be considered an old world soap opera but it is presented as so much more if you follow it from season 1. Things haven't changed much from the turn of the century to present day as far as people of notoriety and power are concerned. The underlying human emotions that exist at Downton Abbey is well worth the time to experience and reflect upon.
B0004Z33EG|3.0|&#34;FIRST BLOOD&#34; WAS INTERESTING AND I ENJOYED THE ACTION.  THE ONLY THING I DISLIKED ABOUT THE STORY<br />WAS WHEN THE SHERIFF (CHIEF OF POLICE) ACTED UNFAIRLY TO RAMVO AFTER HIS DEPUTY WAS KILLED. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE ANY RATIONAL LAW ENFORCAEMENT OFFIICIAL WOULD CONDONE THE ACTIONS OF HIS DEPUTY.  I DON'T REMEMBER ENOUGH OF &#34;RAMBO 2&#34; TO  RENDER A COMMENT.<br /><br />EVERY ONE, WHO LIKES ACTION FLICKS, WOULD ENJOY THE STORY.
1476733953|1.0|Some reviews go into length in describing what they liked or didn't like about a book. I'll make it short.<br /><br />I picked this book after reading some of the rave about it. The first 15 pages were truly a promising start for an interesting and exciting story. But that's were it ended. After these 15 pages, the story changes to become a slow-pace, excruciating read. There is no more excitement about the story that unfolds, the description of the events is slow, there is hardly any progress and the story does not entice the reader. There is too much content that adds nothing to the plot and dialogues that are redundant and far from interesting. The description of the underground city is not convincing and there are too many ideas about the internal workings of the city that make no sense to me.<br /><br />I managed to drag myself to read the first 140 pages before I returned it to the bookstore with a sense of relief that I don't need to keep on reading it.<br />I could not care less about how the story ends.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As a lifelong Christian and long time lay bible study teacher, I found Reza Aslan's knowledge of history and the New Testament to provide a compelling story of Jesus and his times.  He is a scholar who could have given us erudite text but instead blessed us with a good read.

B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Great show must watch every week! Why do I need more words this seems dumb it's a great show nothing more is needed
B000301YY8|3.0|Except for his hit song, &#34;You're Beautiful&#34;, pretty pedestrian. I guess British taste is different from U.S. I wish he would write a few more like that. I would but it in a minute
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Action, Humor, Great Special Effects...love it! I would reccomend this movie to anyone. You have to watch it now, right now
B0094K1MH2|3.0|If I had children 8 to 15 I would have given it 4 stars. but on its own its only worth three.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Easy to use. No issues. Panoramic option is nice. Also the ability to change filters is good. Purchased when I first got my Kindle For Christmas.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|She is great. Her voice is hauntingly beautiful. She never misses, at least not in my experience. I have several other of her albums
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just started but already addicted.  Would recommend if you like puzzles and brain teasers.  I give it a big thumbs up.
B000WTNCYA|2.0|The sound quality don't come close to the live experience. Was disappointed. Perhaps her sound engineer wasn't up to the job. Would go to see her live anytime
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Love it!!! I am currently in the middle of season 3  and in hindsight I thought season two was the best of the three.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Started to watch the series this summer and really enjoy the story.<br />The characters are all very good. Especially Lady Grantham and Lady Crowley.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an amazing read and is particularly great for middle school kids. It's got some great lessons about bullying and just in general being a good person.
B008Y5N3O8|5.0|Great dialogue, great acting.  Great insight into the world of high-pressure sales.  All this and full of surprises as well.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was awesome! I loved it being from the guys perspective! I literally was laughing out loud throughout the whole thing! Such a sweet and funny book.
B008Y73940|4.0|Matthew McConaughey plays a lawyer just sleazy enough to want him on your side.  A good story with just enough surprises to keep you interested
B0053KWDES|5.0|I own a 160GB iPod Classic and listen through Klipsch Image S4 and V-Moda M-100 earbuds/headphones. The FiiO E11 amp is a very practical and wonderful iPod complement which truly pushes more powerful sound through your headphones. Prior to my purchase, the non-amplified iPod would need to be turned up at least 75-90% volume to get a satisfying sound, depending, obviously, on the quality of the music file (iPod EQ settings on 'Rock\\" or 'R&B' seems to provide the best overall range of bass and treble for the styles of music I primarily listen to, which is a variety of guitar-based genres). By attaching the iPod to the E11 amp, via the FiiO L9 line-out to dock (sold separately), which bypasses the inferior iPod amp, the iPod click-wheel volume control is disabled, thus, all volume is handled by the nicely installed knob on the amp housing. The amp knob ranges from 0 (off) to 8 (max). I've noticed that I rarely increase the volume beyond the 5 mark. The E11 also contains a gain switch (high or low), and an EQ switch (0, 1, or 2). By coordinating the settings between the amp and the EQ settings within the iPod, it's possible to yield a pleasing sound for any genre. Battery life depends, again obviously, on the length of use. The amp's battery typically drains after 4-5 hours of intermittent use, which is most likely affected by increased gain or EQ settings on the amp (I have yet to use the amp for more than two continuous hours). It takes at least two hours for a full recharge (in which the amp DOES NOT function). I won't discuss the specs any further since they are available on the product page. I would, however, recommend a higher quality set of earphones or headphones such as the Klipsch Image S4 or the not-as-portable V-Moda M-100 (or the myriad of sets comparable in quality/price to those two models). It seems impractical to use any headphone amp in conjunction with a basic pair of Apple-style earbuds, even though there would most likely be a noticeable improvementin sound. I haven't yet used the FiiO F8 cable (included with the E11) since I've always been under the impression that connecting directly to the MP3 devices' dock provides optimal sound transfer, since connecting directly to the dock bypasses the relatively weak iPod amp as I've already stated. I recommend the FiiO E11 amp (along with the FiiO L9 cable) to any music lover looking for a bit more \\"punch\\" from their MP3 device, at an affordable price.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Good story line so far. Haven't finished but far enough along to know  it's a great  object game. It isn't a point and click adventure but strictly hidden object.
B009HCBCUE|5.0|So many great songs on this 2 CD set.  Includes Rhonda Lee by Al (don't call me Jimmy) Hendrix from Bakersfield.  He's still rockin' these days in Auburn, CA.  He appeard at of all places the Hard Rock in Vegas in a show two years ago.  Can't find Rhonda Lee on a 45 anywhere.  I know, I tried.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|One of the interesting things about this film is the assumed education and level of thinking of the audience in 1954.  The modern science fiction films do not require any math skills or physics knowledge, whereas this film does, if the viewer wants to understand it.<br />Another thing the film brings back is the intense single minded love a woman has for a man; today that would be verboten.<br />I enjoyed this film when I saw it in 1954 and I enjoyed it in 2013; I even had the same emotions as then.<br />As far as science fiction films go; I rate this one and the origional &#34;War of the Worlds&#34; as two of the best.  &#34;Them&#34; is right up their also. LOL, well I liked it anyway.  Can't hear the night noise without thinking of &#34;Them&#34;.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|These movies have been reviewed and reviewed, so I'll review the PRODUCT, and not the movies, which is what we're supposed to be doing, IMO. IMDB is for movie reviews. Anyway, this is put together rather well. What really kicked me in the pants was the bonus disk chocked full of extras I'd never seen before! Hours of stuff. I really can't think of anything they could have done better except for maybe putting all the movies on 2 or 3 disks. I enjoy having this set, and is a replacement for purloined DVD versions of these movies.
0316228583|1.0|Bought the book, not because of the well known author, but because I thought the subject matter would be an interesting and fun concept.  What a depressing slog to get though this book.  There was not one character I cared about, but made myself finish the book just to see how it ended.  Can there really be a town so filled with vile people, even in the author's mind? Not one redeeming page.  It appeared that the author was trying for an ending that left you with some hope, but even that fell flat.  I will be dropping my copy off at the second hand book shop for credit to buy something that is worth reading.  I have to try and get an remnant of this read out of my head.
B006VREHRS|5.0|Loving this show - one of the best in a long time. Well made and well acted! Highly recommend it.
0714844659|5.0|I bought this cookbook after listening to Rose on America's Test Kitchen radio. I bought it for her carrot salad recipe (which is fabulous) and I simply love it! I've made her chocolate banana cake four times in the three weeks since I bought the book. Every recipe I have tried has been a hit, and I can't say that about any other cookbook I own.
B000C20VPA|5.0|In the same lines as Goodfellows. Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, and Joe Pesci gave outstanding mob performance.  They go from hitting the streets of NY to running a Casino.
034580404X|2.0|Why did I have that pervading feeling of reading a not-so-subtly modified version of Pretty Woman?<br />I like Anastasia. Bright young woman acting out with a some amount of recurring common sense. Not as often as you might wish though, but never too late to be irreparable.<br />I detest Christian Grey, a spoiled kid, whatever the reasons he (or she, E.L. James) the writer gives to explain that he is a simple prick acting out of self-pity. I can't condone personally good reasons to justify a miserable conduct. There is such a thing a respecting human beings, and women in particular. And I am of male gender.<br />But I had a mother. You wonder at time if all of us men, had.<br />Is this book written to glorify the survival of rich or poor wankers, if I may so bold as to ask?
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not too much to say about this movie except for the ending which was far fetch too.  Tom always has a new car in his movies now because he likes racing but he need to get over it.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Finally a movie that does the book justice. Authors should direct the film versions of their books all the time.
B001609SQA|5.0|I love the Alien series, and this is probably my favorite one of the series.  It's a little bit older of a movie, but still a great film to watch today.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. is excellently sarcastic and hilarious in such a nonchalant way. The humor is excellently timed and the special effects are fantastic. And, unlike some superhero films, the plot is marvelous.
B00CDY6HW6|3.0|If you dont have an internet connection the game refuses to start. This is unacceptable. The game isnt bad maybe 3 stars if it allowed offline  .<br /><br />Update 8-15-2013:<br />The game does not require an internet connection, Amazon DRM does. If you get a popup saying internet connection required, you need to run the game once with an active connection for Amazon to update the DRM token, after that it will work offline for another 30 days. App developer should have chose not to use DRM.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This lovely period film has everything that a history nut (and his history dilettante girlfriend) could want in a movie. The humor is very true to what most jokes would be like at this point in time, which makes it all the more funny since it simply isn't something you'd hear every day. However, would I recommend a briefing in Lincoln's presidency and the Civil War prior to watching this movie in order to enjoy it to the full extent? Yes I would.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Play this game on my PC also.  Great fun and entertaining while wasting time.<br /><br />Very addicting way to spend my free time.<br />Love this game!!!!!!!
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|With her unique voice and amazing lyrics, lana del ray will take you on an emotional journal with this album. While her musical technique is very unique, one can also observe that her style of music is influence by the 1960's musical era. The influence of the 1960's, and her raw and heart felt lyrics make Lana del ray a musical genius in my opinion.
B008JFUN50|2.0|\\"Elysium\\" is A dull sermon about Obamacare and open borders in the guise of a so-so Sci-fi flic. The didactic aspect of the film is so heavy-handed it takes you right out of the movie, out of the willing suspension of disbelief. It doesn't help that \\"Elysium\\" lacks the arresting characters, clever plotting, or wowee special effects that break science fiction films out beyond the genre's diehard fans.<br /><br />It's 2154 in a dystopic Los Angeles. LA is ugly and garbage-strewn, in a futuristic way. Almost everyone in LA is Hispanic or at least speaks Spanish. Max (Matt Damon), a bald and tattooed ex-con trying to go straight, is forced into taking on a high-risk crime for Spider (Wagner Moura), a crime lord. Max has to travel to Elysium, a space station where rich white Americans live in beauty and luxury, unlike the cursed denizens of earth, who are mostly Hispanic and live in garbage strewn slums and can't get adequate medical care. Elysium has med-beds. If you lie down on a med-bed, no matter what your ailment is, the med-bed will cure you.<br /><br />Spider is plotting to breach Elysium's security and take it over, thus making med-beds and Elysium's breathtaking beauty available to all. He faces formidable foes.<br /><br />Jodie Foster is the white, blonde Elysium antagonist. She is trying to protect Elysium from the Hispanic immigrants and sick people in search of health care who are attempting to enter. Kruger, played by Sharlto Copley, a South African actor, is her evil tool. There is no attempt to explain why someone with such a pronounced South African accent lives in LA. In any case, Copley's performance of an enthusiastic sadist is the best thing about the film.<br /><br />There is a lot of chasing. Men put on metallic costumes that give them special powers. There are your usual hyped up guns and there are also some knives and swords. A lot of this feels like expedient cheating, as it always does in fantasy movies. There are special devices that detect runaways. Max is able to elude these super smart devices by hiding under pigs. The movie never explains, as these movies never explain, the rules of such gadgetry. If a character needs to get away to advance the plot, some trick will help him to get away.<br /><br />I live in a non-futuristic, garbage-strewn slum. We have had liberal, Democratic government for generations. See Detroit. We've been hearing the same message for generations, the same message \\"Elysium\\" sends: \\"It's us versus them. We are human; they are cold and cruel. They live lives of perfect bliss. Their health problems are all taken care of. They only way for us to achieve anything is to take what they have.\\"<br /><br />This message, even in a grade C sci-fi flick, is toxic. Liberals do not help us, the poor, by telling us that we have nothing of value in ourselves, that it is only through taking what the rich have that we can have lives of value. Poor people do not benefit by discounting what they have and living lives of passive, deluded envy, focusing on what the rich have rather than focusing on their own skills and blessings, and cultivating their own opportunities.<br /><br />If the Earthlings of \\"Elysium\\" succeeded in their goal, it wouldn't end there. It would end as the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Iranian Revolution and others ended: with terror, torture, rape, chaos, and \\"meet the new boss; same as the old boss.\\" The real revolution starts when we look within and outside ourselves with love.naways.

B00ANAC32U|5.0|It definitely fits the best for nexus 4. Maybe it won't add too much protection, but it will do decent job.<br /><br />Thanks.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Not his best I was not happy with the fact that Dawson not only had a crappy childhood but then gets killed by his scummy cousin too
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a historical fiction-dramatist's dream. Downton Abbey is well written, imagined, acted and costumed. It's a must If you enjoy British anything, drama, history, scenery and costumes. I watched all 3 seasons in about 4 days.
B00AEBB9SM|5.0|I first saw this when I was a child and ever since it has been hard to catch on TV. I found this and the price was what I fell in love with first. It came to me in excellent timing and was in mint condition.
B000W453KQ|5.0|Has always been a wonderful movie.  Highly recommend that the viewer read the book before watching the movie.  Excellent read as well.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|I was looking for a basic portfolio sleeve to carry my Kindle Fire HD in my purse so I chose to go with this one. It holds my Kindle really snug and protects it from all of the junk that I have in my purse! It definitely does what it's advertised to do. I also like the fact that it doesn't add any bulk or weight to my Kindle especially since I carry it around with me everywhere that I go. I got tired of carrying my iPad 2 around so this portfolio sleeve gives me the opportunity to take my Kindle along with me without worrying about it getting damaged. It's really basic but gets the job done. The price is also quite affordable. I highly recommend it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. I play it all the time. Its great for everybody no matter how old u r.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I've always been a huge fan of Tina and loved reading this. I read the entire book in her voice in my head. I greatly enjoyed her life stories, how she ended up where she was and the familiar names who accompanied her on NBC. It may not be the most exciting or brilliant read on a literary or scholarly level, but I really quite enjoy it.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Great game, with fun puzzles and mini games. Wish there was more games like this one offered for free. Some of the screens are hard to see, but its is okay.
0061928356|5.0|Very interesting book -- led to a great discussion at Book Club  -- everyone agreed that it was very well written
B0087JTAKW|4.0|It is a story that will fill you with hope that every moment is precious and we are all here by grace...
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was a wonderful read, and was as entertaining as the Kite Runner. Great way to learn more about  some of the culture we are not so familiar with.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's right there just a tap away ...I use it to figure my bills and balance my checking account.  I've seen apps for other calculators but this one is simple and easy to look at.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is by far one of the best apps for kindle fire there is. I use it just about everyday. There is a wide variety of sounds and you can make your own personalized combinations, each to suite your different moods. I use it mainly for sleeping but it's great for relaxing as well. You can make use of the timer feature forget about everything and slumber on. Very pleased.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|What else can one say? This is a classic Marvel production... I don't know how you can top this, but I'm sure it can be done and can't wait to see it when it is...
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This movie is a true lesson and if you like to fly or wonder why is your Pilot so happy after he's flown a plane over a million hours, this movie will give you that answer. Good movie and John Goodman was Hilarious!!
B00499QUK2|4.0|It is a pretty good show. I would like for the hole seasons to be viewable. It is getting better every one I watch.<br />Jr.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This is a very good movie. Funny yet insightful. The language may take most by surprise but this is how people act back in that time. If your easy to offend or upset, this is not the movie for you. But if you are laid back and can grasp that this is a &#34;movie&#34; not current times of how we live, then this is the movie for you!!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Very good, liked the cast and i thought it was funny. Would definitely recommend this movie and can't wait for Red 2
B008BO61BE|5.0|First off the 83'US festival dvd is worth the whole package alone. The sound and picture is surprisingly very good... looks like it was filmed yesterday. Awesome performance as well. You also get the entire SFV CD plus live bonus tracks from a show in San Antonio. There is also one unreleased studio track i believe. What more could you ask for?
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The quality was your basic blu-ray. I have not watched the extras yet.  But all the extended versions of all the movies were excellent.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love white noise while I sleep, and I also grew up in the country. Relax melodies is perfect for falling asleep to the sounds of the outdoors or just relaxing in general.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Stirring movie. Strong start. Middle loses it's way dramatically.  The end is exciting and heart warming.  Amazing it's a true story. Glad it was shared.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I've only seen Episode 1 and I am totally hooked.  The rapid development of Characters, the telling glances, the sympathetic loving Mother, tension between characters all leaving you with wanting to know more....everything a great Mystery is suppose to do.  Smartly done placing it in a picturebook idyllic beachside community where everyone knows your name.  AND a cast of exceptional British actors including our favorite Dr!
B00BWRKVVS|5.0|I'm a Disney fan so I absolutely love it! And any other Disney fan will too!! I never saw Kronk's New Groove, but am looking forward to it!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This is the fourth book in the series. I am just beginning to read it but it is just as good as the last three. hard to put down!
B000FC2ROU|1.0|I enjoyed very much two of Murakam'si books: The Wind-up Bird Chronicle and 1Q84. So I bought 4 books more and this is the first of the four Ihave  read. A complete waste of money aand time. While in the two books mentioned above, the absurd situations in this book have no meaning. While in the other books the absurd had a purpose and felt like part of the plot, here it is just that: absurd. The unecessary details are boring: I don't see the point of describing which every single caracther is wearing each time named caracther appears and also each food everyone is eating every single time. This repetition of unimportant details is lack of respect towards the reader. The sex scenes sound out of place, are tacky and meaningless. I don't mind sex in books at all. In the A song of Ice and Fire series there are lots of sex, but it felt like part of the story, into context. That doesn't happen here. The sex scenes are unclassy and without context. The plot itself is nonexistent. The carathers are shallow and their \\"depth\\" is just a desguise for their lack of complexity. The quotations of phylosophers and writers aren't related to the context, being just a name dropper boring stuff. The animal torture scenes are horrible and shows a deep lack of taste. For me, the sign of a good book is not being able to put it down, just like the sign of a bad one is to make myself read in order to finish. No need to say what happened when I was reading this one.
B00000IL1K|2.0|Sarah has always been a favourite of mine; I was sadly disappointed in this CD. I could not hear her she was a whisper, turn the sound up and the backing got louder and was not the music I like. Sorry I did not choice better.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I bought this book after reading &#34;American Sniper&#34; and I give this book higher marks than &#34;American sniper.&#34; I found Marcus Luttrell a more relational person than Chris Kyle. I cannot wait for the movie. It is an inspirational and emotional book.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Loved this book ant wait for the others to be free. Exciting story and so descriptive I felt I was there.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I saw this story on Fox News and had to read the book. Reading the events of this incident and how it effected the men involved for decades is truly inspiring. A spoiler alert is that Kleenexs' are needed .
B009NTNHJU|5.0|I choose this rating as it is an amazing album  i would recommend it as it is the definition of pure, hardcore rap with a very attention grabbing stimulating beat with out of this world lyrics to match them
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I started reading this book with great expectations based on recommendations from a friend. The story is good but I found his personal life character disappointing.  His family was never his first priority.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It's a fun game to play with friends and family online in this game and its a good way to play the game with more fun then the board game.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Not an Academy Award winner but a fun popcorn movie. Sometimes one needs to enjoy a good sci-fi movie and forget about the troubles of the world.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I have to play in another dispositive to beat El Macho,  i lost my records but i least I can escape the machos liar... I had a 660k record and now i got 120k because o that problem
630542845X|5.0|I had seen this movie before and I wanted it for my collection!  I liked the way it was made!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It was good at first, and then it bugged out and the screen kept flashing black and white with little hints of the video. This all happened within the first hour of using it. I have now removed it from my kindle,
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The journey of reading this on the Kindle was a bit deceiving since it quoted the book at close to 1,000 pages because of the font size I chose, but I was hooked to the story through every one of those virtual page flips. Mr. King combines history, mystery, thrills and a damn fine love story in a way very few authors can pull off convincingly. It's worth the 600-1,500 pages (depending on font size) even if you're not a JFK buff.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|It said free and less than a minute it showed I was going  to have to buy.  When I saw the $39.99 price tag I removed it.  On the computer or Wii it is lots cheaper.  I will play it there not on Kindle HD
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I love history so &#34;John Adams&#34; was right down my alley. Learned more about our county, the USA. Excellent movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book came in quickly and in the condition I expected.  I would purchase from this seller again anytime.  Thanks.
B00CBKLO52|3.0|You have to buy aerobatic planes if you want to fly anything other than a trainer (boring to an experienced Rc flyier)
B000001GXB|1.0|I was seriously disappointed by Mr Pollini's efforts this time. Specially because these cds have been so widely overrated over the years.<br /><br />Ears familiar with Arrau, Kempff, Richter, Serkin, Backhaus, Gilels, Gulda or Gould will most likely deride these performances for their rather shallow nature. The Italian pianist, with all his amazing technique, rarely does more than scratching the surface of these works, glorious summits of the human spirit.<br /><br />And there are better performances in digital recordings as well. Try Kovacevich or Brendel.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I loved this book and Im glad I got to read it before Hollywood ruins it and I would advised you of the same!
B008602KQI|4.0|Is this movie a commentary on Combining Competitive Game Shows + The news coverage of Violent Events in the Inner City or Impoverished Nations?
B00AREIAI8|4.0|cant share photos...something about parameters. not set<br />no option to fix it though and I really hats that ads were. added
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|good show.  my wife and I can both enjoy the same show without constantly changing channels when one of gets bored of it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|These app is very addictive. Once you start playing you can't stop. I highly recommend this to you enjoy its free.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I had a lot of fun with this game. An issue I had with it however, was that you had to be very particular about where you placed things. If you do not have it lined up just right it won't fit. I am using a Kindle Fire HD. I had trouble placing things using both my finger and also the stylus. So even when I was sure I knew what I was doing, it didn't always work. But, overall very cool game.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|I am an avid fan of the Dexter TV series and decided to try the novels. Compared to the show there are a good deal of differences as well as similarities. I think the mix helped me enjoy this book more than if I had read it before watching the show. If you're a Dexter fan (show) I'd definitely recommend this book. Onto the second novel!
B003IDMUVI|5.0|I have been meaning to read some Grisham for years. If the rest of his books are as good as The Rainmaker, then I am in for a few years of great reading
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Lose track of time , makes you think. Fun casual game and keeps you on your toes.Fun fun fun fun fun
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is nice to be able to hit a couple of icons and find out what the weather is doing..also setting the alarm for severe weather is very<br />comforting.
0762451319|4.0|I really like this because it has the necklace and the rune tattoos plus more for only $8.95 when at the other store it'd be $6 for the rune tattoos and I think $12 for the necklace. The only thing is my skin is really sensitive so I ended up being allergic to the necklace but if you put clear nail polish on it, it will be okay.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have this on my phone, so when I got my kindle hd fire..I had to see if I could get it there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game. It invols thinking fast and being fast. it requires skill and stradegy. i suggest this game to people of all ages. it is not violet. But yet the perfect game everyone can enjoy.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|every time I start...I can't seem to stop. This game is addictive...makes you work your brain cells in a good way
B008133MDK|5.0|This is a fine modernizing of Conan Doyle's Sherlock.  Great cast - they couldn't have found anyone more enigmatic or soulful than Benedick Cumberbatch. And this version makes Dr. Watson a lot smarter than the original which gives Sherlock a good brain against which to bounce ideas.  There's just enough of the old stories modernized into contemporary culture to make this a brilliant series.  Another win for BBC.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|It's VEVO for your mobile devices. What more can I say. It works as easily as the actual web site.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Brilliant television.  These programs from the BBC are a pleasure to watch.  The production values are top notch, probably because there are only 3 episodes per season.  I wish programs from Hollywood would match that and spend the time and energy producing superior products.
B0073TZ1AA|5.0|This works great with Kindle Fire HD. It is a little glitchy with the original Kindle Fire but will still work (will only display one sentence at a time). Great for kids who are struggling with reading (will help them learn while they follow along) or just listen to your books while you're busy doing other things.
B001QJUX24|5.0|Certainly John Ford, who has won more Best Director awards than any other filmmaker, deserves your attention. As regards *The Searchers*, the American Film Institute rates it #1 on its list of great Westerns. Excellence is far more diverse than mediocrity, but regardless of your personal inclinations and preferences, if you care about American movies, or just about Westerns, you are probably already well acquainted with this painful masterpiece.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I did not receive this game on my kindle fire, have trouble receiving games on my kindle fire, what am I not doing?
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I'm working my way through all four seasons.  I've come into this show late, but so glad I found it.  Almost through 2 seasons and haven't had a boring episode yet.
B000P12LWY|5.0|The actors and the dramas they portrayed were great.  The plot was well developed, interesting and kept my attention throughout.  The casting director did great but --  they should have done more with makeup to show the passage of time on the characters as years went by.
B005EPFA8I|5.0|The Cave of Forgotten Dreams is a revelation. The narrative is wonderfully interwoven with images & sounds from past present and future that push themselves into the deep recess of sacred consciousness. Werner Herzog has created a veritable masterpiece.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Waste of time, the game wouldn't even start after updating and downloading. Not even an option top download without the update.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is so much faster than browsing online! It has great features and I absolutely love it! Download it today :)
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This group has a unique sound and inventive lyrics.  When I first heard them, I liked it but wasn't thrilled either.  Howwever, the more I listen, the more I like It.  And I have to add that while good on disk, they are better in person.
0345529057|5.0|To buy the GoT series individually in the book stores would cost more than triple the price...This box set is a bargain...
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Really enjoyed the book, it was a great end - I think Brandon did well, Robert would be proud of it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awsome! easy to understand how to play, nice graphics, very amusing, animated graph when you`re not playing! cool!!!
B004AO1FF6|5.0|Season 4 is probably the best in the Who series.  It's awesome!  Although they are all good.  The Doctor is like a Jedi wielding a sonic screwdriver.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it! And even though little kids might have a hard time playing it, my nephew still loves to watch.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|A quiet, solemn collection of songs.  Good for times when you want music on in the background but don't want it to be loud and raucous.
B00DCRE83S|1.0|Do you people even listen to Metal? If did, you would realize what a bland, boring, piece of crap this is.  You probably think Sabbath is better with Ozzy back and \\"Supercollider\\" by Megadeth is groundbreaking. Listen to recent discs by Accept, Angel Witch, Riot, The Rods and especially \\"Human Remains\\" by Hell and Satan's comeback disc \\"Life Sentence\\" for old school Metal.  This sucks.
B00008BXJG|4.0|I bought this because I couldn't buy there songs on Itunes.  You can do that now lol!!  Great Album!! Woot!
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I kept waiting and reading and waiting and reading ...for a spy plot.  Alas, too many words,too many boyfriends,...I got lost in stories within stories. Definitely not for me
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|I saw a review of his second book in People and decided to read this one first.  I am a cat friend, so I have a warm place in my heart for cats.  I loved the bond these two have.
0316044695|3.0|I found this book impossible to put down once I began reading it. I can only describe it as intriguing and gut-wrenching. Four American Heroes went on a mission and sadly, only one made it home to his family. I nearly cried reading how the three of their deaths played out but it also highlighted the heroism and drive these SPECOPS service members have putting country first and laying down their lives for our freedom.<br /><br />With that said, I found when Marcus Luttrell veered off of the history and story and into his personnel political beliefs it was nearly impossible to keep reading. It's truly amazing how he could think so highly of George Bush, yet hate politicians and the \\"liberal media\\" so much. Very confusing and reading him place blame on the media for a vote he cast (which many people have casted doubt on this event, specifically family members of the deceased SEALS who died that day) which inevitably led to the compromise of the mission and teammate deaths.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Some unexpected events. A few heroes. A little romance. Good mix of suspense and action. Nice to have female heroine.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|JUST RETURNED FROM TAKING BOTH MY GRANDSON AND GRANDDAUGHTER TO SEE THIS GREAT MOVIE, FOR KIDS ....THEIR AGES ARE 7 AND 6, RESPECTIVELY, AND BOTH ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH.<br /><br />AS A FORMER MARINE, THE CHARACTER I LIKED MOST WAS SKIPPER RILEY ....WELL DONE ONCE AGAIN, DISNEY TEAM!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't put this down. I read it start to finish in 6 hours. I'd recommend this to anyone older than 15!
B0092S4WLY|1.0|I cannot figure out how to play this game.  It has no instructions no where to click to read them.
