B007IXWL2C|5.0|I didn't have the urge to read the trilogy, but my husband bought the first book for me for Christmas. When I finally decided to read the Fifty Shades of Grey I was immediately addicted. I would recommend this series to anyone that loves a good love story. To my surprise the books was not at all what I expected. I read the Fifty Shades Trilogy in a week. The messages sent back and forth between Ana and Christian made me literally laugh out loud. I hope to read more from E L James in the near future.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I'm new to Lee Childs work.  After seeing the Jack Reacher film I decieded to follow up on some of his other books.  The story line and the characters are well defined and there is not a rush to tie things together at the end.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love this new series.  The characters are cleverly written and the actors are just superb.  There's a wonderful tension between the frenetic and very complex Sherlock and the very intelligent and equally complex Joan Watson.  A marvelous contemporary take on the story.  Well worth your time to watch it, but do watch it from the beginning.
B0096CDG0O|4.0|I have had shared quite a few games with my family, who live a long way from me. Just wish you could invite more than one person at a time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A great game that is fun to play and is very addicting. Puzzles are easy at first but get more and more challenging as you progress. Highly recommended.
B009CGAMK6|5.0|This is a wonderful performance.  Sure to be a classic.  I would highly recommend adding this to your video library.
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|not even as good as the first...not scary at all more like sex fetish creepy I am a very liberal media watcher but this was just weird  I kept watching which was creepy then after &#34;spilt milk&#34; called it a day
B004RZGUBM|5.0|While I would love for more ebooks to provide annotated editions of classics, this edition is well done and surprisingly, the illustrations do enliven the works.
B00000K2W1|5.0|Last year I was rummaging through a batch of photographs from my youth and in only one picture did I totally appear to relax my guard. It marked my fourteenth birthday which is when I received this album. I wore my braces proudly in the photo holding this LP and I even looked a bit cross-eyed too. Janis would have loved this picture and I loved this album with its motorcycle mama cover of her. I had hungered for this only for \\"Piece of My Heart\\". Her brazen vocals supported by the fire-starting Big Brother made for her signature and most boisterous rocker. Little did I know or care that there were more wonderful surprises in store. The supercharged live version of \\"Down On Me\\", again with Big Brother, blew me away and it was completely different than the studio single. Her subsequent groups, The Kozmic Blues Band and Full-Tilt Boogie, smoothed down the rough edges. But she compromised absolutely nothing in the emotion of the songs. The ease and nuance in the country-rock \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" helped me to grasp what soul-searching was all about in an artist. I bled my vinyl copy almost white, but it still plays. The two bonus cuts that close out this edition don't take away any of the cohesion. The humorous \\"Mercedes Benz\\" couldn't be more apt a finish, considering it was the last thing she ever laid down. Let this be viewed as the basic primer of who she was. Her free will was her aesthete. She has cross-generational appeal because her free will was not confined to hippiedom at all.
B00973902K|5.0|This song is the fun, poppy, dance song that can be enjoyed by many. Everyone can relate to the meaning of it too.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I gave this 5 stars because I really enjoyed this movie version of FFVII, with an insight into the true personality of the characters.. I also thought the graphics of this cg movie were absolutely top rate.
B003ZHQVJO|4.0|We don't like all of Kid Rocks music and lyrics but there are a couple songs especially Born Free that we enjoy listening to.
1594135851|3.0|There is a lot of repetition from The Hunger Games.  Not much print on each page.  Could have written a much shorter book and accomplished the same plot.  Tired of this scenerio
1451695195|4.0|informative and helpful book<br />Different perspective than from other authors on this subject with some good background information,easy to understand
0439023521|4.0|Book was OK.  I did read the second in the serier, but I doubt if I will read the third one
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This movie was great!  The action was also great!  If you like an action movie, this is the one to get.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|Great movie, the quality is as good as I expected. Please guys if you buy a movie do not tell us about the story, we all know why we want to buy it.
B005LAIHR2|3.0|I choose a three star movie because I liked the stars that were in the movie, but the story line was too familiar.  The music was great.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|Great movie, the quality is better then I expected, really good. Please guys if you buy a movie do not tell us about the story, we all know why we want to buy it.
B00A757EFW|5.0|it is a fun game, and if you have played this game before you will love it.  it has been awhile since I played it and trying to get the arrows to work is a challenge, but I am getting better
B00129H7VS|5.0|I bought this series because I liked it, I do not understand how someone can buy any movie and say they do not like it. THEN WHY DID THEY BUY IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. The quality is as good as I expected.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|My wife and I absolutely enjoyed Salmon Fishing in Yemen.  It is a well told story, with believable characters.  Trying to get salmon to Yemen and trying to make it work, is a bit far fetched, but then again, I was watching a work of fiction, and a good work of fiction it is.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I think Paul McCartney did a very good job with this CD. I personally like this stile of music. I can not tell you how many times I played it. A lot.
B007LE2VDM|5.0|Love her voice. She has her own original sound and style! Listen for yourself and see if she isn't one of your favorites.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire HD and it's very useful. I always know exactly how much battery is left. It does exactly what I need.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The unabridged book is worth the effort.  However, if you want to read the abridged first to get the main points of the story, you will only miss the marvelous descriptions of daily life in 18th century Paris.  Either way, Les Mis is a must read.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The book was full of british witty humor, but on another level it gave you alot to think about. Loved it
B0084IG7KC|3.0|I got this for my wife for Christmas.  The Blu-ray is fine, but i was disappointed that it did not come with a DVD copy.  I only say that because she likes to watch movies on the car DVD on road trips.  Also, I tried to put the digital copy on my iPad and it transferred to it, but it does not work.  It plays but it is just a black screen the whole time. I would try for another purchase if I were to do it again.
B007REV4YI|4.0|My rating is for the film I saw at the theater. This title has not been released to DVD as of 01/18/13 and yet it already has 181 reviews. I've heard of \\"early reviews\\" but this is ridiculous. Obviously people are reviewing the theatrical release and not the DVD which can be two different critters depending on what special features the DVD might have, price vs. entertainment value, etc. I've always wondered how Amazon can start posting DVD reviews on a DVD movie BEFORE it is released to DVD? That said, it is one of the best Bond films in many years.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|i really liked this book!! i pretty much read this in a day and a half!! i would recommend to others!!
B006QF61VA|5.0|This movie is my favorite classic.  So many great moments to remember.  Very funny, very sad.  Everyone should see it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Me and my sister arent abble to connect on minecraft.we could very easily the first time then a week later we tried again and it failed.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Enjoyable, fast-paced story. Wonderfully described characters. Suspenseful enough to want to not stop reading till you Finns out what happened.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Am older and never played any games before but got my new kindle fire at Christmas and decided to try this free app.  I am so enjoying it.  This game is challanging and frustrating at times.  Glad that instuction comes on before a new bird is introduced.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I'm loving S8 of supernatural. I feel like the writers have let the brothers grow,and their learning who is other is now,and becoming brothers again. I love the introduction of the tablets,and cant wait to see where that takes the boys. I also love Benny,I do hope we see him carry over into S9. I love the introduction of new lore,and new characters. okay so what can I say i just LOVE IT...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I adored this book..it has really stirred emotions an feelings inside of me making me very curious in regards to this lifestyle.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was filled with more twists and turns than I could have possibly asked for! It was a fantastic read.
B000AP04NI|4.0|i want get the set with south paciffic  and oklahoma and others.<br />please acept my appology for not getting this dvd.<br /><br />respectfully<br /><br />Jody colllyer
1451695195|5.0|This book is well written and thought provoking.  It helps reinforce my faith in a hereafter and helps me argue the point with my kids.
0312370849|5.0|Recommendation by my daughter.  Another close up story ( from the Holocaust period ) and there are millions, who won't be written, If this world does NOT change the course of history for the positive good in people, it is a shame.  But this story was meant to be read and discussed for future generations.
140131046X|5.0|Mitch Albom's books always stimulate thought and refection and a internalization of why we have the faith that we have.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is Susan's VERY BEST album to date!  You can tell these songs are things that she loved and loved doing.  (( I love them too.))  Been watching her achieve her dream for years, and am thrilled to &#34;share from afar&#34; the blooming of the Rose!  BRAVO SUSAN !!!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book is honestly one of the best I've read! The only issue I have with it is that Clary is a total wimp who screams at danger & let's the men do all the work & battling. I would have liked it all the way if she stood up for herself & fought for herself.
159420411X|4.0|I found myself skipping around (sorry, I hate baseball and poker as topics) to get to the economics and financial markets related chapters, which were somewhat interesting, but nothing earth-shatteringly new, and which hasn't in some way been covered by other authors like Mauboussin in 'Think Twice'.  I was happy to see the mention of Bayes Theorem as a way to improve forcasting. Remember the Monte Hall problem from probablity class?<br /><br />If a second edition comes out it would benefit from some proof reading (clumsey sentences trip up reading flow) and error checking (figure 1-2 not really consistent with the related text...so should I use 20.4% or 5% across the board as default probability?; figure 11-9 pie charts are mislabled). Also, on page 246 the probabilities implied by the figure 8-4 details don't fully jibe with the probabilities mentioned on page 245.<br /><br />Otherwise, I would recommend this book to those who have not been exposed to practical forecasting, and would like to see how it's done across a wide swath of subjects.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The only problem is when it updates. It erases all of your progress. Other that that, its pretty fun, I love it.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I love NCIS and I feel like it just keeps getting better and better! I hope they keep it up for another ten seasons!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Took an interesting turn when he went off the grid.  He always follows his instincts and it leads him to the answer.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Best John Grisham in a long time. Kept me guessing till the end. Was rooting for the main character the whole time.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This is a great game and I enjoyed the sequel just as much!! The game was challenging but not impossible. More of these please!!!!
0307887960|3.0|The Dukan Diet  Didn't seem to live up to the claims it makes about losing weight. Lost 21/2 lbs. after 5 days, following the diet and didn't cheat once. Will try for another 5 days.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop offers a great selection of apps that allow you to use your phone to interact with your computer. This one in particular allows you to stream your desktop to your phone and interact with it via touch gestures. It works great, both over the internet by way of Gmail account linking, as well as over a LAN connection. Although there are many other similar desktop streaming services out there, I highly recommend this one as it allows other Splashtop apps to interact with your computer while only using one program on your computer. Fun to play with, and it has saved me a couple of times when I needed a document on my computer Dropboxed to me.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Best movie we've seen in a while. Fast jokes, fun songs, cute plot.<br />Fun for everyone (age appropriate, of course )
B00884GR0W|5.0|Runs pretty well, and is cheaper then the minecraft app. I would recommend this over it. It also has quests and stuff, which is really awesome, and is a step ahead of the desktop version of minecraft. Updated pretty often, and is only getting better. I highly recommend this app.
B00A8SPNYW|1.0|As far as I can tell a toolbar is covering some buttons on the play screen, making it impossible to restart a level or undo an action without going back to the level select screen.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It's pretty addictingly simple. I suggest you stay away, but it is good for random entertainment. Visuals work fine, but there are advertisements, as expected of a free app.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I can't get enough of Clancy, He'll always be at the top of my list and Threat Vector will not let you down if your a Jack Ryan fan.
B00633W614|5.0|Excellent writing.  Can't wait for the next chapter.  I highly recommend this book as well as any other of Jeffrey Archer's endeavors.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love everything about this show.  Best drama on television.  The characters are so complex.  The acting is superb.  It's been a long time since I've seen anything this good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have gotten a addiction to this game it's a great puzzle game and definitely helps you use up some free time. 5 stars all the way around
B00992CF6W|5.0|TOTALLY AWESOME AND THE BEST  GAME OF  ALL TIME.  LOVE  THIS GAME IT IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE GAME.  I  LUV IT!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's really fun and I like my horse and the game is fun and I like horse and I like the game
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is fun but i wish amazon stays on track with the new apps like fun run, temple run 2, and clash of clans.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Simply amazing. The book keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Very well written , you can't go wrong with this series
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Absolute drivel. Terribly written,repetitive,and not worth spending more words critiquing it.<br />Read @ 50 pages, and realized what a waste of time it was. Stopped.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|This series has been a complete joy to read :) The characters are so well describe. Cole is my favorite!!! The ending to Forever is definitely a little weird because I was more expecting Cole to have found a permanent cure. I wish there would be a follow up book about Sam and Grace's life together. And if Cole and Isabel ever meet up... Still it's a FANTASTIC book <3 (FYI my favorite part was when Cole and Isabel learn that they love each other) :) Time to find another amazing werewolf series :)
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I would say that this is a good book for young adults. Teenagers are on the whole an unpredictable lot. Surviving the districts is takes luck skill,friends and not making any waves . When will kids ever learn?
B000FC0P9E|5.0|As always Stephen king writes marvelous books. Well written.Good book of you are a baseball fan. Definitely recommend. Confusing at some points.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I wasn't very happy with it at all..it was completely wrong when I received it. And it was completely the wrong size
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is very romantic and worth reading! Love a happy ending! My favorite part through this book is that Connor always had Megan back love it
B00A77II0U|5.0|Stray Souls caught my interest right off in the beginning.  It is very hard to put down once it's started.  I hope that there going to be another Stray Souls game.  The only problem is that it is a short game.
B000FC11A6|5.0|While hard to plow through at times, well worth the gems discovered. Insightful and honest reflection of hacker's view of the world.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|My 2 boys enjoy playing this game. Wish we could find it on their tablet so I can have my Kindle.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I just can't get over how well Josh Brolin mimics Tommy Lee Jones!  Really spooky and darn wonderful to watch.  Kudos to all those that created a three-quel that stands up to the original!
B005T87QCI|4.0|My 2 boys love this game because the movie is their favorite. I just wish we could find ut on their tablets so I can have my kindle. Haha
B0049IHX2C|5.0|The roles continue to be tailor made for Smith and Jones.  Great fun, great laughs and worth the two hours!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it's her favor game in the world , can't stop playing it, sometime up all night and then angry in the morning
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|So many out there, and so many are wretched!  As bad as the William Hurt one is, this one isn't. Fassbender's Rochester is just the right amount of angry and broken and Wasikowska is a wonderful, mysterious Jane.  As with all movies, much is left behind from the book, but a masterful effort just the same.  Characters are very truly portrayed all through and the lighting is spooky as heck.  Definitely worth the watch!
B00B19DMUE|5.0|OMG! I LOVED THIS MOVIE, Great movie what more can I say to get you to watch this :) Icould watch this over and over :)
B00005AR3G|5.0|You MUST see this just to LISTEN to the performance by Eartha Kitt as Izma.  The entire cast is wonderful, but she delivers the performance of a lifetime.  Just amazing from start to finish.  Never get tired of her delightful, over the top delivery!  Don't miss t!
1451620829|4.0|pretty good read from Peter Criss.  Kind of typical rags to riches and drug abuse story  that goes with rock stardom but still good to see some of the inside stuff as well.  Hope this guy finds some sort of peace in his life, it's been a crazy ride!
B009E3EY38|5.0|any Zep fan would really appreciate this, Jason Bonham goes above and beyond the call of duty in this DVD...totally worthy buy...
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It does the job and easy to use! And the best part it's FREE.  Would highly recommend to my friends!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|A must for 3D collection now that you can get it on Blu-Ray.  I waited a year for the Panasonic contract to end so I could use on my Samsung 3D TV
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I loved this book so much and my favourite part is when Greg is trying to look good at the end in front of a girl
B009A9ETFE|5.0|I think this collection sums up the past 20 years of HIM music perfectly.<br />For those new to HIM's music then this is a fantastic place to start. You get 19 of their strongest songs and 1 new song, which is a rather lovely cover of Strange World. You get a great range of their work all on one cd, and it's a great place to sample each album without having to buy it outright first.<br />For the fans this is the perfect way to stave off the withdrawals we've all been having waiting for the new album to drop. Most fans will probably have the songs already listed but in addition to the newest cover most of these are 'radio edits' so they are slightly different than the normal studio versions, though not by much.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Clancy at his best.  Jack Ryan Jr. is becoming more of the main character as he eases out John Clark, but slowly.  Clark still has many good years left.<br /><br />A real page turner.
B00AYL7OAY|5.0|Just to give some context, I've been a Yo La Tengo fan since I first listened to Painful in 1993. YLT fans have come (unfairly) to expect nothing short of brilliance from each and every new release by the band. And the Yo Las have delivered on that expectation again and again. At worst, a YLT album is a really good album. At best, it's so good it changes your life. I am always careful not to make any judgments about a new YLT release until I've lived with it awhile. YLT albums (and the band itself) tend to be \\"growers\\". It takes awhile for me to digest a YLT release before I can really form an opinion.<br /><br />Having now listened to this record several times a day every day since its release earlier this week, I can now say it's a masterpiece, on par with And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out, and maybe even I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One.<br /><br />The opener, \\"Ohm\\", is absolutely stunning, drawing in the listener and setting the stage for some of the themes that will be revisited in the songs to come. It's also one of the catchiest songs the band has ever written. \\"Is That Enough\\" and \\"Well You Better\\" revisit the pop and R&B territory YLT first explored on I Am Not Afraid of You... and Popular Songs. \\"Paddle Forward\\" is a fantastic soft-focus indie rocker, and sounds similar to \\"Cherry Chapstick\\". \\"Stupid Things\\" is a real standout, opening with a beautiful guitar introduction like only Ira can devise, with strange dissonant pulsations in the background. Then the song settles into a groove that slowly takes us to a beautifully lush refrain resonating with emotion.<br /><br />The most beautiful song on the album is \\"I'll Be Around\\". The song and Ira's guitar playing both evoke the most arresting works of Bert Jansch or Nick Drake, and Ira's vocal performance sells lyrics that in another context might come off as trite. Here, they are powerful and full of emotional depth and meaning.<br /><br />The album closes much as it opened, with another mesmerizing track with a driving rhythm and lyrics that seem to acknowledge both the meaninglessness and meaningfulness of life. As the song builds and builds with layers of brass and vocals, we are left feeling somehow uplifted and restored. The conclusion that is made is that yes, life is painful and finite and confusing, but life is also beautiful and funny and fun. And we can help each other see that.<br /><br />There are a few notable departures in this album. First, it has the shortest play time since Fakebook, second, there are none of the 13-plus-minute tracks we've come to expect. Third, this album is not produced by Roger Moutenot, who has been at the helm of every Yo La album since Painful. The band turned to equally-revered producer John McEntire. I'm a big fan of both men, and always enjoyed the collaboration between Moutenot and the band. But McIntyre's subtle influence shows here and there with a somewhat more detailed approach to rhythmic elements, a more midrange-centric tonality, layering of soundscapes behind the music and some slightly more adventurous effects processing. At this point in YLT's career, working with either producer would have made for similar and equally rewarding results, I imagine, but the production makes for a nice (subtle) change of setting for the band's music.<br /><br />The album seems to be bringing a few new fans to Yo La Tengo, which is wonderful. Hopefully they will be motivated to check out the band's many excellent releases, especially those from their golden period of 1993-2000. For those who have followed the band on their long journey, the rewards are many in Fade. It's a mature, beautiful and emotionally open release from indie's most beloved band.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|this is a challenging game of mahjong. I like the fact that it is timed and has so many options
B006X5L6VS|3.0|I thought this would make identifying stars easier for me. I still haven't figured out how to use the whole program.  The directions have left a lot to be desired.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this album. Ed Sheeran's raw talent shines through in virtually every song. I'm particularly partial to the tracks \\"U.N.I.,\\" \\"You Need Me, I Don't Need You,\\" and \\"Little Bird.\\"
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|I was looking for an app to just take notes on. I really don't need it for anything else. I did not want to pay for anything until I tried one first. This app does exactly what it says it does. It is easy to use and for what I want works great. It does need better instructions but it is very easy to figure out. The reason I got this one is to see how it worked and maybe upgrade to the pay version. I recommend if you just want to take notes.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I watched this movie on showtime this morning and i loved it so im looking to buy the video now its incredible!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|It ties the history of events leading to WW I thru a fictional cast..I downloaded it to my Kindle. I think it has 1800 pages. I am only 25% done with the book.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This is such a compelling love story. A love that last through time. I loved it!  I highly recommend it. Especially if you are a Nicolas Sparks fan.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game because I like to build my town of animals. I am an animal lover all the way. Anyone who loves animals should get littlest pet shop.
0439023513|5.0|Words cannot describe how much I loved reading these series. I couldn't believe how captivated I was by these books.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|its a good game but it would be beter if you could play with your frinds or family. if you could then you play aginst your family or play with them
1400023343|5.0|This book is very easy to read even when busy with a kid. I finished it in two days, just by reading after putting my baby to sleep. The author is not a native speaker, so there are no phrases or expressions difficult to understand for a non-native reader as myself. It's filled with friendly tips presented with normal every day language of a mom, avoiding any scientific spam filling the pages with evidence and boring you to death.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this series. One tip- try to make the jokes actually funny. I read this book like a hundred times. They should make a video game of it. I love this book
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A good toilet game. I potty daily and play daily, it works out swell. Guess what I'm doing now?  Would reccomend.
1400049628|5.0|I am not even a reader (at all), but once I picked this book up I couldn't set it down. I read more than half of it in one night, very informative as well, the information doesn't just apply to Zombie survival, but survival in general as well, which could be detrimental to you. The actual physical quality of the book itself is pretty legitimate as well.
B002APU580|5.0|Beautiful movie. Can watch this over and over. Fast turn around from Amazon.  I order all my movies from here.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|my little brothers and sister play on this app all of the time! and it doesn't have any adds that I have seen yet. this is even better because they can't buy anything. 5 stars definitely
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|There are so many questions to be answered but with the best hope of actually beating the titans. I can't wait for more.
B002ZJSURY|5.0|I enjoyed the story as much as I enjoyed the TV series which is why I bought all the books in the series.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|Pros:  Bought two of these because it had the better on-board graphics and ivy bridge.  Came with a very nice cooling fan.<br /><br />Cons:  None<br /><br />Would recommend this to anyone.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gripping...get through first 100 pages and take off!  I want to read her other two books now.  Not usually a mystery fan, but really enjoyed this book

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very intense...Held my interest completely....Recommend highly....Do not read Grisham very often but this was a great book. I will read more of his books.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love this book soooooo much. I just wish that there were more to the book. Maybe a series? Its just a can't look away novel
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Very impressive work! Taking a simple yet fresh idea and executing on it superbly.<br />Refreshing to find this getting the attention it rightfully deserves.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I can't say enough about this book.  I was hooked from page 1. Enzo is an old dog and he tells you the story of his life with his original family and with his human family. Enzo loves watching documentaries - he watched one where he learned that the last incarnation before human was dog, so he spends a great deal of time preparing to be human in his next life. He loves watching racing videos - his human, Denny, is a race car driver.<br /><br />While reading this book there were times when I laughed out loud, where I was so angry I wanted to smack some of the characters and other parts where I sobbed. In the end, it was still an uplifting and affirming book,<br /><br />I read this book more than a year ago. This past Halloween a 3 year old trick or treater dressed as a race car driver came to my door.  His name is Enzo.  It totally freaked me out!  Once you read this book you will understand why. His parents had not read the book. I made the mother promise me she would.  I hope she has.  It really is fabulous.  I can't wait to read it again.
B009329ZF2|5.0|It's a movie, it's fun, watch it.  It's not made to be an Oscar, it's made to entertain and escape and that it delivers.  I really liked it and will watch it again more than once, I'm sure.
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|Do you love movies where actors phone it in?  The sci fi plot is generic? And the action is by the numbers bland? Then get out of surrogates way! It's a blast that will blow your mind right open!
B000ICXQGK|5.0|Might have to be in the mood for this kind of film but if you are -- I really appreciated the portrayal.<br />Often films that take ridiculous liberties leave behind the audience but I thought the directing took this along just great considering 90% of the film had to portray of place, btw, no one knows anything about tbh.  Good job.  I didn't think going in that I'd even consider watching this more than once but indeed I may, which isn't typical for me.  Thought provoking movie.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Along with the original vacation this is the best of the Chevy Chase 'Vacation' movies.  It's a Christmas watching tradition at my house.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I've used many other thermal grease before but this one is one of the best. grease goes on easily and seem to be thicker than other paste.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great alarm clock app with plenty of options like having to solve math problems to snooze and you van choose the difficulty of the math, too.  Lots of other things to set if you want as well.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|One of the best in the series.  I don't think it had much language in it, and was great.  Seriously good!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Not sure if it's because I wasn't expecting much or if this book is as good as I think it is, but I really enjoyed it!  I was expecting more at the end, but not sure what that \\"more\\" could possibly be unless the book was at least another 500 or more pages.  I highly recommend this book!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I liked this movie, it was a great chick flick.  Definately not for children!!  If it wasn't for the language that was used  in the movie it would be spectular!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Everyone should have this app. It is great play on the go and my 10 year old plays it now too and she loves it.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Rats cooking?  Yup, that is what makes this such a fun movie.  Kids and adults a like will love this fun filled movie.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|love this game easy to play and it works on my kindle fire thanks glu I give you s 5 on all your games
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Good movie, love how they keep coming up with new things and toys.  I really like the Dark Knight series, and they keep getting better.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It is very funny you Will love the book I forgot the price but it was worth it . But loved loved it.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|I watched this movie, it had a lot of twists and turns and kept you guessing.  Not a movie for kids!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|A brilliantly cast show, Elementary provides a modern update of Sherlock Holmes set in today's New York City.  While I completely love the cast and the writing, my favorite part of the show is that is retains a Victorian mood,  It's great.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|It does what it's designed to do. It does it well and it does it for free. The only reason I can't give it 5/5 is that labels tend to overlap one another into an unreadable bundle when there's multiple routers or channels being displayed. Other than that, it's most helpful in finding the strongest WiFi signal when I need one. It's easy and simple to use. That's elegance.
B000ICZCZS|5.0|Brilliant storytelling!  Great characters... you can't help falling in love with them and wishing you could climb into the screen and hang out with them!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This application does a damned good job of emulating MS Office on the Kindle. While functions are a bit on the light side, it remains surprisingly robust. It imports \\"Word\\" and \\"Excel\\" documents with few errors and even maintains cell formulas. I'd hate to use it in creating any large documents from scratch, but in a pinch, it's great. Bottom line, I'd buy it again - absolutely.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Spellbinding, I saw the Swedish Trilogy and was amazed, but the book is so much better. Very well written. Highly recommended.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I found much liking in this book. Although it was not a book that I read nonstop I found it to be very good. The main character was very relatable in ways an  had a great story to tell. My  appreciation goes to Stephen Chbosky for writing this story well and making it easy to follow along with. A short and tasteful book I would most definitely read again.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Beloved Edmund Gwenn, a secondary but deluxe actor. In Spain he acted in a film of the years 50's titled 'Calabuch' whose work in it was very appreciated.
B002RI9PKO|5.0|Malcolm's Outliers is an immersive read that draws you in and spits you out hoping that you are part of some success pattern that you haven't quite recognised yet (and wondering just how many hours you've spent doing that thing you dream of being successful at). The book provides examples of outliers who achieved phenomenal success through luck, circumstance and practical intelligence. It's an illuminating slant on the psychology of success.<br /><br />Aspects of Outliers probably seep into my [...] philosophy in that location and practice will determine the type of life you lead.
B003B02PFO|3.0|Chosen for our book club's early January meeting. It was appropriately seasonal. Even though it was fairly predictable, it was a good read.  A change from usual John Grisham!
B005I2KDR0|2.0|Love the look and weight of the watch, but the solar battery just doesn't last long enough. If I don't wear the watch for a couple if days the battery dies and you can't just wind and set the watch, you have to let it charge again
B002EXAB5K|4.0|The combination of using a lot of CGI and developing the story line makes the movie a bit lengthy, but it was necessary.  With the CGI alone, the story would have been as shallow as the 70s version of King Kong, which is quite lame.  This was fun and took us to another level of CGI Dinos even after the Jurassic Park franchise.  A few story line flaws, but its a sci-fi movie, not Shakespeare, dudes!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Great book tons of action and fun.<br />I recommend this book to anyone that likes a good story.<br />It Is pretty long but it bis worth it.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|super easy to watch and as corny as it is - it's a good clean story line with some well executed juvenile humor that most adults will appreciate.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|Well researched and A LOT to work on. It might be bunk but I won't know for 2 months. Hoping to greet summer 60 lbs. lighter and with an erection.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire.  I prefer this one over my iPhone version of the app.  That one doesn't make it easy to pin new stuff from the web.
B0000549B0|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend and his dad. We all enjoyed watching it many times. The price was right!
B005LAIGTG|3.0|The dvd &#34; The Vow &#34;came a head of time,and was in very good condition. My only problem with it is that I have trouble playing it on my Blu-ray player. I can play it straight thru,but I can't pause it or rewind it. I'm not sure what the problem is. The Blu-ray player is new.
1416563156|5.0|Great quality.  The binding and cover look so authentic, like a rich leather.  The graphics and text are very realistic, so it is a great gift for our 3rd grade grandson who is an Indiana Jones- a - holic.  He will be ecstatic.
B008NMT684|4.0|Our 2 year old loves these puzzles! great fun while on the go!<br /><br />even our 5 year old enjoys making them!
0765325950|4.0|I really liked this book. How things unfolded I did not see coming. And that is a good thing. How Rand fights the last battle was excellent and consistent with the story. By that I mean it did not contradict the other books and, in fact, required you know several things written in an earlier book to understand. There are losses, ones I did not anticipate. And while that was sad, it too was good because it was unexpected. There was misdirection where you thought certain characters were changing but really they were just pretending to try to gain an advantage. The story was gripping and I found myself reading whenever I possibly good.<br /><br />However, the ending, the epilogue, was short. Very short. It felt rushed. Like \\"the last battle is over now, the end\\". I very much wished that after the last battle, the book told us how the main characters adjusted to their new life. I wished it told us a little more about how the world changed. The end felt like it was rushed. The end was very unsatisfying.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|My husband and I first started with the free version of this App because we rarely pay money for any of our Apps, however after 2 weeks of using this every night we decided this is an App worth investing in. We found no fault in the free version but thought it would be worth the money for additional sounds. We use this App on the Kindle Fire HD and and love playing around with all the sound options. My husband has trouble sleeping, but since we have started using this App he says he now finds it a lot easier to fall back asleep when he wakes in the middle of the night. We had tried melatonin and other over the counter sleep medicine and this is the first thing he has said helps him sleep. My recommendation: start with the free version, if you find you are using it frequently and want to add the additional sound options, then buy the paid version. The only difference between the two are the additional sound selections.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good selection of sounds in both the free and the paid versions, but the paid has even more.<br /><br />Has a timer you can set to turn off when you choose if you don't want it on all night (we keep it on all night though so when my husband wakes up he can easily fall back asleep)<br /><br />You can create favorite sound combinations and save  for future use, even creating your own name for the sound combinations.<br /><br />You can adjust the sound options so you decide what sounds are more prominent.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Some sound options do not have a steady volume so if you are using it to sleep it can be distracting, however there are enough options that do have constant sounds, so we just don't use them.<br /><br />All in all-for sleeping aids this is by far our favorite App.  We have never used this App for meditation or with headphones, but for what we have used it for- it works great! Highly recommended!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|First of all, I'm not an audiophile or am not aware if I was one. However, I do listen to a wide variety of music including rock, pop, (a lot of) classical, hip hop, so I'm your normal average Joe. And here's my short take: Like what everyone's been saying, the built quality and the sound quality are extremely good! No complaint in these departments. I did take off one star because of the discomfort. I have average (if not smaller than average) head and ears, and these cans are just barely circumaural. The right cup barely fits comfortably over my ear, but the left one does not (guess how I know my ears have slightly different sizes?). So after about an hour of being pinched, my left ear would become red and irritated, and well, that can certainly distract me from enjoying music. I'm hoping that after a while, they will loosen up a bit, but as I already have them for about 2 weeks, I don't think there's much of that, so I'm considering returning it for another different pair. I'll give you an update later.<br />To sum up, if you have larger than average (I'm curious to know that the official \\"average\\" ear size is), you will experience discomfort during and after use. I would suggest that you try them out in a store before buying them. I didn't do that and so regretting it.<br /><br />Update 09/24/2013:<br /><br />I've been using this for over 8 months now. The sound quality is still, if not even more, superb. The good news is that somehow the left cup now fits my ear! It's comfy to wear now! Although it can get hot during the summer, and the cans can (pun intended) get quite irritating if sweat gets on it. So I would suggest an occasional clean with some gentle cleaning agent. But overall, the only thing I regret is that I bought this for about $90, and now it's $80.
0525953728|5.0|The drama and tension .... My husband and I both  could not put the book down. If you wonder how these things happen this is the book to read. I will be forever grateful to all these brave men.  They save our lives over and over again.  I pray for them every day
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Not only rich in detail but full of insight into the time.  Funny how similar the political process of Lincoln's time is to the Obama era.  I guess things really don't change at all!  The reason he was elected was because he was so much smarter politically than his rivals.  What a revelation!  Like a game of chess!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked it, but I think I saw this before in film. I will wait for the movie to come on dvd. There is a nice twist in the end.
B0097L29KM|5.0|Great music though the jams might have been shorter, impressive trifold packaging and glorious analog sound.  The only thing I didn't like was the tiny lyric booklet.
0307454568|5.0|Though I wasn't impressed when I first started reading, once I got interested, couldn't put it down,  I read all three books in the series
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Very fun story, it's been some time since I 've craved a book. The reference s were easily entertaining on their own.
0345529057|5.0|The set was a gift to my granddaughter (second year college student) and she was thrilled she got the set!
B002PJN59M|5.0|It was a gitf,she loved it. What more can I say,it wasnt for me.blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Love this app. It lets you know how much time you have left on your battery and when to charge. I bought the app from the Amazon \\"one click\\" check out. So easy! And the price wasn't bad eather.
6305428352|5.0|It was a gitf,she loved it. What more can I say,it wasnt for me.blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I've watched Les Miserables on Broadway about 7 times. The last showing I saw, after a long time of not having seen it, was simply terrible and it made me wonder if it was the performance that was bad or perhaps the play just wasn't that good and the times I had seen and enjoyed it earlier were simply clouded by my youthful, inexperienced judgement.<br /><br />This movie is good. Very good. Much more touching than I remembered it as a young man. The singing isn't perfect but heartfelt and sincere. I remember watching the movie with Liam Nealson (who I like as an actor, by the way)and being disgusted with the whole production, but this newer version redeems the play in a way that I think many people, if they give it a chance, will be very happy with.<br /><br />I don't own many Blu-Ray's but this is most certainly something I intend to purchase since I also intend to watch many times throughout the course of my life.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didnt want to put this book down! I laughed and smiled and was sad throughout this book. And you instantly fall in love with Holder and Sky! The story line is great, I loved the characters, and it was very well written. Hope there is more to come! Would love to know what happens after.
0307341550|4.0|Intense page turner had me hooked very early. The twists and turns kept me wanting more.  As with Gillian Flynn's other two novels, I found myself up into the middle of the night to finish this one. I'm looking so forward to her next book!
1451695195|5.0|I am a believer.  I have worked with physician's and many others that have been just like him.  I never persuade, it is up to each person to believe or not.  This book is great for those that have been doubters and need the voice of a man of science, and perhaps a different way of describing how he remembers his journey.  I bought two copies of this book because I believe it is well written and others should read his words.  There are many that have no idea, and will not take the time to try to understand,unless led by someone else. The one person that I gave the book to is married to a physician and she loved loved the book also, saying I could not put it down.  Now I am trying to get  him to read it.  He(not mentioning name) is resisting but looked at it.  I will bet he will read it.<br />It is well worth reading.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love it so much I've played it three times on my kindle and am now playing it for the second time on my Android. I love the strategy and challenge each level adds. Fun for adults and the kids too. My boys 11, 9, 7 and 5 all enjoy playing.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I loved this book! It was funny cool great pictures nice handwriting I loved the words they were so funny
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A gritty, no nonsense account of over a decade of service as a SEAL culminating in the mission to find Osama Bin Laden. I really enjoyed the technical aspects of this story. You know these are the words of a real Operator in the theatre of war with the lack of fancy prose and a genuine humble demeanor.
0452273331|5.0|I bought for my husband. He couldn't put it down. Saw himself in it when starting out in architecture studies.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|This Griffin Technology NA16029 PowerMate USB Multimedia Controller works good with Windows 7 64-bit operating system and it was in good condition.
076115728X|5.0|This book was great for my daughter who struggles with perfectionist tendencies.  It was great for her to see that &#34;mistakes&#34; don't have to be a one-way ticket to square one, but it may be an opportunity to discover or create something different and new.  I love this book-- empowering message, creative illustrations and just plain FUN!
B005LAIHZY|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies so of course I'm going to give it a high rating. The package came on time and no delay. However I must stress that the case was broken. As a bluray collector I was very annoyed and jut thought it was lucky that I had an extra case laying around to trade them but other than that it was great.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Man this game as fun. The only one I like better is Angry Birds space.<br /><br />The Kenobi bird from Star Wars is a little lame with its powers, but Han solo and his blaster make up for it.
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|I purchased the free dictionary - Merriam-Webster.  It shows in my apps however no matter where I go cannot find a download.  I deleted it and then repurchased it.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|OK.  I am broad minded, but was  kind of ridiculous.  Both he and she are nutty.......she deserves what she gets.
B00999DFP0|5.0|We love this show and wanted to have the collection for ourselves even though it is on TV every day! As a family, we are now watching the episodes in order and realizing there are several we have never seen! It is a great show, mild mature humor, with a real sweetness about the characters. We love Sheldon of course, but Laurie Metcalf as Sheldon's mom is hysterical. And we all require that someone sing &#34;Soft Kitty&#34; whenever we are feeling down. BBT is part of our daily culture!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in quite some time. It kept me up late into the night, and on the edge of my seat.
B00008438V|5.0|Bought this as a birthday present for our son.  It is one of his all time favorite movies.  Recommend it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So addicting I cant put it down:) The only downside is that it takes forever to restore energy &amp; to get diamonds.

B0086700CM|5.0|I think it's a good game but I want temple run 2 and I won't let me so I'm pretty mad
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent, insightful book.<br />The compatibility of science and spirituality are explored and proven. The author keeps you involved and interested throughout.

B00004VVND|4.0|I had seen it before, and  wanted it in my collection.- Act;ually got a dvd  this time instead of blue ray
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good as we're the other 2.  They are must reads.  A little to morbid for teenagers.  Can't wait for the movies.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Probably the most beautiful book I've every read!  Touching journey of two kids trying to face something kids should never ahve to face.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|5stars<br />I would recommend this book to a highschool English teacher.<br />It would be a great idea to read to the students every day. This was a book that really makes you stop and think.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|Fun  for a little while, but didn't take long to get bored. It's fun riding the machines, and the idea that you can fly, but doesn't have any levels.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Hard to read. Slow start. Reading in short segments difficult. Having seen the play, the book seemed different in many aspects.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Once i got used to the flashback/forward rhythm of the story I couldn't put it down. Morton's characters were all so interesting, I couldn't help getting emotionally involved.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Calculater Pro. Great app, large letters, like the fact in turns into a scientific calculater when turned sideways. Well worth the price.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is the most emotional boon I have ever read. I love it. I will totally read the rest of the series.
B009JZVT70|5.0|This is a must watch.  Everyone needs to watch this show,  the characters are amazing, the stories are mesmerizing,  the cliff hangers are a b!tch though.
B005HSL626|3.0|I love the game until it stopped working it was really fun though I wish u guys would fix this
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Another exciting volume by this prolific author, ths time about Ivan, Miles' cousin.  Bujold introduces us to yet another kind of beings, the jewels, created by the same genetic manipulations we've seen before from the Haut ladies of Cetaganda.  Ivan begins to mature through a series of experiences that ultimately lead him to fall in love.  A great read.  Looking forward to the next volume.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is awesome you update it to get new levels and superpowers don't buy the HD just get this full version for free!
B008NF45S2|4.0|I was delighted how easy this app was to use.  It found my wireless printer right away and I was able to print a successful test page.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I wish Zeus was in the game also atom,twin cities.But it's still awesome you can punch their parts off.GET THIS APP!!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This drama is so close to current events and I'm so curious as to what the story line would take.  Watching it I felt drawn in as if it's actually happening.  The cast complement each other and they fit like a jigsaw puzzle.  I can't wait for the next episode.  I would recommend NCIS to anyone who'd listen to me.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great game in an ocean of lame wanna be games. Not sure if people are just stupid or have low standards or all of the above but this game should be a baseline standard that all smartphone games should achieve. However, they clearly do not meet this standard.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|The first half of this book relates experiences from Mr. Frankl's days as a Holocost prisoner.  He shares some of the day to day psychological effects of being a prisoner - very powerful.

B009G9Z08S|5.0|BATMAN will forever be my favorite hero, no matter how dark or grim his stories become. I love the fact that he gets dangerously close to the line of never coming back. AND I CANT WAIT UNTIL PART 2 COMES OUT. It should truely be phenominal.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Manning Deluxe is hours of fun. Keeps you wanting to challenge the games timer and very addicting. What better way to keep the mind sharp and still enjoy a calming game.
B003B02O7I|4.0|Keeping it fresh for his readers and himself, John Grisham explores action and spirituality in this novel about one mans journey from the depths of personal hell to a life of purpose.
B009X01FJS|1.0|This case is a standing case...you cannot adjust it to be tilted back...it is almost sitting straight up in each adjustment.  I bought this case because the description stated you could charge your device while in the case.  That is very misleading as you must leave the case completely open in order to charge it...taking up a lot of space and leaving your device open and unprotected..  The case is very awkward to use and you cannot fold it back to use your device because it does not lay flat. A complete waste of money...I would never tell anyone else to purchase one.
B008LP8QE8|5.0|Gostei do sistema de busca em livro identico ao impresso.<br />Quanto ao conteudo ja conhecido pelos profissionais da area.  Impecavel como sempre desde a escola de medicina

B00280LYHS|5.0|Great ending to the books. Can't wait to read the lost hero. Rick riordan is my new favorite author by far.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A little mystery and intrigue involving the book world and a whirl wind cast of character.  Definitely kept me reading page to page.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have this clock app on my kindle Fire as I needed an alarm and this does the job very well. The free version which I use gives you 3 different Alarms and give you the local weather which is very nice. The screen is a nice soft night light blue. It's very simple to set the alarms and you can have many pre set Alarms. The Alarm will go off no matter what app is running or not running on your device. all you need to do is leave your device on and even with the screen in saver mode or dark it will still go off. Great Alarm App and nice Clock with the added local weather in the upper corner.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Holder and Sky wow... This book had it all. Love, betrayal, secrets, lust I could go on and on about this book. Colleen Hoover has done it again.. A must read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing and I have spent hours reading this book. I really really like this book and I recommend this book.
B007ZZKWHY|1.0|The ad does advertise that there is a digital copy.  However the disc I received did not have this feature.  And per the return policy of amazon it can't be returned since I removed the wrap. The only way you can know if the digital copy is there is to remove the wrap where you usually find the insert with the code to activate the digital copy.  So don't order this item for the extra price of $28 if you are wanting to have the digital copy available.  Amazon please update the ad to be consistent with what is really delivered.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a very fun game but looks aren't everything because it's challenging like other g5 related games. One of the best so far.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Great price for  3d move and got it the day its available on dvd what more can you ask for
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think I found a solution for apps. When you don't need Wi-Fi go to device and disable it that should stop ads. Then when you need it just able it again. Hope this helps.
B00846REIS|5.0|I'm a real sucker for broken men. (Not in real life...far too complicated) I'm also a sucker for stories about the redemptive properties of love. This book kicks that concept in the nuts. It's so much more than that. Two broken souls trying to heal each other and hurting in the process. Lots of smoking hot sex scenes. I love that this is a series. If it had been just one book, the story would have been rushed and unfulfilling. You don't want the story to end in happily ever after because it doesn't seem exactly right for these two. At least not yet. This is the type of story you have to see through to the end because it's obviously a train wreck you can't keep your eyes off of. There's so much passion and fire between them. Their relationship is so volatile at times. They make me crazy reading the back and forth between them. It all makes for great drama and a totally excellent read. Thank you Sylvia!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's derful, did I spell that right?<br />  Chunkymonkeyproducts@yahoo.com makes great cloth diapers!  I need 8words to leave this review, am I there yet?
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|An excellant though provoking challenge to any 'gamer'.<br />On the scope of the Angry BIRDS--MUCH enjoyment!<br />If one liked STAR WARS they will really like this<br />production.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love all of the authors books and again he did not let me down. Easy to read and the characters are so real . Really enjoyed reading.
B0053O89RY|5.0|The show touches ever base.  Very funny and smart.  Finally a show that makes me laugh and touches my heart.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a useful little app. Its projections for time left on the battery have  been accurate for reading and web surfing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Was an excellent book as always by a great writer. I look forward to seeing the movie when it comes out next month.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Works very well!! Love love love love love love love love love love love love. love love love love LOVE LOVE.
B009GED3HS|5.0|for it is good and awesome with a hint of redundancy. The Barney and Robin story arc is most intriguing
B005IEGUDY|4.0|I enjoyed reading about how the island of England became populated and how these people when from Stone age to current. The history was written from the point of view of people from different classes. The was also I lot of information about the changing philosophies and polices of the different classes.
B007712XAU|5.0|I got this series as a Xmas present for a friend who enjoys period productions, but now we're both hooked. Great acting, scenary, and story lines. It sucks you right in!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I am reading this at the same time i am reading william Manchester's final book about Churchhill during WWII.. A higher call is powerful in giving two pictures from opposing side of the war, but from a human perspective
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I have to paraphrase another reviewer on this one. This is some of his wildest, moodiest, most rocking blues ever. I could elaborate on that, but it is his best since &#34;Love and Theft&#34;.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great page turner...witty, wry and full of suspense.  I don't normally gravitate toward this type of novel, but I couldn't put it down.  Great read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I chose this rating because this book has been  my number 1 favorite for over 3 years. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
B003V1WXKU|4.0|Feynman's rambling (and somewhat disjointed) \\"memoir\\" provides an entertaining and at time very informative look into both the field of physics and life as he experienced them, through the medium of a succession of anecdotes. Some boring spots, but you get to see who and what he is. Good book for Feynman fans.
1849904251|5.0|Love it! Already finished reading it. The backstory behind the skull, the random objects in the room, and details about the cases are all very interesting, and the information about ACD's canon Sherlock Holmes is a very good references to look at when watching Sherlock.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good game to kill time with. Graphics are pretty good too.My kids love to play it but its a little difficult for the younger one.
B0037LXTUW|5.0|fun to play and it really gets you into each others minds quick to learn . . . . .
B00A757EFW|3.0|It's really a good game, but I'm not used to using the pen on a tool to move me. It's going to take some time to get used to that. I'm no good as it is now. So it's the user not the game.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love hidden object games. This one is great because it includes hidden objects and puzzles. It kept me busy and it didn't get boring. Fun game!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So glad that the books took the romantic turn and not the S & M route. Was not comfortable with that.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Great Movie, could even be true. Takes  one through several  human emotional tides. Wonderful relief from bad language, guns and violance.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|My 19 month granddaughter loves her new baby that Great Grandma bought.  It is safe and only the hat comes off and watching her taking if off and attempting to put it back on is enough entertainment for now.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|I must admit, that when this was first aired on Starz, I was pretty ticked off that it was only 6 Episodes long. But these are some of the deepest 6 episodes in the series. It dives into a man torn between a friend and a lover, and the outcome will surprise some and disgust others. If you liked the first season, this is a must have.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Thought this was a wonderful story that t me wanting to read more. Paulo is brilliant! I highly recommend the great story!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|When I first heard of The Walking Dead, I thought &#34;Well here comes another show that is probably going to be a huge letdown&#34; and when it finally aired, I was BLOWN AWAY at how well done it was. Call me &#34;glass half-empty&#34; if you will, but I am a HUGE zombie fan, and expecting the worst from things related to zombies is what I do. I ESPECIALLY did not want to see this show become anything remotely close to that abomination known as &#34;Twilight&#34;. That series disgraces the Vampire and Werewolf fandom in every way. So that being said, if you have the money to buy this, DO IT. You won't be let down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it I think it's a fun app and really cool . I love how you can play mini.games and interact with your horse
B0072OFOM6|5.0|All of the Spartacus series are absolutely amazing, and this one is no exception. It's a shame that the original actor of Spartacus (Andy Whitfield) passed away before they finished the entire series, but the gentleman they replaced him with is a very worthy actor, and shines in Vengeance.<br /><br />I would recommend this series to anyone who is sick of all the mamby pamby shows on TV right now. If you like action, blood, gore, sex, and deep plot driven story, this is a show you wont want to pass up!
B0058BI864|5.0|I already commented on the second season. The same applies here. I don't need to cooment sperately on every season I review.<br /><br />Ed
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This is just the most awesome, and the most gruesome collectors edition I have purchased, and I LOVE IT. A really neat thing about this edition is that the screwdriver comes all the way out, and when you do so, it locks the head in place. When you insert the screwdriver all the way in, it has a satisfying &#34;pop&#34; that unlocks the head so that you can retrieve your discs. Totally worth the money.
B005S39YGU|5.0|I already commented on the second season. The same applies here. I don't need to cooment sperately on every season I review.<br /><br />Ed
B001B6JNVY|5.0|This movie is light and funny. The best movie for girl in gloomy mood. I like this movie very much because it's uplifting and smart. The best movie that late Brittany Murphy ever did.
B002P73UQW|5.0|Up until The Big Bang Theory came along there were no good modern comedy shows like &#34;MASH, &#34;Cheers&#34;, &#34;Night Court&#34; etc. I didn't watch any of the new ones. I happened to watch one of TBBT shows and became hooked on it. Just be careful the producers allow Shelton to go the way of Dr. House on &#34;House&#34; and later shows of that series seemed to concentrate more on House being nasty then anything. The same could easily happen with TBBT.<br /><br />Ed
0375507256|3.0|PROS:  Fancy writing, imaginative.<br />CONS:  Not consistently entertaining, LONG LONG patches of dull or bleak situations, often both.<br /><br />Biggest disappointment - it really has NOTHING to do with past lives overlapping or linked to new incarnations of former selves.<br /><br />The stories are linked THEMATICALLY only and ever so very slightly in suggestions ONLY of re-incarnations of former selves.  The book's theme is people preying upon other people. (Hardly a spoiler.) It's not exactly uplifting stuff.<br /><br />Only two of the stories are genuinely fun and engaging, one slightly thrilling, one imaginative, and some just plain dull.<br /><br />Some entertainment can be derived from playing \\"guess-the-setting\\" as each new story begins with the author being coy in giving vital hints needed to locate the story in time and place.<br /><br />It may be DEEP but it's not necessarily very fun.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Mahjong Deluxe HD:  I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in this type of game.<br /><br />M Tompkins
B00004RCO8|5.0|the battle scenes were of superb quality when compared with the special effects available<br />I had a chance to visit the battle site when I was young
B004R63MWQ|4.0|Jeff Bridges is awesome.  The movie wasnt as good as the first one, but still very good.  Im sure Ill watch it again.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|A t.terrific movie that will make you laugh and have you thinking about ones attitude towards life.  A must see for everyone.
B008Y1YKE4|3.0|It's okay. Our grandchildren will love it. A lot of action for a cartoon. Glad we didn't go to the theater to see it. Waiting for it to come out on DVD was good.
B004G600A4|4.0|Kids love this movie and adults will find something to enjoy as well.  Clever and funny movie that will keep everyone entertained.
B008K9SG9K|2.0|When I first heard \\"It's Time,\\" in early 2012, it sounded unique and uplifting. I hadn't listened to any other song, but the album was well reviewed, \\"It's Time\\" was really powerful, and, I'll be honest, I'm a HUGE sucker for both Imagination & Dragons. I did not expect the album to actually be about Imagining Dragons, but I hoped it at least would reflect similar interests.<br /><br />So I really wanted to like this album. But after hearing \\"it's time\\" infinity times on the radio, and listening through the album once, I was sick. Conceptually, I found it  overdramatic, cliche, and repetitive. Over and over he sings \\"I quit\\" \\"I'm giving up\\" while somehow also throwing in \\"It's time to begin\\" \\"I'll be with you forever\\" \\"I'm always coming home to you\\" (some paraphrasing). Sometimes this is within the same song, and that really frustrates me.<br /><br />I recommend reading the lyrics prior to buying the album. If I was 13, this might be my favorite album. At 30, the album drowns me in adolescent histrionic egocentricity, and it's not how I would choose to spend my time or money.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|What a great movie - classic.  Great to show today's kids that things were not much different when we were in school.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|Requires some thinking, a nice casual puzzle game. Not terribly deep though, if you are just looking for an app to pass the time, this one is good.
0679805273|5.0|This book is an inspirational book for all ages.  If you read this after college, pick it up again.  If you have a younger person around, have them read it and understand all the meanings throughout the work.  If you have a toddler, be sure to buy this book and have your child's teachers write a note about or to your child at the end of each year (don't tell your kid) and do it every year and give it to them when the graduate high school, it is a very powerful gift any parent can give.
B0056FMNYA|3.0|While all the individual components are quite sturdy, the system is pretty flimsy.  Even if I tightened the belt as much as I could comfortably handle, the camera would still either rotate on the quick-release or the mounting bracket would rotate on the belt.  This caused the camera to lose it's alignment with my thigh and either swing toward the front or back of my leg.  The constant need to readjust the camera became bothersome during a wedding shoot where I used this to hold a second body/lens while my main camera was on a BlackRapid strap.<br /><br />I would prefer if the mounting plate could be lengthened and a second strap affixed to the bottom so that it securely wraps around the bottom of the thigh.  This would likely prevent the irritating rotation of the mounting plate.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|Got to love Puss!  Better than a simple spinoff from another movie as it the creators put thought into this one.  Our family has really enjoyed this.
B001V5CIFI|4.0|My nanny ( grandma) has been sharing this film with all the grandkids. It was my 2 1/2 yr olds turn and sge was instantly fascjnated. In fact her short attention soan actually watched 30 mins straight! Which was a nice break fir mom full of cuddles!
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|What a great movie - classic.  Always fun to watch and Bill Murray is absolutely phenomenal in this.  I have grown to really like this movie.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|My husband love jurassic park. It was a xmas gift. Dont arrive in the time that i was expecting but its here and he love it!!!
B0054SMID0|4.0|A compelling film if you don't mind the usual courtroom thriller tropes--e.g., Why oh why does the defense attorney always have to be exes with the hotty prosecutor? {At least here, she's not the opposing counsel he's facing in the Big Upcoming Trial.} Despite some very unlikely situations, THE LINCOLN LAWYER's twists and turnabouts are better than average, and once this film really gets going, it keeps the attention without much difficulty.<br /><br />There will be mixed reactions to McGonaughey's performance as Mr. Slick-and-Slimey, Ultra-Mercenary, Hard-Drinking, Wisecracking, Craftily Hackish Defense Counsel Mick Haller. He's about as stock a character as there can be, but then again, he acts just like many real-life trial lawyers actually DO act. I think this film reveals quite well the role that he's ingrained in himself--the lawyer as actor, etc, etc. Many of the supporting characters, particularly the cops, bikers, and bad guys, are effectively portrayed. William Macy (as Haller's P.I.) and Shea Whigham (as Corliss the jailhouse snitch) are especially in-character and add a nice dose of reality here.<br /><br />In search of more specific things to say about THE LINCOLN LAWYER, I notice that the majority of the other reviewers here basically like it but don't have that many specific observations to make either. It's just a good thriller: That's all.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is another beautiful love story. However along with the love story there is suspense and mystery, and an ending I never saw coming. I don't think he could have written this book any better.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|Enjoyed the book, more than the movie.  But of course, there is usually quite a difference.  Worth the read and the new appreciation for quality chocolate!
B00AMSLRAC|4.0|Surprised at how much both my kids love this app. Keeps them Intrigued for a good little while. They talk about their garden all the time. Plus its easy to use,
B000W93CHC|5.0|Love the mini series, the book thus far is very different but am really enjoying. I would definately recommend it.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I never herd of him until I saw him on TV one night...and I couldn't wait till it came in the mail from you guys at Amazon ..(it was a lot cheaper than paying for this DVD and a contribution to the TV station)... I like him a lot and I'm looking forward to purchasing more of &#34;Joe&#34;
B005HJU7HA|3.0|This ebook needs a table of contents with links. It is, unfortunately, one long text document, which makes it hard to get to a specific story if you're not reading them linearly.
B009G5TWFO|5.0|300 is one of my all time favorites. The movie is so intense and follows a great battle story of the Spartans vs. the Persians. The story is based off real life events (the battle of Thermopylae). Zack Snyder shoots the movie in such a cool way that it is hard to take your eyes off the screen. From the opening scene of being born into the Spartan culture to the ending scene where it pans out showing a gigantic Spartan battle formation, the movie is breathtaking and very original. HIGHLY recommend! It also has a pretty awesome soundtrack to go along with the various fight scenes.
B000VFGQUC|5.0|Classic TL line up....a must have....highly energized performance..dual guitars are awesome..all the great tunes from Jailbreak and more..this show completely rocks!!
B0032Z93J4|1.0|I have never listened to Beyonce's music, but by Amazon insistence, I purchased this movie. I had never seen Fatal Attraction, but someone passed me a copy because they said that this was just an updated version of that movie.<br /><br />Beyonce's character although a good wife and mother came across like Regina King's character in Jerry Maguire which made this movie more of a cliche, made to lure the black audience to the theatres.<br /><br />I love Amazon.Com and trust it's judgement when it comes to my recommendations, but this was not what I was looking for, maybe if I were a female.
B004GYY714|5.0|Try it and you will love it too. It get stations from all over the world with my local favorites.
0761163808|5.0|Vivid images of glorious African animals come to life with this unique photographic technique. It is a grand book for any age. The accompanying text is beautifully written. Good for hours of enjoyment.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|This soundtrack is so beautiful. The song &#34;Suddenly&#34; is one of my favorite.<br />It was written special for the movie. I can listen to this all day! One Day More...
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Such a good book. Really pulls you in to the story. I didn't want to stop reading<br />A must read
B0058YPGSY|5.0|We got this for our daughter-in-law as she is a HUGE Sons fan.  We were going to get Season Five but it haasn't been released...found out that she didn't have Season Four so we got that instead.<br /><br />The  CD arrived right on time, as promised...would order from this seller again.
0761166173|5.0|I would recommend this book to any toddler parent. My son loves the rhythm of the story and the colorful pictures of animals. We had the small board book and had to upgrade to the big one as it was getting worn from all of his loving on the book! Boyntons books are simple and appealing, this one is our all time favorite!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Once I downloaded the Amazon MP3 player on to my adroid phone it was very difficult to get any information on how to download songs from my computer to the MP3 player.  I had to call Amazon's customer service number 4 times before anyone<br />told me that first you had to download the amazon app along with the steps for the android phone as well as the amazon download installer before anything would work. Once it was working it was fine but way too much hassle to begin with.
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|This movie was terrible. I am starting find that teen movies now and days are praised for stupidity thank you Jennifer Lawrence.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not one of Mr. Grisham's finest writings.  I was very disappointed. It seemed to be written on a rainy or lazy day, or both!
B0063IH60K|5.0|insomnia is a witch - I have it on and off and this amuses me just fine while I lie in bed and try to sleep
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Love this movie and having all the different way to view it was a bonus!!  Oh and the bonus features, thank you!
B008XG1X18|5.0|So much information, so many DIY ideas and recipes. It is impossible NOT to find something you would love on here!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is an amazing app when I first saw this app I thought it was fake but when I bought it I was amazed at what it could do. You can literally control your computer with this app. It's worth the money. Keep up the good work.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|It's the latest Star Trek dvd - it's perfect!  No problems with the product, it arrived on time and then I found out my parents had this one already...so it's MINE now!
B001XVPA4Q|3.0|Some really good acting but went a bit too long. Also felt the lesbian was a caricature - not in Jada Pinkett's acting which was great but in the plot written for her. Finally felt that never showing any of the male characters was a bit gimmicky.
B002ZBN13A|5.0|The best commercial release by Ev by a landslide. Great angsty pop rock with driving bass lines. Solid versions of songs Amy Lee and Ben Moody created as young people who had a lot of pain.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|Absolutely spectacular.  The cinematography is in a class by itself.  The acting, script, pomp & circumstance outstanding. I'm totally addicted. Thank you!!!!
B002ZBZNPO|3.0|All the songs kinda sound the same. Definitely The Amy Lee Show as opposed to the earlier work with Ben Moody still on board. Alright if you're feeling angsty.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|Can't get enough. As in Gods of the Arena all is superb. Love the entire cast and spectacle. Thank you all involved.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Husband was blown away and couldn't put it down. I love it too!. Great read, well worth it. He's keeps the details coming and suspense building. Crazy repercussions with the reliance on internet........
B000FC11A6|4.0|My 3rd Stephenson novel.  Also read \\"Reamde\\" and \\"Snow Crash\\".  This was an interesting story and made me want to do historical research into some of the events related in the novel to see what was real and what were fictitious inventions by Stephenson.  I'll agree with other reviewers that the first third of the book was a little slow, but it comes together especially as you see the connections between the WWII characters and the present-day characters come into focus.  Anyone with a deep interest in mathematics or cryptography will probably find the technical details in the novel to be absorbing, but for me I basically just skimmed those pages and re-commenced reading when the story re-commenced. At this point, I have to rate \\"Reamde\\" as my favorite of the three, and this one as my least favorite.  But any way you look at it, Stephenson is some kind of genius.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Christian Bale and the full cast was good. Notice I didn't say great. The action was choppy, the plot lines and reasons for the joker was not fully developed.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love Bingo Blitz and actually prefer to play it on my Kindle Fire because it seems to have fewer glitches than the Facebook version on my pc.  My only wish would be that the Kindle edition was kept as up to date as the Facebook version.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I just recently finished high school and this book is so much like what I saw many kids go through and what I some what experienced. This book was a great one to read because  it opened my eyes to reality.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|This one is silly, heart warming and has great lessons for the kids. The whole family enjoyed it and watched more than once.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|Great ; I have watch all five seasons and i liked  this one the best of all.Rodney is a nut but he is the best , they all are .try it you'll love it. Thanks . Pat R.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!  I play it every day and have even downloaded the app to my iPad.  Even my 9 year old niece enjoys playing with it, so it's good that I have it on both the iPad and Kindle Fire so we can play at the same time.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|At first I was curious as to how a book formatted as a collection of letters would hold my attention, that is until I got about one letter in. The main character is so brilliant and full of pure innocent love that I adored him immediately and simply could not put it down. Such a simple, yet enchanting read. Loved it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|A little on the longer side and lacks a climax to stand as an individual book, but, in the end, that only makes you await the next book in the series more eagerly.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved it. Kept me wanting more. I can't wait to read something else she writes. Thanks so much for such a wonderful story.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Great throughout better than 1st<br />Hooked into third book can't wait<br />Looking for the next movie hope the same cast
B007IXWKUK|5.0|FIRST book was awesome and this one was just as great. I love how it keeps you wanting more. I can't wait to see how the next one will read.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app so much! I am almost 13 years old and I believe that this game rocks! I do get bored with it downtimes though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard so much about these books, I just had to find out for my self what it was all about. I'm so glad I decided to give them a try. I can't wait to read the next one.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I really like this game! My friend lives in Arizona and I play this game with her almost the time!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|The language usage, writing style and story line was much better than 'Grey's'.  I am really looking forward to book 3!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is an amazing author.  Safe Haven is one of his best ~I loved it! I could not put the book down.
B000I157KO|4.0|With a minimum of dialogue and action, we watch a photographer take some casual shots.  As the story progresses, through his black & white photographs, he believes he's captured a murder on film . . . but has he?  Does it matter?<br /><br />No chase scenes.  No scary villains.  No tricky movie camera work.  Just a guy taking pictures with some occasion conversation with people he encounters.<br /><br />If you want to see how much can be done with so little, you'll enjoy and think about this movie for a long time.  If guns, blood, car chase scenes, and special effects are your preferred elements in a movie, best to pass on this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I truly enjoy having this app on my android devices. I can pick up God's word anytime and be lifted up and inspired. I also love the different versions of the bible that are offered and the audio versions are fantastic! One of the best things about this app are all of the plans offered. You can select a plan for a week or a year. Right now Joyce Meyers and I are on a year long journey. IfJoyce isn't your  thing there are many others to choose from. There are no excuses for not having time to establish a relationship with God with Youversion.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Life has not been easy for the people of France during this revolutionary period.  Many of the poor people were leading lives of slavery.<br /><br />Freedom, liberation was not something that they mustered much hope to receive.  Many took to the streets and lived lives of desperation, seeking food, medicine, shelter, clothing and money any way that they could find.  This led to alcoholism, stealing, prostitution and selling any earthly possessions, including their own being.<br /><br />Redemption is the living word of this story.<br /><br />The choice is always ours.
0143122010|5.0|This is an amazing book that will undoubtedly confirm some some of your ideas, challenge others and richly inform many more. For anyone who loves to read nonfiction, to think about our world and the human condition, this is a must read. You'll find yourself quoting, referring back, and sharing this book frequently. Bravo!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Just what I wanted to read from Vince Flynn! So good! Didn't want to put it down!  So when does the next one come out?
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Ok...there were some moments in the movie that gave me pause. I had to remind myself it was a kids movie lol. Overall entertaining.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This is what I wanted. This is what I needed. Scott Jurek and his writing partner Steve Friedman have put together a wonderful little book on running (ultra marathons), eating, self awareness and life. I am a runner and fan of the sport. Scott Jurek's name was out there on my periphery until I read &#34;Born to Run&#34;. Scott takes on his journey through life in short crisp chapters. Early on he details the personal aspects of his life that brought him to running. Then he explores his transformation to dedicated vegan (with recipes at the end of each chapter). Then it on to the races. In ultra marathoning, each race becomes an adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed this book!
B0084AZXKK|3.0|I'm so glad I read it.  It's a classic and very interesting.  Everyone should read it at least once for sure .
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Although there are some still open question about Thomas and others the ending was not what I expected. I am not going to read the prequal since from what I have read it is not based on Thomas so what's the point.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Its fun andnmy cousin has it and I played it it's ALOT better maybe cause he's got the update (it's awesome withe the update)  ;)
B004EBT5CU|5.0|There are an amazing number of songs that have received lots of airplay.  Great CD from the start to the finish.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|A 63 year old man does not usually play games like this. I love the sound of it when I play. I am getting pretty good. Sure its a time waster but it is fun.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Would have given zero stars if possible.  Slow, boring, ridiculous, painful, So bad we couldn't finish watching it.  Refund please.
B0086700CM|1.0|I have better things to do with my time. I play Angry Birds but this game is weak and I got bored with it very quickly.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|great game.  new updates make it worth while. go down load it now you will not be disappointed! i play it every day.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked the book. There is a great and unexpected twist to the tale that lives on in your recollections of the book. This story will make a great movie on of these days. High recommendations by this reader.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I first approached this show reluctantly, as a Sherlock Holmes fan, but this show, stands on its own two feet. Love the three principle characters of Holmes, Watson and Captain Gregson. There is nothing demeaning about any of them. Watson in this series finally has some real bones to her character.<br />It is such a radical departure from Sherlock Holmes and the actors inhabit their characters so well and the writing is excellent, that I am able to ignore all of the departures from the Holmes of literature and simply enjoy this show for what it is: a superbly written and acted show that happens to borrow names and some characteristics of the original - but truly goes into its own universe.<br />I look forward to every episode. I will deeply miss the hiatus when season 1 ends. I only wish there were 24 episodes to enjoy. I am glad I purchased.
B006MQRLSA|4.0|I have not watched many movies on my Kindle. But I did like this one a lot. By chance I rented it for just 99 cents.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|Supertramp never came through my town by the time I made it to concert going age in 1979. This DVD kind of made up for that. Awesome show and video production despite it's age. My only complaint is that the drummer did not come into view until 1/2 way through the video. Other than that, this is a must have for any Supertramp fan.
B005VPRETE|4.0|I got this for my daughter to have something to do over Christmas Break.  She had fun putting it together.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|The main character (LaBeouf) is not well developed and the story didn't come together well - a very unrealistic ending.
1451613512|5.0|I'm reading this aloud the my wife and we have watched the television series too.  It is very well researched and often shocking.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't want this book to end. I enjoyed it so much and learned again not to judge someone you don't know what they have had to indur in their life. I can't wait to read the authors other books.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|One of their best CDs!  Great classics from one of the longest running hard rock bands ever.  Australian Masters of the Rock Scene.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I myself am in college to become a doctor in music education. The strings have always had dull music and most teachers use the same songs over and over again. I like the spin they put on their instruments and love their style. The shaping and balance of the songs are awesome. Nothing plays over anything else. Keep it up to help save the world from falling into the mundane music
B006ZT47O0|5.0|That is what some folks are calling the symphonic female lead vocals and the death growls of her male counterpart in a lot of these bands out of Europe.  Believe it or not, it sounds fantastic.  Besides Epica, Leaves' Eyes does this as well as anyone.  Early and late Theatre of Tragedy, to me, was the original founder of this type of music.
B00991TCOG|4.0|All i can say is the mix of electric dance music and the violin is genius. The music videos are a little weird and the tracks emphasize the violin to much in my opinion. I feel the tones should be more mellow
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Watched all 4 seasons so far and still a fan.  Show is about a law firm but there's good character development and storyline.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I love the classic sound of the cello with the modern day spin on it. These guys are great and are like the sectional quartet or apocalyptica . I love how it is just the two guys. The sound is really balanced and the over all quality is spot on
B0086700CM|4.0|This game us a staple if tablet and smart phones. if you do not have yet please do yourself a favor and download it.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This movie is right up there with the classic time travel flicks like terminator and back to the future. good acting, believable action sequences, intriguing plot.  Still, there are only so many ways to spin the time travel plot, so even though it was excellent, it's not going to make history in my book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another lovely and fairly predictable story from sparks. Well written and a great read. Any fans will enjoy this one too
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Speed Racer ain't got nuthin' on this one! Animatrix director Takeshi Koike spent a good seven freakin' years putting this movie together, which was done entirely in hand-drawn animation using over 100,000 drawings in its production. It was a staggeringly dedicated task put forth in today's totally digital world using mostly CGI animation.<br /><br />Set way in the future, JP is an underdog racer in the highly dangerous world of intergalactic car races. After crashing in the preliminary Yellowline race, he luckily gets into the prestige Redline race which is the Indy 500 of the universe. This race is taking place on Roboworld run by a fascist government of cyborg pricks. They don't want these Wacky Racers rejects on their planet, mostly because it might reveal a lot of their military secrets exposed to the public. JP hopes to woo fellow racer Sonoshee, who is someone he's admired since he was a kid, but this keeps him distracted from his double-dealing mechanic Frisbee who is making deals with the mob to rig the race. The big race finally happens, and the big contender, Machinehead, leads the pack, along with several other colorful racers(most of which they only briefly touch on as far as their backstories). Roboworld's military pulls out all the stops(aside from a freakin' blockade!), including particle beam satellites and a giant bioweapon named Funky Boy, that is like an out of control pure energy version of Tetsuo from Akira when he got all bloated. It takes one of the Roboworld's generals to merge with another bioweapon to try and stop Funky Boy, but the movie just leaves off as their big kaiju fight begins. Without giving away the ending, the winner(s) is/are pretty obvious, but the final stretch to the end is nailbiting!<br /><br />What this movie lacks a little in as far as story is concerned(specifically the unresolved characters' story arcs), it completely makes up for in style and animation. Madhouse comes through again with a real trailblazer. There was a short \\"pilot\\" movie that came out about four years prior that was just a excellent, and available on the American release as a bonus. Do yourself a big favor and get the Blu-Ray to get the full visual splendor. It's almost impossible not to dig the living hell out of this high-octane thrill-fest!a short \\"pilot\\" movie that came out about four years prior that was just a excellent, and available on the American release as a bonus.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed playing the trial of this game.The story line Is interesting and graphics are good. I plan on purchasing the full version.<br />I would recommend this game!!!!
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|Best album to ever come out other than Up The Dose by the Mentors!  A must have for every metal fan!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I have been waiting to see this in 3D again since seeing it in the cinema a while back.  Well this package will not let you down.
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|Kings of Butt Metal!!  Great music!!  Lyrical geniuses!  If you don't have this album your a loser!  Every metal fan should have all the Steel Panther albums.
B005LAII80|5.0|Fantastic quality, great action 3D movie.<br />A must for the Judge Dredd fanatic, this will not let you down.<br />Karl Urban plays the part to perfection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Can't even describe in words how much I enjoyed this book , from start to finish . Breathtaking. College Hoover has been added to my list of favorite authors .
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Ghosts of maple creek is one of the better ho games available for the fire. Story Is captivating and puzzles are fun.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|This series captured my attention. Without going through every point and character, the story line made sense and<br />there was enough depth of character to engage this reader. I don't know if I'll continue the series...based on reviews 6 looks a tad iffy....It's on my  list.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|Three stars is a bit generous. I think 2.5 is more realistic. Guess I am just not a fan of Tim Burton.
1419701533|5.0|This was a wonderful Christmas gift for my son, he loves diary of a wimpy kid series, and it was w must have at a great price.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It is pretty much a standard Sparks story, but such a good read, and good characters that I couldn't put it down. It is a good book to escape into.
B005EGXNLS|3.0|Not my favorite book by Cornwell but I enjoyed the book an  it was worth the money. Can't ask for more then that
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the book, but hated the ending.  Can't believe the editors approved this ending.  Just too difficult to accept.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|enjoyed playing previous versions of this game I am so glad they designers found a way to earn extra potions and gems.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I saw this on PBS and had to have  my own copy. Musical theater at its best ! great price too !
B000078DOI|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this album!!!  Im on a big Chili Peppers kick lately so I decided to buy this album and the only thing I regret is that I didnt buy it years ago!!!  There isnt a bad song on the entire album, I find it incredibly fun to listen to....the guitar and bass work on this album are absolutely rockin and if you can listen to this album without having to get up and start rocking out to it...well then I dont know what is wrong with you!!  Anthony Kiedis' vocals arent quite as refined as on the later albums, but they are by no means bad!!  The songs are very catchy and fun.  It always puts me in a better mood when I throw this album in!  Love it!
B005H9B2CE|5.0|In order to enjoy the comic-book genre, one must immerse oneself totally into the fantasy. One of the big issues I have with the Nolan take is just that. Comic-books ARE fantasy and must hold true. Marvel gets it! A great story begets a GREAT movie. THOR is a great example. Is it 'Lawrence of Arabia\\"? No, and it does not need to be. They are popcorn munchers. The effects have finally caught up to the genre and THOR nails this as well. The big mistake MARVEL/Disney, and for that matter WB/DC, are making is that the movies need to be two-parters, part one released in the summer and part two during the holidays. These movies can be long, but must be in two parts, ala the old serials from the 40's. I would have loved to seen \\"The Avengers\\" this way (and think of the movie they could make). So, if you are not into the comicbook fantasy, I would give this one a ride. Sit back and enjoy the story as well as the great CGI. Oh, do NOT view on a screen smaller than 42\\". And try to see in Blu-Ray.
B00AOMV7VK|5.0|This is such a great album! The whole thing has one unified concept, which is pretty neat, the addition of the violin is a nice touch in a few of the songs. The sound is a little different from their previous albums but it is still everything you would expect and more from such a great band!
B00992CF6W|1.0|First off it was WAY too expensive. Second of all, the controls are way to difficult to use, Third of all only a true Minecrafter uses PC.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great season. Cast is great. Jessica Lange is amazing. Characters have depth. Well written and directed. Highly recommend. Should be 18 and older to watch.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This may be titled 30 day shred but I started to feel my body change in about two weeks. Things that were very hard in the beginning were getting easier and in general I was feeling healthier. I like that there are three stages, I have only ever completed stages 1 and 2, but for me that was enough as they both did a great job of improving my physical health!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|As someone who enjoys fantasy novels, this book Haas immediately jumped to the top of my list. While graphic in some parts, it has just the right amount of everything in it. Without a doubt will turn into a classic book.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Entertainment in word form. Suspenseful, erotic, and funny are the three words that I will use to describe this book.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I found the movie to be very funny as did my wife, but beware that it is not for kids, full of profanity and sexual content, but I was laughing the whole time.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|They have shown what funny things can happen in India with the message that the selfless love of the people and the warmth can win you over. A definite watch.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love that I can both listen and read and kindle syncs to audible, best feature ever.  I wish more books were like this.  This was a great story.  Everyone should read it, all about true love, (not necessarily the romantic kind).  What a dog!
B00899F0G8|5.0|Pretty Little Liars is a lot of fun to watch it has many many twists and turns through each episode.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|But I am having trouble reading this translation, so beware, it requires lots of time and patience to understand the way the English is written .
B005AERS74|4.0|It's not their best album but it has some catchy songs, so altogether I am happy with my purchase for the price.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Great Game!! a game and a lot of stratagy,a time waster yea, but a good one! killing people the American way
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I was expecting a typical Bruce Willis action movie which is what I was in the mood for. I can't speak for everyone else but I had to put some thought into the mechanics of time travel on the various relationships and the ending surprised me. I've thought about the movie after seeing it and will watch it again.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|This book helps you to understand where your food comes from and the cost to you and to the planet from industrial food versus local food versus industrial organic food.
0345803493|2.0|Are you surprised that a so called erotic book is boring??? well IT IS! Very poor written and very repetitive. Nothing really interesting happends in this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|i completely understand all of the amazing reviews!!! while the first book started off a little slow it built upon itself really well and by the time i was through books 2 and 3 i was SO hooked!!! this book really does have it all. seriously. even if you don't normally read science fiction, which i guess is what this would most aptly be filed under, you have to read this book!! such a gripping story, full of real characters. i love books that really leave you thinking both while you're reading and once you're done. this is that kind of book, i can tell it'll stick with me. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
030745455X|5.0|I havent read such an interested and well written book in a while. I just couldnt stop reading. I liked Dragon a lot but liked this one even better!!
B005VPRETE|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughters ages 4 and 6 for Christmas.  We had to help put it together and they enjoyed playing with it. I'll probably purchase more sets in the future to add to the collection. It's nice to have some lego sets for girls now. ;o)
0142403873|5.0|After watching the short movie inspired on this book we had to get it for my daugther. We just love it! very nice ilustrations and rhymes.
B005LAIISU|5.0|love the ice age DVDs - hope they continue.  The characters are wonderful and the films are good for children.
B00A5052YE|5.0|Glad she is enjoying making music again. This album has that same energy that she had when she made her first two albums.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was the best book I have read in a long time. No predictable ending on this one. I couldn't put it down.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Good gameplay and challenging puzzles . I played all the way through non stop. Also there were excellent graphics a cinema scenes.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|My son enjoys building these 'modular' lego kits. The only problem I have that he puts them together too fast.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|She's delighted, and has played it non-stop.  What more can I say, since this is just the one she specified.  Easy Traveler
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This was a wonderful epic book which I loved reading. It has a powerful but somewhat obscure meaning which may require another reading to tie in all the connections between the stories. I also saw the movie and found it helpful to better understand the connections between the different stories.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is one of those mindless 'keep busy' games.  It does, however require you to think (unconsciously) about trajectories and angles.  The sounds are the best part!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Heironimous at his best, fighting crime and bureaucrats with equal skill.  Always pleasing.  I especially enjoy the way Connelly educates the reader through Bosch's passion for good jazz.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|Robin out did himself in this wonderful true story. Patch has never seen an insurance form and stilldresses funny. I wish all dDr's were like him
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was my first Stephen King book and I loved it. In fact the 7 women in my bookclub did too. It was a great discussion this month! I hated for the book to end.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love Yahoo mail on my Kindle..I love being able to access anytime anywhere.I would recommend this product to anyone!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Always enjoyed Sherlock Holmes from reading to bw movies to current.  Elementary is engaging twist that I enjoy watching on Amazon Prime
B002R5LKOQ|5.0|I saw this movie 14 years ago and being young I though ahh it was ok.<br />Now as a grown adult I love this movie the singing by this woman is amazing.<br />This is a great movie and I enjoyed every minute. If you have not watched this<br />movie I recommend you give it a chance it might just blow you away.<br />I have not shed a tear for a movie since well I can't even remember. The<br />ending is very emotional and her singing just adds to it.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Was as expected., Well as aggravation I must submit minimum of 17 words..who is doing who a favor, good grief.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Worth reading from beginning to end.  Easy read and interesting.  Hard to put down once I would pick it up to read.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed The Dark Knight Rises! Not sure if it was our computer or Amazon, but we had a few issues with the movie freezing and having to be restarted. Besides that, the movie itself was awesome. The plot was intriguing, yet not too hard to follow and all the actors were fantastic! 5 stars from us for the movie!
B000OBYLVO|5.0|Wonderful story line, wonderful scenery.  would love to live or visit a little house like that in surrey.  Liked that the neighbor In hollywood was brought into the story, besides the 2 couples.  added a nice dimension.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I couldn't put his book down! Totally captivating from the first page! The storyline is different and fresh. My last favourite Kate Morton book was 'The Forgotten Garden' which I still rank with my favourites, but the &#34;SEcret Keeper' in my view is just a touch better. I wont touch on the storyline as that has already been done during previous reviews. If you want a good and entertaining read then this is the book for you!!!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This entire series is now one of my favorites.  The plot is intelligent and creatively written.  The drama of the storyline doesn't feel contrived.  I'm really impressed!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A surprising ending but not disappointing.  I  LIKED THE BEHIND THE SCENE VIEWS OF THE COURT ROOM PROCEDURES.  How difficult for the father.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this series. It is very addicting. I love to knit and now making items of clothing that look like this time period. When I see a hat or sweater , I think wow lady Mary would wear this or maybe Sybil.
B005SV9X22|3.0|I like some of Lady Gaga's songs like Bad Romance, Judas, Born This Way and Paparazzi so I bought this thinking I was going to get a concert along the lines of Gwen Stefani or someone but this had a lot of gay stuff that made me uncomforable. She was doing a song called Boys Boys Boys ( I think) and there was a bunch of gay dances that made me uncomfortable to watch. Also, Lady Gaga went off on rants about gay people and a gay unicorn and I had to turn down the volunme for fear my neighbors might hear the gay rants and get the wrong idea about me. I know there's an explicit and edited version. Does the edited version have all the gay stuff removed. If So I think that's the one I should have bought.
B001FB4VY4|5.0|Awesome show.... Can't wait to watch the rest of the seasons.  Blu-ray and DVD combo makes it easy to watch anywhere
B008N1V11U|5.0|I've played a lot of games for the kindle, but this is by far the longest and best laid out game I've played  so far.  The replay valve of it is also very high.  Definitely worth the money.
1596177373|5.0|My nephew enjoyed the gift  Tim Burton is a great artist and this gift will create hours of fun for him
B0058YPILY|5.0|Another amazing season as they all are. Every Season brings the same intensity while still being fresh and cutting edge.
B005HSL626|5.0|I loved this app! It is fun to do when you are bored. You can change the style of your blade and really have fun with it!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Me and my 2 year old sister love it and we watch all the I'm nom stories<br />*sigh*...if only om noms were real so I could have 1 as a pet LOL
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is my favorite book! I could not stop reading it! I almost finished the whole book in a day! It is funny and really has a personal touch to it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing and it captured life raw. The characters were just lovely and the book was overall inspiring. HIGHLY recommended
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like this book and I am going to name it Michelle book that is cute name right what you naming yours I rating 100·\· Bye bye.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|Would give this 5 stars, but nothing is perfect.  I almost did not buy it because of the several 1/2 star reviews, but my loving spouse, for whom I deny nothing, expressed an interest in it as a Christmas present so I popped for it and she was VERY pleased.  Now I find these few negatives reviews very perplexing; this collection has several really great tracks aside from the cut that has hit the pop charts big. I am impressed by the varied musicality, originality, and the variety of expression here. Get it, enjoy it.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|My 14yr old son and I watched Dark Shadows last evening (digial stream via XBOX), and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  It starts out very dark and serious, which had me a bit worried.  Once the backstory has been told, however, it transformed into an entertaining commedy with an interesting mix of characters.  The humor is rather 'dark' (no pun intended), so IMHO this isn't a good movie for kids under 10.  Being a fan of Johnny Depp, I had high expectations for this movie, and it definitely delivered.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|The app keeps crashing on Android very frequently during the day. My husband has IPhone and was able to get an update to correct &quot;bug fixes&quot; already. It'd be nice if Android was updated too. Share the love people and I'll give 5 stars.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I don't understand the rave reviews for this book. Every character in the story is manipulative, degraded, or morally bankrupt. The plot is preposterous and the outcome was predictable halfway through. Amy is portrayed as a fanatically detail-oriented and goal-driven Machiavellian genius but somehow can't hold onto even a low level job. I finished the book but it was a relief to escape from it at the end.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|A great vintage 'Tramp performance to go with the CD recorded at the same time. A must have for every Supertramp fan.
030758836X|5.0|The book is great.  Lead characters not very likeable but the writing and the plot are sensational.  I couldn't put it down once I started.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|The movie was an unexpected surprise that turned out to be an entertaining gem Well worth watching. Its not the Die Hard Bruce Wllis but you still see some of him and its enough to carry the movie.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I have just finished reading the Lies of Locke Lamora and I am impressed with the quality of the story. Mr. Lynch weaves a complex tale of betrayal and revenge that keeps you guessing all the way along, there was a momento when I thought I have figured out the identity of the antagonist just to completely miss my mark. I have read comparisons to Ocean's Eleven in a Fantasy setting. The comparison is fair although I really prefer the fantasy setting of the story.<br />Relating to world building, the author makes a complete job of creating a compelling world with its own rules of magic, there is magic, there are fantastic creatures, but they are not the drivers of the story. What moves the plot are the characters and their quirks.<br />I really enjoyed this story and already started on the second book of the series.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|Interesting, different, fairly well written.  A little too much coincidence and a bit too pat but it is an unusual background and I read it through and enjoyed it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. A truly great book that I think should be made into a movie!!!<br />A must read.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works great... it's nice to be able to monitor the battery and I love that it tells you exactly how much battery you've got and estimates on how much time remain for different activities.  Great app!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A story that is both intriguing and at times a little bit predictable.  But just when you think you are a step ahead of Grisham he veers off into a  quick unbeliveably unique solution for a character who looks to be in an  [[ASIN:0385535147 The Racketeer]] intractable position. Good quick read.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this app every day to help me get up in the morning.  Its better than a regular clock in that you have to start up your kindle to turn it off so it really wakes.you up.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Better movie of the year. Mavelous. The film is true to the original writing and spirit of the story. Thanks.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Very entertaining and well worth renting.  Good story and one of the best in the series.  All actors did well.

B00866JL96|5.0|I saw this movie by picking it out random at the movie rental store.  I loved it so much I bought it.  I've watched it many times since I've had it.  The actors are great and the story is believable and inspiring.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|We weren't sure about season 2, as season 1 was excellent and unique. The makers of the series have delivered, though, and it's the only series we make sure to tune into live, as opposed to waiting for the downloadable version.  Great entertainment!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent. Instant favorite. Don't know how i missed this one for so long.definitely recommend to fans of any genre.read it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is amazing I watched the first 2 seasons in 3 days. It has a little bit of everything in it and there is a never a dull moment. In one episode you get romance, scandal, a history lesson, and pure joy. I am a history teacher and I plan to use parts of this show in my classroom so students can relate and connect with historical topics in a fun way!
B004K00NMG|5.0|*FILM*<br />Don Bluth's last and greatest film. With the feel of a live action film, this enthralling movie retains the storyline of a traditional animated film. It lacks the crude and unforgiving story and design that much earlier Bluth films carry, most likely resulting in the greater appeal of the film. Bluths first to feature humans as the central protagonists. Shot in cinematic widescreen, this movie is epic. Touching on themes of history and having a theme of mystery and of an elderly woman reliving the past... James Cameron, you are a cereal cartoon 'plunderer', but I don't suppose we can blame you for this one as it was released only about 1 month before Titanic, unlike Fern Gully, which was 15 freaking years before Avatar, right around the time that you said you got the idea for it. Anastasia is truly wonderful. Its pretty much flawless and I'd recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />*Product*<br />The cover art is adequate, but could have benefited from using the original and better.<br />The menu is a full scale Blu Ray Menu, unlike 'Dogs' and 'NIMH'. The menu is brilliant and does justice to the film and is great to navigate.
B004SIP7F8|5.0|already been said? Gorgeous Ralph Fiennes....oh my!<br /><br />Lovely Kristen Thomas, with her big red shawl and her dashingly cute husband!  The story line, the wonderful cast, the beautiful gowns that Ms. Thomas wears, the music, the scenary..oh my!! So, wonderful! Yes, it's an older film, but so worth being watched again and again and again........this is a rough film in parts, but so worthwhile and so dramatic. The performances are just wonderful!
B00A83075M|5.0|*FILM*<br />From the advertising done for this film, I didn't expect much, as was the case with everyone else I've spoken too about it, however, I came away form the theatre completely blown away and wanting to see it again. I was saying lines, singing the songs, replaying scenes in my head... I was immolation invested in this film from 10 minutes in. the first 10 minutes are a little unsure but the plot picks up and then continues to change direction and pace from their. This is a brilliant film; the characters are superbly developed, original and highly entertaining and full of their own unique wit and charm, the format is a concept well managed and creatively manipulated to produce unique story elements, the environments are original and also surprising and unexpected but refreshing and welcome. For a film about video games, it would have been easy to produce something that had worn out, loud and annoying characters (in a bad way Vanellope)and lazily devise a plot line were the characters jump form boring game to boring, poorly rendered lava filled game, trying to recharge some thing to save something or other, but they didn't!! thank goodness... Instead, the majoity of the film is set in the most unlikely game immaginable, and instead this film is a touching story about misunderstood outcasts!! like me!! and a beautiful bond that leaves you emotionally touched for what I think should be forever.<br />I kinda want to stop here. I could go on for hours about how each character is uniquely hilarious and how the film itself is hilarious and how the CGI is the best yet and how its the best CGI film to have been made in many years (Possibly since the original Toy Story, citehtap si evard). I could go on for hours but I wont. Its great, see it, love it, let it change who you are for the better and enjoy<br /><br />*PRODUCT*<br />N/A<br /><br />PS, I'm writing this before the item is released. I'm an Aussie guy so if you know if this Blu Ray is region free, if you couldtell me then that'd be great. It should have A,B,C on the back if it is. Gosh,,, Gosh I bloody well hope it is... Gosh...
1895565669|5.0|My son isn't here yet but I can't wait to spend many bedtimes reading this to him. I would recommend it to for any mother and son duo, it is just a sweet story that can shared for generations to come. :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is awesome! Season three keeps getting better! I would recommend to any fan of the first two seasons.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is the second copy of Downtown that I ordered for my family. We love this series so much that we watch this series over and over again. I have already preordered Downtown series 3. These characters are almost like family the way we talk about them. This is a wonderful series and very enjoyable, especially when you want to escape to another world.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|this was a very funny movie we watched it just before christmas with most of the family here for the holiday
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My granddaughter danced around the room when she saw this.  Disney has some good, strong female role models.  You can't go wrong.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I haven't seen the movie, but it can't be better than the book.  Read it in 2 days,  You can relate to the characters and feel their joy and disappointments, and you can't help but cheer them on.
1442354747|5.0|It was nice to be able to sit back and enjoy a book with someone else reading it aloud.<br />The best part was I could continue fixing lunch or whatever and still understand and enjoy it.<br />This was my first audio book but it won't be my last.
0823016714|5.0|I was so excited to get this as a gift, I read the whole thing in a few hours.  As an animator, this is a great resource for facial sculpting, preparing for lip-sync, and just funny exaggerations.  I am so happy with this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I'm another person that wishes you could use zero stars. This has to be the most poorly written book I've ever read. It was page after page of nothing. If I was 12 yrs old...I would still find it boring. The entire plot is so stupid and the characters are unbelievable. I feel so annoyed after being sucked in by reviews. It seems to me that the 4 and 5 star reviews are from people of low intellect or they get enjoyment out of reading the telephone book. There was not one character that was likable...just pure foolishness on every page.<br /><br />Save your money or suffer like I did.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|The Opteka x-grip is well thought out. It has multiple mounting options for a camera. Works well with a Sony HDR- CX130, but will not fit a Sony NEX-VG10/20 due to their top mounted handle and mic. The cold shoe will spin under load, but is easily fixed with a DIY rubber gasket. The cold shoe works well with a small shotgun mic. or  LED light.<br />This will not magically make steady video, but it should work for anyone doing low to ground-level shots of Skaters using small cameras like the GoPro's or Handy Cam's.
1936608618|4.0|Great book that serves as a manual on how to properly execute endurance along with crossfit.  Pictures are very detailed, so that most anyone can understand.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|This CD is so amazing. I've loved Twenty One Pilots since they stepped foot on stage in Detroit. The songs are so catchy and you can't help but sing along and jam to them in your car. I would highly suggest buying this CD and, if possible, seeing them in concert.
0446581356|5.0|This book has EVERYTHING you need to know about how to choose the right product formula and color for your skin type, and how to apply it correctly. I absolutely recommend this book!
B0063IH60K|4.0|The definitive Solitaire app. Lots of fun. Would recommend it to anyone who likes to play simple, but classic card games.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Never had ordered a book for the Kindle for my Kindle app on my iPhone, and it worked like a charm. As far as the book is concerned, I LOVED it! I was more caught up in this book than possibly any book I had read before, and that says a lot, since I'm a middle-school English teacher. And I'm not evaluating it as a young adult fiction book--this book would be amazing for adults as well.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|Real or not, the movie raised some excellent points regarding the digitization of our selves and the complications that may result.
B006ISJQ1W|3.0|Not a bad movie. Traditional Depp as far as content. But he's always good to look at no matter what part he's playing.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use this app all the time, and more often during severe weather.  My singular complaint is that it only updates once an hour.  I hope in the future they will have a 15 minute update.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is packed with action and depicts the war.  It also has a story line that connects the watcher to the characters.  Your emotions will get you involved and make you feel like a part of the friendships.  I really like the packaging as well!
159668139X|4.0|As a beginning weaver, I have a lot to learn -- a whole new glossary of terms and concepts that are difficult to explain verbally (much easier to understand if demonstrated on the loom).  This book does a pretty good job of it, though some sections still elude my understanding, despite reading them several times.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|Excellent CD,excellent quality,excellent music,all tracks were great!! I highly recommend to everyone!! I thoroughly enjoy it and so will you.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|What  a great read!  Anyone who ever had a passionate first love will read this book with smile upon smile!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I perfect follow up to the previous novels in the series. A perfect ending to a near perfect series. I'd be interested to hear if there is another to follow.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Another great read.  Highly recommended.  I could not put it down.  Harry Bosch is a great character.  One cannot help but love Bosch novels.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much... Just an all around great read... too bad the movie didnt live up to the book...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved the plot twists and turns. Very suspenseful. Had no idea what would happen next. It all came together in the end. Awesome read. Loved it
630522577X|5.0|Bought this after hearing our 7 year old granddaughter singing some of these songs.  We wanted her to have her own copy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love all of Nicholas Sparks books...they all have an important message..  Jo was an interesting character and I  was both surprised and pleased to know who she was in the end.  The book is very inspirational and the author never disappoints me.
B009M5CJI0|5.0|Book was a wonderful historical fiction.  Follett must do a great deal of research for all his books.  I would recommend this to WWll buffs.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The best book I have read in a long time. Not what you would think when you heard nicholas sparks book. By far my favorite.
B002UBRFDC|3.0|This book is long.  The writing style isn't very descriptive or riveting.  The dialogue is very conversational and not very interesting.  I just wanted to know what happened to the hero and kept on reading.  It doesn't give very many insights into the culture either.  The names of the key leaders are real but it doesn't follow real history in any way.  It could have been reduced by half the number of pages.
1594744769|4.0|This book was the next book to be reviewed in my book club. I bought it expecting a scary story because the cover is slightly creepy. While it did have some scary elements, it was certainly not a horror story. Instead it was a very well written, great story about a kid. A lot of people have already compared it to Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events but I think the comparison is spot on.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|ANYTHING GRISHAM WRITES IS A WINNER- THIS , NO LESS.<br />GOOD FOR MEN OR WOMEN.<br />A GRIPPING TALE.<br /> I HAVE READ THEM ALL, I THINK.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show consistently delivers compelling drama, nuanced character performances, and twisting storylines... it's one of only three shows I look forward to watching each week.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I heard these guys on the radio months ago and am just now getting the cd. Love it. Very relaxing and makes the ride home very nice. thanks.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Nice look and sound.  Pleasant to play and really great that it's free.  I would recommend to those who enjoy this type of game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It minecraft on the go how do you get better than that. It's fun works good and overall is worth the money.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I got this app and it seems to be going ok. I haven't ever really liked apps that require money to advance, but since most do what else can you do.
B00866JL96|5.0|This is a gret movie! Husband and I both loved it. It worked good, no problem with playback. Good gift idea.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This is an amazing wartime story let down by the style in which it is written.  The author has researched in great detail and has indepth knowledge of the Luftwaffe and the US Air Force,  technically, about the planes they flew and about the personalities that provide the backdrop to this specific incident. However it is written in a rather flat prose which, while it recounts the detail does not bring out the true emotions of the people involved. This detracts from what is a book really worth reading.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|You would think the premise would get old after the first couple episodes of exploding heads and eaten humans, but this show is so much more than that. Much like 24 or Homeland, it takes a premise and not only makes you care about the characters but continues to come up with story lines that keep you on the edge of your seat!
B004QX07G4|2.0|Every other line is either a joke or a gag or a punchline, but it's doesn't work. It's somewhat like slapstick - initially you laugh and once you get the idea you wonder why you laughed in the first place. I read only two chapters and couldn't continue.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Watched it 3 times in the 24 hr rental period. Then bought it. Silly and super funny. Would recommend this movie to any age group.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My sister recommended this series to me, and I am hooked!!!  Love it!  Watched season 1, 2, and what I could of season 3 in a week.  It is like a great book- hard to put down until you finish!  The only thing that I hate is that I am now caught up with the episodes and have to wait a week to see, and I can only see an episode a week...
B009E3EY38|5.0|Great audio and video.  Just wish the concert was longer.  So many great songs! Only wish I could have been there.
B007HACDLK|5.0|After reading this book, I have started at the beginning of the Mitch Rapp boolss and am enjoying them all!  What a treat!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book in two days. It kept my attention. I really wanted to see what came next. I enjoyed the plot and the characters. Id recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a mystery and likes to be surprised!
B000YH6YG8|5.0|Well worth the money. A great movie. 13 more words required. Now 9 more words. 5 more to go now.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I like Grisham books but went on strike because they were too expensive for kindle editions. But I broke down and bought this one and couldn't put it down. Well written and worth the money, which I see is a little less than before.  If you want a good read, this will fit the bill.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Waiting to view Taken 2 as this one really was good. Intense plot with excellent cast and I will watch this one again
B00APUQRPC|2.0|I'm embarrassed for all three of these actors.  They can do better than this movie.  I would only watch this if you're a girl who's feeling a bit depressed and in need of some light entertainment.
B006RXPUR2|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and recommend It for others to view  The value of the movie is excellent  buy this one

B007BVOEPI|4.0|Thought the series was good because of political Intrigue and action. A bit too much cursing and nudity for my taste.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I loved it so much I went out and bought a copy for myself,  It's a really good navy movie.
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|Needed some movies to download on my Ipad. I haven't watched it yet,  but the download went smoothly and I am excited to be able to watch a movie when my husband and I are traveling.
B00130UFY2|5.0|Have watched whole series and this was no different. Actin packed and surprising to the end.  The movie definitely kept your attention clear to the end.  I have watched the fourth one and was disappointed that Matt Damon wasn't in it- sure hope that doesn't mean there won't be another one.
B004Y042N8|4.0|This game is very addictive. I have on both my phone and my kindle for when I get bored. So glad it was a free app of the day and showed me the joys of it!
B0086700CM|3.0|Kind of boring. Not my kind of game. very definitely not my cup of tea. Others might like it though.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have always enjoyed Patricia cornwell and murder mysteries. This one had me guessing right up to the end. I couldn't figure it our or put it down. Loved it!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Frustrating but entertaining little game! The angry birds and the pigs are really funny in the Star Wars setting. Darth Pig is a hoot and a half!  Highly recommend this one!
B001CQONKY|5.0|CSI now isn't what it used to be, but this season was one of the good ones before it started going down hill.  I love the old CSIs!
1449410243|5.0|If you own a cat, you will definitely identify with this book. Very funny, quick read. My whole family got a kick out of reading it, as we have 3 cats.  Very funny!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I can't help it... I love a good ole mushy love story.  This is a great story...as always I wish there were more.  I definitely recommend this to any romance-addict.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It's not often that I get surprised when reading a fantasy book, but the twist at the end of City of Bones managed it. Clare has a way of making you care about her characters, where you want to read the next book just to see what trials they'll endure next.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|I no longer need paper maps with this! GPS yes was designed for Drivers and Navigation. These Maps allows for Trip Planning! Also good when you travel and don't Get/have a GPS Unit available! Rated it a 4 Star only because, I like to review applications for 30 days or more. Yet this application at least initially delivered what I was seeking.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The ending was different than expected. Kind of makes you think there might be another book in the process. A sequel if you will.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed it, I didn't want to put it down! I'm a little sad I'm almost done reading the books but, now…on to the 3rd book!
B003O86FMW|4.0|It had my emotions up and down through out ...what an unexpected ending.<br />I cannot wait to read the next one
B000I186FW|2.0|I liked the graphic novel. For all its philosophical and historical cluelessness, you could see Moore was an artist who was really trying, although supremely confused. But I just re-watched this, thinking I had enjoyed it somewhat the first time, and it was much less impressive than I remembered.<br /><br />It is so sad to see people praising this movie as \\"thoughtful\\" or \\"smart.\\" It is a commentary on how badly our educational system has failed them. For those who are cognizant of actual current events and actual history know how muddled and confused this film is. The structure of the film itself is some action punctuating tedious sermons about the dangers of fascism and intolerance. It \\"bravely\\" casts Christianity as a danger and all others (including Islam) as victims.<br /><br />So this movie is a kind of \\"opposite day\\" in spades.<br /><br />To expound, anyone paying attention would see that, today, the only religion under constant persecution in mass media and actual, physical threat of death is, in fact, Christianity, from Hollywood to Burma, Africa, and various Communist states. They are routinely slaughtered by the villagefull with nary a peep from the press or the UN. The gay lifestyle is celebrated in the West. Apart from the odd exception, it is in fact Islamists who are burning the Bible and killing infidels. The media is not controlled by Rush Limbaugh, but his opposite numbers, and in staggering array. It is the Bible that gave rise, through long, painful birth pangs, to modern freedom, despite the failings and crimes of its followers, whereas anti-Church Darwinism, which Moore espouses, gave us the horrors of Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Che, et al. and their collective massacres, tortures, imprisonments and injustices in the name of progress. (Yep, surprise: the Hitler-Darwin connection is historically unassailable.)<br /><br />Opposite Day, indeed.<br /><br />In this alternate reality, all this is unknown. Indeed, to enjoy this movie, you have to purge your head of these realities. But that aside, and supposing an alternate history to justify this narrative, this film should be tedious even to the most ardent believer of these fictions. It hits you over the head in ham-handed heaviness, over and over again, with these eternal untruths. Long stretches of yakkety-yak to ensure that you are well inculcated with Opposite History are sprinkled liberally. Plot holes abound. Bad guys have protection details outsourced to the Keystone Cops.<br /><br />However, there is redemption. In their earnestness, the writers forgot to excise the pro-2nd Amendment message - governments should fear their peoples. The people should be armed to resist tyranny.<br /><br />Think on this, even if you loved this movie. What if, per this movie, armed, government-backed Limbaughites were knocking on your door in the middle of the night? You would want to be armed. Yes, the 2nd is meant to foil any sort of tyranny, whether from the Right or Left.<br /><br />The rest of this movie is self-righteous sermonizing and violent revenge fantasy. Bags of salt are advised. To those who still think this movie was \\"smart\\", I would suggest challenging your mind with something like [[ASIN:1414326017 What's So Great about Christianity]] or [[ASIN:0465019374 The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific Pretensions]].

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|What a great story!  Brandon did a great job on this one.  Love the characters and story elements.  I will be looking for more from this author.
B00825921I|4.0|Well that's the atmosphere, which is brooding and great for this story set in the moors. I like the touch of realism that the guy doesn't change his essential core - of selfishness as it happens - all for the love of a good woman. But then I love most of the books I've read by this author.
B002TXZRNQ|5.0|An old man a young man speak of lives lessons,the could haves should haves and would haves if we all had a second chance.a must read for all ages.it will give you hope and inspiration.<br /> Read it today
0743270754|3.0|A lot of the material in the beginning of the book is about the backrounds of the presidential candidates as well as some other influential people. Aside from all this content, the vocabulary back then is so much different that it is today.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|Bought this for my dad for Christmas. He really enjoys listening to it. Good, yet entertaining music to relax to.
B0018RC7QE|1.0|This movie is aweful! It dragged on boringly for ever it seems. It has no real plot.It is super slow. What a waste of the talent of two good actors. The movie really shows how people can turn their back on a healthy committed relationship to follow their own selfish whims. This is pure loathesome, boring selfishness at it's \\"best\\"
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I was weighing options re: which Kindle to buy... my first criterion had nothing to do with ebooks or video. The model HAD to be able to run Evernote. I've used Evernote for several major projects now & can't do without it.
0786915749|2.0|A so-so attempt at authorship, I had a hard time sticking with this book.  Having read lots of military and sci-fi military fiction, as well as history, I had a hard time buying into some of the precepts that establish the Dragonlance \\"universe\\".  From the legend of some of the characters, the song, the descent into the lost world, and the whole valuable commodity thing just didn't ring true with me.<br /><br />Regrettably I bought large trade paperback containing the first three books in the then new Dragonlance series introduced to the fantasy audience at the time.  A friend tried to warn me about the purchase from a bookstore that is no longer there anymore.  But, TSR had seemed to put a lot behind the product, so I took a chance on it.<br /><br />The scope of imagination injected into these written works is impressive, but the execution of the story doesn't hold up for me, and therefore does not pass muster in terms of flavor descriptiveness and getting to the story with aplomb while carrying the flavor.<br /><br />In short, it's not the well written, the world established is not that robust and interesting.  But, that's my personal taste.  Check my previous reviews to see my position on similar products, and then decide.  For those who disagree, well, there you go.<br /><br />But, don't say I didn't warn you.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I liked the characters in this story.  Very peculiar story. I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a Iight read.
B007V80WUC|5.0|Huge, heavy, melodic, epic, anthemic, ethereal, progressive... HA!<br /><br />With 2 of the 10 tracks clocking in at 10:00 minutes or more and none of them under 4:00 the album does require the listener to invest a bit of time to fully appreciate the music; it's void of the instant gratification offered on more typically written albums. Even still it does provide several songs that follow the classical style of verse, chorus x 2, hook bridge MONSTROUS LEAD and chorus out.  This album has a lot going on. Musically huge and technically over the top you'll hear all sorts of familiar tones (to the genre anyway); Dream Theatre of course, Satriani, Yngwie, Neil Pert, bass licks from Sweden's finest bass player Jonas Reingold, Symphony X and others... even a little Dire Straights. The album may strike you as odd to begin with but my goodness - this thing rocks and may become one of those albums I refer to as \\"special\\". You can't go wrong for the price either.  The mix is top notch and the production very good.  Circus Maximus is new to me but I'm fairly familiar with the genre and in my opinion, CM has just catapulted to the top.<br /><br />Crank it up - B
B008TRUDAS|2.0|I purchased the book based upon its standing in the New York Times best seller list.  It is probably a good book for younger folks, but I could not get into it.  I was unable to finish the book.  I encourage others to read it and give me a synopsis.

0385535147|3.0|The Racketeer is a slickly packaged fast food fiction meal that was consumed quickly but, at the end, left me regretting having spent the time and money.  Yes, the plot has its main course of usual twists and turns but the reader sees many of them coming and others are just implausible.  Toss in Grisham's lefty tutorials on the problems with our criminal justice and legal systems, a protagonist who is hard to root for, and a weak ending and you wind up with with a product that is easily ingested but below par.

B009CPES4I|5.0|You will never go wrong with the cast of this movie. They could make reciting the alphabet exciting and fun. There are times when we will see a title of a movie they are in and say \\"Them again.\\" only to say, \\"THEM AGAIN!!\\"
1451696191|5.0|Great book and it ties in super to the movie (which many have not seen). This is a story about a boy and his longing to fit in but also be invisible. I really identified with Charlie (and I graduated high school over 30 years ago.) My current high schooler also identified with Charlie and picked it to do a research paper on.  Great job My Chbosky!
B009SQQRH2|5.0|We got drawn in and watched it too, too many times during the holidays. This is a classic that will be around for many years.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|[Important Update at bottom of review]<br /><br />I started getting into vinyl records a few years ago.  Of course, the Beatles were one of the first and biggest targets to fill out that collection of music.  However, it was not always easy.  It has been hard to find good-sounding Beatles vinyl that wasn't prohibitively expensive.  Most of what was available was either later reissues mastered from the '87 cds (which sound awful) or were old, noisy, and often scratched.<br /><br />So, hearing that the Fab Four were coming to vinyl again was a relief.  Yes, you might have all these songs on CD/MP3, but this is how they were meant to be listened to.  There's little point in reviewing the songs themselves, because what can I say about the Beatles' music that hasn't already been said?  Instead, I'm going to focus on how the sound is on this release and the presentation of the albums.<br /><br />So, how do they sound?<br /><br />I found the sound on these records to be superb.  Some people are complaining that these are not totally analog-derived, but the only test for me is in the listening.  And to my ears, these sound great.  I own the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs version of the White Album, and when I compare that to this, I honestly prefer this remastered version.  It has the clarity of the MoFi vinyl, but hasn't lost the power of the original pressings that I've compared it to either.  And the original pressing is amazing, but there is notable distortion on songs like Happiness is a Warm Gun where the sounds hits the upper limit of what they would press back at the time (they were afraid too much bass or drum would pop the needle out of the record groove).  These pressings sound crystal clear where they are supposed to, and maintain the warmth and power that you want in a vinyl record as opposed to a CD.  Because of the remastering process, the detail and umph on these that is either missing or covered by surface noise on my other records comes through in perfect balance.  Having clean copies of these songs is great, and in some cases they sound even better than the original records (Rubber Soul, for example, which has horrible fake stereo in all American pressings).  If you like vinyl and like the Beatles, or love the Beatles and want to get into vinyl, this set is great.  The artwork on the albums has been beautifully reproduced, and is again often nicer than the original American versions of many of the album covers, which were made from poor facsimiles of the British LPs (compare the pics on the back of Rubber Soul...sorry to keep picking on that album...and it's like night and day).<br /><br />The albums like Sgt. Pepper or The Beatles [the White Album] that had extras come with wonderful reproductions of those extras, such as cutouts and extra pictures.  The book for Magical Mystery Tour is slid into the opposite side of the gatefold cover rather than glue inside of it, making this version more durable than the original album (I have one, and it's falling apart!).  The paper sleeves inside are nice, with plastic lining to keep the records safe.  Also, the labels are al faithful reproductions of the original versions, which is a nice touch (they did a similar thing with the remastered CDs).  I have heard some people complain in other reviews about their pressings, but mine are perfect.  They are nice, heavy 180-gram vinyl.<br /><br />Also included is a large book that details each album.  Most of the information contained in this will already be know to Beatles super-fans, but it's well-presented and there are some pics that even a long-time fan like myself has never seen.  It's really very lovely.  Also, if you don't know a huge amount about the band's history, this is a great source of information (though it downplays some of the tension in the band, as do the \\"official\\" biographies or almost every band).  A wonderful supplement to the albums.  The heavy black box that it comes in is lovely, with a folding lid and foam padding inside to keep your music safe.  Everything fits in nice and snug, without any wiggle room to bounce or break.  It's just really smartly put together.  With a little bit of care, this set will last you a good long time.  If you're trying to put together a Beatles collection on vinyl, I can't see why you'd do anything other than buy this set.<br /><br />[January 2013 Update]<br />[I had previously written that all the records on this set were fine, but as I listened to them the second time I found that Abbey Road had surface noise and a single, very minor, skip in the middle of \\"Because.\\"  I asked Amazon if it was possible to replace just the one album, but they say that they can only replace the entire set.  I walked to a local record shop and bought a copy of Abbey Road and it plays perfectly.  I have a friend who doesn't care as much about surface noise, and she was glad to take the other off of my hands.  When you factor in the cost of the set and the one replacement album, it was still about the same price as buying all the records individually, and the awesome book was more than worth it.  I think they probably have the quality issues under control, but be sure to listen to the records carefully if you buy the set.  Amazon was willing to replace it, so I'm not taking stars off of the review, because the product really is fantastic.  Sad that the first batch of the later albums (The Beatles, MMT, Abbey Road, and Sgt Pepper) were mired with this quality issue, but at least they are replacing the defective sets with no questions asked, so you aren't hurt for buying it.  I just replaced the one because it didn't seem worth all the extra trouble when all the other records were fine, and I had someone who would take the record.]

B00AESN8XY|5.0|I hardly ever rate any apps except for the few that really set themselves apart from the crowd in terms of quality and uniqueness, and this game has both.<br /><br />It's not easy at all starting out. You have the option of unlocking certain perks that will lower the difficulty, but I'm just trying to unlock them the normal way through gameplay. I wish other developers would take a lesson from this team and step it up a notch as far as new quality games like this, and hopefully new debs willbe inspired to get into game development because of unique yet amazingly simple concept games like this.

Had stopped reading her for a long time and was excited when I read some review saying she was back. So, I bought this and feel it is one of her worst works, or at least more of the same. Scarpetta has been written to sound like an insecure teenager, worrying about is she still attractive to men. Come on. This is supposed to be an accomplished woman with a wonderful husband and crazy family and friends. This would have been so much better had it focused more on the story, the science and the solution. Save your money.

B000GCFG7E|5.0|This tenth Jack Reacher book is my second favorite in the series so far. The first in the series (Killing Floor) is still my farvorite, and this tenth installment is similar in that Child relied more on Jack's intellect and powers of deduction than on his brute force. Even after ten books, Child still surprises me in his ability to capture the spirit of people and cities in the US when he's from the UK. This book especially captured the nuances of life in Manhattan. Since the bad guy's apartment was in The Dakota, Reacher asked many people \\"have you seen Yoko\\" so many times it got to be a running gag.<br /><br />What I liked best about The Hard Way is the surprises that I didn't see coming. Child did it masterfully with many characters who appeared to be one thing but weren't. That really  makes for a fun ride and makes it tough to put the book down.
030758836X|5.0|This book deserves it's place on the top 10 book lists. Hope this is just the beginning of a long productive career for this author.

B00006AFF5|3.0|The deleted scenes are not included in the movie itself. That was disappointing. We had seen a version of The Grinch at Christmas time with a bunch of new scenes, and we were hoping that this edition would include that version of the movie. Not so. There were two disks, for some reason I cannot fathom. One disk had the theater-version of the movie plus some extras. The second disk had the exact same movie (as far as I could tell) and some commentary.<br /><br />That said, we LOVE this movie and are pleased to have it on DVD>
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I thought this book was extremely well done. I could see the arduous amount of research that I am positive went into this book and although parts of it were dense and a bit slow, overall, I salute King 's patience and the ever insistent \\"harmonies\\" that continuously tied things together again. It was definitely worth the read.

B009YP9L7U|3.0|Good reading, really enjoyed it Would recommend to anyone who likes this kind of reading. The story line is alright.
0525478817|4.0|This book is one of those books that you more or less know what is going to happen before you even start reading the first page. Two people are going to fall in love and one of them is going to die and it will be really sad. It has been done so much in movies and books that I tend to avoid them because they just don't move me as much as everyone else it seems. This book through cancer into the mix, another reason for me to not read it because a book this widely loved if you don't like it for any reason at all you are going to get hated, bashed, beat up etc.. well not beat up but you get my point. I don't think that is fair because not everyone is going to like every book and I respect the one star reviews for being honest.<br />So I finally picked this up because well I was tired of seeing it everywhere and I have had several people asked me if I had read it yet. Finally late last night I picked it up from Amazon and started reading.<br />My feelings on the book were really mixed and I started to give it 3 stars but I ended up with 4. I liked the overall story however Gus and Hazel really were not all the believable. Yes I am aware not many people feel this way but really stand back and look, what teenagers talk or act like this? The teenagers come across as geneses and the adults come across, well at times like idiots. In the end that is why I didn't really feel as much sadness as I probably would have if I had connected with them more. It wasn't that I didn't understand them it was that they were not believable and there is a difference.<br />I didn't cry, or sob at the ending but overall I did enjoy the story and the writing was good so I ended up with 4 stars. I am planning to look up more of Green's work as this is the first book I have read written by John Green.

B00AKL1XPU|2.0|The game is okay, but there should be a way to earn peanuts without spending real money. It's not worth it for me. I kept this game for a few months. I'd built an amazing zoo and it starts to freeze and not allow me access to random reserves and my friends reserves; I have to click on the reserves 6 or more times before I could view the reserves; then one day nothing. I did a hard reset and this is the only game that would not work. I downloaded it on my android and the same thing started. Suggested I clear the data. Did not want to do that because I knew it would delete my progress. They keep saying it would not delete my progress. I went ahead and cleared the data and it deleted my progress. I so peeved... I just deleted the game.

Even a natural propensity to positive thinking can take a few hits when your employer is disolving.

B0070066DI|5.0|Fits in a Silverstone Ml03b just fine. Cools a hot c2quad Q9650 to 40c idling and keeps it at 64c at 1400rpm...59c ish at full 2100rpm...which is noisy by the way...but it never reaches that speed in my setup.<br /><br />This was purchased for a XBMCbuntu HTPC to reduce the noise from the stock Intel hsf, which at full load kept bridging 80c, idled at 50c and @2000rpm was very loud.<br /><br />Very impressed with the heat dissipation capabilities and the zero noise factor at HTPC duties. My psu is louder than this thing. Also, the fan runs at 600rpm and keeps the proc at 50c... In other words its Inaudible unless you put your face 1ft away from it.<br /><br />To put it Into perspective my ps3 is louder than my htpc now that I've installed this hsf and replaced my psu fan with a Swiftec Helix.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Superior heat dissipation in tight, low airflow environments, which in my case, my htpc case has Zero case fans. Even the psu does not extract heat from the case. MY Silverstone ml03b runs no casefans with this hsf.<br />- Low speed half height fan is very quiet.<br />- sturdy mounting system<br />- extreme low height<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Instructions could be better, but still an easy install...mobo has to be out of the case though.<br />- I must have missed the boat, bc these are no longer available from typical overclocking and PC enthusiast vendors anymore. I'm actually going to buy another one now, just in case I need it for another build.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />- Don't overclock with this thing or put it on a higher watt CPU. It's not designed for OCing. My workstation runs on water, now that's for OCing...this is for low noise, low heat HTPC applications.
B0013A1T8I|4.0|I bought this movie for my granddaughter about a year or so ago.  I would watch it with her, but did'nt pay to much attention to it. The more I watched and paid attention the more I liked it so bought it for myself.  I recommend for children and adults.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a game that involves immersing activities, but no real right or wrong way to play. Here, the world is made entirely out of blocks, giving the enviroment a playful and original look and functionality. You can build homes, farm crops, fight monsters, search for diamonds, climb mountains and the possibilities don't end there.<br />  The player can create a world in one of two modes: survival mode or creative mode. Survival mode gives players limited health, animals and monsters to see, and resources to gather. In this mode, you must eat food or sleep in a bed to heal wounds and dying will allow you to respawn by a bed or your original spawn point. Despite the necessities of living, survival mode is by no means difficult, but rather fun and occupying. If this mode is hard for you, the options tab includes peaceful mode, which removes monsters from the game and health regenerates automatically. The other mode is creative mode. Creative simply allows you to use blocks from an a selection page and get straight into building without fear of danger of any kind. Creative mode gives players immunity from fall damage, lava, explosions; essentially every threat in the game. Finally, you can FLY in creative mode.<br />  I currently own v. 0.5.0, so it's pretty up-to-date. Don't expect it to be anything like the PC or Xbox 360 Edition, because the features aren't quite that advanced. This app does have staples in the Minecraft universe such as creepers, diamonds and creative mode. However, Minecraft fanboys may be disappointed to<br />know that the latest features like enchanting, minecarts, brewing, dungeons, and the Nether don't make an appearance. In essence, the game is the barebones Minecraft experience with limitations like a smaller map and lack of mechanics.<br />  Anyway, the game features no tutorial, so you will need to learn a lot of items and interactions by experimenting with them. Chances are that despite its flaws, this game is enjoyable provided you like building and exploring. If have a lot of creative ideas, this game allows you to build so many incredible structures and find interesting ways to bend the world around you.<br />  Controls:<br />-tap the arrow keys in the bottom left to walk in the indicated direction.<br />-tap the center key to jump.<br />-tap and hold on a block to break it(this will allow you to collect certain resources).<br />-tap the panels on the hotbar to select items and blocks.<br />-the far right panel opens your inventory.<br />-from the inventory, tap &quot;craft&quot; to use the crafting menu.<br />-scroll through the crafting menu by swiping your thumb. tap an item or block to see what you need to craft it as well as what required components you already have. This is where you will find most of your essential information.<br />-tap the X to exit the menu.<br />-tap a panel in the inventory to bring it to the hotbar.<br />-tap a block to use it or place/use the currently held block/item on it.<br />-tap a monster/animal to hit it. Holding a sword, axe or pickaxe will do more damage.<br />- tap and hold on food items while you're holding them to eat them.<br />-In creative tap the center/jump button twice quickly to enter flight mode. Tap twice again to fall. Or while flying, tap jump and slide your finger up or down to rise or fall.<br />  A few tips:<br />- monsters spawn in dark areas or a night. Try to get shelter before sunset.<br />-different tools can be made from different materials. Materials include wood, cobblestone, iron, gold, and diamond. Each of these have different strengths.<br />-sugarcane can only be found, grown, or placed by water.<br />-cook' beef, chicken, and pork in a furnace to make it better in quality. Also, be sure to refine iron/gold ore in a furnace before use.<br />-to farm, build a hoe and tap the ground to plash dirt or grass blocks. This will ocassionally drop seeds which can be put back in the soil to grow wheat.<br />-each monster has a different attack, and they also drop rare items. Learn about them.<br />-above all, have fun. That's the big point of the game!

Well....the story of Adam Brown makes one think, am i doing enough for my family, wife, kids, friends and the rest of my surroundings. I can never be like Adam Brown, but if i do a little more like him, I will make people more happy. So maybe he also changed my life.<br /><br />This is a strong story of a weak soul with a wery strong will. AND the story of a NAVY wife who have to live through it all.

B009FZFONO|5.0|I've always enjoyed a good horror flick now and then, but movies (ot television shows for that matter) with Zombies wasn't one of my favorites, until I heard my co-workers talking about the television series &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;. For the first two seasons, I kept hearing about it until half way through the third season, I was convinced to watch it. I watched the second episode of the third season - from that one show, I was hooked. I purchased the first, second and third season shows. For some reason, I found the story intriguing. The time, setting and locations are so realistic. I always put myself in the show's predicament and wonder how I would handle the situation in order to survive. As of this writing, I'm in Walking Dead withdrawal, and I'm anticipating the continuation of the third season!

B005LAIHSQ|4.0|(Originally written as my new blog, found here  [...]) Thanks for reading. Justin D.     Snow White and the Huntsman (2012)   Universal Pictures    PG-13    Directed by: Rupert Sanders    Starring: Charlize Theron, Kristen Stewart, Chris Hemsworth, Sam Claflin    Snow White and the Huntsman is a Hollywood film based on the fantastic stories written by the Brothers Grimm. In my estimation it is the third film that could be attributed to those wonderful stories, although in fairness the movie the Brothers Grimm was more of a Hollywood version of the brothers themselves.    Kristen Stewart plays our Snow White in this telling, with Charlize Theron holding court as Queen Ravenna. We are introduced to Snow White first as the young daughter of King Magnus and Queen Eleanor, she is show to be the Fairest of them All, with a pure and loving heart. Through an illness Queen Eleanor passes on and the King is left heartbroken. In his grief he is lured into battle outside the castle walls where he meets and is immediately love-struck with Ravenna, so much so that within days he marries her. At first she seems to take a genuine liking to our young Snow White, it quickly sours however as we see the new Queen's true motivations. It is shown that at a young age one thing was instilled in Ravenna, something that seems to hold true in our current day, Beauty and Youth command true power and sway over all else in society. Ravenna wants to be young and beautiful forever and unfortunately for Snow White, she is the one that can save or destroy the Queen. She firstly calls upon the Huntsman (Hemsworth), a brokenhearted man himself having lost his wife when the Queen first took the throne. He agrees to help on the condition the Queen resurrects his wife. The Huntsman leads them into the Dark Forest, not knowing who he is hunting, and it is there after he has found Snow White that he is made to realize he was used and he would indeed see his wife again but not as he had intended. The Queen,now furious after having not succeeded so easily sends her brother out to hunt the girl and bring her back and kill the Huntsman. William (Claflin), a childhood friend of Snow White who has long lamented the fact that he left her behind so many years ago, joins the hunt, feeling it to be an easy way to find and save her. Chased into the forest of the fairies we meet the dwarves, so familiar and yet not one of them bare the names we come to expect. From here we get some of the traditional pieces we remember, an apple, sweet sorrow and a kiss, but how they play out.. well, I won't spoil that for you. In the end we get a solid battle and an outcome that leaves you both satisfied and ready for more.    I really wasn't sure what I was going to feel from this movie. I will simply say, I loved it. basing itself more off of the original darker tales from the Brothers Grimm, these are fairy tales I am more than willing to get behind and recommend. The visuals are simply stunning the filtering they used makes it feel like it is a dark and brooding Winter. The music elicits the emotions when needed and is non existent as well. Many of the story changes in this film, make infinitely more sense to me and I feel add more depth to the story, things such as who gives Snow White the apple, why is Ravenna so hellbent on achieving long lasting Beauty and Youth. These things actually make sense in this film, and Kristen Stewart does a fantastic job as Snow White, I am of the mind that her acting skills are vastly underrated by many who just toss her aside based on their dislike of her Twilight films (which are good, if you just go in with an open mind). Charlize Theron however is the true star in this film. As always, she gives her all and absolutely owns her role as Queen Ravenna and basically the movie itself, she is simply amazing here and it shouldn't be missed.    The Film clocks in at just about above Two Hours, and like many movies it does have its ups and downs, and probably could have saved about Twelve to Fifteen minutes, but all in all this was as fun and entertaining movie I have seen, and would highly recommend it to any and all.    Final Verdict: 4/5 ( See It)
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great turn of events but huge holes  and unsatisfying in ending.  Not ht e best of the year in my estimation
B004J4WKTW|4.0|\\"The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.\\"<br /><br />While the opening does a great job at grabbing your attention, it took me a few chapters to get to where I felt like I could finish this book.  The blurb on the cover of the book is actually very misleading.  While there are two magicians locked in a duel, it is not that simple.  There is much more to the story and I feel like those who read the jacket would assume this novel is something entirely different and color their thoughts on the story.  It is a delightful story, set in a world that you will most certainly wish to inhabit after reading.<br /><br />I know all of the other reviews will give you a rundown of the story; I do not always like to do that in my reviews because I want to tell readers how I felt about the book. Therefore, there will be no story synopsis here-<br />The story itself starts slowly, and though Morgenstern creates an air of mystery with her atmosphere, more character development would have served her much better. Much of the book I found myself wondering what was going on and while some authors can master the time jumps and split narratives, I found this to be a little confusing.  The story would have more flow, if she had stuck to a straight narrative. I would have liked the action picked up much earlier, not ten years into the competition.<br /><br />However, I love all types of writing, but the one I love the most is the kind where the author does such a great job at creating imagery that the reader feels a part of the world in which the story takes place.  Eric Morgenstern does a fantastic job at creating a world, where the reader can almost feel the warmth of the bonfire, smell the cinnamon thingamajigs and hear the sounds of the circus.  Her excellent vision for her world is part of what makes this book worth reading.<br /><br />While, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, I did feel like there was something missing.  I feel like the characters I was supposed to care about did not really ignite with me until towards the end of the story.  I think I wanted to know more about them, more about how they felt as all of this was going on.  I think that if I were in the same situation that the main protagonists found themselves in I would have reacted much differently.  Marco and Celia seemed to be content, up until the very end, to be puppets for two very strange and detached men.<br />With all of that said, I will miss Le Cirque des Rêves.  I will miss the atmosphere that Morgenstern created and I was just starting to become attached to the characters, I wish she had made me love them earlier in the book.<br /><br />Truthfully, that information on the book jacket rather spoils something that the reader should have been left to discover along with the charactersmissing.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This series is one of the best that I've ever watched. It appeals to fantasy, science fiction, and of course horror and the degradation of humans.
B009FZFONO|5.0|There's just something about this show that makes me watch it, it's a must see!!!  Season three has really picked up the action and I can't wait for it to resume. This mid-season break feels like an eternity.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|The dvd arrived on time and in good condition. I enjoyed watching this edition of the series, however the premise is getting somewhat stale. Maybe it's time to put it to rest.

B006LSZECO|3.0|It was almost like the author ran out of ideas so she just quit.  It was really interesting and suspenseful, until Amy returns, after that it became almost tedious to read. I had heard so much about this book, I think it was a disappointment.

0345803485|1.0|I'm sorry, but I don't get the hype of this book. The writing is terrible and the story is about an abusive relationship. I'm not talking about the sexual content, which wasn't as shocking as people described it to be. I'm talking about the rest of the story. I know it's for fun and as adults, we should know the difference between reality and fantasy. I just know that too many girls grow up into women thinking that kind of emotionally abusive relationship is normal and actually live those relationships out in real life - beyond their teenage years. It's sad to me that our culture glorify things like this. And from what I heard about the other two books, it sends the exact wrong message - that you can \\"fix\\" someone as messed up as Christian Grey if you just take enough abuse and stick around long enough. I know people will completely disagree with me, and that's fine. This is my opinion and I'm just throwing it out there.<br /><br />Also, this is the best review of the series EVER. Go read it, now: [...]
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy has undoubtedly turned me from a regular avid reader to a crazed \\"I can't leave the house without my Fifty Shades\\" lunatic. I am so pleased with the compelling ways the author presents the characters and conveys their emotions. But most importantly, I am impressed with the consistency of the theme. Often times authors stray away from the original theme as a novel saga progresses, but E L James did not...while blending and introducing new characters and new conflicts with the old SEAMLESSLY. I give this FIFTY STARS DESERVED!
B00ARAO720|2.0|Premium rush is a movie based in Manhattan and is about a bike messenger who picks up an envelope that attracts the interest of a dirty cop, who pursues the cyclist throughout the city. I was disappointed in this movie considering the actors in it but for me the presentation and some of the acting is a little hokey and the overall story a bit boring.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Its nice to know that everyonce in a while it's still possible to find a movie that is good positive viewing for the whole family. The wife and i also had a good time while watching . Great for the friday nite special.
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|Thinking this was a cartoon aiming for a young audience, I decided to rent and see what it was about.  The story is an average one if not a little slow and boring.  My biggest issue with this movie is I am not sure what audience it is aiming for.  It seems a big scary for young children and not so entertaining for the older ones or even adults.  I am not sure I would recommend watching if you have small kids as the imagery might cause nightmares.

B000LB7G00|5.0|If you have ever used a \\"mouse\\" to try and navigate around a CAD program and/or Google Sketchup which I use (Another must have); it can absolutely drive you made trying to coordinate your mouse and keyboard to get through your design!!    When I heard about this through the tutorial \\"Harwood Podcast for Sketchup\\" I was amazed.  When I received 3Dconnexion Space Navigator and started to navigate through my design I felt like I was actually walking through my design inside of the computer!...I was absolutely beside myself on how easy and interactive the navigator is!!    I know that there are other tools like this out in the cyber world, but they can cost you an arm and a leg.  My son has a philosophy that he lives by; \\"Cost vs Functionality...will I use it and is it easy to use\\".    I guess if design and/or drafting is your career the justification for paying 100's of dollars or more for a navigator is a must have...  But, I would venture to say that even the most avid design/draft person out there would be very happy with the Space Navigator.

The only song that was not up to par was the last one on the soundtrack, The Lonely Mountain isn't nearly as great as others he's had a hand in for this franchise. That sound is no May It Be, or Gollum's Song, or Into The West. I hope the next will be better. Over all this is still a great soundtrack.

B008YKRRI6|4.0|Klemperer in Beethoven, those classic performances from the 50s. Although most are in very good stereo, it's those mono versions that stand out for me. His mono 5th is, for me, the best performance I've ever heard and the recording is good too. Maybe I'm showing my age but again, for me (and it's a very personal thing) these performances have never been bettered. Here is Klemperer with a wonderful orchestra (the Philharmonia/New Philharmonia of the 50s) doing his thing before he started to slow down.<br /><br />My guess is that this collection will only be surpassed when Andrew Rose from Pristine Classics applies his amazing XR technology to these recordings.
B008MEM24S|5.0|A very entertaining and enjoyable app! An 11 year old like me needs some puzzle in her life! I love the show but now an app for it, good idea, get it I know you'll love it!

0307744434|2.0|After reading the synopsis of this book, I was excited and wanted to love it. Sadly, I just didn't get it! This story was confusing and just all over the place. I had a very hard time keeping up with what year it was and all of the side stories of the many different characters. I thought all of the sub-stories would come together in this dramatic conclusion and instead, it just left me scratching my head, wondering what the heck this story was REALLY about. I didn't connect to any of the characters and I'm still not entirely sure what the point of this book was. I feel like I should give it 1 star, but I didn't HATE the book. The imagery was gorgeous and I did actually finish the book. Ehhh...it's 387 pages of my life I'm never getting back.
0525478817|2.0|It may be a tour de force for the author to speak from a girl's point of view, but he flunks in speaking from a kid's point of view.  How many video game playing 16 year olds rap about Shakespeare, T.S. Eliot, William Carlos Williams . . . .  And she didn't even go to high school.
030758836X|2.0|Aweful!!!! Are you freaking kidding me? This was the most ridiculous book ending I have ever read! I'm absolutely furious that I wasted my time reading it. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because it was decent until the last 20 or so pages. complete nonsense-that is how I describe this book.
030758836X|4.0|Reading \\"Gone Girl\\" reminded me of how I felt when I passed a bad car accident on the road the other day.  I looked at the pile of debris with amazement, with curiosity and dread.  For a thrilling look at the perversity of human relations, you will find this a great read.
034580404X|5.0|Oh, I'm sorry romantic literature for my female friends. Only it's S & M bondage. OK, guys, if you never knew this, women can be just as crude, lewd, and horny as guys - and they DO talk about it amongst themselves - only we are not supposed to know. The open secret on this trilogy - if you don't know - is that it is so good they re-read it and masturbate to it. Like over and over. As in some reach climax without even touching themselves. Swear to God. I gave it as a gift; like most men, I like my porn without so much foreplay. I don't really want to talk about it, but if you wanted to know what all the fuss was about, that's it. Skim a few pages and you'll get the general idea. See the faux author on book tours and using her pen-name and you'll see the next cottage industry springing up worldwide - porn for women. Great - maybe it'll get more people reading again. Helps to revitalize relationships. Not kidding. Your emotional, mixed-up cold fish will grab you by the back of the head. Is that a good thing? I'll let you decide.

I hate to pay money for these short hardcover books, but I did, on faith - that they wouldn't compare to his past successes but maybe I'd find something there - and I did. He's better than I gave him credit for and I (a cheapskate) had to bregrudgingly admit I got my money's worth.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I chose this book because it was listed as a bestseller by amazon.  I will not trust their reviews again.  The story is good, but the character development, dialogue, is lacking, it's more a teenage geared movie script than the page turner it was described as.  You knew where the story was headed pretty quick.  The best character by far was a secondary character Breckin.  If u liked twilight u will like this
B0002L592Q|5.0|Favorite Movie. We all know about Rita Hayworth and Stephen King - what's this? Only the best way to see it with never-before seen extras - read the description. If you are among the significant number of Americans who think this is the best movie ever made - why don't you have this?

Watterson may have invented LOL before there was such a thing; if so, he deserves a royalty for that, too - especially since he didn't want to license these characters to keep them true to the spirit of the strip. Do the right thing - share this with someone too young to know any better. They will (sooner or later) thank you for enriching their lives.
B0020MKTOS|4.0|A deep movie. A love and hate movie one that requires a deep understanding of some vets who were placed in a situation and the scars left behind.
0321898648|5.0|Previous review resulting in two stars: The book and the computer based lessons are excellent. But I am on page 254 of the book and it directs that  certain photograph projects be accessed,  but they are missing from the dvd downloaded materials. What gives????<br />Updated review resulting in 5 stars: after emailing Peachpit with my problem and getting their prompt response, I learned that the project files are not missing. What happened is that I had skipped lesson 4 because I did not think it was relevant to me, but in so doing I had failed to go through an exercise of merging photo libraries where the end result is that all of the supposedly missing photo projects are picked up. My mistake and it goes to show you that you really need to religiously follow the book's instructions. So, I am revising my rating to be 5 stars....the instructions and lessons really are excellent.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book the storyline was edgy and emotional it made u want to cry in parts and in other parts it evoked feelings of joy and happiness and made you smile. I loved the characters and how they grew and entwined into one big story the author was really clever the way she introduced them and then blended their history and the flashbacks into childhood were amazingly written ...this book is by far my fave read in a long time! Loved it!
B007WFTFG6|2.0|I think it is too difficult to use.  I don't see a toddler being able to color with this easily.  I am removing it from my Kindle<br /><br />Coloring Book for Todders  FREE
B006LSZECO|3.0|Given the literary kudos accorded Gone Girl I think my expectations were beyond the books intention and the writer's capability.  Although the story is, initially, riveting, by the last third I found it predictable and manipulative (not in a good way).  Not too far into it you begin to understand that it was (intentionally?) written to be escapist entertainment.  Don't look for characters that make sense (or likable characters for that matter).  And don't look for exquisite writing.  Keep your expectations low.  Enjoy it for what it is, a sugar-high.  When it's over you crash and feel slightly guilty for having consumed it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Wow! Was I ever surprised when I downloaded the Kindle app for my Android base Polaroid Tablet that I got for Christmas. Within seconds I had all of the purchases that we made on my Android Tablet that were on my wife's Kindle with the exception of the games for Kindle. Now I can read books that she has read and we don't have to share a device to read them. Now we wish that the Kindle was a Kindle Fire too! In that way she could read Time and Newsweek too!. Amazon does sell that too!
B008476HBM|5.0|Ships quickly. Item as described. good to use. will recommend it and buy it again in the future if needed.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Take plenty of time to read this great novel of all time. It is no wonder that it was made into a musical on Broadway and the London stage and into a French movie and an english movie which is playing in theaters throughout the world. While Victor Hugo weaves his story he also goes into great detail about things such as the Paris sewer system. Get it here at Amazon.com and enjoy many of the great free classics that are begging to be read on your Kindle.
B000JML90Y|5.0|Ships quickly. Item as described. It is a great book. The only shortcoming is the small letter size. But considering its price, it is still a good deal.
B0015DWLD0|4.0|This was an amazingly insightful look into the class structures of India.  It reminded me very much of another excellent book exploring Indian culture, Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|These series made me laugh and made me cry. Masterpiece! I was surprised to find additional DVD's included in the box set (interviews with actors and producers). Now my brother is also hooked up to The West Wing!<br />Fast delivery, great quality. Thank you Amason!
B008WCP2KG|5.0|I LOVE THIS COMBO-PACK!!!!!! The special features are pretty epic too!!!!! The DVD made a great Christmas present for my sister, who also loves this movie!!!!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Once again, as with many books I've tried to read of late, this one lacked character development.  If you are looking for a sexually explicit book, with very little story line to draw you in, this is your book.  I didn't finish the book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|a very cute story with lots of mini games and beautiful graphics. its great to keep kids occupied and very cute and wholesome fun.
B00646UU5Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this show. I think they did a great job finishing off the series. The viewer was not left off wandering what happened. They wrapped it up and still left it open for the possibility of a movie or another season. I would totally recommend it to others. Especially those who enjoy fantasy and science fiction. I also recommend starting with the first season in order to understand where some of the characters and story lines fit in. There are several reoccurring elements and characters that are better understood when the series is followed from the beginning. The first episode of season one is a touch slow at first, but stick with it, this is an enjoyable show and worth the effort.
0810989956|5.0|Great book, has plenty of activities to entertain any wimpy kid fan=) Nice addition to the growing collection my Lil bro. Already has!
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|Great movie for all ages, the creators have great imagination to put it to real life excellent you will enjoy it
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is best experience you can have just playing an app. The multiplayer online is just like call of duty. Love it live it
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Songs got stuck in my head just as easily as the last time. It was all great stuff from childhood.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book had me crying every sad moment. And made me feel the emotions that everybody feel. Making me cry, laugh, and happy for each character. Thank you Susanna Collins for an amazing series.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is amazing! I love it. It's extremely useful. I especially like how it tracks to the second how much time a charge lasts with whatever you're doing. Also tracks how well your battery is. Temperature and quality are also tracked. One cool trick is you can change the color of the battery in the notification. I would highly recommend it. I only use the free version. I don't remember off hand if there's a paid one.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|Looking for an action packed, fast-paced read with vivid imagery? Dashner's \\"Maze Runner Trilogy\\" might be what you're looking for. It has great allegorical qualities that not only ask questions about an apocalypse, but also seems to question purpose and maybe even a look at the author's views on creation. Fans of \\"The Hunger Games\\" will enjoy.
0425252868|5.0|I just finished your book and I must say it was an exceptional read. I have a WWII book collection that spans over 50 years and this is one of the best if not, \\"The Best\\" read I have ever encountered.  I liked the way you delved into the workings of the Luftwaffe and their pilots and told their stories. It is nice to see that not all Germans of that time were \\"Nazis\\" but men who were fighting for their country in a war they knew they could not possibly win yet they kept fighting to defend their way of life as they knew it.<br /><br />I only wish I could have been able to meet Mr. Stigler and Mr. Brown and listen first hand to their stories.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that you plan to continue writing about WWII and you have a good hleper in Mr. Alexander whom I met once in Lebanon when he was doing a book signing about Dick Winters.<br /><br />All the best to you and your budding career and I look forward to seeing more of your works on the market in the future.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Debra
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love that I can use it across platforms. I use kindle, android, and PC. Use it for work and play. Love the audio notes and ability to organize notebooks.
078689136X|4.0|The second in the series, the characters continue to be entertaining, if a little improbable, and once again Nikki and Rook track down the bad guys.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have bought several books on building muscle, but have usually lost interest after a few days of reading. I picked up this book and read the book cover to cover in two days. It has a lot of helpful information that is easy to follow. I began the workouts as described in the book and I am looking forward in seeing the results in the coming months. If you are new to strength training, this is an excellent book to get started with. The author even answers questions for you if you sign up at his website. It was a very valuable purchase for me.
141690977X|5.0|Deeply insightful.  I had no idea now naive I was about how men can just walk away and never tell you why -- just leave you hanging and wondering what happened.  The book was enlightening and  you can tell the authors really cared about their readers knowing the truth.  Phenomenal helpful book.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This is the second Jack Reacher book I've read and have enjoyed it as much as the first (a lot).<br /><br />Great characters, interesting story, kinda predictable outcome (our hero still has many books to go), but every bit a terrific ride. And that's the beauty of this author.  He keeps the momentum going and the excitement building.<br /><br />I couldn't put the damn thing down. In fact I'm holding off on the next one until I can spend some quality time with my family.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have been playing Mahjong on my PC and on my TV for years. It was nice to be able to download it to something more portable.
1616960922|5.0|I love that Brandon's shorter works are now available. For one, that means he keeps making money so he can keep writing, but more importantly it gives his fans (like me) more to read rather than waiting a year or more for his next 1000 page epic.  And The Emperor's Soul is a perfect short novel to start with if you happen to be one of the 2-3 people who hasn't yet read any of his longer works.<br /><br />A key part of the fantasy genre is magic and the more fantastical the better...to a point. For me, it still has to hang together and make sense. The soulstamp magic of this book does just that. But perhaps what is most magical of all are Brandon's characters, well developed, believable and complex. The fantasy world is a richer place for having Brandon Sanderson as a part of it.
B004I744AS|5.0|Love this app. Works great on my smart phone and includes even the obscure words I often come across in my reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't know what I was getting into when I started reading this book. I forget who recommended it to me but I'm glad they did. I couldn't stop reading, and was quite glad the remaining books in the series were already available so I didn't have to stop at the end of this one. If you only have this book - go ahead and get the other two right now, you'll want them!<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant to let my 11 year old read this book since I think it shows the emotions and turmoil of the characters so much more than the movie did. Plus the violence of small children fighting for their lives and killing each other in cold blood is disturbing in a way that makes you not stop thinking about it. (This made me worry about the movie too) I did let her read it and she hasn't had nightmares or shown any psychotic tendencies.<br /><br />I'm glad I read the book before I saw the movie though. The book is much much better!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son absolutely loves Minecraft. He has spent hours building and creating his own fortresses. Thanks to the creators of Minecraft.
B005ZFXBYM|5.0|I don't know how many years I've owned the LP album, but I've nearly played the grooves off of it. It's great to hear the all of the songs and tunes fresh again, without the surface noise of an LP record!
B00ADS98FC|3.0|We bought Pitch Perfect because my family loved the show The Sing Off. My 9 year old enjoyed it the most. She has watched it at least half a dozen times. It was juvenial for its PG-13 rating which is why I gave it 3 stars. I would recommend it to others because it is a fun movie.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|Bravo to the filmmakers for taking a thoughtful route on this documentary.  Could have been very exploitive but ended up being very touching and sensitive.  I enjoyed this so much more than I thought I would.  I was expecting something horribly awkward, but by the end, my friends and I were so happy we watched it.  Thank you to the filmmakers for taking the time to do this right, and do it so well.
B005R32L66|5.0|And MS didn't screw it up yet.  Since it is free and common, most friends already have it or can get it quickly and easily.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Sushi is interesting? Yes, in this case it is. What an entertaining documentary on the 86 year old sushi \\"master\\" Sukiyabashi Jiro. The story about his work ethic and his middle-aged sons that have trained under him for decades while trying to live up to his standards, will hold your attention and entertain you. The cinematography and editing is amazing!<br /><br />This should have been nominated for best documentary for the Academy Awards.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Every episode in every season has so far been hilarious!  The material is always fresh and funny, would reccomend to everyone.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Like many reviewers, I am a longtime fan of Diana Krall. She has taken jazz and the American Songbook and made it fresh and contemporary. I remember seeing her back at the Algonquin in NYC in '95. She was mesmerizing in that room. I have enjoyed every album of hers, even her foray into more modern music in the CD \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\" (or some title like that...apologies to Elvis Constello, her husband, who wrote the piece). \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" (or \\"Sad Rag Doll\\"), the latest CD by Krall, is flat out terrible. And, it is not bad because she is branching out into new music. It is just plain bad...in every dimension. I am a guitar player and have recorded music myself (as an amateur), so I have some understanding of how to balance instruments and song elements. In some of the tracks the twanging, screeching guitar overpowers Krall's lovely, expressive voice. Yes, using T-Bone Burnett as your producer is fresh and new for this performer, but it was a huge mistake. This is one of those CDs that I could barely listen to the end. I threw it in the back of my CD rack and will not pick it up again. As others have said in their comments, there are so many other song genres that Diana Krall could do well to venture beyond her jazz and American Repertory foundation. One of my favorite Sarah Vaughan albums was when she did all Brasilian songs (on the Pablo Label). I think Diana could do a wonderful job with Brasilian Boss Nova. She also needs to stick to producers who truly understand what she is all about. Don't buy this CD. It is truly awful.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|My four year old loves this game. Kinda like Hello Kitty meets Restaurant Story, cute. Gotta think fast, be quick. I like playing it too. But I wish you could earn the helpers vs having to buy them.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It is very easy to use.  It automatically reshuffles when there are no moves left.  There is also a large variety of boards.
B004HD61KE|4.0|This book is full of topics to make you think while you enjoy the storyline. The characters are well done, and I can only blame the editors involved for the two mistakes that weren't fixed. The first mistake is that the phrase is supposed to be pants leg, not pant leg. Heavy breathing doesn't have any legs. Also, you just get off something, you don't get off of it.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|My boys seek all things Batman, thus, new movie, wait for deal & Bingo; two happy boys, at a great price for mom.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|I was hooked from the first episode! The plot is gripping, the characters are multidimensional, and the acting is superb. Damian Lewis is amazing in his ambiguous portrayal. Love it!
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|A struggle getting through the first half of the book. I have almost gone onto the next book several times but hope it gets better. A very slow and boring read so far.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I will start by saying that I was a DJ working a blues show for a few years that had a pretty wide-ranging definition of blues and I found it irritating how many blues fans are purists - not unlike the people who booed Dylan at Newport.  They want to hear want they want to hear and not much else.<br /><br />So I find many of the negative reviews here to be unfair in that they judge the album based on their expectations and personal tastes rather than focus on the artist and what he is trying to communicate.  The title cut is R&B.  That should communicate something.<br /><br />So, for the blues fans there is plenty of electric blues with big crunchy chords and also that gem of a delta slide tune at the end.  Scattered amongst these are some other great songs that reflect the kind of soul music you just don't get enough of these days.<br /><br />I won't go through all the songs but here is a list of the possible influences and sounds I heard, in no particular order.  See if you hear them too.<br /><br />Hendrix obviously, but more S.R. Vaughan.<br />Prince.<br />D'Angelo absolutely (love his Brown Sugar album).  Hear him in the title track and \\"You Saved Me\\"<br />Gordie Johnson from Big Sugar - a brilliant Canadian guitar player who relocated to Gary Clark Jr.'s hometown of Austin, Texas.  Would love to see them play together.<br />Smokey Robinson and/or Curtis Mayfield - take your pick.<br />Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith.  His song \\"Sea Cruise\\" shows up, though many reviewers hear Chuck Berry.  Huey Smith began with Little Richard and was tremendously influential in New Orleans R&B<br />Sonny Landreth/John Hiatt.<br />The Beatles - \\"Oh, Darling\\"<br />Tupac. Yes, Tupac.<br />Son Seals, Son House and the whole damn history of it all.
B000025XKM|5.0|I find it very interesting, a lot of details that would bug me about another artist's work (the insubstantial voice, the inconsistency of the lyrics, the limited dynamic range), absolutely don't cross my mind when I listen to this album. The guitar work is balanced and nuanced and unfussy, the voice is led along the chord structure like a sad-eyed orphan, and the whole record transports me. It's brimming over with atmosphere, and always ends too soon. Fragile, flawed, sublime. 5/5
0446547646|5.0|This book was a present for a friend of mine who just loves Nicholas Sparks.  At lease, I know she'll appreciate the present.

B007ZCQJOM|5.0|One time, on vacation, very early in the morning, the color Blue arrived. He was got up in a pinstripe suit and a Spirit Hood (R), and he kept tilting his head to the side in that infuriatingly cool way. Of course, you followed him. And he led you to a room underground, a cavern full of polka dot lights and glowing bars and faux fur rugs thrown haphazardly across the floor. It was the greatest dance party you've ever been privy to. You knew nothing about the hosts or the guests. This is Beach House's &#34;Bloom.&#34;
0812993357|5.0|This book was on my daughter's wish list so I got it for her for Christmas.  She was happy when she opened the present.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book was so different from what I usually read. I saw the movie and it left me with lots of questions.  The book put everything in perspective and much better than the movie.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|lve listening to this  cd all the time while driving it has a lot of different sounds for different moods even my husband like some of them. If you've seen the movie you know where you are in it.
B000FBJHEO|4.0|I read Cosmopolis because I had seen the movie (also hypnotic) and needed to get more background, as well as understand how Cronenberg used the words in the book to adapt it for a screenplay.  This is definitely one of the odder books I have read recently, but I loved the wordplay and the insight into a somewhat psychotic mind.  Yes, some of it is silly, but I think that if you can really get into Eric's head, the book is fascinating.  He is someone trying to connect to reality rather than his own inner life (the only one he has).<br />This is the first DeLillo novel I had read, so I cannot compare it to any other of his works.<br />I feel that the movie itself, Cosmopolis, was very much misunderstood and poorly reviewed.  Come on, forget that Robert Pattinson was in Twilight, and look at the movie for itself.  Cronenberg is always a fascinating director, and all of the actors were superb.  Pattinson and Giamatti towards the end of the movie are spellbinding in a ritual dance of cat and mouse (which is which, and when).<br />Overall, a little Hamlet, and a lot of 21st century zeitgeitz.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Kidding, it was another great book by Rick Riordan I once again recommend it to mythology lovers. The site was excellent
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a very sweet little app.  Once it calculates the battery life on your device (mine is a Kindle Fire), it is quite accurate in telling you expected battery life.  It is easy to use and has an attractive visual presentation.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love,  love,  LOVE  this app. I spend far too much time on it. I've had to dig a bit in the Help pages to find things that seem like common questions (&quot;How can a pin be moved?) but those moments are little blips on an otherwise issue-free experience.  And believe me,  I've put in a LOT of hours of testing. ;)

B009YP9L7U|5.0|I give it 5 stars because it was a good book for free..i just wanted to rate it but they make you write a review also.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good book. Very sad, can't say I would want to read books like this every week, but it was definitely touching.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|After watching several awards shows where the actors were being praised, I was curious about the show. If it was available on Amazon prime for no extra $, I would watch it. I thought the first episode was intense and it could be a show I watch in the future.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|It is riveting. You get so involved in the life and times. Can't wait for the next season to be available for purchase.

B0068LYEHA|2.0|I only enjoyed two of the chapters, the wedding(which should be required reading for all mothers of brides and brides to be) and the fashion chapter.  Bothe chapters were amusing.  Unfortunately much of the rest of the book was tiresome and draggy.  Shorten the book and you may have a winner.
B005LAII80|1.0|You have to go into your settings and turn on 3d its not automatic.<br />DO it! this movie is underrated and very very good. I feel the actor is perfect as Dredd and judge Anderson is great. This movie is gritty and is true to the comic. I am a long time fan. I was very let down by the earlier version. this one made me nearly cry with happiness from it's perfection. 3d IS AWESOME IN THIS!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The show is a well written. The show has a good cast. I like this show because it is a modern take on Sherlock Holmes. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good mystery.

B00AB0AR2U|2.0|This was a attempt to fill in the cracks in the series but the plot was pointless & boring terrible dialog & some of the same old repetitive stuff RE fans a accustomed to! Waste of my time! Don't bother!
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|It's O.K. Some of the songs on the show,that I like were not on this album.Maybe second album will include them.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game. The sound is great.  I don't get to play it often enough but when I do I enjoy it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It really makes you think. I enjoy playing the game at night, it helps me fall asleep. It is very addicting and challenging.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Over the past year I had heard all the great excitement about this series from many friends with different tastes, and couldn't understand what the difference could be between DA and Upstairs, Downstairs. I mean, really, hasn't the British empire saga been pushed down the throats of every English-speaking country via film, etc. for decades? Aren't we over it? But curiosity led me to stream the very first episode, then the next, and a few weeks later, here I am nearly caught up and ready to watch on a Sunday night with the rest of the fans. I especially love the Irish character named Thomas Branson. As the American wife of a man from Belfast, Northern Ireland and therefore someone who has been around Brits for over 30 years, I am amazed at how well Branson expresses the Irish Republican opinions of that time (when Eamon DeValera and Michael Collins were leading the struggle for freedom), and the Crawleys' various reactions to him. Well done, the whole lot!
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|i got this for my 6 year old nephew for christmas, to say the least, it was an amazing hit!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I thought it was going to be terrible without Sylvester, but was delightful surprised! Non stop action with some of the coolest slow motion effects I've ever seen! Definitely worth a watch!
B0049J3RBC|4.0|This is one that I have paid to see more than once... will make the perfect download to the kindle for road trips.<br /><br />The story is cute and imaginative.  and uplifting.  In a world full of princesses... I much prefer the scruffy &#34;<br />anyone can cook&#34; message of this story.  The physical comedy of the boy chef is adorable and the larger message of mass consumption is subtle but present.  LOVE LOVE LOVE

B004HD61KE|5.0|This was my first read by Rollins and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  The mix of history, science, and adventure is truly intoxicating!  I will be reading much more of this author....and soon.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|This wouldn't install on my Sony Tablet S. Not sure why, but I could never get it to install properly - haven't had any issues with other app I've downloaded from Amazon. So, can't say I like something that never worked.
1932735410|5.0|Just passed the PMP exam on my first try (wrote January 17, 2013) My prep consisted solely reading this book and doing all of the exercises and practice questions. The practice questions at the end of each chapter is the same difficulty or more difficult than the actual pmp exam questions.<br /><br />The tips on the book re: not memorizing everything and knowing the pmisms detailed in the book were great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you want to pass the pmp with the least amount of studying.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was never a reader, in fact I never understood why people would get so intrigued with a book...I am hooked and can't wait to start book three...Surprise, I'm a reader now!
B009OJ01HA|3.0|this is an almost movie... The relationship between the protagonist and his boss is so unbelievable that it as silly. The sexual tension interest was off.  But a young hot Ryan Gosling and as always intriguing menacing Anthony Hopkins were great.  The extreme behaviors dont make sense  and that is what brings this down from a 4 to a 3.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead keeps getting better and better, although I've been disappointed with some of the cast members that have been killed off

B005HSL626|3.0|this is a cool game its very fun....but gets boring after while but still is a game I'll come back to. BUT it was the game when it came out.
B004ROMIVO|5.0|Bought this for daughter in high school for a class reading assignment.  There are two ways of looking at these classics--either for mere consumption, or, collecting them for your shelf to read and reread again.  Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn were both books I would just not buy in cheapest form.  The original reproduction prints, at around $12, are SO worth it.  Books are more than just printed words.  The bindings, the artwork, the way they heft and feel, and even smell, is important too.  I still have an ancient copy of Treasure Island which is one of the coolest BOOKS I have.  Digital versions on Kindle and Ipad are fine for informational research and homework, but READING for pleasure, books still win out for me.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|this game is awesome. it is very entertaining. I love the game play. I love when you sail you can do stuff while you sail to the island. it is an amazing game I would recommend it to everyone.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I fell in love with her writing style almost from the start. For those that love stories of magic and vampires - this is the story for you. No, it is not traditional but these days - what is? The book, story and words are perfect enough for me and made an enjoyable read.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Keep reading, don't stop...a rewarding end.  Enjoyable for anyone who likes books, mysteries or both...good locales..both coasts.  Excellent character studies.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very good &#34;go-to&#34; game if you're stuck and have nothing else to entertain you. Seriously, it does suck you in once you get started, it just has to be the right situation to get me interested in playing it.
B008XJM86Y|5.0|Fabulously rich melodies and lyrics passionately sung by Myles...touches the heart...thick, complete and memorable. Rocks with feeling!! Awesome...what a voice!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Good read...a real page turner.  I am rarely dissappointed with this writer.  I recall that this book was made into a movie, but the book was much better.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just like the first book. It makes me want to begin digging into the next. Brilliant,sexy, nail bitting good!!!!!!!!! !!!
B0093OGBL6|5.0|This book was incredible and gave the honor and respect to Michael Jackson that he has always deserved.  Kudos to this author. The book was &#34;Defending a King&#34;.
B0072NWJRK|3.0|Rich in historical background. The reader is quickly pulled into the mystery of a young woman's death. But there are two many characters and plot diversions which slow an interesting story down considerably.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Great, fun free game. I actually enjoy this more than Angry Birds. Maybe it's because I'm old school, who knows.
B003IODNJA|2.0|Not for me...too repetitious and weird. Sounded like one huge song that got on my nerves. Yick!!! Loved 1234 but this... no.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love the work of this writer. I can't wait for the third book of the trilogy. Ken Follett does not disappoint.

B00005O3VC|5.0|When I want Comedy. I select anything done by Monty Python. Holy Grail has always been one of my all time favorites.
B0071NLG0W|4.0|It was a little slow getting started but got much better quickly.  The heroine is down-to-earth former police officer who experiences fear but isn' t afraid to poke the bad guy a little when things are looking bad.  It's a good book for those who like a little humor with a lot of danger.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Excellent book, very enjoyable; I am highly recommend it. Life shouldn't be taken so seriously, enjoy in your life as much as you can, even after 100 years.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|something you just have to read or yourself.  Life get so much better when &#34;you don't mind what happens&#34;.  Just wonderful.
B001UDPAB0|5.0|I ordered the trilogy as I wanted to watch three movies as they happen and they show how robbers can get over on the establishment and sucessfully win but BIG money..Great actors played their part in the show.  Lastly I just wanted to see the movies from the begining to the end in my private movie theater.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|The characters are so complex, it always keeps you guessing.  I watched the whole season in just a couple weeks!
B009LXEBD4|4.0|I really liked Kelly Clarkson, she has a beutiful sound and I even participated in the American Idol voting to crown her the winner.  I never bought any of her CD's however.  I don't know why, but just never got around to it.  This has all of her &#34;Hits&#34; that I liked along with some of her newer country music which I'm not a fan of.  Awesome to have access to all of the songs I liked before country.  This is clearly the way to go if you like her music, but never got around to buying any of her albums.
B0018PXEI6|5.0|I grew up on the Beatles, Bob Dylan, the Beach Boys and Simon and Garfunkle. I had this music when it was a 33-1/3 RPM Vinyl Album, and it's every bit as good today
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The actors were perfect for their parts and the story was respectful of Marriage and informative about the benefits of counseling.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I was bothered by Pi's deep hunger for God being treated so passively by his family. Just when the story begins to take shape, it all seems to turn to symbolism in an effort by his mind to deal with the tragedies. It left me feeling empty and uninspired.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for my self esteem! I deal myself a winning game and if I pay attention I win every time!

B0098VYCCE|3.0|Kiristen stewert was not asked to play a lage range of emotion, so it was a good fit. Chris Helmsworth was good as well. Charlize Theron was outstanding as the evil step-mother.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great graphics. Wish I had more control of the horse though. Still fun! Would recommend to any horse lover to buy.
174179403X|5.0|Ok folks, do you expect this book to cover 5,000 years of history in a single volume? Of course not, but what this wonderful book does in just a few pages, is create in the reader's heart, a desire to perhaps travel and explore just a little more than originally intended.  I had my own ideas of what I wanted to see, but was not mindful of the little things I would encounter, e.g., the national voltage, the exchange rate, the best way to travel once you arrive and other helpful tips.  Best of all, this book gave me the right words to google for more information.  Purchase this book: You'll be glad you did!

1452653747|5.0|When people decide they should learn about physics they typically do one of two things, if they are trying to teach themselves they go to a book by someone like Stephen Hawking or Brian Greene or if they are in a class they go to a book like Serway's introductory physics text. Both are a mistake. In the case of Steven Hawking or Brian Greene they will spend too much time trying to puzzle out the meaning of physics new enough it will likely be proven wrong anyways. They are likely to leave understanding little about physics but the fact that it is complicated. In the case of Serway they are likely to spend too much time doing math that while important, is likely to chase them away from physics before they have any real understanding.<br /><br />This book should come before any of those. Explanations of common every day events like rainbows or pendulums with only minimal math. The only reason I say it is the second book on physics you should read is that [[ASIN:0553346687 Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman]] is a better place to start. It gives little real explanation of physics but does a better job of changing your perception of physics. That book will give you enough excitement about learning physics to push you through the more complicated parts of this book then maybe even some of the more advanced texts on the subject.
1471101223|2.0|I have been a fan of Ian Thorpe's for a while and was surprised that he came across as a self-centered jerk in this book. Also, i'm really tired of athletes selling books as if they are autobiographies when it's obvious they didn't write a single word.

1481251880|5.0|I picked up this book solely because it was on the NYT best seller list and was well-reviewed on here.  I had no idea what it was about.  And then I couldn't put it down!  And then when I finished it, I immediately read it again.  Best book so far this year.

B008BQ8VOC|3.0|I jumped on top of this train all the way back in season 1.<br /><br />Was looking for something a bit different, that didn't take itself overly seriously<br />and had a great ensemble cast.  It filled that bill quite nicely,<br /><br />The premise, Mike is a pothead (Sure there's a better, more current term), who also has<br />a sort of eidetic memory (can retain everything and apparently actually understand it all<br />as well.)  To support his habit, he takes the bar exam for people.<br /><br />Premiere episode (which I give a 4 star rating), has him trying to hide at a hotel where they<br />are holding \\"auditions\\" for newbie lawyers for one of the biggest law firms in New York.<br /><br />Once he demonstrates his ability to Harvey, Harvey sneaks him into the firm as the new<br />kid on the block.<br /><br />So, a lot of unbelievable action here, Harvey is a big time lawyer, big time money and he's<br />going to risk it all on (and I'm guessing here) a kid who is \\"illegal\\", no papers?<br /><br />hmmmm.<br /><br />Well, this all leads to some pretty entertaining episodes in season 1, I highly recommend that.<br /><br />Season 2, someone decides there needs to be some drama in the whole thing, so they bring<br />back an old partner that they had managed to get kicked out of the company several years<br />earlier.<br /><br />Again episodes not bad, actors do I think a bang up job on the whole deal, they're striving<br />for more tension in the episodes, and the kicker here is that the old partner (founder actually)<br />of the firm -may- be here to take the firm back.<br /><br />Throw rationality out the window, ignore consequences and you'll get a decent enough ride out<br />of it, call it 4 stars because of the whole focus on Drama (with a capital D).<br /><br />Break in season 2, now they're back.<br /><br />Let's ignore the whole streaming taking several days to get the episode online (Amazon thing),<br />I could rant about that for days.<br /><br />Series seems headed more into big D-rama, Mike melting down, and likely he'll recover his<br />footing.  In the meantime, to me, it's sort of jumped the shark a bit.  The relationship between<br />MIke and Harvey is on the rocks, Rachel is rightly pissed and Mike's off doing stuff that.... well<br />given the background they've laid for the character seems to be marginally believable, based<br />on what he had promised his now dead grandmother.<br /><br />LIke I say, I may well cancel the streaming for the next couple of episodes, come back later<br />and hope it finds it's groove again.headed more into big D-rama, Mike melting down, and likely he'll recover his<br />footing.

044661758X|5.0|I thought I knew the outcome of this novel from some of the others I've read out of order. However, I found out the big reveal from all of that hoopla in the prologue. Turns out that wasn't the real story.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed the Harry Bosch series, at least all of the novels written in third person and this one was no exception. What made this one so much fun were all the twists and turns. Since I never try to second guess the author, I went along for the ride and had no idea who the killer was until the very end. The last few chapters left me reeling too.<br /><br />With plenty to think about, the actual trial which was what I thought to be the main premise of the book was more of a sub-plot to the real story. I thought I was just going to find out how Harry got to the point where he ended up shooting the bad guy. Far from it. I'm glad I went on and read past the prologue!<br /><br />I don't have a quibble with this one. Highly recommended.

I almost stopped reading, but I really had to discover how it ended.  I was not disappointed.  I love how this author tells a story.  He takes the reader on a twisting path as he did in Atonement.  I will continue reading Ian McEwan's books.

B009Z5BPZK|4.0|It was sad seeing this series end. I was such a fan of the first 2 seasons but I'm glad the ending was satisfying. For anyone who's watched GG and is familiar with the show knows how melodramatic it can be. The last 5 seasons were filled with some mind blowing scenarios that were a bit exaggerated that sometimes especially in season 5 just took the flavor and sophistication out of the show. I'm glad this season came around and did it the right way this time. The writers have finally redeemed themselves of the horrid things they were threwing at us last season. Not saying that this season is the best so far but it comes close, very close the only reason I give it 4 stars out of 5 is for these following minor problems that I had with the show.<br /><br />[MAJOR SPOILER/ DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE WATCHED THE SHOW]<br /><br />-Problem #1: The end of Bart Bass. These people spent almost the entire season the first 9 episodes to take Bart down who is very clearly the biggest, most feared and ultimate villain of the show. Of course, their plans to bring him down didn't go well at all. They had to face many obstacles and disappoints and many of them suffered from it. But then when the final curtains came closing down and he actually was defeated the situation just seemed a bit rush, unexpected and mostly disappointing. All that tension, all that drama just built up to that small scene and it just eluded a fake climax if you know what I mean. I thought the writers could be a bit more creative and made it more realistic instead. In short I didn't like it.<br /><br />-Problem #2: GG Identity,I was actually scared that the writers would reveal who GG is. I thought it was never going to be revealed. However, for once the writers satisfied my curiosity and told us finally who GG really is. However, her identity just didn't click for me. The decision felt rushed and it was a last minute thing. I wouldn't be surprised if the writers just didn't know for themselves for the last 5 seasons who GG is or who should she be. Then they just picked one person and finally settled with that idea and then just like threw it there. They were like just setting in their seats being like \\"Oh, let's just choose Person A no one would expect that\\" and called it a night. And then somehow everything else needs to make sense but it doesn't.<br /><br />On the Other hand the writers were smart enough that we finally see character development something that was lacking tremendously in the last 2 seasons. The characters are finally and I mean broke away from their High School Mentality and started acting like Mature people and I liked the fact that not everyone got their happy ending which made the series more believable and less predictable.<br /><br />[END OF SPOILERS]<br /><br />But seriously watch this season. It's short, it's great and it's fun. Hidden agendas, plots, secrets and mind games you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Enjoy!asons who GG is or who should she be.

And then somehow everything else needs to make sense but it doesn't.<br /><br />On the Other hand the writers were smart enough that we finally see character development something that was lacking tremendously in the last 2 seasons. The characters are finally and I mean broke away from their High School Mentality and started acting like Mature people and I liked the fact that not everyone got their happy ending which made the series more believable and less predictable.<br /><br />[END OF SPOILERS]<br /><br />But seriously watch this season. It's short, it's great and it's fun. Hidden agendas, plots, secrets and mind games you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0375831002|5.0|This is a remarkable book..  Went to a grief counseling session - was sitting next to a librarian.  She and the Counselor begian taking about this book  -so of course had to secure it.  Was unfamiliar with this author, and have now requested all his books.  They were so  impressed, as am I.  It is a remakable book about WWII from the standpoint of  people living in Berlin and other parts of Germany during the war.  But is is not what you would expect.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|I prefer using the camera as opposed to the editor. Generally, when I take pictures I take enough time to make them the way that I want, so that I really did not find the need to use the picture up photo editor thus far, while using my Kindle fire.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|I like anything with Julian Fellows. And Gosford Park is a good whodunnit. I also like period pieces with accurate costuming.
0783230079|5.0|such a great family movie sad but very cute. my husband had never seen it fell in love with it so i had to buy it to watch it over and over :0)
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|As the son of a WWII fighter pilot I am very interested in the lives of the men who flew in the war, both sides.  My father was a 30 year military pilot.  He told me one story of a German pilot flying an unmarked P-51 next to him and waving as they made eye contact and flew away from each other.  My father is no longer with us.  This book brought him back to me as I read about the lives of these men and women.<br /><br />This is a well written book that will keep you reading to learn more.  These men and women of WWII were not that different from each other.  This book makes that time much more than it was for me before reading this book.  I recommend this book to help anyone with a family connection to WWII to know that time better.<br /><br />Jim wight
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book!  Written very well with a very unique plot.  Loved loved loved it!....could not put it down.
0375830995|5.0|Amazing book.  --  Requested this book after reading 'The Book Thief&#34;  -- had not been aware of this writer until then.  He is a most impressive author
0321857895|1.0|It is not working on my ipad's Kindle. Too bad that I did not ask for refund in time....<br />I am glad that they removed its kindle version currently.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Just found this show, and liked it, so I bought the season an amazon. It's fun and witty and keeps you guessing. It's kind of a new take on Robiin Hood, mixed with a somewhat Smallville esq Green Arrow! If you love human super heroes with a dark side and a good heart, this is the show to watch!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love how games have evolved into more analytical and critical thinking instead of just kill kill kill! I am a perfectionist and have to have all the stars so that makes this a really great fun thinking puzzle game!
B00A757EFW|4.0|Love it...wish it was a little more sensitive and easy to do quick moves like real game....but what do you expect.  I really give it 4 1/2 stars.  I enjoy it and would purchase it again.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|My husband got be hooked on this game and I like to play it on my computer. So I went looking it the app store and found this for my Kindle Fire and I just love it.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|As a man, I am a little ashamed to admit that I am addicted to regency romances.  But some of the formula books are annoying.  I get tired of the \\"she loves him but won't tell him because she thinks he despises her and so she treats him as if she hates him....\\" etc.<br /><br />This book not only has none of that.  It actually mocks it.  \\"This isn't going to be a marriage like one of those dreadful romances where the wife dare not fall in love with her husband lest he turn into Bluebeard the pirate and chop off her head?\\"<br /><br />There are no unbelievable plot-twists like a letter revealing a deep secret going astray, or the important, life-changing revelation getting interrupted at a key moment.  The characters all treat each other with respect and as much honesty as possible for that moment in the story.  And yet the plot moves forward and there are still dark moments and happy resolutions.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|So frustrating. Trying to install cloud on my kindle. It's my understanding that its the only way I can download music. I keep getting sn error message stating that my o/s does not support cloud. Then it offers me several options like chrome. But. Chrome States that. Its only good if Ihave a Mac. Argh.....
B0050F6JQE|5.0|Victoria (1548-1611 ),was born in Spain, and was educated by the Jesuits in Avila. He studied for the priesthood in Rome, commencing in1567, and until he moved to Madrid in 1586, he had motets, masses and magnificats published in Venice and Rome.<br />He was a prolific composer of religious works, but wrote in no other form,ie. instrumental.<br />In Madrid, in 1600,Victoria broke new ground in composing 14 large new works, scored for eight or more voices, to be sung in the Salamanca Cathedral. The Organ manuscript required a large separate book,of musical syle that hadn't been heard before. This pointed the way to the late Baroque as no other composer.<br />Many of these works are having their premier recordings, which makes this a very special collection. The recordings of some of Victoria's Masses by the Tallis Scholars and The Sixteen are very good,but I think this collection just nudges them out of first place.<br />The recording is crisp and clean, with fine and beautiful balance. The voices are wonderful, and there is no echo which can be a minus. This CD is all plus, and in Cervantes La eleccion, one of the singers proclaims \\"All that one sings reflects history.\\" This is a wonderful insight to a great composer who led the way in the 17th century to the Baroque era.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I flew through these books. They have been great reads. So happy things ended up the way they did. Sad that certain char a caters were killed, but all together great series
0143122061|4.0|A good way to review and learn what one didn't already know to better understand today's problems -  hopefully for solutions.
B0012NO316|5.0|I rate this movie so high because of the way it pulled me in personally. I thought the actors all gave great performances. There aren't many films that keep my attention and make me not want to miss a single detail. This is one of those films! Bravo!!
B00005JNEW|5.0|Tim Mcgraw, Billy Bob Thorton and Garrett Hedlund at their best! One of the best small town true redneck stories ever.
B006O6F932|5.0|SHE HAD A SLEEP OVER AND HER LITTLE FRIENDS REALLY ENJOYED PLAYING WITH IT THEY HAD A BLAST THEY PLAYED WITH IT ALL DAY.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Easy to read and get into, this book left me want to know the rest of the story. I couldn't stop with this one book, once I finished it I couldn't wait for the next one to come out.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I wish I wouldn't have seen the movie first because it really closely follows the movie. Reading the 2nd one now!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|In good, working condition. Everything I was hoping for in a cd. Case was unmarked and also in fine working condition.
B009AP2G26|4.0|Do not like the season as much as I liked the first three. However enjoy it all the same. Gets better after the first few episodes.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Nice, fun, easy read with retro gems! A must read for the educated gamer and pretty much any child of the 80s
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the suspense of the book but what a weird ending!<br />Could not put it down! Well written, fast read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book, I just wish it would have ended a little different. I was left feeling something was left out at the very end. A good read, just missing a little something.
B004G600A4|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />I love Tangled and it's what I expected it to be. Totally perfect!<br />All the Actors and Actress voices are wonderful. I love it.<br /><br />Thank you!
B005P5TQPU|5.0|Excellent show Amazon is great<br />I feel it was a great experience using Amazon for my purchase.<br />I am a real person
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I have heard of this book many times over so many years. It is my sister's favorite book. I was in the hospital with pneumonia, and decided it was time to start reading it. Absolutely amazing and I can't believe it but it made the time I spent in the hospital go fast. I couldn't wait to get back from my X-ray and cat scans so I could quickly pick up where I left off. I was so inspired. Truly grateful for reading it. I was released from the hospital a changed person. Take from it what u can . No matter how hard life is u too can be a survivor and triumph.life is good!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Downloaded this very long book (over 800 pages) to our Kindle for my husband for Christmas, along with The Pillars of the Earth. My husband read the book in three days! He loves the way Follett develops his characters, especially how he uses real history and historical figures as background. This one is well worth the read!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I have wished for one of these. I will use this a lot. Thank you for making life a little easier.
B005LAIGTG|4.0|Not really sure as this was a gift. The story is kind of sad but I think she liked it.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />As this was a gift I was told that he can't put it down.  He listens to this CD all day.  I know that Shinedown has a fan for life in him.<br /><br />Thank you
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Great addition to the story and world of Martin. If it had my favorite characters (that aren't dead anyway) it would have been 5 stars.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Enjoyed this book and had fun trying to determine what would happen next. Well written and a quick read. I would recommend for those who like interesting spy novels.
B0049985XW|5.0|As a Bogart fan, this film is a must have for anyone's classic DVD collection. Director John Huston's masterful job shows in every scene..............
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A great little tale with a twist. As usual, Grisham reels you in quickly, and then keeps you turning the pages. No life changing lessons or great revelations, just a good escape.
B0099116AY|5.0|This was a gift but she said that she loved it. Excellent !! The story was great and the acting superb.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />Burlesque is and will be one of the Classics for me. Cher and Christina are effectively pleasing to the ears. They make every girl want to be them or want to pretend to be them.  Burlesque is Awesome.<br /><br />Thank you
B009GX6SSK|2.0|I don't like Heddy, I only bought 1 episode because they went on an aircraft carrier. First thing they tel you when you go out to sea is never wear your cover. 1st scene,  the ex o has his on with planes taking off and landing. On the flight deck.  You lose your hat it takes out a million dollar engine. The only place you wear it is on the bridge. I wish I'd saved my money & hadn't bought this episode.
0765325950|5.0|This is a fantastic conclusion to one of the greatest fantasy series ever written. From depth of character to the sheer amount of detail put into everything, from countries' histories and customs to the imaginative system used for magic, this book is definitely one of my favorites.
B005HCI72O|4.0|Loved this book, yet again. This is about my fourth run through Drums of Autumn. My original is paper but have just started down loading to kindle. Every so often I find myself returning to Claire and  Jamie like visiting old friends. Always love the mix of history and fiction especially since I have Scots ancestry.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is very addictive and fun little game. I love that it is free and its a great cure for boredom.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|GREAT BOOK BUT A LITTLE ODD. I DID HOWEVER ENJOY IT AND THERE ARE FUNNY PARTS AND GREAT QUOTES IN IT.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />As I said about the first 3 &#34;Terrific&#34;. I'm just dying to see the other part of Breaking Dawn.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This totally took me by surprise.  Now I.'ll have to read the third one just to find out who she ends up with.
1891252089|5.0|It's a very good book for an Ashtangga Yoga learner. But as my experience,<br />If you are a beginner, you'd better have a teacher first, as Ashtangga Yoga is<br />one ofthe highest level in Yoga world.  Most the strength and the stretch<br />are all need to reach the extreme.<br /><br />So though the book can help you learn and remember the movements, but a<br />real good teacher is the most important!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|&#34;Speaker for the Dead&#34; by Orson Scott Card is a remarkable although windy sequel in the series. I found the narrative to be somewhat repetitious but I loved it never-the-less. The Piggies are peculiar, endearing, though cantankerous mutant humanoids that challenge the hegemony of the humans who are studying them. Ender Wiggins to the rescue and the open ending leads right into the next story &#34;Xenocide,&#34; can't wait to read it...
0525478817|5.0|Can't say the book is &#34;good&#34; as the topic is far from good....but a great read and I would highly recommend it.  The story itself would be good for anyone to experience but some of the words used might be above an average teenagers vocabulary.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I fear that many younger individuals will read this book and see the \\"games\\" as a true competition. They will be more likely to take up archery in the event that they will need to use it for protection. They are not likely to see this as a hidden message about how governments can control the lives, and deaths, of our youth. That killing another government's youth can be justified.<br />  As an action-adventure novel it is well written. It should appeal to girls in their teens...the heroine is athletic, a survivor, clever, sought after by two of the most desirable boys. I will probably read the rest of the series sometime.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Synology sells RAM for the NAS' for about $50-60. I bought this, opened the casing, popped it in, powered it back on, and had no problems...and I saved a bunch of money buying a great name brand stick of RAM.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I first got this on my iPod touch and I loved it! Immediately got it on my laptop! It was, of course, the first app I got on my kindle fire. I hope that they add armor make it a larger area. I wish you could play multiplayer within different WiFi networks though. This is a good app but they should add more.
B003WE9WRI|5.0|This well-crafted and insightful work is a delight to read. Packed with helpful survival hints for dealing with Level 1 to 3 zombie infestations.  Sadly however the author presents compelling evidence in support of his sobering conclusion that human survival is only marginally probable in the case of a Level 4 global zombie pandemic.<br /><br />The book's contents are logically arranged and feature a contextual background, a detailed review of tactics and strategies to combat various threat levels as well as an informative chronological set of zombie outbreak case histories.  Most interesting to this reviewer was the practical approach adopted by a determined Roman commander based in North Britain facing a mass zombie horde just on 2,000 years ago: channel, decapitate, burn and instantly euthenize one's own wounded.<br /><br />One proviso I have to mention is that the book is premised on the existence of only one type of premordial non-evolving zombie. For example, the author does not acknowledge the risks associated with latter-day perverted science such as the well documented Green Flu research programme involving genetic modification of various strains of rabies virus and which many believe pose a greater and more immediate prejudice to human societies.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|&#34;Pines&#34; by Blake Crouch is a sci/fi horror/thriller that is frankly implausible in many ways but in spite of that it's still an entertaining read. The inability of the protagonist to seek help for his constant injuiries/pain is a bit irritating particularly when coupled with the complete disinterest shown for his well-being by the towns people who are aware of and deeply involved the the coverup...doesn't make any sense IMHO! Having said that, I still got caught-up in the storyline and couldn't stop reading. Loved the ending!!! 3 stars...
1451629184|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book.  Amazed at the tragic events she lived through.  I can appreciate her desire to write it herself but so many questions remain with me that a peice or section based on a &#34;professional opinion&#34;  or explanation would be good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this app! The game is awesome, &amp; the app is well made. Haven't had a single issue with it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am a busy lady. Wife, mother, full time employee in public education, student, as well as the founder of two non profit organizations. I can make a file for everything from my son's funny quotes, to homework and tasks, as well as make separate note files for both of my non profits. Perfect. The only down side is that not all the options available on your computer and tablet are available on the phone application. But I am still over the moon about this app!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|First off.... WHY MY NAME AND THE CITY I LIVE IN??? AND MY AGE!! Reading this and knowing how many other people have read this or are currently reading this, of all the people I know, I dread to think how many people thought of me every time they read the name Anastasia.<br /><br />After long curiosity and commotion about this series, I began to read it.<br /><br />I was SHOCKED early on in the book, porn in a book. Not typically a book I desire reading, once I got used to seeing sex on every other page I began to start skipping sex scenes every time the author wrote one. Why? Because I don't need to read about sex in specific detail after every little event that happens in the story. I do enjoy this book, what I enjoy is the story and not that it's about a sadist and his lover on every page I turn to see in detail of the pleasures and pains and different forms of having sex.<br /><br />Currently on Book 2 I'm constantly waiting to see what happens to Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. The sex gets annoying and I'm constantly skimming through to find a line where the word moan or sex or thrust doesn't exist. I'm waiting to see what happens to this average girl and this apparently gorgeous man who is a billionaire. I like fairy tales, with twists, so I hope, and hope some more that I can get past the thrusting and onto a heart melting story.<br /><br />Can't wait to see what drama is next in store for these two. I would say this book is a must read, and that skipping paragraphs... or even pages IS ACCEPTABLE. But we should all know what the fuss is about on this Best Seller.
B0001I562I|5.0|It was perfect! And my husband was thrilled to receive the movie he loved as a kid! Thank you! A+++++
B003TSEEDY|3.0|&#34;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&#34; by Stephen Chbosky failed to meet my expectations. It's somewhat whiney, sophomoric, and long winded, although I guess that is to be expected when the narrative is portrayed as being written by an unstable and troubled boy. Certainly, the confusion and constant recriminations are one of the many stages of puberty coupled with the hormone storm every boy goes through. I thought after reading several reviews that there would be many more humurous YA events and situations than there actually were. I didn't dislike the story but I enjoyed &#34;Carter Finally Gets It,&#34; and &#34;Spanking Shakespeare&#34; much more...3 stars!
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|not bad im kid of new to this type of game playand this game was ok for buck or two i spent on it
B00A80SHFM|5.0|The music from this show has always impressed and moved me. But to see it and to hear it performed on screen by non-professional singer/actors adds a more human element to Les Miserables...
B004M8S3Y6|1.0|I suspect most of the 5 star reviews are fabricated because I find it hard to believe there are so many naive people in the world. The instructions in this book are absurd. He tells the reader to stop eating fruit because fructose increases iron absorption. Why on earth he assumes the reader needs to decrease their iron levels is beyond me. He also claims a vegan diet causes women to miscarry because he found some people who say they miscarried whilst on a vegan diet. (None of the many vegans I know had any trouble having kids so I wonder if maybe the vegans he was referring to were following his bizarre no fruit advice?)<br /><br />Anybody who's ever owned horses or livestock would know that you need to feed them a lot more in winter because they lose weight in cold weather, so I imagine his ice bath idea probably would help you lose weight but personally I have no desire to test this. (Walking is also an effective way to burn calories and a heck of a lot more enjoyable.)<br /><br />Don't waste your time and money on this book unless you are one of those mindless fools that will jump on any old bandwagon with no need for credible scientific proof.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I saw this on Bookbub and thought it sounded like an interesting book.  I wasn't disappointed since it had many twists and turns and kept my attention throughtout.  I wouldn't consider it a great literary accomplishment, but just an interesting, easy read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I look forward to every series! They are a delight to watch (if you like British settings)! Stay tuned for more :-)
B009E3EY38|4.0|I enjoy everything in this package.  I only wish the actual concert came in regular DVD not just blue ray sothat I may play it in other parts of the house.
111846446X|5.0|Good instructions on using the pi,<br />I am getting more use of my pi.<br />Instructions for setting up wireless are fine.
B001U3Y5XE|2.0|My children were disappointed. Limited colors included in box. Not as challenging as they had hoped. Directions for playing game were not clear.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can not wait to see more! Love this show. Totally entertaining, fascinating characters. Hope it continues for a long time
B0084TWN9K|5.0|I would never miss an Alice Munro book. I save them all and re-read them when I need to read something great and memorable.
B00008CMR6|5.0|Great film and comedy. Good tie in to Civil War and Texas frontier. Nice film to watch on a rainy day! John Wayne is such an American! Love him!
B000FCK9D6|4.0|Despite seeing the movie over 30 years ago and knowing &#34;who done it&#34;, the main plot was intricate and would keep the reader guessing.  A character  (Colonel Race) from a previous novel was present working another plot involving a foreign spy.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Although the beginning was a little slow moving, by the time you just can't take it anymore - about 30 min - it finally gets fun!  Newer toys and gadgets, a great plot and story line, and the return of fabulous characters make this one the best yet!  Also - like this depiction of the Cat Woman the best!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|No I do not want to buy the full version.<br /><br />Stop asking if I want to buy the full version
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I play this game everyday. It keeps you going back to it. I'm a fan of simcity so this game is right up my alley. Would have<br />Given it 5 star, but some times they mess up an update and makes the game a chore to play.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is totally worth getting, it is free and works great. There are plenty of different sounds to put together plus they are very realistic. Ill put together my sounds and within five minutes I'll be asleep!
B003YUS9OW|4.0|I've never owned crocs before so I expected material on the bottom.  It was a comfortable rubber material.  The rest of the material is breathable and its an overall nice shoe.  I'm an 11.5 in women's so I went a half size up and they fit very well.  I would recommend them.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Place this one in the \\"hard to put down\\" category. I picked it up because the word of mouth reviews were fantastic and I dove into the book immediately...enjoyed playing the whodunnit game as I read..yet ultimately unsatisfied. Hate is too strong but I disliked the ending. I do hate when I invest time and interest in characters and can put book down and forget them a day later. Definitely a \\" good\\" read though.
0060574216|4.0|Good, very informative. It helped me to understand alot about myself, and also about my wife. I would recommend the book for any couple or someone wishing to get married soon or understand more about the other gender
B00632HWOG|5.0|Simply easy, worldwide access, always introducing bigger and better.....what's not to love?  I prefer yahoo over any other gmail, hotmail, and private server emails.
B007QUUJMG|3.0|If you have watched the movie and is now looking into the book then be prepared that its a good book but it's nothing like the movie. I prefer the movie rather than the book.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fun game for kids. Liked the game play and easy to load. Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh had a blast plsying. Fun art and looks great on kindle
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is my favorite game, play it all the time, I have not had any trouble with this one, unlike some of the other ones they offer.  Wish they had more. I play this game constantly. One of the best.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was great.  It was a simple read about complex issues that we all need to be reminded of from time to time.  I am going to read this with my 8 year old son.  I recommend it to all my friends to read with their children.  It made me laugh out loud, cry, and reflect on mine own behavior and feelings.  Excellent.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I cant say enough about this addictive and excellent homage to the very industry that spawned it. In many ways it also parodies the course of video games' history. You wont regret this purchase.<br />Runs best on the Kindle using the 'performance' detail setting, but in my opinion looks better that way as well. (less odd aliasing of pixel art.)
B0058YPL66|5.0|I love that they have taken a new &#34;real-type&#34; spin on common fairytales.  Excellently written and the acting is wonderful.  I only hope they can match the first season in this next year!
B0000026UV|5.0|BOTH of these guitarists are wonderful ....and TOGETHER they are awesome!  It's sometimes like Dire Straits meets good ol country boys!
0894803123|2.0|This book was written quite a few years ago.  Something I didn't realize when ordering it to go with a new ice cream machine I had just purchased.  A lot of the recipes called for eggs which remained raw, as the recipe was a no cook one.  While the flavors looked great and it was well written, the raw eggs were a deal breaker.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|Works as advertised. It is a little off on predicted time left but overall good. The pro version is worth the 3 dollars.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved this book. Very hard to put down.<br />Highly recommended to anyone who has read the others. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is amazing one of my favorite games on my kindle.<br />I play it all the time, my nephews love it
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The series keeps you intrigued and the relationship between Sherlock and Holmes is great. I'd recommend it for those who like mystery and subtle humor.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. IT IS SO AWESOME. WELL WORTH DOWNLOADING. IT IS KINdA LIKE MARIO. and I love that one to.
B005LAIIPS|2.0|The thing that I got the most of this movie is that Manila is a mess. Other than that the obvious linkage to the Bourne saga is limp at best.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It was a good idea to make Watson a woman, (still want to know more of her backstory) They make the odd couple thing work in a way that adds to the stories. Holmes is a constant source of surprises and his continual lack of consideration is amusing. The stories are well done with twists that add interest. I hope it stays around for many years to come
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a great show to watch.  By the 4th episode, you will be hooked.  I was unable to stop watching the 9, 10, 11 and 12th episodes and watched them one after the other!  Some compare it to 24, but this is MUCH better!  Love this show!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games. Great story.  I immediately was into it.  I have not seen the movie as I wanted to read it first.  So glad I did.
1594202842|4.0|When this book first came out there was a mad frenzy about it--mostly people were shocked at how a mother could be so domineering, controlling, and in some reviewers' minds borderline abusive!  When I read an interview that a WSJ reporter did with her there were a couple of statements she made that really stood out.  One was that it's about getting your child to be the best that they can be.  She gave an example of how her mother spent hours teaching her Downs Syndrome sister how to tie her shoes, play the piano, etc. and that now that her sister is an adult she still plays the piano, has a job, and a boyfriend.  So it isn't always about being a concert pianist and being number one. The book itself is not very long and is written in a way that gives one a glimpse into the life of Amy Chua, a Yale law professor, her husband Jed, also an attorney and the daughters Sophia and Louisa(Lulu.)  She writes of her own growing up years with a well educated father and mother and explains how she didn't always follow in the steps that her father wanted.  She also devotes a chapter to each of her daughters to show how different they both are and here's the conflict--not all children conform to the way of Chinese parenting.  There are times in the book that I was almost exhausted reading about this woman who taught full time, flew to lectures all over the place, and still devoted time to supervising piano and violin lessons, plus transporting the girls to places several hours away to get expert teachers.  Some of it seemed a bit much and Professor Chua admits it herself and is very honest about how sometimes she was in conflict with her Jewish husband who had more freedom in his upbringing.  There is a lot of humor in the book as well, especially the chapter when it's decided they will get a family pet and Amy puts her Chinese mothering to work on the dog!  The author is a good writer in my opinion.  It's the kind of writing that keeps you focused and entertained.  One would almost think she is bragging when she writes about her daughter Sophia's accomplishments but she is very careful in letting other people give praise as she holds back like during the Carnegie Hall episode.  What it boils down to is that I think that there is a lot to take from this kind of parenting, like expecting a child to work hard and achieve.  She points out in one chapter that she doesn't feel that Western children that have more freedom are necessarily any happier than children that are the product of Chinese mothers.  If you look at the current state of affairs, she may be right!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Love John Corey, loved the book.  My first Demille book was Plum Island which is now tied with The Panther as my favorite.  I've enjoyed many of his other books, but none as much as this. The storyline is great...the twists and turns, great. The intrigue and characters, great!!  My ONLY negative is that several times in the book, the sailors who died on the Cole are referred to as the \\"men\\" who died.  Mr. Demille,  in the next edition,could you please change that to \\"the sailors who died\\" as there were two female sailors who perished in that attack?  I'm sure their families would appreciate it and it would be historically accurate.  (It could/should be changed in the Kindle edition immediately!) Other than that, this book was a true page turner...couldn't put it down and was sorry when it ended.  If you like Vince Flynn or Dan Brown, then you will probably LOVE this book too.
0765325950|1.0|I agree with these comments and as a loyal reader (who had previously purchased all the hard covers) i am incensed at this. I was going to buy one copy for me and possibly two or three for my local library in addition to the ebook for me to read in the train into work. I will no longer buy the hard covers and i will probably still buy the ebook, but i am upset.<br /><br />While Harriet may have her reasons, i do not agree with them.  Her husband's goal was always to have people read and enjoy his work, not some posthumous honor of being a NYT bestseller.<br /><br />I think she should allow for it to be released earlier and issue an apology to the fans.  PS, I would have paid full price for the ebook!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I throughly enjoyed reading this book and reading this series. At first, I had my own thoughts about who the killer may be, but at the end, I was very shocked on who it was! Who was it? You would have to read the book to find out.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Great CD I'm glad I bought it..Phil Phillips first work is amazing..Very Dave Matthews like, although has his own originality, I'm sure being compared to Dave is a compliment in one sense, but Phil probably would want us to recognize his own talent given talent.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Graphics were phenomenal, great story line and some tough puzzles.  Played flawlessly.  Will! definitely buy more games from this company.  Absolutely loved it!

B009POCFTG|1.0|I have seen my fair share of god-awful films. & this is one of them. Matthew McConaughey, just like you in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-The Next Generation, why did you agree to pursue acting in this film? As i will most likely never meet him, i will never get an answer to that question. There is not one character i liked {because they are all LOSERS... Except for Dottie, because unlike all the others in this film, she is more innocent than any of them...}<br />Director William Friedkin, famous Director of the 1973 classic, The Exorcist, you chose to direct this? I spin my head around a full 360 degrees in amazement at why you would even consider wasting your directing time with this garbage... Make a new Exorcist film with Linda Blair in it, then i will forgive you.
075669910X|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for. It goes over life from the very beginning to modern day as well as goes over some of driving forces that shaped life into what it is.
