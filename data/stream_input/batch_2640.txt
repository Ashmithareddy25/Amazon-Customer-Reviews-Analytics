B000QCS8TW|5.0|I cannot recommend this series enough it is absolutely incredible, Martin sets the tone for an epic tale in first installment of the series.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A story of dedication, honor and bravery. Too bad our stupid liberal media influence the decisions of our troops in battle.  A must read to understand our troops and their dedication.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I am not one that can't figure out movie like this one. I am a movie fanatic me and my family, but we watch it (3) times and still couldn't grasp he concept of this one even though we know what the movie was about. Just puzzling.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. It's fun and challenging. However, I do wish it had more rooms. But more are promised.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Loved loved this movie it will have you laughing from beginning to the end. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann great actors. I would always watch their movies.
B0091X2K0A|4.0|Good homegrown Americans chosen at random to sacrifice themselves for nothing. Nothing gained but lives lost. Who knows why the momentum of political action thought this war wise?
B00BJUQP4A|5.0|A GREAT JOY TO READ . WE LOVE DOGS . DO IT AGAIN.MADDIIE LOKS LOOKS LIKE A REAL HAM I HOPE SHE ENJOYS ALL YOUR SHOTS
B009AMALGM|2.0|Wow, oh wow I really wish I had that hour and 22 minutes back...<br /><br />This movie isn't scary, not even a little bit, not even a tiny bit.  I was so bored the whole movie...<br /><br />I've seen the first 3 Paranormal Activity movies - I thought they were all good, especially part 3.<br /><br />What happened?  Did different people make this movie?... I don't get it... How is it possible there isn't one scare in this whole movie?<br /><br />What a massive disappointment.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Great sound track! It left me wanting to purchase more quality sound tracks. I continue watching the movie whenever it is on tv.
B000GCFG7E|3.0|better story lines in his other books in this series  it wasn't real believable  and I don't think reacher would have evolved himself in this situation  could have been better written
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Creepy children are scary.  The story is good.  Its not too long of a movie, so it wasn't one of those that seems to drag on forever.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|such a wonderful movie with lovable characters.  my niece and nephew both love this movie & for an adult who has to watch it over and over again, it's one of my favorites
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|50 Shades a different way. Less S&M and more realistic dreaming. Almost reality but this type of love is really lust.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really well done and stuff. It gives people a bit of an idea as to what to expect if you want a horse.
B000FBJG04|4.0|In many respects the reader gets a sense of becoming acquainted with the members of Easy Company. It was engrossing, moving and very well written.
B0044IABFS|5.0|What a great ending to an addictive show- I feel like I know the people and am going to miss them!
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|The movie plot is a dark premise. It was a thriller that kept me at the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. That says a lot. The ending was a total surprise to me. I did not see it coming. Jude Law does a fabulous job in his role. Catherine Zeta-Jones has a great supporting actress role. Many plot twists and turns.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|The challenge of it is fun. Disappointed having to pay for coins rather then earn for that reason  I will give three stars
B009NY43NY|3.0|As Mrs. Harris gets farther along in these books the more boring they are. Not my favorite but it was ok. I hated the ending too many questions left open.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Always was originally a huge CCR fan.  Have followed and enjoyed John's career post CCR and this one especially with old CCR songs along with the collaboration with the Country Music artists was outstanding!  Instrumentals and vocals were over the top!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game easily becomes addictive! Makes you really think and use your brain to find the clues to get out! No hints to use _- just your brain power!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|We can't wait to watch each episode! The characters are quirky but very lovable, and have grown from beginning to end. The truly despicable characters don't last too long, which makes for pleasant watching; and while the science is &#34;out there&#34;, it is not so unbelievable that it couldn't happen....Mostly, we just find this a lot of FUN to watch, making it really perfect escapism....Not quite as gory and weird as FRINGE, lot;s more fun....
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Very cute game my daughter lives it she's 8 it is a little above her head but it explains well
B000O8OTNC|5.0|small and a little dangerous to handle. be careful!!!  just be careful and you should have no problems. thank you.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The puzzles are a bit stiff sometimes, but it entertains nonetheless.  I recommend it to 8 yrs and above.  Thanks.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|Does just what it should. Wish it had more alarm tones though. The stock tones on the SIII are mostly music style. Want more alarm style sounds.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|The Kindle sits securely in place. The Kindle snaps in, rather than the elastic strips that hold some in place. The rotating feature is nice as well, giving the option of horizontal or vertical view however I tend to use the hand strap most often, but I like having the option. My only criticism is that the different colors were priced differently. The purple I wanted was twice the price as the black. I think I would have misplaced a brighter color less often, but the black looks nice.Like the case so much that I bought  an orange one for my daughter.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This has been an absolutely AWESOME game so far. It took me countless hours to beat every plague type on Brutal!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game you have to search for all the obscenities to get to the next t level. It takes time to figure each level out. I am not waiting for the next levels to open so I can continue on.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The leads have great chemistry and are a joy to watch.<br />The characters all have dept, which is illustrated by the brilliant writing.
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|This mystery movie was exciting but not one that was bloody or gory. It was easy to watch and the setting was great.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Great show that mixes courtroom drama, scandalous behavior, and great characters that keep you watching and wanting more! Five Stars all the way!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Well what do you expect from the King of Thrillers - the best.<br /><br />However I have to say the book fell short, albeit by a little, of my expectations.<br />I would expect creatures of sort, sharp twist and the like but there were none.<br /><br />However the author compensated for the shortcomings with his usual fluency and tight plot.<br /><br />I enjoy the pace of the story and the end was interesting.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend a read.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|that's what it feels like! This app kinda guides you like a schoolmarm to the best wifi spots in your house.In your yard.In your office, restraunt, jail holding cell(jk) wherever. And if you're good and keep the app- later on you will get some nice updates. Ez to read graphics and ez to switch settings for viewing. Very nice job dev dude.or dudette. kudos
B0090KZDSK|3.0|I liked it, but getting towards the end I was looking forward to all the loose ends wrapping up and they didn't. It just suddenly stopped and announced there was another book on the way. I'm mostly disappointed for only that reason. These kind of books aren't my usual choice, but after a friend urged me to read them I did. So now, even though I'm not a huge fan, I have to wait to keep reading simply because I'd like to know the end of the story. It's ok. But I wish it was over.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|Entertaining movie. Fun to watch if you enjoyed the others. Not a sophisticated plot but still a fun movie. Would recommend.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|When I installed it I was expecting it to work but the game keeps on crashing on my kindle Fire and the space the download takes is unrealistic 1/5 stars.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|My grand kids will enjoy it.  Newer version of the game.  Teaches eye hand coordination.  Keeps kids busy and keeps their minds working.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's awesome.<br />U can slide under trees.<br />U can also find gems and coins<br />To buy stuff with.<br />And u can go in caves!<br />Isn't that awesome.
B004SBULWE|4.0|Keeps apps not being used from running and using up battery time.  Also have the program on my phone.  Would recommend it.
B0038IMOOQ|5.0|I love Helloween, and so this acoustic version was an excellent addition to their collection.  I really like to hear my favorite bands doing things like cover songs and acoustic recordings.  It gives a different perspective to a song that you may already know.  I enjoyed this a lot.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so much fun. I could play it all day long. If you like temple run I bet you will like subway surfers. It is not exactly like temple run but really close. Instead of tilting your device you swipe.I love how you go to all different places every time there is an update.subway surfers is my all time favorite game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is rated E for everyone because it's so fun ! Every one can play this game & this game is for everyone. Literally
B007N5YIUS|5.0|It's one of the best Angry Bird games and also one of the best of all.I bet you'll like it 'too
B00CO52NLI|5.0|I love this game because you get to rescue animals and take care of them<br />And you get to feed them brush them and pet them
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is pretty cool...keeps me thinking...a nice change from the other games i play....I'm working on the next level...looking forward to it.....
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like it but after a while it gets kind of repetitive and boring. I wish there was more to do.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|this is just a wonderful movie of one of Austen's best novels.  Well worth the time, don't miss it. Better then subsequent versions.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|Emma began slowly but after getting the background for the story, it was a charming one. The stars were well cast, the costuming great and just all in all, very entertaining.
1468179993|3.0|This is a fine, basic book on public speaking.<br /><br />The author doesn't have anything to do with TED talks, he hasn't done one, and I have the impression he hasn't even seen one live, so using their name to market his book is a bit sketchy. He has no special insights into what makes a talk TED worthy. Of course, I probably wouldn't have bought it, if he hadn't done that, so I can see why he did...<br /><br />Please note the length (112), this is more of a pamphlet than a full book.<br /><br />If you haven't read any, or many, books on public speaking, this is a fine starting place. If you have read many, it's probably all familiar.<br /><br />I did like the \\"ted ten commandments\\", but that's from TED, you can just google it.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I loved the ending. (: another amazing book by an amazing author! (: I also loved the fact that Patrick and Alex are having a baby. AHHH! (Sorry if you didn't read the book & I ruined it for you.)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved it... I think The crossfire series is one of the best book I have ever read. Dying to know more about Gideon and Eva.
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|Sublimely good read. Funny, smart and wise. This book tells the story of Doug's struggles to deal with the death of his wife, Hailey. Very well written. Tropper is insanely concise. I wish I could write this well.
0345529057|4.0|Reading 1st book.  Good so far.  Not a lot more than in the HBO series video.  4 more words required.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|The writer is honest to a fault. She lets the reader inside her head, where she stands proud (rightly so) and totally transparent. All her failures and triumphs are there for the reader to share. The total beauty of a courageous human spirit, one who takes full responsibility for her life emerges. Truly inspiring, and very well written.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome. Don't get anything that is like minecraft. Out of all the rest games I have,I have to say I spend more time on minecraft.
B00BN2D5FG|5.0|Awesome as always Bon Jovi Rocks!!!!!!!!!!! Bon Jovi never fails at any album they bring out. This is no exception.. See you on tour...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is cool game not to hard not to easy really makes you think and figure things out would like more levels tho try it its worth the down load I don't waste my time with reviews if don't deserve my time
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome Reading.... EJames is a great author. If you like in depth romance/sex novels this is for you. Cant wait for the movie in 2014.
0440245915|4.0|I give 4 stars because most of the mid parts of the book are very dragging. I listened to the audio book. The storyline is very fragile and touching. The plot is very touching. But the storytelling sequence is, let's say boring. I had read this several years ago more than 15, so had forgotten most of it. I reread it because the sequel [[ASIN:0385537131 Sycamore Row]] is coming out in fall with same lead character and I am curious how the next book in sequence will be.  Gives the idea how the South was in those periods, though I am not sure how accurate the descriptions are - was it real most of the places, or only in pockets or just fiction?<br /><br />Anyway, I would say last 3 chapters are the one that really piqued my interest in this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series, hoping it will continue for several years to come! Great to have a show that isn't gory, vulgar or distasteful on TV!
B003FC6WBQ|5.0|I love this movie.  I won't ruin it with any spoilers.  But it's a wonderful romantic comedy, with lots of flavor and character.  The cast is amazing, the script is good, and the results are classic.  I do love old movies in general, that's true, but this is one of the best.<br /><br />Picture and sound quality is excellent, IMHO, given the age of the movie.  (Obviously, this will not hold up to modern standards.)
0812982622|5.0|It was hard to read such grinding realism, but I could barely put it down. It is stunningly written. A modern classic.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|beach buggy blitz is one of the best games I have played so if you are thinking about getting this go do it
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My daughter loves this game. Lots of neat and easy accessories to use for the free app. I even enjoy playing dressup!!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I enjoy this movie every time I see it.  And thanks to dvd players & a source to buy the movies, we can enjoy<br />classics like this whenever we want.
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|The only positive element of this movie is the scenic countryside.  The characters are boorish and uncouth.  My husband and I shut off the movie after 15 minutes. In this case, my $3.99 was wasted
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Best game like ever.  I don't know who likes it more my seven year old or me.  He's ha ha.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so much fun I'm a regular person they did not pay me to say this I really love it
B004LPLU4K|5.0|I just like it. Will be buying the DVD so that I can watch it again. If my mother liked it then my grown children and grandkids will watch it and see if they like it. I think they will. In other words this movie wil  be viewed many times why, because its very good.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|YOU HAVE NOT MUCH SKINS IN THERE<br />because it has new stuff in there like new monster and some skins
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|fun and challenging I keep going back to same stages....I'm enjoying it ....little tricky when u first start but when u get the hang of it pretty cool..
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The twists leave you wanting more. If you like thrillers you will enjoy this book. Look forward to reading more from this author.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Great movie.  Not what I expected at all when I watched the preview.  The violence is mild and Tom Cruise does a great job as usual.  Worth renting on Amazon.
B0058SNI58|4.0|My feet are pretty tough for the most part, except in a few areas... and these did happen to rub along the inner parts of my feet (where the strap runs back to your ankle) and I got blisters, but I put duck-tape on my feet until they got used to it.  Now I can wear them all night at the restaurant and I don't get blisters. Sometimes they catch and make you trip up, so if you drag your feet... don't in these shoes. Feet feel good at the end of the night. They just took some breaking in!
B008Y78GYI|5.0|This was a terrific movie and look into the life of Fannie Brice.  The music is terrific and Streisand hit it out of the park.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Turned it off after 30 minutes.  Too much foul language, poor parenting and generally raunchy behavior. Very sorry excuse for comedy.  Would not recommend.
B007V4530A|2.0|The book missed the mark on delivering great ways to deliver a TED Talk.  We all have one in us, and I was hoping to be inspired in some way to produce one.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is an excellent film!  My wife repeatedly asked \\"Are you nervous?\\"  Of course I said no,  then I realized I have been literally on the edge of my seat for an hour.  Great movie.
B00C9U9YOC|5.0|When I first heard QOTSA's single \\"My God Is The Sun\\" on the radio, I really wasn't feeling it. \\"This isn't nearly as catchy as \\"No One Knows\\" or \\"Go With The Flow\\" from their magnum opus, Songs For The Deaf. After listening to it in the context of the album, not only did I think it was a great song, but it fit exactly where it needed to be in the grand design of the entire album. I never felt that ...Like Clockwork had the strongest selection of songs (as I would only place 1 in their top 10 songs of their catalog), BUT the major, major silver lining of the album is that it rocks so much as a cohesive, single entity, which is the most important thing an album should be.<br /><br />I cannot skip around any song in this album, as everything flows together so well to a pace that Josh Homme has never created before. You have the desert, dirge, ambling pace of the opener \\"Keep Your Eyes Peeled\\", the back to the roots, and super catchy rock of \\"I Sat By The Ocean\\", and the very interesting and melodic ballad of \\"Vampyre\\". Afterward, this cycle repeats up until the climatic closer duo of \\"I Appear Missing\\" (QOTSA's finest), and the titular track. 10 songs in and out in 45 minutes.<br /><br />What makes this different from Era Vulgaris is that Josh Homme had 6 years to hone his skills, and it truly shows on ...Like Clockwork. You definitely will notice that Mr. Homme took some time to reassess himself and make an album with his friends in high places (Elton John, Trent Reznor and among many others appear on the album), as well as experiment with the work of his influences and peers (I hear some Eagles of Death Metal and Bowie, nonetheless).<br /><br />Great album for any QOTSA fan and rock fans, as this is most likely in the running for Rock Album of the Year, and Album of the Year in my book. 5/5
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite games on any device. It's so cute! But to all people considering buying this: WARNING! HIGHLY ADDICTING!
B005LAIIMG|3.0|While I love a good action sci-fi thriller, I set aside the sage advice of my former AP U.S. History student, Matthew Normand, who in response to my criticisms of \\"Avatar,\\" said, \\"Colonel, park your brain at the door of the theater and just enjoy the movie.\\"  Forgive me Matt, but I cannot help myself.<br />World War Z (WWZ) would have been much enjoyable for me if Brad Pitt had paid a bit more attention to detail on various aspects of the story.  While I embrace the concept of zombies, the rapid contamination in a matter of seconds from zombie to human was unrealistic.  Given that rapid rate of infection, how did it spread from India to Korea without sending up red flags all over the world?  For that matter, how did it spread across oceans to the U.S.?  What did the zombies eat?  It appeared that their only motivation was to infect others.<br />WWZ should have used some other organization than the United Nations.  The UN has no robust standing military command structure or forces.  A much better and more plausible scenario would have been using NATO instead of the UN, replacing the UN deputy secretary general with the U.S. vice-president, and casting Brad Pitt as a former member of Seal Team Six.<br />While I respect the Mossad, I question how they were able to take unbelievably rapid action in response to a radio intercept of an Indian general reporting fighting the \\"undead.\\"  The Israelis ability to construct a wall around Jerusalem before the onset of the zombies strains credulity.  What would have been the reaction of the rest of the world?  I also found it unfathomable that the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) would not have complete and solid surveillance on all parts of the wall to prevent surprise attacks like the one that scaled the wall.  Although I know from my 30 years in the Army and three trips to Israel that female IDF soldiers are tough, I find it hard to accept that Segen did not go into complete shock following the traumatic amputation of her bitten-hand by Brad Pitt to avoid the spread of the contamination into the rest of her body.  Then, only four days later, she was able to conduct strenuous tactical operations in the W.H.O. facility in Wales.  HOOAH!!!<br />How they got to that facility is also troubling.  Civilian air travel would have been shut down long ago, and I doubt that the wall around Jerusalem would have included the airport.  Surely, WWZ could have used some other aircraft than a commercial one from Belarus Airlines.  No explanation was given as to how the zombie that suddenly appeared in-flight managed to stowaway on the aircraft.  Kudos to Brad Pitt's quick action in using one of Segen's hand grenades to blow a hole in the side of the plane that sucked out the now infected zombies.  Amazingly, in the resultant crash (conveniently within walking distance of the W.H.O. facility) those two were the only survivors except for one zombie still strapped in her seat, but she does not count.  Brad Pitt is certainly one lucky puppy in that he, with virtually no formal medical training, was able to select and inject himself with the pathogen that would make him undesirable and thus virtually invisible to the zombies.<br />The rant is almost over.  WWZ had no closure at the end other than Brad Pitt muttering some philosophical balderdash or platitudes (take your pick) about how although offensive action is now possible against the zombies it not the end, \\"not even close.\\"  Please spare us from a sequel.<br />Despite my pointing all of the above to her, my highly intelligent 15-year old granddaughter wants to see the movie again.  Although I love her, I will pass on accompanying her for an encore viewing.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Yes this book is all three plus many more adjectives. The main character made this book one I could not put down.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|My sister-in-law recommended this book and I was not disappointed at all.  Very moving account of slavery and the lives that must have been led ... Couldn't put it down!!
B000FC1CYG|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It was a nice long mystery with lots of twists and turns. One always knew, however, that good would triumph over evil in the end. I liked the way the narratives changed from one perspective to another. I think it is a little outdated, and that is why one always has to think of the day in which it was written to truly evaluate the worth of the book.  I would recommend it to certain friends but not others.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Loved it.......super cast...sweet story....well acted.....highly recommend it!  Bonus of good music and sweet relationships....well worth your time...Enjoy it as I did...
B00746O3X8|5.0|I use it when i go hiking it proved to be a very handy and you don't have to worry about hitting your camera on the rocks or trees
B00AMH3RBA|5.0|I love the whole series of this movie. Makes a fun clean movie night with my nieces and well worth the money spent
B005LAIGN2|4.0|There are two historical incidents which are commonly referred to as \\"the Tuskeegee Experiment\\".  This is the more uplifting of the two.<br /><br />The Second World War was a time when the world changed radically, then changed radically again, and then again, and on and on for almost six years.  This was true not only geopolitically (three of the world's major powers destroyed, two others risen to a new category of \\"superpower\\") and technologically (the transition from prop plane to jet, from TNT to U-235), but culturally as well.<br /><br />People often talk about the regimentation required by war, but too often fail to notice how a war can force a country to give up some kinds of regimentation, such as sexism and racial segregation.  Rosie the Riveter is  a feminist icon today even more than during the war, and the \\"Double Victory\\" the Red Tails fought for is still worthy of celebration.<br /><br />This is a story worth being told, and it is told very well with superior scripting, acting and special effects.  Even if your only interest in the Tuskeegee Airmen is in the planes they flew, there's plenty of that here.  I'm rather fond of the old warbirds myself (I set up a Yahoo group, \\"Airboy\\", in honor of one 1940s aviation series), and I definitely enjoyed that aspect of the film, but there's a good deal more to see here.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I read this book on my own honeymoon. It's another funny, entertaining and quick read. Theres a good struggle between sisters which most women can relate to. Another good book by Kinsella.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It does everything I expect. Access to books. Easy to manage. Convenient.... while I still decide if I want a Kindle Fire : )
0020442203|4.0|I know this is a classic book but I've seen too many movie versions to truly enjoy the original writing. Read the book before watching any of the movies.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The book was entertaining and exciting, a great read. It was a bit unbelievable at times, but that led to more excitment.
B000002IAZ|3.0|Bought this as a gift for my father who remembers Buffalo Springfield fondly. He seemed disappointed because it wasn't quite what he remembered.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|Loved this movie growing up and just recently re watched it,  from the amazing soundtrack to the great acting it is a must for all to see
B0095P33IW|4.0|Mostly solid story line. Not as hokey as some comic book movies that have been made in the past. Good graphics.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|This is the first album I've purchased in probably 10 years. I didn't realize that I was into electronic music, but apparently I am, and I guess I've been missing something as this music is fantastic. Okay, so I wouldn't give every cut a five star score, but I would certainly give five to Within, Give Life Back to Music, Instant Crush, Lose Yourself to Dance and of course Get Lucky.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love the game. you want to keep going. it would help if there were some glues if you needed them.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|HD quality and the best season of the next generation, and epic adventure. just waiting to proceed to the conclusion
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I loved the book, but it was suppose to be the last one. It's cool we have another one to look forward to reading, but no telling how long it's going to take to come out. Entwined with You got pushed nacho so many times. I was just hopeful for more answers with this book.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|brought me back to my childhood, if your a fan of star trek then why not continue to the next generation.
B000071ZZI|4.0|We had a sequel to this, but not the initial film. It was nice to locate it online and share the great series with our children.
B00846TRHY|5.0|This is a story that needs to be told, and this movie does the story justice.  God bless Sam Childers and all he does for the African children.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Potential viewers beware -- this series is habit-forming.  The urge to watch the whole season in one sleep-deprived binge is nearly irresistible.  No, the courtroom scenes are not realistic, but this series succeeds in capturing the essence of what makes courtroom drama exciting and fascinating, drawing inspiration from real-life criminal and civil cases.  The personal back story of these characters, on the other hand, accurately reflects the challenge of trying to &#34;have it all&#34; in the arena of law and politics.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|Love fairway!  I keep missing that darn gopher.  Most fun of  any card game.  I enjoy listening the announcers call the plays.
0756659841|5.0|I love this product and so does my 9 years old daughter, my 7 years old nephew, and my 4 years old niece.
B00CBKLO52|1.0|how can I rate something I never received.whem did I get this?when did I order this item.tell me when?when ?
B000055Y0X|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you must.<br /><br />I pulled it out on Christmas break for the kiddies who don't remember the Evil Empire. The adults were horrified I would choose to give a history lesson and use this as my maim source, but everyone was soon surrounding the TV.<br /><br />We loved it. Take it for what it's worth and have fun with it, but remember. Communism is the most dangerous tyranny we could face.

B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|Hard to watch, but this needs to be watched as this is part of history. Excellent movie, highly recommended. True story.
B000006NUW|5.0|What can you say!<br />Motown was the great soundtrack to my teenage years.<br />Love to just play this while I'm doing stuff around the house.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have to say, this app helped out a lot especially in severe weather such as Tornadoes Severe Thunderstorms Hurricanes etc. It's quite impressive. Now I don't say this often, Thanks. I also think this app deserves more downloads. People should be cornered about mother nature. Mother Nature can be quite deadly. Hopes to all those people. And thanks again.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|A good cover for the price, nice and simple. I used it on a trip out west and it protected my Kindle just fine.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love this game! It is so fascinating. This game deserves five stars! Kudos to Big Fish games! The graphics and story are both excellent.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|This is a great movie to watch with the family, my kids loved it...and so did my wife and I
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game a lot. It is very easy to earn coins and gems. Very very fun game! Love it!
B002ZG994U|5.0|This is our 2nd A-team DVD, our first one got worn out in the car DVD player. My husband LoveS this action packed, humorous DVD and its hard to find!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this app everyday.  I have it on 3 different tablets.  One has android 2.1 and is basically only a back up now.  The other two Samsung Galaxy Tab 7. 2 and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 both have this app installed.  I read from whichever one is appropriate at the time.  I both buy books and get library books on this app and it works terrifically.  Get it you'll use it.  It's easy
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put this book down until I finally found out what happened. The writer is awesome and holds your interest every minute. It all seemed so real!
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I love this show. I first started watching it because I saw an ad for it before a movie that I saw in the theater and thought that it looked like an interesting and entertaining show, and I was right. If you like Sci-Fi, Action, and Drama I highly recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book doesn't allow you to put it down. Believe me there is nothing boring here! I couldn't wait to read book three.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game makes you think through the problems and helps flex memory skills. Think through all levels without looking for cheats makes an even greater challenge.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|This book can be an excellent guide to help you make fewer errors in your regular activities.<br /><br />I especially like that Gawande uses a lot of time driving home the effectiveness of using checklists, by providing numerous examples from a broad array of professions and situations before he teaches you how to create and implement them in your own life.<br /><br />I think The Checklist Manifesto will be of great value for anyone that seeks to minimise the number of errors they make due to forgetting or miscommunication. Although everyone would benefit from the lessons in this book, I think it is especially beneficial for managers, regardless of profession.
159514188X|4.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is one of those books that sticks with you if not forever, for a very long time.  While this book did not resonate with me personally as much as some others have (such as If I Stay and Before I Fall), it is a very powerful book that I think all teens should read.<br /><br />The entire book is about Hannah's reasons for committing suicide.  While her motives at times felt insufficient to me, the bullying she is subjected to builds up and she feels that she has no friends and no one to turn to.  Her cries for help are unanswered, and she is not taken seriously by her classmates, parents, and teachers.<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why has a butterfly-effect type of message.  All of your actions affect someone else, sometimes much more than you could ever imagine.  Small slights that others would be able to shrug off left Hannah reeling, especially as the insults accumulated over time.<br /><br />Asher tells Clay's story along with Hannah's, with a dual narration that could have gotten clumsy but worked really well.  I liked Clay and I really felt for him as he dealt with his culpability and guilt for Hannah's death.  The whole time I was reading the book, I kept hoping that somehow someone got to Hannah in time and she was not really dead.  I knew the book was about suicide but I was still hoping for a happy ending, although I think that ending would have cheapened the message.<br /><br />I would recommend Thirteen Reasons Why to anyone, and especially to middle and high-school students.  I think this book would have had a much greater effect on me if I was still in my teens.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />I think the fact that Hannah commits suicide over not one huge incident but because of small incidents makes more of an impact on the \\"everything you do affects someone\\" message.
B009MVM09W|5.0|30s era machine gun dialog delivers a great story. The acting is dead on from Tim Robbins' naivety, Jennifer Jason Leigh's fast talking schemer, Paul Newman's deadpan cold bloodedness. Charles Durning and Bill Cobbs add the right amount of magic. It's a great ride not to be missed.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|Fantastic movie, watched it twice.  Great for people like me who get bored with a story line after watching it for 10 minutes. Playback was excellent, no skips or bumps.
B0086213XW|4.0|I loved this movie! It's one of those that makes you think long after the movie is over. It's full of emotions and very well acted by Michelle Williams. I highly recommend!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is a good show to watch for discussion on the possibilities of science.  Although it is from an atheistic viewpoint, I think anyone interested in science will like it.
0525953728|5.0|No matter how you feel about having a SEAL break the vow of silence, the writing is clear, concise and fast-paced. Easy to read, has great photos and diagrams.  This was a gift, but I read it in 4 hours - it's that riveting.  Recommend it highly.
B007T967X4|1.0|very upset. this looked fun for my.daughter.<br />the app will not download after repeated tries. I have restarted the kindle
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Nothing better than being able to get something for your other half that he REALLY wants. Music is enchanting, and he's had many hours of enjoyment as he drives to and from Civil War re-enactments.
0385349947|5.0|The children's dictionary is just right for my 5 year old granddaughter.  The illustrations enhance the dictionary and hold the attention of a 5 year old.  Without the illustrations  I don't think kids would be interested.<br /><br />lean in was a gift for someone I did read a few excerpts and decided to buy one for myself<br /><br />Thank you amazon for providing great products and exceptional customer service
B00122J0YW|4.0|This is the only Madonna album I have ever bought. The variety of musical styles and rhythms visited on this album fascinate me.  Good for a trip down memory lane.

B008NCSZQ8|4.0|A little confusing at the beginning. If you didn't see the other movies before this it can be a little confusing. Great action and digital effects.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The book went nowhere. I was expecting the ending to my trilogy not a filler book that felt like they were making story plots up to fill up the space. I think this was a bad decision on the publishers and Sylvia Day to milk more money out of this series. The first two books I loved but I had a had time getting though this one.I felt like parts of this book were written by someone else.Then they had to ruin the main character by completely changing her personality into this weak and needy person. That was one of the main reasons I loved this series was because of her character development.  So now after patiently waiting after two pushback of this book I'm left feeling completely disappointed!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Kids will love it, def worth the free DL, maybe even to buy if it was cheap. Great way to pass time.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Terrific choice of Tommy Lee Jones to play Dave Robicheaux. Where was Clete Purcell? John Goodman appears to have some of the physical attributes of Clete, but his character in the movie was used elsewhere.
0786958731|5.0|This game is just as much fun as the Ravenloft version.  The board(s), game pieces, and cards are all very well made.  One of the things I enjoy most about these D&D board games is that they are co-operative.  No more feeling like I have to let my son win or give him an edge.  We win or we lose TOGETHER.  I also love the replay aspect of this game.  No two games are ever alike because you can never have the exact same game board.  Genius!<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a co-op game with high durability and a lot of replay value, look no further than these board games from WotC.  Great products!
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Nalini Singh writes with a style that just keeps you hooked into the lives be they psy or changelings. You just cant put the books down. This one is no different despite it sounding like he was a bad man in the previous series of books.<br /><br />Its a fabulous book well worth the read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Puzzles are interesting and fun to solve.  Some rooms took a little time and imagination.  Hope to see more soon.  Great app.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Great game and adventures. Makes you use your brain. Great for all ages with the difficulty settings.  Great time passer and ilove it!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|WOW! This book was such a pleasant surprise and I gobbled it up in less then 24 hours. It had such a different flare to it versus the usual romance novels I read. It was like a comedian, hot billionaire, steamy sex scenes and an adorable heroine all crashed together for a funny, sexy, feel good read! The writing was truly brilliant and flawless and I have never laughed my way through a book and been turned on at the same time. Lol
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|Not as easy as it looks it  is very  very very hard to brush the hair it only takes one strand of hair at a time.
B001DDBCUA|1.0|I loved the series. The movie, on the pther hand, was boring, with shallow caracthers and dull of the most dull clichés. Waste fo money and of time.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Especially the ending can't wait to get book four and book five dunno what I was reading before!!!! Thank you to the friend who introduced me to grrm
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Like so many people who own a nice camera, I have read a few dozen books on photography.<br />When people ask me for a photo-book recommendation.  I say there are two MUST-READ titles.<br /><br />This is one of them.
B007ZSBQYE|5.0|I love it! I can never stop playing it. The only thing that I don't really like is how you can just tap something and one of your car's life is gone. But other than that, I love the game and I would recommend to anyone else out there who asked.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I HAVE READ ALL OF THE BOOKS-I WAS HAPPY TO READ THIS ONE,I TOOK IT ON VACATION AND TRYED TO NOT FINISH IT RIGHT AWAY-WHEN I GOT TO THE END I WAS UNHAPPY,THE AUTHOR STOPED THE BOOK -THATS RIGHT JUST STOPPED IT-SHE DIDN'T EVEN WRITE UP TO THE ENDING,IT JUST STOPPED-I KNOW SHES GOING TO WRITE MORE BOOKS-I WANT MORE BOOKS BUT I'M UNHAPPY THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER BOOK-SHE DIDN'T EVEN TELL US WHEN THE OTHER BOOK WAS COMING OUT-SO I'M WAITING FOR THE NEXT BOOK-
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app my brother had it so I wanted it so I got it and so far I have 3 world's I love how you can do multiple people on one world.  I would recommend it to people who like minecraft because it's just like the real minecraft.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Too much jumping around and the whole continuity of the different generations was lost. Definitely not as good as his first too books where I thought were excellent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wonderful game and addicting too. I would recommend this game to anyone.  It is also great to pass the time.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wonderful book.  Recommend to everyone.  A very suspenseful keeps you in the edge of your seat.  Surprise ending. Loved it.
0679720200|5.0|-<br />I have put off reading the existentialists because I have had been unable to make sense of their writings. This book is different; it is a fine work of literature in its own right. And the translation is a beautiful example of that art.<br /><br />A short novel that you will wish had lasted much longer.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Classic Disney. Great movie with great music. I have all the Disney movies and its one of the best. Highly recommend.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|But I did no  like the ending. There were  too many loose strings an  I found  myself  getting frustrated. I
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Really cute and fun for the whole family. I love Steve Carrell and he does a great job with the voice over.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I think this is the fifth in the Jack Reacher series for me, and this one's every bit as good as the rest!  There are plenty of great action sequences, plot twists, good guys and bad guys, and as always, Jack ends up being quicker, stronger, and smarter than everybody else.  There's a grisly murder (murders are always grisly in these novels), a hostage, an agent who seems bad but is good, and a place where people are \\"housed\\" so that they don't get in the way of an on-going Federal investigation.  All in all, it's Jack being Jack.<br /><br />I have noticed, in the five Reacher novels that I've read, that Reacher is never \\"supposed to be\\" a part of the intrigue that he finds himself in.  He always is accidentally thrust into the fray by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  This time he's hitchhiking (which he does a lot of), and is picked up by three people in a car.  Now, he's 6' 5\\" tall (Tom Cruise on stilts), always unkempt, and is sporting a poorly tended recently broken nose.  He should have been immediately suspicious of anybody who would pick him up, and, to his credit, it doesn't take him long to figure that out.  I guess that's the only way to get a self-professed loner without a phone or a permanent address involved in bringing the bad guys to justice.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|The special effects and makeup are great, not what I expected from a television series and what a great cast!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I love all of the Reacher books by Lee Child so was curious to see what the movie would be like.  Very enjoyable.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app. Very easy to use and the large numbers makes it so easy to see and to use. Love it
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My husband and I both love The Good Wife, and it is such fun to watch 2 or 3 episodes at a time.  It has the perfect combination of legal drama and personal drama and a cast of characters that is outstanding.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. Its so much fun. A lot of strategy!! But it makes your  brain work.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It alot of fun for adults and kids!! All ages i should say!!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game on my Apple devices and have been waiting for it anxiously to come out on the Android market.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|The first time I used this app I backed out of a video but the sound of the video kept playing until I shut down my kindle please fix it
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved the way everything went full circle within the family.  There were times I had trouble keeping track of the characters.  Wonderful story.
B0018QQQK8|1.0|Movie made from this book was quite view-able; the book had wooden characters and lacked any spark.  No more books by Nicholas for me.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is amazing wonderfully written passionate and breath taking I literally read it in two days it was that good! It continues the story of the 2 main characters in exactly the way your heart wants it to go loved it!!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a fascinating biography of a Luftwaffe pilot and what it was like to serve in the German air force as it was systematically dismantled by the Allies.  The actual incident with the American bomber is almost anticlimactic.  A good read for war buffs.
B004P1JEXE|4.0|Another great book in the series. George RR Martin never fails to mix it up and keep you guessing. I felt that this particular book in the series rambled a little towards the end, and it is so hard to keep track of all the characters. however I am as hooked as ever and must read on!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I love this show, and this DVD set is complete and the box is compact for storing the set conveniently
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|everything is good about it except when you're flying I press the beachball on accident besides from that its a five star game
0060589280|5.0|Means good book. The book came on time no wear or tear. Good author good book. Worth it for a read.
B0049J2CKE|2.0|It was boring and very unentertaining.  Got it for my four yr old and she couldn't get into it either
8172238479|4.0|I can't weigh in on whether or not this is an accurate portrayal of India, but I can say that this is one of those books that I didn't want to put down. The protagonist is a complex beast - sometimes I'm rooting for him and other times my hand is literally covering my mouth when I'm reading his account of what he's done.  I feel like I walked away from this book with a clearer understanding of what the caste system looks like under a modern lens in India, but most importantly, the story was compelling and artfully written.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|My only complaint is that after my daughter finishes the makeup and puts the dress on, the face gets a black box over it. She really wiuld like to see the entire princess dressed up. Please fix this on all of your games. Thank you.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is one that will get a second read because it was a bit difficult to follow.  Lots of characters and side plots but all in all another good book by a talented author.
B000VH3FV8|5.0|I have always been a fan of Luther and this selection of songs are the best commemmorative grup I have heard. They are thoroughly enjoyable and my wife and I have listened to them several times already.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Just finished the movie. It was entertaining for the most part. I enjoyed it, for the most part. But it was unbelievable, wasn't realistic. Just didn't feel believable. Would I watch it again, maybe. Very handsome characters.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game. Starts out simple and then gets more challenging. Good memory tester.<br />Would like to see more levels. Definitely recommend.
B007HU4FZ2|1.0|I was hoping for more. It was in a foreign language. I could hot follow it. I could not even watch the whole thing, had to delete it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a very nice game. Great for children. You get to play with your horse get gems and do competitions.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I was hoping more like the Lord of the rings. I watched it, had read the books years before. I thought this would be a single show, but it will be like the Lord of the rings, tri.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Very hard to put down, the only problem now is that I'll have to get the rest of the series.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Yea lame. This movie was boring. I could not follow it at all. He was in the dinky, then the tiger was. He was in the boat then the tiger. It was lame.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game to play. My grandson loves playing this game. He loves the flying backjet. I would really suggest this game to anyone of any age. Awesome
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This was lousy. Maybe I'm just to technical. But this movie was blah! I would never watch it again, even on the TV.
B006QQQ5SI|5.0|This film was lots of fun to watch. The actors worked together smoothly to give the audience a fine time.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|One the best cop shows ever! Something new every time. Always wanting to see what happens next and turns evolve
B005544V6A|5.0|I really enjoyed this show. I stumbled upon it by accident after I signed up for Amazon Prime.  At first I didn't honestly think it could pull it off but after a few episodes I am hooked.<br /><br />The characters are well established, from leading to supporting what a really good cast.  Mike, Harvey, Rachael and especially Louis (he is the guy you LOVE to hate.)<br /><br />It is good fun light entertainment.  It's not heavy like Law and Order but its not to corny like a sitcom.  It happily finds its place somewhere in the middle and is just good entertainment.<br /><br />I'm hooked
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is written as a diary of two people - the victim and the suspect. Although the plot is quite interesting, it doesnt reveal itself until 2/3 into the book. I still gave this book 4stars as it is a holiday type of read and its quite good but the end is too claustrofobic for my liking.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Previous reviews stated full version was .99-$4.99. Definitely worth  .99, but I personally wouldn't pay $4.99 for any game that I'd only play once.  I'm having a little bit of trouble following along, but they asked me to write this review early in the game...so I'm hoping to catch on soon (only just entered the second structure).
B002HHPVHQ|5.0|We all followed the events of financial world turmoil. This books explains all of those and their correlation to Lehman very well!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is an excellent game. It is so entertaining. i would definitely recommend this to a friend. thanks mojang . best game yet.
B007DIQC90|3.0|With one song being searched for- we bought the albumn deciding to try the rest of the songs for a fit
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|The ALL STAR cast was absolutely hilarious in this movie.  I recommend this comedy to anyone.  You will not be sorry.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|After hearing the History Channel commercial for Swamp People- I was bent to remember to look for them- All in all pretty good
B0091WNK8M|5.0|It's a silly fun loving movie. This is one of those movies that no matter how many times one sees it it's worth another viewing. The awesome part is a new generation of kids are watching and loving this movie as well. We'll be watching it again and again.
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|This is a coming of age film.  A feel good movie in the very best sense!  Boy makes good against all odds.  Fantastic film!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob, This is a novel that you cannot put down.  I thought I had the guilty party figured out, boy I was wrong!!
B0006PV5VC|5.0|This Scheherazade is stunning, almost perfect based on my tastes.  The pace is rapid when appropriate, but the tempo never steps all over itself as it does in other recordings.  Slower passages are gentle and rhythmic without dragging.  It sparkles and scintillates but maintains a deep, strong undercurrent.  I am going to try other Scheherazades, but I don't expect to find one that will displace Reiner's.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Stravinsky, so I won't comment on the rest of the CD.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I am trying to find a weather app that works well on my Kindle Fire HD. I switched to Weather Bug which works great on my Samsung Galaxy SIII but it is only mediocre on the Kindle. Weather channel is fair, but AccuWeather is terrible.
B0012HEB32|5.0|Very well acted, the writing is superb with plots and twists.  It is a down right shame that Fox canceled this show, don't know what they were thinking.  I loved this show so much I helped sign the petition to bring it back.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A story so heartbreakingly beautiful that I felt transported to another place, often breathless by majestic storytelling.  This book is a gift.
0679420266|5.0|Very conveniently written, and quite conveniently understood. So convenient I could read this twice in a day. Recommended for the readers out there.
B000NMW6M0|4.0|It was an interesting movie to say the least.  I forgot I had seen this before in the movie theater but it was nice to be able to watch it from the comfort on your own home.<br />I was at the edge of my pool watching in on my iPad and enjoying the cool water on a very hot day in Arizona.  I would recommend this movie but it is something that you really need to keep your full attention on it.
B008VO3PA4|3.0|The book is quite cute, but I'm taking away one star because I can't read it on my Kindle for PC for Windows 7.  Apparently, the author has some sort of problem w/ Windows 7 and refuses to publish it for Kindle for PC for Windows 7.  I'd originally bought it for Kindle, with the intention of reading it on all my devices.  I bought the book, so why shouldn't I be able to read it in any format, on any device I wish?  But no, the author and/or publisher was being stupid and decided it was a good idea to limit the book's availability.  So, since amazon wouldn't help me read it on Kindle for PC for Windows 7, I had them refund my money and I bought it used.  That way, neither the author nor the publisher would benefit from my purchase.<br /><br />I think the book is cute, and most of the poems are cute.  I like the cat pictures in the book and the book title makes me giggle.  It would merit 4 stars, but since the author and/or publisher is acting like a goober, I am taking away 1 star, and giving the book only 3 stars.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I thought the book was extremely boring and was disappointed to find out the saga was going to continue. How many times do you need to read the same sexual encounters and drag a book into another sequel. Very disappointed.
B005LAIIN0|2.0|Much has been said about world war z. This highly anticipated film was to be adapted from max brook's cult following novel. After a bidding war with leonardo dicaprio, brad pitt managed to secure the rights with his production agency. Apparently brad then endured a year of stress to make this film happen. Reports included reshooting, delays, re-writing and an overblown budget. Ironically the critics began to appear from the woodworks, one by one to naw at the prospects of brad's brainy demise. And i have to admit it did not look promising when he was quoted as saying that he chose this role to do something his kids would enjoy. Why would his kids enjoy a horrific world war calamity??<br /><br />The problem for brad pitt, maybe unknowingly, was that the passionately loved book would be incredibly difficult if not impossible to translate into a 2 hour feature movie.  It really deserves a mini-series format.<br /><br />I am not much of book reader, but i was harassed long enough by my house mate such that one night i finally opened the pages. I couldnt put it down thereafter.<br /><br />When i heard they were making this film i wondered how brad would be able to bring together a book which was essentially a series of short stories,  that encompass different characters, places and times to create a world war narrative on a massive global scale. Each chapter has a different protagonist and a different perspective, that gives an insight into the world of a zombie apocalypse. From intimate tales of survival to social commentary to geo-political consequences. The book was intelligent, gripping, and always took itself very seriously.<br /><br />And serious is how most fans of the novel are towards this piece of fiction. Brad pitt had alot to deliver and its not completely unfair for fans to expect a certain level of respect that goes hand in hand with a planned adaptation.<br /><br />Without exaggeration, this film bares almost zero relation to the book. The movie from startto finish never even happened in the textbook. The only premise it took from the original source was the notion that a zombie outbreak occurs on a world wide scale. But why did he purchase the rights to deliver this premise?<br /><br />For those who havent read the book, it obviously appears irrelevant, but for many people like myself it means that a true cinematic adaptation of max brooks novel is no longer possible. That chance has been needlessly wasted here. This movie could have been called 'zombie apocalypse' and someone else could have produced 'world war z'. And that would have been fine,  and i might have even conceded it was a pretty entertaining movie in its own right.<br /><br />This movie fails for this reason. I understand many liked it, but unfortunately they dont realise just how small a glimpse they were offered, and how amazing it should have been.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I would not pay $10 for an app. Sorry. I like earning my achievements on a console where it matters.  That's where I would pay the $10.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|I truly enjoyed 24, Seasons 1-8. I found the series and each seaon very entertaining.  I would highly recommend this series to people who love action-packed scenes.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|seen it so many times and its still pretty damn good. Go see it if you havent especially if you have prime. It's a great addition for prime members.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a bit obsessed with this game. I need more gems!! Also, I'm in the market for more friends. Gems gems gems.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Entertaining summer action movie, what more do you need to know? You should just sit down on your couch, get the popcorn ready, and enjoy yourself.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Good depiction of the transition into the 20th Century.<br />Well written social classes descriptions with their prevailing rules and mores.<br />Great characters, acting, photography and scenery.
B0097PW7H8|3.0|I was looking for a product with easier optimization settings and I just couldn't figure this one out. I also didn't feel like helped my battery a whole lot, but I had a great program before this one that turned out to be a trial and I was looking for a replacement. I'm gonna try another app, but I'll keep this one in mind. It's not terrible; it's just not as easily customizable as I'd like it to be.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|The red thread of their lives story is ok but very slow and it is all starting to get a bit boring by now. I didn't feel like the story was leading anywhere and must admit I flicked all the sex pages. Honestly how many times do you want to read how much they love each other and can't be without each other. I won't be reading the next book.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Acting by Danny Glover not his best, but otherwise was good plot and suspense.  Wahlberg plays a good role.  Some scenes not real believable but that is the case with most action thrillers.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I had never heard of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis until my friend told me about the single \\"Same Love.\\"  I was so intrigued I decided to take a listen to more of his music.  I liked what I heard and decided to purchase the CD.  I LOVE it!  There is not one song on the CD that I don't like.  Their music is different, original, and the substance of the lyrics will hook you.
B002CRN7WM|5.0|Eurovision 2009 introduced me to this performer. He deservedly won. This album presents 10 tracks which are good examples of his abilities. One track is a solo for violin. Another favourite is \\"13 Horses\\". \\"Fairytale\\" is the hit song from Eurovision. I can listen to it over and over. It has a quality that combines old and modern Russia.<br />I am surprised he is not more popular in my country, considering the supposed talent we are force fed by our media.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|If you liked iron man, captain america hulk, thor movies then you will enjoy this as I did. Lots of action and good special effects. Would give this the thumbs up
B00004CX86|1.0|I was looking foward to receiving this movie. Unfortunately when I attempted to watch it, the DVD player kept saying it couldn't read the disk. I tried two other DVD players, and they both did the same. I received a blank movie. Will not be purchasing from here again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! I love it so much I want to marry it. This game is the best game I ever played.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|My 2 year old loves this show.  It's funny for adults too!  It's simple and has cute music and themes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun time passes by very fast the game makes you stop and think about what your doing glad o play the game
B008M87GJK|4.0|Can always find out world news instead of just local or whatever they show on the tv or whatever news is on the radio
B005USZYDU|2.0|Upon acquiring this book, I didn't realize it was written for a younger audience. I usually enjoy trilogies / series and that was why I selected this book. However, the story line was not typical of a John Grisham novel in that he usually develops several characters and story lines that keeps you interested.  As I read several chapters, I kept hoping the story would become more interesting but it never did. At this point, I gave up on the book and decided not waste any more time on the Theodore Boone series.<br /><br /> I think this book is geared for  6th or 7th grade readers and I am not sure they would enjoy it.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I'm a QOSTA fan, so this is a biased review, but this CD is awesome. Josh is an architect of plays on words set to his unmistakeable sound. I can't wait to see them live.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I was expecting a goofy storyline and puns. Turns out the storyline is entertaining and thats what I want, to be entertained. Knowing this is worked around fairytale characters, it doesn't go too far over the top.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|AWESOME and addicting. A dream come true. My 12 year old self thanks you. What is next? SIM city eat your heart out. Facebook saving is best of all. I will never lose my spot.
B00821OX98|5.0|Exciting and action packed. I had to watch the whole season, at once, because it was so good!  Other than a little language - it was family appropriate as well.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought these for office use rather than &#34;noise cancellation&#34; headphone to play white noise, rain waves, etc while working to drown out talking going on near my work station and am very happy with purchase.  VERY comfortable that you can forget you are wearing them, fidelity is great, controls easy to learn, rechargeable battery life lasts all day, wireless connection is noise/fuzz free.
B00821OX98|5.0|The story has great depth and feeling, great storyline and even though some of my favorite characters were taken off the show the storyline was really good
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The characterization gets better yet with every volume.  The plot also becomes increasingly intricate.  There are more surprises than in any previous book as well.  It is difficult imagining how he will wrap everything up with just the rumored two additional books.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Maybe because I love sushi, I don't know, but this movie was so engaging and fascinating.  We got to see the wisdom and drive of the sushi master and his sons, and the inner workings of a Japanese fish market were great. I would recommend this movie
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Intertwining stories of families over the course of many different generations and 3 (4? more?) continents.  Found The Kite Runner's characters to be more endearing/engaging.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|This game was a dissapointment - it was not as interesting and intertaining as I had hoped it would be. Same old, same old.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I didnt know an album could be this good. Its good through and through, not a dull moment on the entirety of it. Would definitely recommend.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game is good but it should track your days instead of starting over every week....I would get it it is a good time waster
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I like the series, so far, but often find some of the accents especially those of some of the servants, difficult to understand....With so m any characters it sometimes gets confusing.....
B000ID3E9S|3.0|This movie is objectively bad, but I am giving it 3 stars purely because of late 90s nostalgia and the huge adolescent crush I had on Sarah Michell Geller at the time. I also liked the sound track.
B00000612P|5.0|Bring back so many memories .... Great great album any and every age group Would enjoys this this music I recommend anyone one that enjoys music to buy this
159315724X|5.0|I felt I really benefitted from this book.  It outlined for me a schedule that I could follow and not feel pushed.  By starting my morning doing things that help me feel more optimistic,  I am able to get more done. I feel much more focused, basically, because I know what to do next to help me accomplish my goals.
B00CFITJKW|1.0|Don't waste your money! The graphics are really bad,it also tends to stop working when you try to land. I regret buying it!!!
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|This is not the best work of this band, but it is still a great album, and one that any fan of the band and genre should listen to. People that complain about liking a bands old stuff are annoying. Bands have a lot more to time to write and perfect their first albums. This one starts heavy and ends heavy.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I find the show well written and believable.  This season continues the thread that season one started with.  I'd say this is a real winner!
B007XIC1GI|5.0|If you want to get to know who Marilyn Manson is then this is the book to read. Some parts are a bit disturbing but I really didn't expect anything else.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|Main actor, however is too predictable.  He is too easily emotional and reacts that way.  I know, it's the script for effect.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|enjoyed the way Hosseini wove the different families' stories together.  Not quite as good as the Kite Runner, though but better than the second book.
B000FC0ZAI|1.0|this was not what I expected  and it was a great disappointment so much so that I have no desire to see the movie
B0041D843M|5.0|For your dedication and sincere concern for your fellow man. Eliminating dairy has cured my painful arthritis and I am avoiding what little meat I had in my diet. I will be getting this book for all my loved ones.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The plotlines, new and old recurring characters, and mostly Sam and Dean, I mean Dean and Sam, pull it off week by week.  The pace is never too too high weeks in a row or too too intelectual (I mean, there is an aspect in each episode) weeks in a row unless its a two parter.  The beginning of some episodes I just gotta look away, for a sec, but I love the effects and the humour sometimes injected.  Sure do miss Bobby, though.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent is all I can say about the book. I can hardly wait to read the third book. Can hardly wait for the movie. Excellent.
0141345659|4.0|I had to read this for a school assignment and it was very good.  I enjoyed the book very much
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I like this author.  I have read several of his books.  The location is in North Carolina.  This was a very good 'plot'!!  That is all of my review.
B00821OX98|5.0|I think this is the best post-apocalyptic show on TV these days. The Walking Dead is a good show, but it takes a very dark, pessimistic view of human nature. This show is more optimistic. It acknowledges that human nature contains evil, but it gives you hope that even with the destruction of society there are things (family, brotherhood, sisterhood, etc.) worth fighting above and beyond mere survival. It is more entertaining and fulfilling to watch these characters strive to maintain their humanity than to watch the characters on the Walking Dead lose theirs.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|The best game on here I swear I love it so cool then Whidbey better then the rest strait up awesomeness
B000PDYVVG|4.0|A little long, but so endearing to live her adventure & see her grow, bloom & find the love she deserved - within herself!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very well put together game like it a lot.has good graph on the game,and a lot of different types of challenges.I love the scene,where it take you to different parts of the world you may have never been.keep up the good work
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Interesting series, full if twists and turns.  The first episode is a bit confusing, but if you keep watching everything becomes clear.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is fun, takes a while to get good armour but the game is fun none the less. Iron man is such a great marvel character.
0375413405|3.0|My mistake!! As all recipes are rather complicated and as the measurements are no good for the metric system, it stands useless in my bookcase.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|When this show was on F/X I never gave any thought to watch it, even though I always heard how good it was. Since its been on Prime I decided to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did . This is an excellent crime drama following the daily routine of dirty cop Vick Mackey and his unit. Very gritty and very in your face! I highly recommend!
1781162646|2.0|Buying this book of Stephen King was a very bad mistake. This is not his style, his genre and it was a big disappointment.<br />!!<br />A very slow book without any tension and with an even worse and predicted clue.
0345522478|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Hounded\\" and quickly went out and bought the next few in the series. Atticus, the last of the Druids, lives in an occult bookshop in Arizona, because if you can brew up immortality, you might as well spend your life somewhere sunny. He might look like your average tattooed Irishman with a talking dog named Oberon but he has hidden depths. He can shape shift, gets power from the earth and can wield a magical sword called Fragarach. An angry god, Aenghus &Oacute;g who has been hunting Atticus for centuries has finally tracked him down and he wants the sword. Cue dramatic music.<br /><br />Rather than limiting himself to just Celtic gods, Kevin Hearne has decided to make gods from all religions real, along with the usual vampires and werewolves. This can make the novel a bit daunting if you are not familiar with a variety of world religions and myths. Unfortunately Hearne info dumps quite a bit on you in the first few chapters to set the scene. Even if you get everything he throws your way, you have to grasp the concept that lots of goddesses have the hots for Atticus. Sure he is a tattooed Irishman with a talking dog named Oberon, can shape shift, gets power from the earth and can wield a magical sword but I don't really get the fascination, particularly as his attitude can be downright immature for a 2,100 year old. Oberon however is an absolute treat and contributes to the humour that litters the pages.<br /><br />Everyone in this novel has an ulterior motive, including Oberon who wants sausages and French poodles. Atticus is crossed and double-crossed until he is cross (sorry, couldn't resist) by the gods, goddesses, witches and even the police force. The action scenes are entertaining and never really veer into gory territory. Atticus shows just how he was able to stay alive over the millennia through hacking and slashing with Fragarach and trickery. He has a highly tuned sense of paranoia and innate ability to build a support crew that will support him in life-threatening situations, not just because they care about him, but because he is one hell of a negotiator. The scenes with the witches read much a chess game with each side trying to work out how to exploit their opponent's weaknesses. In this sense the witches are at a disadvantage because they are so much younger than Atticus, they couldn't hope to have his experience. Hearne emphasises over and over the limitations of Atticus e.g. has to have his feet on the earth to draw its power etc. but we never really feel that Atticus will emerge as anything other than the victor.<br /><br />\\"Hounded\\" is not without minor problems but the sophisticated world building, witty banter, effective characterisation and lively action scenes make it a rollicking good read.t him in life-threatening situations, not just because they care about him, but because he is one hell of a negotiator.

B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Too dark, and how does anybody really know what was said! Was I suppose to think this was a true story?????
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|The film  was extremely well done.  I watched it with my teen-aged granddaughter and we were glued to our seats.  I am in charge of the Saturday movies in a retirement home and plan on showing it in early Sept.
0374214913|4.0|but I found myself reading out loud from it. Captures a certain sensibility perfectly. It was fun. The story worked. I have recommended it to many readers I know in their 20's.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Great show, excellent actors. Love the guest stars, and trying to figure out where I've seen them before. Still fresh and interesting.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|One of the few shows we found we waited for each week. We don't watch a lot of tv but my husband and I organized our schedules around both being home and awake to see this. I really like the Aidan Quinn  and the cops.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Perfect amount of challenging and fun!  very creative puzzles, good brain workout. I finished all 10 levels, cant wait for an update with more levels!!!!
B004HD61KE|5.0|This novel kept me super entertained. I couldn't put it down! Great characters, plot and thrill. I'm never disappointed in his novels.
0375851569|5.0|Another Like New Being Like New. Now a spot on it. Saved myself some nice dollars on what I have to admit EVERY baby should have!!! Imho. Great Seller!
B0034G4P94|5.0|It's about brotherhood, fatherhood love and redemption. The fighting is just the background for this wonderful, sad story. All of the movie is superb but two scenes really stand out. The first is when Hardy hugs and comforts Nolte in the hotel.<br /><br />The second, and I actually just noticed it, is in the final fight scene. As Edgerton is coming out of his corner in the final round and sees that Hardy is still ready to fight despite his injury, he holds his gloves up to his face and sobs. Just like a little kid would do. Fantastic acting.<br /><br />This is a movie for brothers and fathers.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I got this game for my kindle and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I only wish it was a bit more challenging so that I didn't get through it so quickly. Either way it was worth it.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Anyone calling this rap music must be 12 and have never really listen to any real rap music. I've been listening to Rap since late 80'. This album sounds like it took 10 minutes to write and produce. There is no music quality here any where you look, besides the last song which sounds like something from his first 3 albums. If you're looking for rap music then buy J Cole's 'Born Sinner' album, if you're looking for something that might make your ears bleed then go ahead and buy this thing called \\"Music.\\" This album is basically Homicide to both Hip-Hop and Pop music. If I could give this album negative stars I would.<br /><br />0/5 stars
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Could not wait for this to come in the mail. We have enjoyed this entire series, and am very sad that this is the finial one.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Keeps your interest through the book. I Have bought more of his books because of the way he writes, There are still good writer out there.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book was published many years ago.  I can't believe I never read it before.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, the time period, the family struggles etc.
B008MZWJCC|5.0|Joy Division basically has two records: Unknown Pleasures and Closer. Unknown Pleasures is an undeniable classic and has the iconic album art, but Closer is an unabashedly brilliant and emotional record that leaves me in awe with every listen. It is the best thing that Joy Division ever did. If you are a fan of New Order or Joy Division, then this is a must.
B000FC146C|5.0|In my opinion, this is a classic.  Read the book many years ago.  Then watched the mini-series and it portrayed many events in a new light.  Had to have it on my Kindle to reread it.  Enjoyed it all over again.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Just funny....love the characters. Well-written. Guilty pleasure of mine. Takes me back to high school days, the good and the bad.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Quite simply one of the best works of modern fiction ever written. Vonnegut at his absolute best, which is truly saying something considering his list of literary accomplishments.
0545265355|5.0|This is a very engaging story.  It adds a lot of depth to the movie.  I read the entire series in 4 days.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I became a fan in 2013 thanks to TNT. Showing the reruns got me hooked and so I wanted to start at the beginning because with this series-It all flows and has meaning. Thw writing is great and the offshoot of books  was a great addition to help one enjoy the show even more.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|i liked the movie alot the complete story to the wizard of oz and i plan to purchase it soon!
0786891416|3.0|This book -based off the TV series Castle.<br />Castle is the writer who teams up with a beatiful NYPD cop so he can do research for a new character he has invisioned.<br />This book is the 1st book from that research.<br />While  the story-written by a ghost writer is not a bad start-if I wasn't a fan of the show already- not sure if I would have purchase the second book.<br />The story itself is good and enjoyable and many Castle fans will like it -provided they understand that it is a &#34;story&#34; based off what the &#34;writer created&#34; from cases that he was on with Backett. The history of Beckett is a bit different than the show -because it has to be. If you are a fan you will enjoy it. If you like a good who done it..this in a good selection.
B00DJW0OBQ|1.0|This is a long book and you don't want to put up with the terrible formatting, spelling, etc.  I uploaded a picture of one page of this book.  Take a look.<br /><br />I then purchased \\"Pride and Prejudice (Illustrated Edition) by Jane Austen, Charles Edmund Brock and George Saintsbury (Jun 26, 2013) - Kindle eBook\\" for an extra dollar and everything is as it should be.  Wonderful illustrations are a plus too!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|This season makes the fan either so darn mad at Castle or mad at Kate or both for that matter. I guess it depends on how you accept the story. There is no need for a spoiler alert-because I will simply say-if your a fan-you got to have the series IN YOUR VIDEO LIBRARY.
B00B78AIV0|5.0|I loved this book. Will be reading more from this author. I felt I was there in Nigeria with her the whole time.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|iT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU WATCH THE RERUNS ON TNT<br />TO TRULY UNDERSTAND AND ENJOY THIS SHOW- YOU NEED TO HAVE THE WHOLE SERIES TO GO BACK AND WATCH ANYTIME THE MOOD HITS...WHICH FOR ME IS OFTEN.
B001JI8IJW|5.0|Some movies get better with age - just like the two main actors of this splendid thriller, Robert Redford (now 77) and Brad Pitt (now 50). SPY GAME as written by Michael Frost Beckner and David Arata and directed with distinction by Tony Scott reminds us how thrilling films of this ilk can be without the need for computer generated aliens, or vampires, or werewolves, or zombies or outrageous extraterrestrial effects, etc. The dialogue is smart, balanced with humor when appropriate, and played with a fine assemblage of actors who know how to terrify us simply by telling a visual story.<br /><br />CIA operative Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) is on the brink of retirement when he finds out that his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) has been arrested in China for espionage. No stranger to the machinations of the CIA's top echelon, Muir hones all his skills and irreverent manner in order to find a way to free Bishop. As he embarks on his mission to free Bishop, Muir recalls how he recruited and trained the young rookie, at that time a sergeant in Vietnam, their turbulent times together as operatives and the woman who threatened their friendship. There is of course the requisite female agent (Catherine McCormack), a top member of the CIA (Stephen Dillane) who allows us to see how corrupt that organization can be, and the ever grounded secretary (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) to remind us that the people involved in this world wide intrigue are really just human beings - even if they misbehave in their jobs.<br /><br />Made in 2001 this film remains a skillful winner - just the ticket for watching in the stifling heat of summer time.  And it is such a pleasure to watch the magic that Redford and Pitt weave. Highly recommended and it is so VERY timely in 2013! Grady Harp, June 13
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I used to play the card game when I was a kid and this is the perfect nostalgic pocket game version fix I have been looking for. :-)
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Brisingr is the perfect mix of action,adventure,drama,and comedy. I would recommend this book to anybody who read Eragon or Eldest, or people who have read Harry Potter.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The entire &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; series is terrific!  I can hardly wait for the new season to come out this coming winter.  I enjoy watching English dramas so much more than American.  They make more sense and do not have all the foolishness of violence and bad langugage.  Always uplifting and don't leave a bad taste in your mouth.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|This new movie about Superman turned out to be very good. You are able to review the history of our hero and it is very good. YThe action begins on<br />Krypton. Here Superman's father Jorel is played by Russell Crowe. He3 launches the baby Superman to a journey on Earth. Here his earth father is Kevin Costner. He plays his role very effectively. You are taken through his teenage years and into an adult. Another good role is Lois Lane. She encounters<br />Superman in a frozen wasteland. This is also where he encounters his father (Russell Crowe) for the first time. Lois experiences his super powers and<br />begins tracing down his past.It is not long before she is able to establish his identity. Another big role in this movie is General Zod. He actually has a cause and a mission for coming to earth. He is attempting to locate the core that will allow Krypton to be restored. Unknown to Zod the core has been<br />placed in Superman's body by Jorel. Superman and General have a vicious fight. An action ending. Be sure to see this movie.
B00AAI7B7W|4.0|The movie is one of the all time horror films.Some may not see it as a film but it is. The acting was great and done very well. I would say that every one who likes this kind of film would enjoy it.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I am surprised by how much I like this show.  It is really really good.  I am not sure how ong that can keep the suspense at this llevel, but it is real fun right now.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Kite Runner was so intense in its emotion and the depth of the human struggle it described that I still have not read Land of a Thousand Sun's.  The blurb describing this book's theme helped me decide to go for it. It was a delicately woven story of a family's growth and evolution over cultural, religious and generational expanses.  It was compelling and touched universal themes that affect any family pushing through a  changing culture where boundaries are profound and also change profoundly in a short period of time.  For my interest in the history as well as the humanity, I was moved as I hope an author will move me each time I take up a new book.  Very fine writing.  Thousand Sun's will my next.
B00CRW2066|5.0|I have never listened to their albums much, so when I listened to this album and loved it I searched out their other stuff.  It is all really good.  It is like I found a new band to love that is not new at all.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I thought the trilogy was fantastic with just enough hi-tech and physical combat to be believable. The drama of each movie kept me in suspence and returning for more.<br /><br />I was concerned when I learned Matt Damon wasn't scripted to be in the latest Jason Bourne film.  I needn't have worried Jeremy Renner is magnificent in the role.  The movie is as action pacted as I have come to love.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Truly enjoyed this story.  A great read for all Nicholas Sparks fans.  A little different than most of his books but still an excellent love story.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|My son and I buy DVDs and watch the series together. It's our evening activity many nights. This one is very entertaining. Great acting, interesting special effects. Funny and serious with an interestingly accurate representation of a lot of the arcane lore.
0061950726|4.0|Well written and true to the facts as we know them-it added another perspective to an interesting period in history.
B004PHSTY8|5.0|My son and I buy DVDs and watch the series together. It's our evening activity many nights. This one is very entertaining. Great acting, interesting special effects. Funny and serious with an interestingly accurate representation of a lot of the arcane lore.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game but such a pain in the butt. Really makes you think. And just when you think you've got something figured out, think again because you've probably missed something.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|My son and I buy DVDs and watch the series together. It's our evening activity many nights. This one is very entertaining. Great acting, interesting special effects. Funny and serious with an interestingly accurate representation of a lot of the arcane lore.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read the first two books and waited a year for this one. Couldn't wait to get to the end and see how Gidion and Eva resolve their issues. Then to find there's more to come! It is a great story and I want to see how it all concludes but now have to put it aside for probably another year. Then, I hope, it will be the last. At 71 years old, I really don't like wondering if I'll get to read the whole story. I will not buy another series again unless I can get the whole set at once.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the options you get in picking the kind of game you want to play.  On a bad day you can select a winning deal...  I don't mind the pop ups - it's a small price you pay for getting a free game.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark is still one of the best. She can weave a story that really keeps you on the edge of the seat and this is one of them. Very good story.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan has truly outdone himself with his third book of the heroes of Olympus. This book kept me on the edge of my seat and made it hard for me to put it down. Rick made me wanting more with the ending, almost making it a sure thing that his fourth book will be sold. Lots of adventure, suspense, and action. This is a must have for any Rick Riordan fan.

B00BWGL6BS|5.0|When it comes to ethereal adult alternative music, the two staples have been Sarah McLachlan and Dido.  The latest entry from these two is Dido's Girl Who Got Away.  Some albums I can size up quickly while others take me a while to process.  This one falls into the latter category.<br /><br />Of Dido's four albums, Girl Who Got Away leans the heaviest toward R&B.  This is most evident on \\"Let Us Move On\\" where Kendrick Lamar makes a guest appearance.  However, \\"Blackbird\\", \\"End Of Night\\", and um, let's say track #7, also have similar qualities.  The R&B slant was not across the board, however.  Some tracks have a sparser feel to them such as \\"Sitting On Top Of The World\\", \\"Happy New Year\\", and \\"Day Before We Went To War\\".<br /><br />While the style may have some different nuances, there is a common feel to the songs.  Some, such as \\"No Freedom\\", \\"Let Us Move On\\", \\"Blackbird\\", \\"Happy New Year\\", and \\"Loveless Hearts\\" deal with love gone wrong or lost.  For example, \\"No Freedom\\" has the line \\"By the look in your eyes I can tell/You Don't think I'll be back for more.\\" while \\"Blackbird\\" has \\"Why do I bring you love/When all you give me back is pain?\\".The overall album leaves me with a sense of melancholy, and it is one that I listen to when I want to unwind or when I am going to sleep.<br /><br />Girl Who Got Away is another great album from Dido, and I highly recommend it to old and new fans alike.<br /><br />Download this:  No Freedom
B006WAIV6M|4.0|The author has captured the concept of Cue-Routine-Reward very well, and almost the whole book is devoted to demonstrating the various shades this concept takes in personal, corporate & social settings. For me, the real gain came in the final pages of the book where the author details a framework to reprogram habits. It would be almost impossible to appreciate the workings of this framework unless the Cue-Routine-Reward concept is clearly understood; and all the material in the book, before this part, helps in achieving that.<br />Since the examples are very detailed, I did get a bit bored in the initial part of the book. However, I'm glad that I hung on till the end. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I understood this concept when I started analysing my habits based on the framework explained by the author. As the author explains, each habit is different and there are no pre-set formulas. However, reading this book will give you an understanding of how your habits emerge, where to look for &#34;cues&#34; and in the end, create your own program to change a habit.

The writing itself is top quality and the production is excellent.

And if you like western's and / or martial arts films, you might get into this film as well. Plenty of shootouts and some pretty impressive hand-to-hand exchanges as well. It's a good story that uses the setting of an aftermath world quite well. Cinematography and effects are spectacular with lots of epic shots that really pull you into this world and wow your imagination with beautiful scenic visuals.

1250004217|5.0|For the life of me, I can't remember when or how I first heard about \\"Sarah's Key\\". I am so glad I did, though, because over the last twenty-four hours, this book has held me in its rapture.<br /><br />Julia Jarmond is an American journalist living and working in Paris when, in 2002, she is assigned the topic of the Vel' d'Hiv', something she knows nothing about. On July 16, 1942, French police rounded up thousands of Jews, kept them in a bicycling stadium (the Velodrome d'Hiver in Paris) before they were sent to Auschwitz and gassed. Of those taken, over four thousand were children under the age of twelve, and not one of those children came back after the war. Julia becomes obsessed with the story, horrified that she not only had no previous knowlege of the events, but dismayed that her French family and friends not only are unaware but also don't seem to care.<br /><br />At the same time, her architect husband, Bertrand, is renovating his grandmother's apartment. Julia learns that the apartment came into the family in late July 1942 after a Jewish family that had been living there \\"disappeared\\". Given the dates, she concludes that the family was part of the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup and endeavours to find out what happened to them. Who were they? Records show the deaths of two parents, but their daughter - Sarah - remains strangely unaccounted for. Did she escape the concentration camps? What became of her? And what is the horrible secret her father-in-law and his mother are terrified of her finding out?<br /><br />The more Julia is determined to know about little Sarah and all of those who were killed in the roundup, the more she realizes that the past is, truly, important, even when those who should care would prefer to be left in the dark.<br /><br />It has been quite some time since I read something that will stay with me for as long as I expect \\"Sarah's Key\\" to. It's beautiful, poignant, horribly sad yet at the same time powerful.

B001HADE00|5.0|My first trip to LA was in the summer of '84.  Mom rented me a car and I drove around the entire LA area for days. \\"Round n Round\\" was constantly playing among the other great songs from that summer.  It was a magical trip for me and this Ratt song was the soundtrack for it.  Came home, bought the album and the entire thing was great!  I still play the cd version before hitting the gym with a starbucks iced coffee.  Still gets me pumped!<br /><br />The only negative of the recording is that the high end/treble must have been on set on 11.  I still get ear fatigue from listening to it at hi volume. Some flat areas in the guitar at points, where it hits the ceiling. Still, its a phenomenal hair album that i would strongly recommend!
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Critics say that there has been a falling off of Le Carre's books since the Smiley novels. That may be the case, but there are still fresh insights and turns of plot left in the old master's bag of tricks. \\"A Delicate Truth\\" brings out a side of the author he had not previously sufficiently exploited. The book gives a very well crafted sense of Great Britain itself, rather than of some far off place, even though he opens with a very deft portrayal of an operation in Gibraltar. I won't give away the settings because discovering them is part of the fun. I will say the reader earns a sense of British character, of its customs, of its elevated reaches, of its pop culture, and of much else that in Le Carre's mind, makes England worth fighting for. Another criticism of Le Carre is that his political opinions are too politically correct. I thought that marred his books on terrorism and arms dealing, but this one does not go far beyond the headlines about what is the relationship between British and American intelligence people. Most of all, Le Carre delivers such a good read, his action just moving along so that a reader can get through the book in one long sitting, that Le Carre earns a reputation for not being a serious novelist, which means that he does not get bogged down in his own insights. Le Carre is an old fashioned novelist because it is the plot that carries the reader along. A nice job by the old man.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great character development.  Season One begins with the sinking of the Titanic and how it impacts a titled family in England.  Through the seasons, you get to know the characters and they almost seem real.  We see their strengths, their weaknesses, and their insecurities.  By the end of Season 3 you begin to have a soft spot for characters that you have grown to dislike and you have to say goodbye to a favorite or two.  Worth watching for sure and I prefer to watch it on Prime...no commercials. I cannot wait for Season 4 to be released.

0199603235|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1NTWP8IQF6L0Z]]TO `A SERIOUS AND DIFFICULT AREA OF THE LAW'<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />In the words of the author Karon Monaghan, The Equality Act 2010 (EA2010) `is the principal subject matter of this book'-- and a startlingly and formidably wide-ranging subject it is.<br /><br />Whether you are a practitioner, academic or general reader, anyone wishing to gain an in-depth understanding of this pivotal piece of legislation would do well to acquire this thorough and scholarly text published recently by the Oxford University Press.  Yes, it is a reference book and a seriously analytical one too.  But the nature of the subject which affects us all is compelling. Be warned that once you delve into it in search of a reference, you may not be able to put it down.<br /><br />As pointed out in the book's introduction, the EA 2010 is not all that necessarily revolutionary, but `does reflect a gradual and progressive shift in the legislative approach to addressing discrimination and more particularly inequality.'  Moreover, the Act will doubtless have historical impact as well as cross-jurisdictional reach.<br /><br />The Explanatory Notes to the EA 2010 describe its two main purposes, namely `to harmonise discrimination law and to strengthen the law to support progress on equality.'  What is not widely known about the EA 2010 is that it repeals and revokes, not quite, but almost all preceding equality legislation dating from the 1970s onward.  Specifically, there are nine pieces to this legislation, the chronology of which is most interesting.<br /><br />Between the enactment of the Equal Pay Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Race Relations Act in 1970, 1975 and 1976 respectively, there was a nineteen year gap before the Disability Discrimination Act came into force in 1995.  Another eight years elapsed before five further pieces of legislation were enacted in 2003, 2006 and finally, 2007 with the advent of the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation Regulation).  Equality - and there are a number of definitions and interpretations of it outlined in the text - has undergone a lengthy gestation period - which extends of course, much further back than 1970.<br /><br />In this volume of almost 800 pages Monaghan has endeavored to cover some of the historical as well as contemporary issues pertaining to the EA 2010 and also has considered to a limited extent some comparative law.  Prior to discussing the key concepts of protected characteristics and prohibited conduct in Part II of the book, Part I provides an interpretation of the Act as well as an historical overview.  Part III focuses on unlawful acts and enforcement, while Part IV examines strategic action, statutory duties and the Equality and Human Rights Commission.<br /><br />Copiously footnoted, the book offers researchers a rich reservoir of research tools and resources, including over sixty pages of tables of cases, legislation and treaties and conventions.  The detailed table of contents and lengthy index at the back neatly aid navigation throughout.<br />In all, this is a comprehensive and exceptionally valuable text on what Baroness Brenda Hale refers to in the Foreword as `a serious and difficult area of law'.  The publication date is cited as at December 2012.inally, 2007 with the advent of the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation Regulation).

B001IFZTDE|5.0|No need to write about how magnificent this album is. I'm here to write about the 4 LP vinyl box set. I'm extremely satisfied with it, and I was worried about it with all the spotty reviews of the 2 LP reissues of this album. The sound is incredible, the packaging is great, the LPs are clean, scratch-free. If you like this album and want to find the best presentation of it out there, buy the box set while you still can!<br /><br />NOTE: My 4 LP box set is the Universal Recording Group edition. It is NOT the Warner Bros. release. Mine was still released in 2008.

1846611350|5.0|A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR PRACTITIONERS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Always a sensitive issue, personal insolvency can and does touch on so many different areas of law.  Recently published by Jordans this book, in the words of its expert authors, is `a composite of, inter alia, property law, equity, finance law, securities and family law'.<br /><br />Usefully for the practitioner, the three authors, from three different specialties, write from three different viewpoints.  One is an insolvency law practitioner and another is an accountant with one of the big four accountancy firms and the third is a specialist academic in this field. All of which renders the book as practical as it is scholarly and purpose designed for ease of use.<br /><br />The result is a wide far ranging, insightful and succinct treatment of this vexed subject, written to provide expert guidance on the various insolvency procedures in force in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  To this end, the relevant issues -- bankruptcy, individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs) Debt Relief Orders (DROs) County Court Administration Orders and Deeds of Arrangement -- are also carefully examined.<br /><br />Interestingly, as the publishers note, the book approaches this variously complicated subject from the point of view of the over-indebted individual and therefore takes what we would call a solution-based and ultimately helpful approach to problem solving in the area of personal debt.  Indeed the first five chapters examine personal debt in detail, discussing the various solutions that may be available to the debtor.<br /><br />Other key aspects of the personal insolvency landscape are discussed such as the key players and the assets that may be used to discharge all or part of a debt.  The practitioner pressed for time should also note that the book provides all materials required by accountants. The appendices contain, for example, a statutory framework reference guide to locating current statutory instruments.<br /><br />There are statutory forms too and a guide to the bankruptcy court structure.  Aids to navigation include a detailed table of contents and extensive index at the back, plus all the relevant tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments.<br /><br />And there you have it: a superlative and certainly authoritative reference resource for the insolvency practitioner in one handy volume -- ideal not only for practitioners, but for other advisers, as well as creditors and debtors.  If you are involved in insolvency matters you need this book.  The publication date is stated as at February 2013., a statutory framework reference guide to locating current statutory instruments.<br /><br />There are statutory forms too and a guide to the bankruptcy court structure.

0307341577|5.0|Dark Places was SO good! I was immediately drawn into the story and remained alternately riveted and frustrated throughout, but never once bored. Frustrated because I could not make up my mind who I thought was actually responsible for the \\"The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas\\" and riveted because this story was disturbing, heartbreaking, suspenseful, and altogether incredible.<br /><br />The audio narration by Rebecca Lowman, Cassandra Campbell, Mark Deakins, and Robertson Dean was flawless, giving depth to the multiple perspectives as they alternated throughout the story. I think that it's easier to process a book that so often switches perspective and alternates between past and present when listened to on audio with multiple narrators. I highly recommend the Audible version to anyone considering reading Dark Places.<br /><br />While the story itself was fascinating, revolving around a family's massacre in a small farm town, what really grabbed me was Libby's character. She was understandably damaged by the traumatic events she witnessed at such a young age and now, as an adult, she finds it difficult to function as anything like a \\"normal\\" adult. She sees herself as separated from society and unable to connect with just about anyone. I could relate to so many aspects of Libby's personality, as I'm sure anyone with any kind of \\"difficult\\" childhood could. I believe it was extremely perceptive of the author to present Libby as such a dysfunctional character because it felt authentic and I absolutely fell in love with her.<br /><br />I had a few very minute issues with the story. Some of the other characters I felt were a bit less dynamic and more one dimensional, such as Libby's brother Ben. His character, as well as his relationship with his girlfriend, was awkward and difficult for me to understand which didn't always work for me in the story. Also, the ending, while I didn't see it coming, was pretty far fetched and didn't feel exactly plausible. However, I would much rather read an exciting yet over the top ending than an ending that is anti-climactic. All in all, any flaws were so small as to be nearly insignificant when compared to how fascinating this story was.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to any fans of crime, suspense, and/or thrillers. I would be interested to see this made into a movie. I think this story would translate well to film.would much rather read an exciting yet over the top ending than an ending that is anti-climactic.

Refreshing,as we have had to move away from the cold war movie days, and this movie is a great reminder that these possibilities were real and true.<br /><br />I have a friend that was from the \\"cold war era\\" and he was on a sub for his 20 year career and he said that they would actually go into the Russian ports, underneath the Russian ships and because it was a nuclear sub, they were undetected and that there were times when things were lined up and all they had to do was wait for the word and WW!!! would have been a reality.

B00AH8U3UC|5.0|I love the dialogue and the freedom to really express what everyone is seeing, feeling and thinking...kudos to the writers and I love it, thank God for cable TV.<br /><br />As for who should be watching Californication 5, to have seen the previous 4 seasons would be a great help.<br /><br />Hank remains to be everywhere at once and it seems that even on an innocent airplane ride he sits next to the the very chick that is the love lady of the guy that he has gone to California to write for, only Hank...<br />I have loved the entire series and my heart is always with &#34;the Hankster&#34; because no matter which way he turns there is always an adventure.<br /><br />I admire and love him for the unconditional love that he always shows for his daughter, Becca, the love and hugs seem truly genuine.<br /><br />Season 5 is a winner and all of the characters in the season are great and diversified, I also see faces from shows from other genres and it is great to see that they are still gainfully employed.<br /><br />Very entertaining, always a laugh and the language whether slang or the King's English is perfect and delightful.<br /><br />Great series....keep 'm coming !!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome. love this app. challenging but not impossible. got stuck but then figured it out. can't wait for more levels.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Easy to download and setup to use.  Very helpful allowing me to download Google Chrome Beta too.  Now I can run more web sites than with just Silk alone.  ES File was key to making that possible.  A nice change since Silk does not play any Flash formats.
B00932A4XE|5.0|The movie is Very funny and enjoyable but is heart wrenching as well. I dont recommend watching it while someone is pregnant, your hormones may get to you!
0393340244|5.0|I love this book. It is intellectually stimulating and cuts through a ton of the gender-based silliness in books like \\"Mars and Venus.\\" I've never met Cordelia Fine (the author), but she's exactly the sort of scientist and writer that makes me proud of the work of real scientists. Bravo! John Sommers-Flanagan, author of 8 books, including: [[ASIN:1118390113 Clinical Interviewing: 2012-2013 Update]]
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I would defiantly rate the book five stars. It was so thrilling and had so many different twists and turns. There was nothing that I didn't like about this book and I defiantly didn't see what happened to Link at the end coming. If you like books that have twists and turns, romance, magic, and suspense involved this is the perfect book for you. And don't forget to read all the other books in this thrilling series. I hope all of you love this series as much as I did.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So simple, yet so handy. Thanks for keeping it free with unobtrusive ads. I'll make time to follow some since Amazon was thoughtful enough to consider the end user.
1469220725|4.0|I have been a huge fan of the Crossfire series ever since I first read Bared to You so it feels like I had to wait forever for Entwined with You to finally be released. Gideon and Eva are my favourite dysfunctional couple and I have to admit to having a huge crush on Gideon so I was excited to spend more time with them both. I was a bit nervous when I discovered that the series had been extended from the trilogy originally planned into a five book series though, I was worried that there wouldn't be enough story to fill that many books and that we'd end up with a couple of filler books. It remains to be seen how much there is to learn in the next two books but I enjoyed this latest instalment and will be at the front of the queue for Captivated by You when it is released.<br /><br />In the previous book we saw exactly how far Gideon is prepared to go to keep Eva safe but now he is facing the fallout. Not only does he have to try and come to terms with what he did but he also has to make sure nothing can be pinned on him and he can only hope that it doesn't change the way Eva looks at him. He is pushed into taking extreme measures to keep his secret and it shows just how far his and Eva's relationship has progressed when she is able to trust him no matter how bad things look. Their relationship still isn't perfect by a long shot but things are better than they ever have been. I really want to see the pair of them talk to each other more rather than constantly using sex as a way of communicating but it was good to see them start to get a handle on their jealousy issues and have a little faith in each other.<br /><br />One thing I think I missed was the conflict that was so prevalent in previous books, there are things that happen that could have added more drama to the story but on the whole they were handled much more quickly and with a lot less stress than before. This is partly because of the growth that both Gideon and Eva have gone through but it does make for a less dramatic read and lets face it one of the reasons we love this couple so much is because of the drama! I never thought I'd hear myself say this (especially about an erotic romance novel) but I actually reached the point where I started to get bored of the constant sex scenes. As you'd expect from Sylvia Day the scenes were all well written and incredibly hot but there are only so many ways to describe inserting tab A into slot B before it starts to get a little repetitive. Gideon is still one of the sexiest literary heroes I've come across so I don't want to lose the sex scenes completely but I'm hoping to see a little less of them in the next book and I'd love more focus to be on the couple spending time together outside of the bedroom.<br /><br />I was really pleased that we have finally started to learn a little more about Gideon's past, we are still left with plenty of questions about what happened to cause his nightmares but it was nice to get a few answers. I found myself getting incredibly annoyed with his mother in this book which surprised me because she has always seemed so nice before. Her attitude and behaviour was completely out of order this time around so it was nice to see Eva stand up for her man. I'm hoping for some kind of showdown with Eva's mother in the future too because she is driving me crazy with the way she stalks Eva, the way that everyone just panders to her only makes her behaviour worse. Then you have the side story with Cary that shocked me and made me want to shake some sense into him! I still can't quite believe what he's got himself mixed up in this time and I'm really hoping that he sorts himself out soon.<br /><br />Although Entwined with You wasn't my favourite book in the series it was still a great book and I'm happy to have had my much needed Gideon fix. I'm glad that the story didn't end with a huge cliffhanger so as much as I'm looking forward to the next instalment I'm not quite as desperate to get my hands on it as Iwas this one. It will be interesting to see what the future holds for Gideon and Eva and I find myself feeling happy that we have another 2 books to look forward to.was this one. It will be interesting to see what the future holds for Gideon and Eva and I find myself feeling happy that we have another 2 books to look forward to.
B00466HM28|5.0|Fairly durable, nice portability (shorter than LPK) and incredibly light weight; extra pads are great. Plug in and ready to jam.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I finished the book in just over a day. It's a really great read. I especially love how the story was told from many different points of view as It went on. That had a clever effect on the book. It was an easy read for the most part so I would recommend it to basically anyone. Those who love a happy ending with some twists inside should read this book.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|The writer developed the characters in a way that made you care for the heroes as well as those you initially perceived as villains. We watch the young people mature, appreciate the wisdom and follies of the elders and appreciate the challenges of the times. The stories are a skillful blend of humor and pathos. Well acted, directed and produced.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|So cool a real chick flick, good for the young, and good for the young at heart! I very much enjoyed all the books and movies!
B005VPXNV2|3.0|Movie was okay. I watch movie for the second time (the last time was when it was produce). I enjoy watching being I have gotten some movie scenes.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|A little slow moving, but the acting was very good. I did enjoy the story line and would recommend it for a for anyone looking for a nice evenings movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this App, use it all the time. It is exactly what I was looking for and needed. I recommend it to anyone.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Good read about a interesting adventure. It is a funny and heart warming story that is also realistic. Cheryl Strayed is living life.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is very well designed.  It gradually increases in difficulty as you move about the map, gaining experience and more powerful equipment/skills.  Choosing to improve items triggers various length time delays, which keeps you hooked into playing 'just a little longer' as you wait for the improvements to finish.  Of course, you can also always finish an improvement instantly, if you want to spend some gems, which is how they make money.  But you have complete control and game play is not affected by whether you choose to spend gems or wait.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|I normally buy all of JT's music.  I guess probably because I grew up to Nsync and then JT working with the top people in the music business.  Some of the songs are &#34;eh&#34;, but I expected that.  Either way, it is a good 20/20 Experience.  Lol.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have this app on my Android phone and wanted it on my Kindle also. I find it very convenient while traveling to have the Weather Channel on Kindle...no switching devices for weather info while at the pool or at a sightseeing venue.
B001NHNG64|5.0|one of the best books I've read!  I could've believe Reacher would live through this one.<br />the fifth Jack Reacher I've read.
B001VU1NJ0|4.0|I really liked this movie, I wanted to see it when it came out to the shows at 1st and wasn't able, so glad it was offered on amazon.<br />It was suspensful and I like all the characters in the movie.  I really couldn't guess &#34;who did it&#34; until the end.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Every women should read this book. She is both hilarious and thought provoking, covering all aspects of what society expects of us, and what we should expect of ourselves.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a good app for children that live on a farm because they could learn how to take care of their horse or horses.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this.  The sounds are wonderful.  My suggestion is a timer that would go through the different binaurals (presleep, dreams, dreamless, dreams, deep meditation) during a night as a series.  Either an automatic series or a kind of playlist the user can set up (this noise for this long, then that noise for that long, etc.)
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love puzzels and finding puzzles on my kindle is great. Plus you can pick your picture and how many pieces you want. This is great. And as a bonous yoy dont have to worry about losing pieces.lol. my only issue is sometimes a few of the pieces are dark and kinda hard for me to see. Its usually the darker pictures i have this problem with. But i love it anyway and the best part is its free
B000002IOY|5.0|For some reason, I was never that much into Overkill during the 80's. I guess<br />it's because I never gave them a fair chance. A friend of mine wanted to go see<br />Testament and Overkill in our town. I was skeptical about going because Testament<br />was the only band that I was familiar with. After seeing Overkill live, I got<br />on Amazon the very next day and ordered 2 of their cd's and \\"Years of Decay\\" was<br />one of them. Within a few months later I have almost all of their albums and this<br />one by far is their BEST. I like their sound, their style, and the vocals. This is<br />a Thrash Masterpiece that I would put up there with Metallica - Master of Puppets<br />and Megadeth - Rust In Piece. If you have any Overkill albums and this isn't one of<br />them, then WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ?  You will love this album and you'll find yourself<br />playing it over and over and over.........
B0086700CM|4.0|It took me awhile to get the hang of this game. I do like it and now that ive got the hang of it it is fun. It does take awhile to earn enough money to buy upgrades though. This is great way to kill time and keeps you alert. I.again its free. Why not give it a try
B0091WNK8M|5.0|I grew up watching this GREAT movie & enjoy watching it with my kiddos. Especially on my kindle fire HD the quality is better then seeing it in the theater when it originally came out!

B009MYARIK|4.0|This was my first Sophie Kinsella book. A very enjoyable read. Light and sexy. A bit unbelievable but a  great beach book.
B000003N89|5.0|This is Dianna Krall at her best.  The piano, style and voice are alive.  They respect the classical interpretations, but they are hers.  These songs will ring in your ears afterwards.  You'll be wanting some \\"frim fram sauce ... with she fafa on the side\\".
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game, but I have had to delete and re-install it twice. I love playing it, but I hate starting over. this is aggravating and horrible. why does it do this?!?!?!
0307950689|2.0|A mediocre book by a great author. I loved his Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. Digital Fortress and Deception points were disappointing for me. This book is in the middle.<br /><br />It does a good job of capturing your attention in first few pages. It does a good job of keeping the interest. But in the end when the secret is revealed, I was left wondering whether it was something substantial.<br /><br />Mr. Brown repeats a lot. Five hundred and nine pages filled with repetition. His style is good so one doesn't get bored much, but after all how many times can one read the same thing?<br /><br />The book is about a lunatic seeking a Masonic pyramid. He kidnaps the head of Smithsonian Institution and blackmails his way around to get what he wants. CIA gets involved. The reason for their involvement is revealed towards the end of the book. To me it appeared so flimsy that I chose that disappointment to be the title of my review.<br /><br />A secret is revealed in the end. Alert readers would be able to anticipate it. I wont spoil if for those who have not read the book.<br /><br />I don't have the patience to go back and pinpoint exactly where, but several places things don't add up. The author describes an inevitable event but later reverts it by giving some explanation. Almost like Tom Cruise's method of using mask in his Mission Impossible movies. They lead the reader into thinking something and then conveniently change the course by some explanation.<br /><br />In the end the book drags on. Story ends several pages before the end of the book. Last few pages were the hardest to read.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is the second time I have watched this series and I have enjoyed it even more the second time. I love period pieces especially those of Britain. There is something about the clothing, the cadance of their speech, the restraint of love and the heartache of unrequited passion that draws me near to these types of works. It is fun entertainment for the whole family.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love Games, and this one is one good game to play...I play against some of my friends, and they are hard to beat, very good game...play it every day and sometimes more, I just try to be #1...and it is not easy to get there. The tournament is the best one...
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I could not find instructions or rules so I sent it back.  I have played a little and could not understand it
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good game to play, I think it really needs a little more action..but it goes by pretty fast and a simple game to play.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|It was all I expected and more...As a girl who read the books as a child, I was happy to see some different elements.  Want to make me more happy?  Read the books, and see what the happens in in the real books....
B008YRVW0I|4.0|So far it's a fun game.  It goes very fast.  It's worth the price. I would buy it as gain.  The graphics are fantastic.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|A really great series.  I can't wait for season 4 to come out.  This one left you hanging.  Hurry up with season 4
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Can´t stop listening to this album. There are nine heavy metal anthems and two instrumental pieces. Great to see my heroes return. Who else could create songs like Open Road or In this light? I missed those type of songs for years. Can´t wait for the next album. It´s just the beginning of a new era for the band. From: a brazilian fan.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|the story line is so funny... and true when you think about it... told everyone about this so they can watch it too.. once you start watching it you can not stop... I watch both 1st and 2nd season within three weeks... a must see!!!
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|I love Cirque Du Soleil. I saw many of their shows in Las Vegas. Some of them 5 times, for example KA. This compilation of their best shows or movie, because we can call it movie is fantastic. I'm waiting for more edition in Blue-Ray format.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Sorry to see this series end. Not sure that I found closure with the characters, but a little mystery is good I guess.
B009DH379C|4.0|Good music with fantastic Freddie Mercury. So sad, that we never hear his voice again live. But he will live in our memory.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved this book and had a hard time putting it down!  It keeps you guessing until the end and beyond!
B005V2S7FW|5.0|This app is the best and most reliable. Can't go wrong here. Easily hands down the best and most stable.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It took a while to figure out but turned out to be a great read I would suggest it for everyone
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Goonies is a classic, the movie is hilarious my 5 year old and I watched it and he liked the movie he's been repeating lines from the movie for a week now \\" do the truffle shuffle\\".
B00AM7E4LM|1.0|The reading lists the key ideas and provides examples for them. The ideas are simple and they are not useful for me. Only for me.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't stop reading over and over! One of the best adult series ever, well written, I can seriously imagine everything, like I'm watching it as a movie -- it's that easy to get lost in. READ IT!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Although my kids had no idea who most of the classic video characters where, nevertheless they still loved it. The movie could move a bit faster.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's really fun but when you get your multiplayer up to x30, it doesn't save so when you update the app, you have to earn the x30 back all over again.

B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Great movie
0007281196|5.0|Narrated by an ageing dog, this story is Not another &#34;Marley and Me&#34; type of book. The main character is a likeable guy's guy. He works hard, tries to take care of his family and do the right thing.  Failures, triumph, grief and despair, and hope are all observed from a dog's vantage in a believable, non- judgmental way. There are some hilarious moments, with spot on descriptions of every- day incidents that we can take for granted, but make us  oh - so - human.  Nice racing metaphors  and family strife keep it from getting too cute or weepy. There's enough going on to keep it flowing for a quick read or to be appreciated a few nights before bed.  You don't have to be a car racing fan or dog lover to appreciate the finer moments, but I think it would make the difference between rating it a very good read vs a great book.
B002VPE1WK|2.0|The bas was too small and looked cheaply made...it would not have worked for my purposes and was not suitable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters - and the acting - are all believable, even though of such disparate societal levels.  The photography is beautiful, and the evolution of the story and its players is subtle.  In addition, it's fascinating - and educational - from a historical viewpoint.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is fun and very useful when I need something to do!!!!!!!! I love to play this game with my friends and family. :)
B004N7977I|4.0|If you like spooky comic books you'll like this movie.  Without being too scary it's entertaining enough to hold interest, and be fun.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I expected a book telling me to lean in at the expense of my family from a woman with the resources to do so and still feel like she was giving enough all around. But instead I found a well round book - sensitive to women in every stage of life and empathetic to the struggles we all face. Sheryl provides great advice to women and unique insights from the boardroom - I highly recommend this book to all women!
B009MVM09W|5.0|I put this one on my Instant Video watchlist because I remembered the title and always wanted to see it.  I expected a thriller of Corporate intrigue and greed.  What I got was a delightfully absurd comedy!  The over-acting by Jennifer Jason Leigh has to be seen to be appreciated<br />A great movie that I'm sorry I didn't see sooner.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so good i reccomed it!!! Its good for lond trips and it changes every month to a new theme!! You can unlock cool boards and detailed characters!!! Its ALOT different then temple run... i would say its even better!! I am very satisfied with this app and I wont ever stop playing it :)
B00CRS88IO|3.0|Mr. Stevenson knows Ian Fleming inside and out.  That much is obvious.  Unfortunately, this novel got lost for all the research.  Every character's wardrobe is described down to the buttons and snaps.  Don't even begin to talk about insignia and medals! Fleming's life is dissected down to the number of cigarettes he smoked per day.  At times the research gets in the way.  For instance, after noting that Fleming's running records for the 1500 meter still stood at Eton when he entered the war, Mr. Stevenson then had him run 50 miles through terrain too mountainous for radio signals - in one night!  He knew his real life main character extremely well, but the novel suffered for the minutae.<br /><br />That having been said, this is James Bond with Ian Fleming being the super spy.  The plot puts Fleming in the English refugees fleeing from France, the negotiations to buy France's navy after the French capitulation and the destroying of a super weapon.  Pretty strong fare for any Bond novel.  The historical backdrop was interesting, but Fleming as Bond was almost cartoonish in his ability to get into and out of every scrape.  Fleming's Bond novels were less ambitious and much better for it.<br /><br />The history is enjoyable.  The speculation of British intelligence behind events is thought-provoking.  Some of the derring-do is fun.  These good elements make the book a fairly good one, but nothing up to Bond or even a real biography of Fleming.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|very good old/new planet  kind of like startrack  but with real people.  The characters are great.  Keeps you wanting to see how the Captain can get out of the next jam he gets them in
B0012UOWBA|3.0|The movie was entertaining, and both actors performed beautifully.  I would have given it 5 stars except for two facts.  One, the entire movie is about two people, who for no apparent reason, commit adultery. The other is because about a half dozen times during the movie, the actors used the Lord's name as a swear word.  This is wrong, and was very unnecessary in the telling of the story!
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|Very inspiring movie that will appeal to animal lovers/activists world wide!  A nudge at humankind's conscience for sure, and a heart-warming ending.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a good game!!!!! I absolutely can't wait until I get an upgrade. So I can play more levels!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I thought this book was very helpful and had great suggestions.  It explained it with more than just words.  There were &#34;real life&#34; stories that went with each and everyone long language.  It gives me hope!
B009AMANH4|3.0|Wasn't what I think it would be.  I liked killing lincoln by bill oreilly better.<br />Would liked to have seen more of his life and mrs. Lincoln and their children

B000O19EWK|5.0|I actually have had 3 copies of this movie. Two hard copies and I finally decided that this would be the only way to not wear out the disc. My 4-yr old is OBSESSED with this movie. Its his favorite. He will watch the wrestling scene over and over again. I'm greatful for the Amazon direct product because now we can essentially watch it and not have to worry about where he put the disc or if its scratched or not. Worth the $$ I spent. And for the record, he's way more into this series than the new Amazing Spiderman.
1593976216|1.0|CD arrived late. My plan was to use it doing my surgery recovery. When I did get it, the 2 &3rd tapes would either skip or just stop playing. Here`s the kicker, now &#34;I &#34; must take it to a return center, {I am two weeks post_ops} at cost to myself, there goes my `free` shipping. I have no ideal how\when /I will be able to get to post office before some contractral expiration happens. I am SOOL!

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|What happened ?  The last time I checked, a trilogy meant 3...books, movies, etc.  I waited and waited for this book to come out, only to find it didn't resolve anything.  I was so disappointed.

B0012QVJXS|5.0|This 1978 movie is filled with wonderful characters and humor!  There is action, but it doesn't overwhelm the storyline.  The latest Superman was all action, no storyline, and absolutely no humor.  The origins of this story derive from a cartoon, people!  It should be fun.  The new Superman which is in the movie theaters now plays like a computer game with non-stop violent action.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game kept me entertained for hours. Well worth the price. I just wish that they would come out with hidden object games that are not so macabre. All in all I would recommend this game.
B005HSL626|1.0|game is fun, but the game constantly freezes or quits working/ responding after a few minutes every time the game is played. maybe if you pay for it, it will be better.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very little to add other than to say this book gives a simple to understand perspective of what really goes on in war and how people like Chris and those he served with give everything they have, including their lives, for their country.  It's hard to describe how one feels after reading this other than humbled and &#34;small&#34;.<br /><br />A great read and thanks Chris for putting this in print for us.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Love me some Dr. Who! What more is there to say!!!!!!! Need to buy the whole set of all seasons!
B003YJEXL6|1.0|Save yourself the trouble.  Do not buy this book and do not read it.  Your brain cells will thank you.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Words don't describe how good this show is! Take the journey with all the survivors and see for yourself. Storyline continues to suprise and enough twists to keep you guesing!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Interesting concept of aliens and their technologies.The main characters mesh well in this series.The story lines are innovative; and there is enough action to hold my interest.
B00062PN6I|5.0|Setup a podcast studio with...<br /><br />Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB x4<br />Behringer HPM1000 Multi-Purpose Headphones x4<br />Behringer UCA202 Audio Interface<br />Behringer HA400 4-Channel Stereo Headphone Amp<br />Behringer XENYX 1202FX Premium 12-Input 2-Bus Mixer<br />RCA cord, 3.5mm stereo cable and a 3.5 to 1/4&#34; adapter.<br /><br />Everything needed to set-up a high quality multi person recording studio.<br />Can only record on one track for now, but it is not a problem.
B008GJVH7M|1.0|I like to call it a sleeper. It was a great movie to fall asleep to. I am glad I didn't pay for it.
B000W93CHC|3.0|Not as great as The Pillars of the Earth, so just three stars. Enjoyable, but not essential reading like his previous book about the building of the cathedral.
1469259206|5.0|I saw the movie and started to read the jack reacher series from the beginning.  I love this series. Cant wait to read more.
B00C7NKPPS|4.0|Masterpiece from Wings and Sir Paul McCartney.<br />If you are a fan of PMc you must have this re issue with a good remastered sound.<br />More impressive is the fact that inside has a note that will be avilable soon \\"Wings at the Speed of Sound\\" & the classic and out of print (untill now) \\"Venus and Mars\\".
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I was a little apprehensive of this game at first, but now I'm addicted. The only problem is that there needs to be more levels!!!
B00846REIS|1.0|If you like reading smut this book is for you.  Was suggested by a friend whom you would not have believed read books like this.  Explicit sex.... I never finished much past the 3rd chapter.  There really isn't a great story to this book to get you past the porn.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Well acted, nice twists, and beautiful. I'm looking forward to jumping into the second season. I'd recommend this show to any fans of science fiction or post-apocalyptic tales.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book is really fun! I love the scope of the story. It is such an expansive view of what could happen during the zombie apocalypse. I really enjoyed all of the vignettes.<br /><br />Addictive. Eye opening.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Great performance by D.D-L. Brings home, too, how the Republican Party has fallen from its proud heritage (where a radical Republican actually meant someone who stood for justice) to where it is now -- like the serpent in Genesis 3:14 crawling on its belly and eating dust.<br /><br />I just looked at the one star reviews. The prevailing complaint seems to be that the movie is slow-moving and boring. I would say it's contemplative and that this is one of its strengths.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Never saw this show when it first aired, but a lot of my friends were into it. I'm enjoying the show
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I went to see this \\"free showing\\" at my local college and really did not have much expectation for it. A Disney film, eh, that's for children and I am 61 years old. James Franco, a lead actor. Yeh, he is good as a no. 2 actor in a movie,  but I doubt he could be a lead. 0h, well it is better than watching the boob tube at home.<br />After watching this 2 hr. 15 min. long film, I can honestly say that Man, I was 100 percent wrong.<br />This movie floored me.<br />This is the best Disney film ever made. May not be the best movie ever, but certainly Disney's best.<br />And not only James Franco is great as a lead, but I can say, he is as good as Robert Downey. I was not a Franco booster before but I am now.  Kunis is very, very good but everyone else was good too as actors.<br />First, this movie is a prequel to the Wizard of Oz, and it explains how The Wizard of Oz gets to Oz 40 years before Dorothy. What is unbelievable is that this intelligent younger Oz becomes the blow hard Oz in the first Wizard of Oz movie. But that is not Franco's fault.<br />Second, this movie is about personal transformation for two leading characters, interthwined with a love story. Redemption for one and hell for the other. I won't say more about that because it will ruin it for those who have not seen it. I will say, don't let your anger define you, it may lead you to something that you will regret for the rest of your existence. Just ask, Darth Vader.<br />Third, it is about triumph for those who believe and who are brave enough to act when everything points to defeat and death.  Heck, 100 percent of the gambling money would have been that evil wins in the middle of this film. But not at the end.<br />Does this sound a bit hokey? Guess what, what do you think the messages were in the original \\"Wizard of Oz\\" movie? It was not just about Judy Garland singing. Welcome to the land of Oz. Except, this movie becomes more intense and hits your emotional buttons in the middle and especially at the end of the movie. If I wasn't repressed, I might have cried at the end.<br />This movie sent me to the Land of Oz, physically and emotionally.<br /><br />No sex, no graphic violence and no four letter words, although there are a couple of scenes that may scare young children.<br />This is a Disney film mostly geared to adults and teens.<br /><br />Special effects are great, music is too, and the acting by all is fine. This is not a musical.<br />The first 15 minutes are in black and white and a bit slow, but ride this pony and watch the rest of it. You won't be disappointed. Franco plays a POS character in that beginning, but he gets so much better later.<br />Buy the Dvd, and see it at home with a loved one. Make sure you have your popcorn and drinks before starting this film, cause you don't want to pause it. You will feel warm, positive and fuzzy afterward. It will change you in believing that there is good in all human beings. That there is love in all.<br />When your spirits are low and your faith in your fellow human being is lower still, watch this DVD again. It will do better than any alcohol or medication or weed.<br />Show the film when you have friends over and they have nothing to do. They will not have heard of the film before but afterwards, they will marvel at your film knowledge wizardry and probably go out and buy it themselves. They may not admit that to you. It is a Disney fil,. For adults?<br />This film is a keeper. I will go further. This is a film that I am going to give someone in my will. It might explain to them what you are all about. It will melt anyone, even the ones with the coldest of hearts. This film can transform you and them. But maybe not the film critics. They have no hearts. In the film, having no heart was the pre-requisite in becoming the \\"Wicked Witch\\".<br />P.S. I know that there seems to be many negative reviews here, but it is interesting to note that the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" did not become an iconic film until years later after its release, when it was first shown on television in the mid fifties, when many more viewers first saw it. Maybe this will have to be the case for this movie as well. I have faith in the better nature of humanity, now.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|This is a hilarious ride for anyone especially a parent. Take the time to watch the seasons and re-live your amazingly accurate teen years or just prepare for what your teens will experience.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a fun bingo game. No problems so far. Good game for all ages. I would recommend it for all.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|After viewing the trailer I was really looking forward to seeing Jack and the Giant Slayer; sooo good! I'm also a fan of Ewan McGregor; he really brings it to whatever the role. I love him in fantasy and SciFi roles, he just rocks it!<br /><br />This is a great family movie, i agree that it is a great cinema version of a story that we grew up reading as kids. Funny, nail biting; the giants are disgusting things. I am going to purchase it!.<br /><br />Go for it!!!!
B000GWE44U|5.0|I cannot believe it took me this long to watch the movie. But it was awesome! I didn't think it was very scary, but I usually don't find any movies scary. I would consider this a must watch.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Even though it does not fit the books, it does fit with the Judy Garland version of the stories.  I believe anyone that has only seen the movie version and not the books will enjoy this prequel.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|ties up a lot of loose threads from previous stories -what happen to Faith's cousin Sarha  -who ghost is-few more items that end this book's storyline wonderfully
B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved all the different little stories that kept you guessing what was going to happen next and where the story was going take the next turn!
B007SGM084|1.0|I ordered this book because of all the hooplah... What a mistake. The characters are shallow.  The sexual content is so overly done that it actually gets boring.  I started flipping through pages of the same sexual play that is repeated over and over again to see if any of the story was worth reading and found that it was all garbage. I cannot believe people are purchasing these books .
B009NY43NY|3.0|I understand this is Charlaine Harris' last book in this genre. Sorry to hear that. Maybe she can start a new series about the faeries.
B000267JQK|5.0|ordered all of the cds i could find on them they are all very good i will be in the third row i can hardly wait
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Yes this series is noted for violence and sex, but I found some of the brothel scenes to be quite pornographic and unnecessary.
B0034G4OWM|5.0|this is one of the best movies i have seen it a long time it keeps you laughing it is awesome.
B002N8TJ18|3.0|I love Enya, but felt this particular CD to be a bit too much the same throughout all the songs.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I hope they release another album soon. This is great, very creative. I like that it is still electronica but quite different from their album Discovery. I find it more mellow and melodic, and somehow more mainstream. I have friends who don't listen much to electronica or techno but really like this album.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Excellent movie and characters, but just a wee bit tooooo long for kids as well as adults. But havng said that, I highly reccommend it.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|Good movie for kids.  Enjoyed watching it and I think it will be great for a kids movie to watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its an awesome game for anyone who likes minecraft. I highly recommend this app. but one thing is it needs a purpose for red stone such as pistons
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Kept me occupied for 45 minutes, not a lot of instructions but easy to figure out.<br />And the price is right!
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|J.COLE is the first ever artist that I'm hooked to and I can't get enough this man. I love it.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|The best 50 year old show you will ever watch.  You will love it!  Don't be a Gallifrey'deecat!  David Tennant was a spectacular Doctor!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I was told AFFC would be my least favorite in the series and ASOS is a tough act to follow but the depth and detail to bring open the world beyond KL is great. I love Dorne and the Iron Islands is intriguing. Great fun adventure this was!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This is a good thriller movie I think. It's a souped up, adult version of the fairy tale Hansel & Gretel.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Unbelievable series. So many hidden meanings. So many links to our own present time and event. I recommend this to anyone.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Cliff hanger to the end. At first I didn't care for the chapters being in a different persons perspective but as you get further along it makes the book that much better. The story is so well written some of the plot twists are nice surprises. Really looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|With all the hoop-la I was expecting to really like this book.  I did like the characters a lot but was put off and bored that it was the same thing over and over again...
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Creepy and disconcerting and ultimately compassionate, a story of alienation and the strange blank space where online fantasies meet real-life feelings.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|The album is good for country fans. I like the lyrics in many if the songs and thevtunes are melodious. . He is definitely being real and it's refreshing from other artists who are real, but in a nagging sirt if way. Bkake has a way of singin'that just makes me want to listen. If you are a fan, you know wgat i mean
B0002IQJUK|5.0|It was when my daighter added Gavin's mudic at my request  to the IPOD she gave me that decided to get a CD if his. Thus is because I like putting CDs in car and in my radio in the kitchen. Gavin's Chariot is special and his stripped version in this package is awesome. You want real music you can listen to that has great acoustics as well as depth in kyrics, I guarantee you will love love this CD
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Trying to cash in on popularity of Fifty Shades but doesn't quite make it. Very sorry I per ordered this one. Probably won't read it all
B001AH6ZWY|3.0|Great cast. Somewhat different than events in the book but doesn't Chang the story. Great special effects. Great to see again
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I am a book snob - I will start a book and put it down never to read the entire thing - This series draws you in with its wonderful characters.  Love the HBO series and they do follow the books pretty well.  So happy I found a book I thoroughly enjoy!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Rich characters - it drew me in from the beginning - incredibly well written - love it!!! Can't wait to read the rest.
B00821OX98|3.0|OK..so it has a few decent actors in it. It has a pretty good SciFi plot. And that is about all I can say. It isn't terrible but the writing for it is pretty poor at times and the acting by some of the characters is pretty terrible. It is hard to figure out if it is the acting or the writing but jeesh it can be poor at times. I really wanted to like it and overall it is watchable but do not expect too much from it. CGI is pretty good but man could the show use better acting and writing.
B005MVLI8A|5.0|Anyone who loves music has to have this album in their collection.  I would highly recommend it.  Spawned a whole new movement in US rock.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Mainly this movie is focused towards adults not for kids under 10, some kids may love the action and vibrant colors, but the dialogue is strictly for adults.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Like it a lot better than 100 floors. I'm looking forward to more rooms. Update soon please.  My review is too short... so I'm adding this line.
B001DPC52C|5.0|This is another excellent album from Within Temptation. I love the addition of the symphony! The DVD is pretty entertaining, too, and I'm not really a fan of watching music videos.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|When your in the mood to listen to this group, it will put you at ease, just sit back and relax
B0062QRTKA|5.0|this game is definitely worth the $0.99<br />you can tell that the developers wanted to put out a great game
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is now # 1 on my favorites list. I laughed so hard I fell off the the treadmill! It's totally got the hot factor too-the whole package that I will now pump out to all my friends!
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I simply adore this series, unlike 50 Shades it actually has a really good story line! 5 stars! Can not wait for the next installment.
B00114RKT8|5.0|Ioan Gruffudd captured this movie with his stunning performance. This movie will certainly stir the deeper emotions and move you.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|At last... I bought these in search of good all around headphones, and I want to say, these studio monitor headphones are really good choice and a decent value.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I was 15 years old when World War II ended. I had no love for Nazis or Japanese. I had wished I had my turn in the Army or Naval Air force, but now know that God had other plans for me. I have hear many stories that gave God credit for war time survival. I have not seen any better true story than this one. It was great to see that God was directing both the American and German pilots of this story. I am an aeronautical engineer and have been for over 60 years. I  know what keeps these airplanes in the air. I would have to say that for this B-17 to make it back home took miracles and God's care for the B-17 crew and the fighter pilot. I have worked with German pilots since the war and have a better understanding of their situation. However, the things I learned about the German pilots and their distaste for the Nazis in this book has given me a great understanding. A lot of credit goes to the author of this book!
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|wtf this game gets boring after you been on for a while first time buyers never in your life get this it gets lame after ten minutes and it slows down your kindle I rate this worst game ever
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game has AMAZING graphics and is easy to play. I just wish that more people would play multiplayer. All in all a great game.
B001F7MSFM|2.0|I love Hellboy II and am a large fan of what was done in the sequel to the first one. I bought this movie from the glenthebookseller and upon delivery, opened up the case to a scratched up dvd that was unable to play. I really do love this movie and was so disappointed to recieved such a crappy product. I'd give this movie the 5 stars it deserves, but due to the copy of it I recieved, I'm giving it only 2 stars. BEWARE!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun but needs more rooms. Hope this isn't just a play once and delete app. This could potentially Be a fun game.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Doctor Who is the perfect combo of sci-fi, whimsy, and heart. I recommend everyone start with season 1/episode 1 (not the strongest of the series, but hang in there, it just keeps getting better and better and better) and watch all the way to present.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Hmmmm, found some of the reviews interesting.  Fortunately, we have not had the \\"unskippable preview\\" problem....not sure why others can't go directly to the movie by hitting \\"episodes\\" and \\"next\\"...We do not have TV so we read the books and wait for the \\"seasons\\" to come available.  We have completed up to through disk 4 of this 5 disk season 2 box set and it has played flawlessly.  However, we don't bother with blu ray because we are not interested in all the \\"extras\\" and have yet to find them any more \\"spectacular\\" than the plain DVDs...maybe that is the reason we are not having any of the problems listed by other viewers.<br /><br />We are enjoying this series very much but, (and I want to state we certainly are not prudes in any way), but we get tired of what we feel is unnecessary and very graphic sex and nudity scenes.  This production would be just as fantastic without seeing an over-abundance of frontal nudity and sex scenes that rival even some porno flicks I've seen....not necessary at all...and I find these offensive especially for a production that is available on HBO/TV.  If the author feels the need to put it in the books, fine....but it is out of place where \\"family viewing\\" could be an issue.<br /><br />Eagerly waiting for Season 3 although I've read it will not be available until Feb 2014!  How distressing!
B000FC146C|5.0|I bought this to have in my kindle library.  I love this saga, it is one of those books that you like to reread every once in a while.  Wonderful story of Australia and the Catholic Church, greed and hardship, love and friendship.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Being eighty, I could identify.  All of us oldies want another chance to be appreciated.  We still have talent and brains.  We need an opportunity to show the world. . .
B009KY5OGC|5.0|Read this book many years ago, it's a wonderful story and well worth having in your library which is why I bought it again, you will NOT be disappointed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent writing; casting is superb; acting is flawless;  each episode is beautifully crafted.  The wardrobes are a fabulous reminder of what fashion and &#34;style&#34; we are lacking in our tacky, casual  modern era.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is a great game and really entertains you for hours! After a while for me thought, it got a little boring. So I bought some new plagues that I couldn't unlock and it is is just as . Fun as ever!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Such a fun game and it keeps you entertained! Wish they would update it so w  can have more levels!
1401324649|5.0|It is very funny.  The characters and actions are outrageous.  Hurray for straight thinking, hard-drinking, direct action, honest aged persons.  Since I live in a community of older persons, I can understand why the lead character wanted to escape and live a little. And he did live it up.  For his whole life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game.  PS don't spend gems on your tasks or other stuff because its fun training your horse then you will pernicious when you get one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day is one of my favorite authors! She did not disappoint in the ongoing story of Gideon & Eva! Can't wait to see where the next book takes them!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I don't love it, but I like it. Im not a fan at all of the fact that I can't see page numbers. I would rather know what page I'm on than the percentage read.
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|Jimmy, the main character, takes us to Spain where he hopes to straighten out his life and quit abusing cocaine. Things don't go to plan. We follow Jimmy and his new friend Jason on their misadventures, and it becomes clear that nobody can be trusted or depended on. It's a story of self-discovery and although the characters aren't people I'd invite into my life, they were likable and/or entertaining in their own way. `Get Clean' is a great read. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the drug scene and even for those who don't do drugs, but want to know a little of how people act in that crazy world. Not for children, but two thumbs up from me.
B00459GJUM|5.0|Fun entertaining show that I am disappointed I missed when it originally aired. I honestly think this series was better than the stargates that came before it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|enjoyable but wish the rasks weren't so long of a wait or the jemmy choice should be lowered to one
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a fun game but not to ease and not to hard I recommend  this game to play because it Is fun
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I enjoyed this book but not nearly as much as the author's other work. It fell somewhat flat for me and I didn't identify with the characters all that well.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love it. Great graphics. Great story. Easy to navigate. Great mini games and puzzles. Would love to have more like it soon
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book was very well written. The author had a very unique way of delivering the story. I would highly recommend this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|super fun game but they need to create more rooms soon. finished every room in under an hour. fun while it lasted
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It's a great show with loveable characters. Leave it to Fox to cancel one of the only good shows they ever made...
0062206281|5.0|Anyone who has read The Shadow of the Wind and/or The Angel's Game will thoroughly enjoy The Prisoner of Heaven. (And anyone who hasn't yet, really should!) While completely independent novels, several characters are present in the other books, and the weaving of their stories is believable and interesting. Carlos Ruiz Zafon is on the top of my list for anyone who has ever visited Barcelona. The picture the author paints of the city is as rich as the local paella!<br />Great read! Highly recommended!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app could be great but it slows downloading anything it also shuts down and kicks me off Facebook numerous times. I have a kindle fire hd 7&#34; and this app doesn't work well. It's easy to use and fun but it doesn't work right. I had the old version but my kids accidentally erased the app from my kindle fire hd and when I downloaded it again, I got the new update which doesn't work and makes using it harder. I love facebook cuz it keeps me in contact with old friends and family, but this app is awful. PLEASE FIX THIS APP!!!
0446554995|5.0|I am a huge fan of both these authors, and Two Graves doesn't disappoint! Incredible read! Highly, highly recommend ANY AND ALL of their novels. Happy reading!
B00A757EFW|5.0|It's easy to move and enjoyable to play! It is just lke playing it the wat that I remember as a kid.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a lot of fun whether your three or thirteen. It demonstrates real world scenarios not only for taking care of a horse, but any type of animal. Its a great app to teach young kids responsibility.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I was not familiar with this artist until she sang on American Idol.  I bought her CD right after.  I love every song simply because of her voice.  Very melodic.  She really can sing!  The songs are great as well.
B00BL5EQLC|1.0|This was just another rip off of the Donkey Kong concept. I got stuck on a screen, got board, uninstalled it, and forgot it. Not sure it even lasted a full hour on my phone.
B0058VW36U|4.0|My 6 year old grandsons love this game.  It makes them think logically and plan ahead.  Even I find it challenging.
B00821OX98|5.0|I find it shocking that some major network didn't try to air this show, waited half a season, and then canceled it. So glad a cable network picked it up so it would have a chance for once. Great acting, solid character development, the aliens don't look like cheap cartoon style CGI. Strongly recommended.
B004TI1WME|4.0|Office Calculator Pro I totally like the app, very useful and the tape affect is also very helpful and real calculator like.
B00C4YZ12C|3.0|Pretty much a rip off of several 80's video games, but that is what I wanted. It being a rip off of 80's games was why I downloaded it. It is very cheesy and fun, but I tend to get board of it quickly. However, unlike other games that bore me when I get stuck on a screen I tend to keep coming back to this one. No clue why. Maybe it is because it is such a great rip off of so many 80's style video games?
159463176X|5.0|Loved this book, much like the other's I have read by Khaled.  The stories read like I am walking the streets of Kabul through his stories. Gut wrenching and optomistic.  There is a true feeling of being there with the author.  I'm hoping he writes many more books.
B00COHIFQS|2.0|I watched this because of a more or less positive review in the NY Times.  But a definite skip--just about the silliest, most incompetent movie it could possibly be.  A great disappointment from this director.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love how Hosseini creates characters that i come to know and love. Imperfect, but trying their best to make the most of a bad situation. He also takes time to make a picture in the readers mind of time & place. Compelling beginning. Heart-wrenching, yet satisfying end.<br /><br />Beware- character narratives and setting change w/o warning. It took me a paragraph or two - sometimes more - to figure out where the story had moved.
B00DGNOMB6|2.0|I couldn't watch it.  Cute old people in a depressing end of life rest home.  Sad, because the cast is full of great actors with nothing to do but act old and petty.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I have read this series 4 times. This will be my 5th.  I have it in hardcover, paperback and now this time electronic form.  I am rereading this series in preparation for the last in the series which will be coming out soon.  Every time I reread I pick up details that I missed before.<br /><br />I enjoy reading series books but there has never been one like this one that I have enjoyed enough to reread.  The way Diana has woven actual historic events into this story is awesome.  I have recommended this series more times than I can count to people looking for a good read.
B00BHU261S|4.0|Maybe more than you want to know about the master, but one will certainly think of him in a different way when watching his great films.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Could not get along without this app.  if you love shopping ebay, and just want to get where you want to be...this is the app for you.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|With all the hype I expected to be disappointed.  The cast delivers with a minimum of mis-steps.Well worth the time to watch.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I had been hearing about minecraft for a long time and decided to try it out. I got this app and it was really fun but, it gets boring kind of fast. Maybe it's because I didn't play it on the computer but really I don't play it that much.
B00CHILW64|3.0|The flood scenes extremely realistic, and one has a sense of what that horrible event was like.  Just a sense, but devastating in its implications in the aftermath as well.
B00847KFDS|5.0|My husband and I go way back.  John Fogerty has alway been one of his favorites.  When I ordered it for my daughter she did not care for it, but, the old man did.
B000VRH0T6|4.0|This is an album I always bummed from friends in high school or listened to on the radio.  I finally bought it, LOL!  Has some of the great Aerosmith songs on it.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|(myurbanfantasies.blogspot)<br /><br />I usually try to provide smaller plot points when doing a review. I do this to give a little more information than the synopsis can provide, so you can get a better feel for the book. With Shadowfever it's just not possible. Every detail is a small part of an epic ending. Red herrings are revealed and all questions you may have are answered. Shadowfever is what every Urban Fantasy should be. It's an amazing story with strong characters and a hint of romance. Perfection.<br /><br />Shadowfever starts exactly where Dreamfever left off. Mac has just killed someone important to her, someone she cannot live without. To say she is overcome by grief would be vastly understating it. The beginning of Shadowfever is horrifically sad. I am not ashamed to say I cried like a baby. To me that says everything about an author. The ability to weave words together so the reader is able to feel exactly what a fictional character is feeling... beyond brilliant. To grieve with Mac... to feel the despair, rage, guilt and the emptiness. To go from wanting to slap Mac upside the head as she continues to deny her feelings, to applauding her when she finally admits them. It was an honor and an exceptional journey.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Just keeps getting better and better.  Cast is great, so are the special effects. Spectacular! Can't wait for Season 3!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really addictive puzzle game. Clever tasks to advance to the next level. The graphics are a little crude, but you hardly notice them once you get farther into the game. I hope new levels are released soon.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I got hooked within the first two episodes.  There are a LOT of characters and it can be a challenge to sort them out, but that's my only complaint.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I had heard this was a good movie so I thought I'd read the book first.  It was a nice love story with a little suspense. It really kept my interest.
B009A87ZKG|5.0|Great War Classic. If you are a fan and own it on DVD you must upgrade to  blu ray version. It looks and sounds amazing.
B005J2UM9S|1.0|Was looking for a good horror film, but this seemed more like a comedy between the realty tv spin and the horrible acting. The last 20 minutes had some scary elements, but overall it was disappointing.
B006YRVY2G|5.0|the music is beautiful. wonderful to listen to at any time :) i would recommend buying this soundtrack even if you haven't seen the series.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|This movies a joke. I seen all the other die hards and loved them all.<br /><br />This one just plain sucks asscrap he got lazy, hired some guy to do all the acting as bruce willis kind of sits in the background and clearly didn't care much about it.<br /><br />Funny if you got nothing else to do.. not even worthy of being considered a serious movie though
B008220BLG|5.0|Saw warm bodies at the theater. My daughter is a zombie fan. A movie that gives you hope if there is ever a zombie uprising. :)
B005OLF6BI|5.0|This concert was the best concert I have seen in a long time.  I would recommend this to any fan of<br />Taylor Swift.  She just goes beyond the call with this concert.  Best Ever.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|This soundtrack is super. Saw the movie at the theater multiple times. Bought the music and love listening to it at any time. Second time is definitly a charm :)
B0009HAHD4|5.0|This replaced my Nikon D60 cup and fit perfectly. Slid the old one off and this new one in and it looks good as new!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Great show!  Would rate it a 5 star but it has way to much profanity, especially wish they would stop using G-- D---.  People of their intellect don't need to use such language and not many in the real business world do o casually.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Decent game with cool Iron man suits from the third movie. Fun to play with several challenges for each run. Takes a lot of grinding to upgrade and unlock better suits after the first set. Can skip upgrades but at an awful high cost. Would definitely recommend to Iron man fans but not for those who need instant gratification for a &quot;free&quot; game.
B000HZD168|5.0|Such a cliff hanger, and a great villain.  They outdid themselves on this one - certainly my favorite of the series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is Fun and challenging. Definitely needs more levels. I would recommend this game. My mom loves this game also.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|Says this is for ages 6-12. When you get it, it has a sticker on it \\"Handle With Care\\". After handling it myself, I can see how easily it could be broken. Thought this was important to be said. Use your own judgement.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Immediately fell in love with the characters and the stories were always completely engrossing. Have watched all 5 seasons more than once.
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|There are two versions of Persuasion on film, that I know of. This one and another one from the nineties that's also good. Ciaran Hinds was quite a hottie in his day; he's scrumptious here. Anne is played by someone so plain I fantasized about giving her a makeover, but that just made her seem all the more sweet and deserving of winning her man. I especially love the way the family interactions are portrayed here: amusing, touching, and familiar - Jane Austen was really good at writing family dynamics.
0307716554|5.0|This is a riveting story. I could not put it down. I really enjoyed the whodunit aspect intermingled with the relationships.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Every bit as powerful and fun to listen to as their first album. If Mumford & Sons can keep up this level of quality they're going to stay as popular as they are now, and deservedly so.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Buy this instead of the 3 books individually.<br />I find reviews of books hard to sift through. This version has good continuity and jumps you right from one book to the next.<br />It has a newer publishing date than the other e-book versions, and I noticed only a few errors, but none of them were serious enough to ruin dialogue or the reading experience.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This album is a great listen without a single bad song on it. Great debut for a great new band.
B008F2AKUA|5.0|It is nice to just listen to the classic rock and roll by Huey Lewis and The News. Just like in the 70s and 80s the good old days.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's good,like the PC version,but it needs more items in creative mode,like all the items from survival craft.it is good but needs more
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Sparks is such a prolific writer, and manages to write without the awful language in such wide usage today. This story was warm, and yet heartbreaking on so many levels. It proves the saying: &#34;You can't tell a book by its cover&#34; in describing the lonely man who befriends the lonely woman in such a fatherly way. Though he doesn't waste a lot of time on descriptions, the ones he does are alive to the reader - and puts one there. I do have one bone to pick with him, and he knows what it is. I will not discuss it here, but......<br /><br />I sincerely hope this will be a movie. Movies made from his books are most always good - and many of us watch them more than once.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Fascinating, complex plot, written using different narrators. Collins has the ability to &#34;hook&#34; you in such a way that it is difficult to put the book down.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|What a crazy, wacky and weird story that I couldn't stop reading - great to read something a bit different.  I also enjoyed the snippets of history that Allan was part of - he certainly got around!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It kept me wanting to play more levels. Can't wait for more. And it's free which makes it even better.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|This is a great game except for the issues with connectivity . This issue also keeps me from trying any of the other games that this company creates. It is hit or miss on being able to load the game.
B00628RVV0|5.0|This movie had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for what was coming next.<br />Once you've watched this movie you realize how truely inocent childrens minds are and how easily they can be corrupted.
0316096199|4.0|This was required for a class I took.  It was well written and an easy read.  May read another book by this author in the future.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This was my husband's father's day gift.  He is a huge WWII fan and we have owned Band of Brothers for a long time.  This was the perfect completion to the collection.  The language is much harsher in this one than it was in Band of Brothers.  Guess they felt like they needed to HBO-it more.  Nevertheless, it's a fantastic show!
074322454X|5.0|I read this book cover to cover. It is great and worth every penny. It compliments the movies very well. I love that it is all true.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I am not a techie and this app is so easy to use. Set it up in seconds and it's ready to go. Awesome!!!
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Not incredibly deep, but very good for a free app. Pretty good graphics and fun game play though. Definitely worth it if it's free
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|There were spectacular special effects and the side banter between the &#34;avengers&#34; made me laugh at time.  In all, enjoyable.
1250027624|5.0|This book is lovely. If you love Downton, you will not be disappointed. Beautiful pictures and very nicely put together. In the Chronicles, this book outlines the characters who play a vital role in Downton. So you, as the reader, get the opportunity to go &#34;inside&#34; your favorite character. You get a chance to understand their character. The actors playing these characters also comment. I highly recommend this book - you will not be disappointed.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Definitely left wanting more...Just when you think Eva and Gideon have all of their problems on the mend, BAM!!! They hit another obstacle head on!
1250006341|5.0|This book is lovely. Very nicely put together. Lots of pictures & lots of information.<br />In this book, you get a bit of a history lesson. Through the years that Downton takes place, the history of that era is interwoven.<br />This book takes you inside Downton and makes you feel like you are looking at a family album. Again, if you love Downton this is a wonderful book! Highly recommend it.
B002DEZXOE|5.0|After reading the book by Michael Lang, the man who thought this whole festival up..(\\" the road to Woodstock\\"), it put it all in perspective for me! Watching the artists perform was simply amazing! I loved it!! The music.. the People.. the interviews have brought me right there! I still can't get Richie Havens Out of my head And that's a beautiful thing! Nor Santana for that matter!! They laid the groundwork for the vibe that was the Woodstock Festival. 10 stars!!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|What  a  game  it  Is  so  silly  who would have  thought that a  game could be so silly. Thoughts are  cool  so is your  game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This story has opened up some new things between Giddeon and Eva. Also some things going on with the roommate. Loved it and glad she is doing more on this couple.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The portrayal of Lincoln as a \\"storyteller\\" was performed to perfection by Daniel Day-Lewis! This was a great film! A poignant reminder of our darker history and the struggle to find our way to equality for ALL people!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|its an ok game so far I guess.  pretty fun to play so you might as well check it out
B0036SQZ2K|5.0|Based on the book \\"The Men Who Stare at Goats (2004\\"  by Jon Ronson about the U.S. Army's exploration of New Age concepts and the potential military applications of the paranormal. The title refers to attempts to kill goats by staring at them. Research was carried out in part by Jon Ronson, but also by documentary filmmaker John Sergeant.<br /><br />The book examines connections between military programs and psychological techniques being used for interrogation in the War on Terror. The book traces the evolution of these covert activities over the previous three decades, and analyzes how they persisted within U.S. Homeland Security and the Iraq War. It examines the use of the theme tune to Barney & Friends on Iraqi prisoners-of-war, the smuggling of a hundred de-bleated goats into the Special Forces command center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and the connection between the U.S. military and the mass-suicide of members of the Heaven's Gate cult in San Diego.
0486290492|1.0|I love Jane Austin, but this book has to be ranked as a very boring and preachy effort on her part.  Pride and Prejudice has drama and excellent dialogue.  Sense and Sensibility does not.  And Ms. Austen's conclusion, that it is better to be \\"sensible\\", only leaves the reader rolling her eyes.<br /><br />Emma Thompson's movie adaptation has all the romance and drama one would have wished to see in the book.  Buy the DVD.  It's as good as reading Pride and Prejudice.  The characters, especially Eleanor and the infamous \\"sister-in-law\\", are superb.  Ms. Thompson, as Eleanor, gives the performance of a lifetime, as even my husband, who I dragged to the movie, acknowledged.
1451695195|5.0|I really love true stories that add substance to faith. This book is one of those. It is not only a story, but science, and given by a credible voice. It has everything to make you think, believe and wonder. A great read!<br />If you liked this, you may also like another true story of faith, but more of a proof of the demonic, in [[ASIN:0615658911 How Gods Are Made: Exploring the Spiritual Dynamics Behind Idolatry and False Religion]] *****
B00441GYZQ|5.0|\\"What is the last thing about you and your husband that you know was true?\\"<br /><br />Harrison Ford asks this question of Kristen Scott after he finds out his wife was cheating with her husband.  As a person who thought she had a happy marriage, my discovery that my spouse had been cheating on me was devastating.  This movie haunts me - I have watched it multiple times.  It is a comfort to know I am not alone, that other people have been betrayed by their spouses for no reason that they can figure out.<br /><br />\\"What is the last thing about you and your husband that you know was true?\\"  This movie explores the options:  looking for that \\"true\\" thing or not.  Does it drag out the pain?  Does it help you heal?  Is there an answer?  And if there is, can you find it?  Or should you let it go as unexplainable and inexplicable and just move on?  Can you move on without answering that question?<br /><br />The movie explores the options and lets you decide.<br />Apparently an uncomfortable movie for many people. I did not find it so.  I identified with Harrison Ford's pain.  This movie brought me comfort, and still does to this day.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|The black keys keep coming up with awesome CD's. This one is no exception. There are at least three singles on this cd that you've probably heard on the radio and the rest are just as good.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I laughed out loud, I cried, I yelled at the characters! I loved this book!!! It was wonderful, and so well written!
B00CRMX53S|5.0|I just did a 64 mi bike ride the other weekend and I had this song stuck in my head for most of the ride. It really helped me as I struggled through some seriously tough hill climbs. Gran Fondo!
B008NMT684|5.0|I have enjoyed playing, but actually downloaded it for grandson. Haven't needed to introduce it to him yet, but sure it will be a hit when he does see it.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Excellent CD, Many great songs. I was just going to get the single, but I am glad that I opted to get the whole cd.
B00BHWG0HW|5.0|We love everyone of the series and this was no exception.  You get where you feel you know the people personally.  If you are into &#34;Star Trek&#34;, this is a must for your collection.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I purchased this game for my grandson who is 10 yrs. old. He played it for several hours but lost interest rather quickly. He said that it was too simple for him. Might be ok for younger kids
B00271HAK8|5.0|Best 80's movie! Lots of laughs and is a joy ride you'll enjoy just as much as the characters in the movie enjoyed.
B003XDXNOQ|5.0|Awesome , they never disappoint, would buy another without hesitation, keep up the good work, will defiantly will recommend to people
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a good game I play it every day. I like it a lot so there it is from me
B008JFUS5A|5.0|Catching fire is the best book out of all three. I have no doubt it will be the best miovie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just when everyone seems to be adjusting well, along comes the unexpected cliff-hanger !!!!<br />Can hardly wait for Season 4!
B007HC3LHS|3.0|So far this book is ok.  It seems to drag on and on and on.  And jumps from one subject to another.  So it gets a person mixed up of where they are.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As many of Ken Follet this one is a page turner, you learn a lot about ww II and how regular people were living and the things they had to face. This is one of 3 books, we are still waiting for the third
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's fun to play and I really like to play this game and I wish I had more levels on this game cause it's so fun to play
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game is just hard enough to keep you thinking but not to hard.<br />I love it my kids and I play it together
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I like how subway suffers has different types of cities. Except why is it called that.I mean its not in a subway. Plus it should have exclusive stuff. It's fun to run and collect things BUT why not once.in awhile not run.help paint graffiti . I don't want to always run from the fat guy so  I think the creaters should change it
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|this game stinks to many problems with it. you get attracted by player but cant invade them because it wont load there base your own allies will not load and the more allies you get the worse it gets.  glad I didn't spend real cash on this thing.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I liked this book, even though there are a lot of curse words (Therefore, this is an okay book for those who are not so easily offended by curse words.). For those who are looking at this book for the first time (SPOILER ALERT!), there are no Martians.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This is a very fun game, kinda hard to control at times but still is a really fun game it a keeper.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Worth to try it.<br />Download it and enjoy. But need to get enough space to download it. Check before you try this.
B005LAIH2W|1.0|I thought it would be a good family Sci-fi movie. Within the first 15 minutes or less the GD cursing came out and we didn't watch it any longer. What a disappointment! Glad I bought it cheap and not new!!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Was sad when I heard that Google Reader was closing down but after using Feedly it is sad no more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice to play on a lazy Sunday morning. I don't like the music but that is what mute is for.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This is an easy read with some important and fundamental advice that is worth listening to. It's slightly repetitive, repeating the same concepts without adding much new - so it could have been half the length without sacrificing much. Still, I'm glad I read this. I certainly learned something and will definitely apply these principles in my relationship(s). Recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I down loaded solitaire on my kindle fire and i pod love it especially when im somewhere and have to wait i sit there and play my game good stimulation for the brain
B000VSYDRM|3.0|I read the book a few years ago and I liked it because the killer travels through France in a quest to find the best way to get what he tries to achieve.  The movie is great for showing the period and the life in Paris then.  I love to see how the city was at that time and how it looks now when one visits it.  Too bad they removed all the bridge with houses on it!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it's my favorite game it's addictive it works realy great for androids I have a kindle fire hd and it doesn't have any gliches I love this game
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|It's not like a lot of movies.  It starts off and you wonder what's happening or happened and you don't really know what's going on.  A very strange little boy who sees and hears music everywhere.  Since I love music, it appealed to me.<br /><br />As the movie progresses, you begin to hear August's music...the rhythm of life.  This movie captured me.  I rented it twice; shared it with a couple of other people that I know like music and finally bought it because I wanted to see it again and knew it belonged in my library of movies I like over and over again.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell the story.  The story is good and it makes you want to dream again of good things.  Hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as I did.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Oh baby this app is hot like the sun<br />I love this as much as my mama girl o.k. maybe not that much
B004X75RK4|5.0|My sister and I would religiously watch anything that had Sandra Bullock in it (though the earliest movie we've seen is &#34;Speed&#34;), and this one is just as good as Miss Congeniality or The Lake House. I'm not used to seeing her play that type of character, but boy she did good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is probably the best game on my kindle so far. the lite version is cool but the full version is much better. I have an iphone at my moms and have the lite version. I know this has nothing to do with the game but if u have facebook do NOT add Valerie Goodwin! she is my mom and is a drug-addict creeper
B004RL9T50|5.0|Animated movies went downhill for awhile there in the early 2000s, but now they are back up again. This is one of the better ones that I've seen lately. Good lines, good plot, could easily have been the same old same old but they made it fresh.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This book is horrible. its so racist to asians. It made me cry because it was so bad. I hate it with all my heart, soul, and mind.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is excellent! ALL of them in ONE box for such a decent price AND on blu-ray?! We thought we were dreaming at first! Delivered really fast in great condition. It's a must for every household :)
B005PK57IK|5.0|Well-plotted, well-acted, well-everything-else too! A superb product; very entertaining and addictive!!! I have included it in my short list of things I do not want to miss on TV.
B000FGGE7C|1.0|Was totally disappointed with this purchase.  I did not know that this was an animated cartoon rather than a real movie.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this game. Only thing to make it better would be a longer story and more decks! Love it!
B000YPUFA6|5.0|This movie is a fair follow on to the Resident Evil saga.  Amazon did a fine job (as always) delivering this purchase with blazing speed.
1452101248|2.0|I absolutely loved this author's book Jerusalem but was really let down with this one. Oh well I just resold it on consignment so somebody got a good deal.
B00C1S945G|5.0|I really like what they've done with remastering the series for HD.  The effects are new and spectacular and seeing the characters in HD is awesome.  I hope they do the entire seven seasons.
B0091REZMW|4.0|it kills time! love hidden object games so this one works for me! same with my boyfriend. not the best but it is fun!
B0038P59A0|5.0|I love this character, I love this actor, and I love this movie! That's all there is to say. Excellent!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST SHOOTING GAMES AROUND. THE LEVELS ARE GREAT AND the graphics are some of the best I've ever seen. Mind blowing fun.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I just started watching this show. But based on the first one I will enjoy watching the series. Looking forward to the rest of season 1.
B008476HBM|5.0|Don't make up your mind about someone's character before you have exhausted all the facts.  And sometimes it is good to let others know how you honestly feel about them, although it can certainly be risky.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Page Turner read all 3 in a week and a half!  It's a must read! Would be nice to have a follow up book to know how all characters ended up!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben Alexander, a neurosurgeon, would have joined the majority of scientists in a disinterest and probable impossibility of Life after Death as believed by many people of Faith, a few of whom claimed they had experienced it.  Only the miracle which he relates to us here reveals his complete change of mind.
B00004XPPE|5.0|It is the middle of the Cold War and the United States maintains fleets of bombers with nuclear warheads stationed across the globe ready to strike the Soviet Union should a situation require it. During a routine investigation of an unidentified flying object, one fleet of bombers erroneously receives a signal to proceed to bomb Moscow. No one wants a full-scale nuclear war and the rush is on to avert it any way possible.<br /><br />Due to its similar premise, this movie seems doomed to forever be compared to Dr. Strangelove. While Dr. Strangelove used a similar scenario for laughs, Fail-Safe provides a serious, dramatic look at the prospects of what could go wrong when two countries have nuclear weapons constantly pointed at each other and the dangers of putting too much technology in command.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is excellent with memorable performances by Walter Matthau as a cold-blooded political scientist who only sees the number of possible dead as a statistic and Henry Fonda as a commanding U.S. President.<br /><br />The DVD also includes a very interesting audio commentary by the late director Sidney Lumet who, despite how old the film is, provides many interesting recollections about the making of this film.<br /><br />All in all, I found this to be well put together film. I would recommend this to those interested in a story of a hypothetical Cold War scenario.
B000I9UA30|4.0|So this film is a little over the top, and the acting isn't great but hey, its a movie about aliens and the USA. Action was good, the comedy was enjoyable. Good for a night on the couch.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great free preview of the full game. Fun, quick, and yet challenging. Full version will give you a lot of flexibility with cards...but this free version gives you a taste of everything.  Going to be purchasing full game soon!
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|Saga is such a unique story, beautifully written with art to match. I binge read the first 12 issues and I can't wait for what's to come with this story line.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|good game overall and its free app until u want to move to the next lvl. get to learn how to play magic love it
B0031RS2HC|2.0|I was inspired by the recent Jack Reacher movie to read this novel. I found it disappointing.<br /><br />The characterisation is shallow, the storyline is weak and requires multiple suspensions of disbelief. Please don't think this criticism comes from someone who only reads non-fiction and can't tolerate a bit of creativity in a story. I read sci-fi and fantasy and have always enjoyed a well constructed story, even if the basic premise requires a logical leap.<br /><br />Perhaps you could justify this book as something to read on a plane flight, but there are plenty of better options out there.
B005LAIIHG|1.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" starts pleasantly, though is confusing.  It has the potential of being something quite thought provoking.  But, the thing quickly degrades into a hellish experience that will leave scarred memories, images that may well remain with the viewer for some time to come.<br /><br />The mindless, idiotic fool that is the central character fumbles his way onto a life boat while intentionally wandering around on the deck of a ship that is struggling to stay afloat in typhoon conditions.  There are zoo animals confined on this ship, which are depicted as drowning below deck while the ship is slowly doing down.  People and animals suffer miserably, and you get to see it!<br /><br />While everyone in your living room is begging you to please stop this miserable agony of a \\"movie\\"; you hold on hoping this garbage will improve eventually.  Then you get to see a hyena attack, and mutilate a zebra while the coward is standing in the lifeboat with a ten foot oar in his hands, just looking at the butchery with flies buzzing in & out of his cavernous pie-hole!<br /><br />I slammed the stop button on the remote, and found myself desperately wishing I could grab that oar and do to the fool what he should have done to the hyena!<br /><br />If you have children, or adults with sensitive demeanors in your family, be sure to avoid this ravishing torture at all costs!!
B00821OX98|5.0|I love this show, my husband and I are always at the edge of our seats... I'm official hooked so keep them coming :)

B004YW4L5K|5.0|This book proves Gaiman is the brilliantly demented genius!  Read it years ago and then bought it for my Kindle so I could listen to it on a 12 hour road trip...got even more out of it the second time around.  Time and money VERY well spent.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Because they are a great group.  Love lady Anterbellum, she completes this song. I would recomend it to everyone. Love it!!
030759565X|5.0|I do love the recipes and those i've tried have been hugely successful, but i mostly love that Deb managed to take her blogging popularity to a commercial success level, it's very inspiring :)
B00AZ6E2DK|5.0|The used DVD was in excellent condition.  I had seen this movie at the theatre and liked it so much I decided to purchase it.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is a pretty decent game. Had my doubts cause it looked like a &quot;100 Doors &quot; ripoff but I liked this better.  Quite short though.

B008OOYALE|4.0|Well this app is really fun but, the one thing is that I have a friend that has an iPad and I have a kindle fire HD 8.9 so whenever I try to visit her it says dragon story has stopped but great game get it
B0097EWK3A|5.0|The game was fun and addicting, I couldn't put it down! It was fun being able to solve this mystery as well as have something entertaining to do on long trips! Can't wait for the second game!
B0000V6SOG|5.0|Takes you back to watching the movie...<br />not just for the holidays, but any time..if you liked the movie, you'll love the soundtrack<br />Super quick ship....smooth transaction.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Have not really used it yet...not happy about u tube as a site since I got my 2nd Kindle. The old One let me look for ltems  ---ris feature is gone on the  newer one.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|its a great tape quality good listen to it all the time, I bought one for my girlfriend too, price was great
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm speechless great book I'm a little surprised about the ending I have always been team Eric but great ending this has been one of the most amazing series I have ever read and I'm glad that I did thank you Charlaine Harris for feeding my hunger for the supernatural romance you truly are an extraordinary author.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I watched the first two seasons back-to-back and this is the first episode of Season 3. It looks to be another good season...I can't wait to see how many mistakes they make and who will get it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed the variety of clues/tools needed to escape. Some clues were not always sensitive to the touch so it would take longer to escape some rooms.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This movie is a great take on an old classic. It's new, fresh and can go for many years to come.
0425263924|5.0|The book is crazy it's even crazier that there's a book 4 coming out. I'm waiting for the Eva to do something stupid and for Gideon to go ape s***.
0812550706|5.0|This book is awesome and the movie is going to be even better. I would recommend this book to everyone!
B00C1BU8G2|4.0|Rental so this is a rating of the movie itself, not the DVD or Blu-ray product.<br /><br />After the 2nd entry, I was very much surprised with this original story.  I think I liked this one even more than the original.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie. The visuals were outstanding. This is a very good movie for the whole family to watch and it keeps the kids engaged.
B00C1C0WCQ|2.0|Rental so this is a rating of the movie itself, not the DVD or Blu-ray product.<br /><br />Didn't like the story at all.<br /><br />Very, very loosely based on the book of the same name.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Never having experienced life as a completely unwanted human being, this book was a tough, emotional read.  i was somewhat disappointed that the author chose not to include some guidance regarding Victoria's pregnancy.  I haven't every experienced life in foster homes or being the ward of the court.  It was a raw, touching, tear your heart out story.  It reminded me of some of the poverty I have seen in my travels to developing countries.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Always entertaining  and full of surprises.  It has everything, great acting, drama, humor, and it wrapped in an always delightful package.  Always makes you wanting more!
1451695195|1.0|I wanted to like this book but there were so many signs of improbability to the story I just couldn't do it. By the end of the book I was sure that the author and his editors were selling snake oil.<br /><br />Alexander tried very hard to distance himself from religion and new age spirituality in the beginning of his book so he could seem more credible once he starts telling his outlandish story. \\"Believe me. I'm a Neurologist. I know the brain better than you.\\" \\"Believe me. I wasn't religious before.\\" \\"Believe me. I was a skeptic of the highest order so if I can be convinced it must be true.\\"<br /><br />He claimed not to be religious yet one of the first people to his bedside is the Rector of their church. A close friend obviously as only the closest of friends and family stay by you at the hospital through such a trauma. His wife describes their close friend Sylvia as a psychic. Another close friend of his wife, Susan Reintjes, is, according to the author an intuitive. A description that he calls a \\"fact\\" that never got in the way of his feelings about her. Contrary to what he says in his book he was clearly influenced by religion before his so called NDE and he was receptive or at least tolerant of New Age thinking.<br /><br />The book is called \\"Proof of Heaven\\" yet there was no evidence or proof provided. It was a story. An accounting of one person's experience. Who's to say these experiences happened while he was in a coma? Why couldn't these experiences have happened once he became conscious and was experiencing his post-coma psychosis? He briefly refers to a \\"reboot phenomenon\\" in his list of possible scientific explanations at the end of the book but dismisses it as \\"most unlikely\\" without any explanation of why it would be unlikely.<br /><br />The revelation about his birth sister toward the end made his book feel more like a novel with an unexpected twist at the end of the story. I certainly felt manipulated there. Perhaps it was not Dr. Alexander but hiseditors who insisted on the \\"plot twist\\" but regardless it was a blatant manipulation purely for entertainment value. This writing technique certainly leads me to call into question his intention for the book and weakens his claim that his experience was a valid scientific observation and proof of the afterlife.<br /><br />If I was skeptical when I finished the book, I was certain when I visited his website ([...] Dr. Alexander isn't wasting any opportunity to make more money from his story. You can buy an \\"All is Well\\" bracelet from Etsy for $70 memorializing his first words out of the coma. You can go on an exclusive 5 star retreat in Greece with Dr. Alexander where in addition to \\"experiential\\" and informative presentations some speakers will be offering individual \\"healing sessions\\" no doubt for a hefty additional fee. If that's not enough for you, you can buy Dr. Alexander's four 90 minute Video Meditation Learning Sessions for $59!<br /><br />He is a slick speaker too... just watch his many interviews. He has a well-rehearsed shtick that seems very contrived.<br /><br />To be clear I'm not weighing in on whether NDEs really happen or whether there is, in fact, an after life. What I am weighing in on is Dr. Alexander's integrity as an author. He is not being completely honest about who he is and what his motivations are. Reader beware.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This has been such a great series.  I have loved every episode of Downton Abbey-Season 1,2 and 3.  Can't wait to see a season 4.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I enjoy this show and have been for the duration its been on.<br />It's fun, interesting, intriguing and keeps me watching it for the great stories unlike any other and the acting is stupendous
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Having read all 3 Crossfire books I would defiantly say this was the best. Loved the pace the writing & the story seemed to have more life & soul to it. Could not put it down.<br />Waiting to read more of the Crossfire Series.<br />The book does not seem hurried like most authors do in their later books! like they are just rushing to complete the story. Keep it up Sylvia , Luv your books .
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I loved watching this show. I love musicals so it was right up my alley! I'm sorry it had to end but it did<br />end at a good spot in the plot:-)
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Predictable and very common plots. You pretty much know whats going to happen at the start of the book. Sounds like the author ran out of ideas.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|This is the Queensryche release I have been waiting for for a very long time. Todd brings new life to this band which has been needed for many years. This release is a blend of Rage for Order and Mindcrime just progressive enough with some heavy hitters thrown in toward the end. If you have been disappointed in the last three or four Queensryche releases this one will finally renew your love for this band.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|At first I was unsure if I was reading an adult book. To my delight it proved to be just that. Written very well, it delivers the mystical adventures of a seven year old as told by the adult. Thoroughly enjoyed it!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I've been waiting for an actual youtube app, but sadly, none have surfaced on the Amazon appstore. I decided to give this a try despite its apparent low user rating. This app is a fitting replacement app until we get the real thing. It has a search bar, a favorites section, and you can even sign in (don't worry, I haven't received spam yet, so using your email is safe) and manage your subscriptions and playlists. Yes, the ads do get annoying, but honestly, its a free app so it's a small price to pay to have something like this. Adds aside, I'm extremely glad I took a chance and downloaded this app. It deserves 5 stars because its free and is exactly what it claims to be; an accurate, suitable youtube app for the Kindle Fire HD.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|The item was great however it did not help my situation, my kindle charge port is damaged which did'nt allow me to charge it
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great read. This was a captivating story-I couldn't put it down! I really liked the way the author handled the main character's mental health issue with sensitivity and insight.
B000MVN8GK|5.0|You must watch all three seasons.<br />A television show that actually deals with classism, racism and sexism.<br />Smart, sarcastic and entertaining.
B004UID2LC|1.0|After downloading this app I wasn't able to download or watch a single video.  Never did figure out what was wrong with it.
0061950726|5.0|It was so well done that I wanted to read more. Give me a different prospective on the children that were sent on the Orphan Train.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a great little flash for the money, I would buy this flash again if I had to.  I also recommend getting the Stofen Omni-Bounce for Nikon SB-400 Flash Diffuser unit OM-400 to go with it.
B003CI90MQ|3.0|Good tips, but they could have been summarized succinctly in a couple of pages. It was disappointingly short for a book.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I enjoyed a lot, it's easy to lead with and has a good connection, I now just go to bed, and see what is happening in the desktop...
B005C8ENI0|4.0|A good fantasy trial lawyer movie where he does the right thing for the right reasons. I was glad that it didn't try to portray meth dealers and other crooks as misunderstood. To bad Marisa Tomei did not have a bigger part.
1781162646|4.0|As a long time fan of Stephen King, I've enjoyed most of his work throughout the years. This is a well written and delivered story that has just the right combination of crime, supernatural and personal involvement. An easy read and well worth the cost.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love this game named subway surfers it is awesome .I have a lot of fun on this subway surfers game.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|i REALLY LIKE THE EXTENDED BETTER, IT HELPS EXPLAIN WHY JACOB WAITED SO LONG TO GO OUT AND CONFRONT THE PACK.  REALLY LIKE THE DISH THROWING.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I could not put it down. We take for granted all of the small things we see or do each day. This story reminds us to be good to one another, and don't give up hope.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun game!  Have a pen and paper by your side to write down codes and clues!  This game is addictive.
B004JK61K0|4.0|One on the things I like the best about K9 is you can do a lot to tweak it to your likes.<br />The mail apps that came on my smartphone and Kindle leave a LOT to be desired.<br />This one never disappoints.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read.  Well, tried to read as I couldn't stomach any more after the first two chapters.  No wonder the movie based on this book bombed.  If you enjoy 18th (?) century literature where everything is described in the most excruciating detail to the point of insanity - then this puppy is for you.  I'm betting that quite a few of the folks who gave this book a high rating were simply too embarrassed to admit that they made a bad purchase, or maybe it's just a case of misery loving company?  I can think of so many ways I could have wasted $11.99 that would have given me some pleasure, but buying this book wasn't one of them.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have a tablet and smart phone.<br />Both native calendar apps are horrible.<br />Almost unusable.<br />Found this after extensive internet searches recommending various apps.<br />This one came highly recommended.<br />I purchased for both my smart phone and then again because my Kindle uses Amazons proprietary apps store.<br />Even got a copy for sons Ipod so he could stay organized.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|I appluade the makers of this one.great job.good pat on the back for u. i highly suggest downloading this app.its got great colour graphics and a touch of humour ;) great app for all ages.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Son has an Ipod and I have a smartphone.<br />Helps keep us sync'd.<br />The only issue is I also have it on my Kindle and get logged out when switching devices.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have an 8 month old child and we've used this app since the day she came home. Helps to relax her and puts her to sleep faster. We love it!!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Historically based novels are the best way for me to learn the history of my own country.  This book took a look at what happened to orphans and didn't whitewash the events.  A real eye opener.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Great story and love the characters.  If you are a fan of Downton Abby you will be a fain of this show.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's nice that this app didn't have horror or gore.  she wants more rooms to solve.  We are waiting for the next release.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|This is a great app for making scan's via your phone. It's simple and intuitive, yet more than gets the job done. I'd recommend it to anyone and liked it so much that even my wife has gotten it because she's seen me using it. So worth it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Brilliant game, not too hard and not too easy.<br />A very good game and can't wait for a new release from the makers. Download now.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Got it.  Watched it.  Loved it on Amazon!!!<br /><br />We don't have cable/dish TV, so this enables us to watch many of our favorite shows for a fraction of the cost of these other services.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|I really loved movie. I liked the suspense and thought the actors were well placed in their rolls. GREAT drama!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Mark Owen does a good job of speaking to an audience with little military understanding.  If what he says is true about not revealing any top secret information, then he is to be congratulated for telling this story.  The training involved for Navy Seals is clearly communicated making the information accessible to all.
0307888908|5.0|Great book for entrepreneurs and people who would like to develop a career plan. I finished the book in few days
B001P7HUF0|5.0|This movie stands the test of time and is totally engaging from beginning to end. Highly recommended for your viewing
B0044C5SCU|5.0|You just haven't lived until you sit down with chocolate pudding and a root beer float to watch Walter and Walternate!
B00DF0POXA|4.0|Lyrics a tad off putting but the beats are among the finest Kanye's ever conjured. To be owned by any rap enthusiast.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Constat action keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire read, Sanderson excels at concluding Jordan's life work.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't believe I totally enjoyed reading this book and every book written in this series. Wish there were more :(
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After we finished book one we went on to books two and three, so the book read lasted a bit longer
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Is an interesting activity that may create an awareness for a horse crazy kid.  This also reinforces the need for positive interaction that is simply created through spending time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My friends and I did this as a book club read and it was worth the time it took to read
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I've ordered two cases from CougarCell and I've never had any major issues with the product.  I tried LifeProof because I was in the military and wanted something that was not easily worn out, plus it's nice slim case was so much better than bulky cases I've used in the past and would fit perfectly in small pockets in my uniform. This case if definitely a keeper.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|He absolutely fell in Love and is watching so much television of Enterprise it's unreal.  But, I always know where to find him.
B0036UMM84|5.0|I went to this movie when it first came out and enjoyed then and I still enjoyed the music and the movie
B004QK5N5W|5.0|works on my apple 4s. I like it . no complaints. I wish it would work on the apple 5 phone
B002PYW26O|3.0|It was ok. it was entertaining. so happy I only rented it because more than likely I will never watch it again
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Doesn't entirely make up for lack of forward momentum that was lost with &#34;a feast for crows&#34; but a worthwhile entry into the series.
B008HK3RVY|4.0|This simple sleeve provides sufficient protection from everyday use.<br />If you're prone to dropping things, I suggest investing in a sturdier form of protection.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Fun to watch again. So not politically correct, makes me wish we could go back to those common sense days.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a turtle the cookie cutter and yellow pages search engine rankings and the toilet paper is a toilet seat in vivo the toilet paper and yellow the talking about how the cookie toilet and yellow the toilet paper and y chromosome
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|This movie was good and quite entertaining. I think there was a much smaller budget compared to the first 3 movies, since there was an overwhelming amount of cgi. I must say the majority of cgi is very well done. Just a couple points where it's not so great. Of course the scenery is amazing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome just awesome gets harder and harder as you go I wish there was more challenging games out there like this one it really makes my brain work
098555780X|5.0|Great book very helpful, drawings and instructions are very clear.  This guy knows his stuff, will be buying the volume!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I would like  more levels please.  I finished all of the levels in just one day.  It makes you think.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Most of all they are doing looks new and is a gun ride! If you like Sci-Fi, not Sci- Horror, then this will be great.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I love Downton Abbey, so this series fit my tastes well. My only complaint is that the musial score seemed hokey at times.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|I have been an over the top fan since Warning was released. After the last few releases, I had almost given up on them. This album is the fuel they needed to re-Take hold of the Flame...
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Normally I never write reviews but this game is just amazing. The graphics are great and the storyline is very interesting that you just wanna keep playing until you get to the end . I've played several similar games but I finish them in about 2-3 hours. This game was much longer. It is totally worth the money.
B003B96AOW|4.0|I collect these figures for my nephew and his son. I know daddy likes it and I'm sure his son will also.
B00CWVFZ8W|2.0|There are a few clever, interesting moments in this film, but mostly it is very embarrassing for all concerned.  A prime example is Emma Thompson, whose every moment on screen is worthy of a cringe.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Admittedly I am just a bit bitter that this is the last of the series and it didn't end the way I wanted it to, so take my rating with a grain of salt.  If you like the series you will like this.  Sookie has such charming narrative that it is hard not to enjoy reading the book even if things are not going the way I want.
B002WY65W4|4.0|Hands down my favorite Zombie movie and with Bill Murray's cameo role, it would be hard to beat! Love the safety rules when encountering zombie territory. Twinkies definitely rule over Snowballs!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I love this CD! I play it all the time! I think this is his best one yet. Highly recommend it!
B003HARV4S|1.0|What an outstanding movie!  But it's hard to appreciate if one is hard of hearing!  I purchased this on blue ray to get the best enjoyment experience.  I wear two hearing aids, but I don't get most of a conversation.  I had a difficult time. Thus one star.  Otherwise it's 5 stars!
B0000009XP|3.0|I am not quite sure when this was recorded&#60;I dont think it is<br />anywhere near the standard of most other Buddy cd`sI have bought'<br />but with this man you cannot go wrong.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is absolutely my favorite book. I . Have read it more than ten times and every time it pulls me in and I read it in 2 or 3 days. Now that I have finished the book again I'm going to go. Watch the movie!! Happy reading!
B0000033IS|5.0|I absolutely love anything and everything that this lady does.<br />There is nobody in this world with a voice like Aretha.<br />If she records something,I buy it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just when you think you know what will happen next, the plot takes another unexpected turn. Very impressed with the quality of the acting. Am not a student of Victorian England but this sure looks like an authentic portrayal. There is great attention to detail. This is the kind of series you wish would go on forever. I refuse to watch network TV because of the barage of commercials. Got this free with Amazon Prime - can't beat that!
B000UOOT1W|5.0|What is there to say he is Carlos and there is nothing else like him.<br />I thoroughly enjoy this cd and would recommend it to anybody.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Good read. Entertaining Transitions a bit roughly, but it all comes together.  Difficult to express ideas and theme well done.  Courageous writing by an author who says what he wants to say and says it well.
B004AHNIGM|3.0|I bought this on a whim and it is nothing like what I expected it to be.<br />I suppose for Greg Allman fans it is ok.I like it anyhow
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Entertaining and fantastic teaching tool. Concise, clear and to the point commentary doesn't get published, I have to add this fluff to comment. Ridiculous.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great!! This was a fun game. I just wish it had more levels. It was a great challenge. Glad I got it.
B0064MGU98|4.0|A level of underlying intensity and risk increases your interest in seeing it to the end.  Quality of actors is excellent.
0060989157|5.0|I grew up loving motley crue! This book was great! Alot of \\"the dirt\\" in the book actually surprised me
B00CWY76CC|4.0|ti's a good game I play a lot cant stop battery almost dead<br />so u should get it too too too good game
B003B02O14|4.0|Enjoyed the book but had a disappointing end, not what I expected, major question left unanswered , no conclusion in my opinion
B00280LYHS|5.0|I almost cried at the thought of this book series ending. And I hope, for all you potential readers, that you enjoy this as much as I did.<br /><br />(<br />  )<br />(
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This is truly one of the most addictive books I have picked up in awhile and is a testament to what I see as an amazing author of the art of writing.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|It's a quirky, but not laugh out loud comedy.  Certainly worth a rental or purchase.  It even has big name stars.  Entertaining.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I never played temple run...but this is entertaining and the graphics are quite good.  The only thing I don't like is that you are pretty much running g the same route over and over.  It would be more fun if at a certain point you do not start right at the beginning again.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Great tool that keep me in touch with younger siblings without having to Skype. Usefulness is very easy as if using a phone.
B004AO4FJ4|4.0|Season 1 of the reboot was great it reintroduces us to the Doctor and also Rose arguably one of the best companions.
B003XQPYR2|5.0|I didn't know the story of Robin Hood before he became Robin Hood.  Ridley Scott made this movie interesting<br />and filled with great fight spectacles.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|Delivery took longer than expected, packing is not up mark.<br /><br />Biggest watch in my collection, the finishing is very good. Nice design.<br />Feel light with the kind of size, and the good price.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|My daughter's very happy. However, bits fall off it very easily and I can see that she'll be frustrated when she loses the pen and UV ink nib.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|i downloaded this to my kindle fire and have been enjoying it. i have enjoyed duels of the planeswalkers since the 2011 version and have purchased each one since to see what kind of changes. they have come a long way with the dotp line and have added many features that make it even more enjoyable. the graphics in this version are excellent, and the controls are quite intuitive on the fire.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This app works nice. I really like the fact that it has a better ui then most of the youtube apps out here in the android market. Still doesnt compete with googles official youtube app, in look and feature wise, but this app gets the job done. Works better without the ads
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Loved it!  Continued on with the Shift Series.  Good Science Fiction read. Plan on completing the entire series reading Dust next.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I have heard of this book for many years and just had never read it.  It was way too long and repetative, but I made it to the end.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Struggled to follow the story and then suddenly it clicked and I couldn't put down! I'm flipping to the next page in a frenzy and then whack- slap in the face I'm done! Kindle reading gives no warning that you are approaching the end unless you keep the % bar in view so I was shocked to find the story done.  Agh. I needed more!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this looks similar to a lot of linear type car games but this leaves them in the dust. the plot is simple, get as far as you can before you either run out of gas, crash, or the terrain blocks you. extra gas is available and coins each run. use the coins to upgrade your ride to get past difficult terrain, to unlock new vehicles, and new runs. tip - motorcycle on moon run gets a ton of quick cash. focus on unlocking these for quick progression.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great alarm clock like the sounds it offers easy to use and you get to choose the style clock you like
B00499NHLC|5.0|Feature Film Quality Production. Story line & plot - Sir A.C.D. - how could it miss? Outstanding direction & acting.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you love the 50 shades of grey, you will love this book. A much better written book then 50 shades and follows a fast pace.  I couldn't put it down!
0761129235|5.0|I heard the author  Dr. Maurer on radio in an interview concerning Kaizen, the science and its simplicity. These principles are simple enough even for me . :0) Since I bought this book a few yrs ago, and by taking one baby step at a time; I've quit smoking, rid my 3 car garage of over 3 decades of  the - ** I might need it someday**-  stuff.!  I've lost 45 lbs. And after 40 yrs out of High school -returned to college.  I started by simply looking up the phone # and writing it on a sticky note that I'd see every day.  Need to send a postponed letter to your grandma?  Get out the envelope.  Find the address, address he envelope. 3 tasks... Even if you do 1 a week, you are still closer to getting it sent than you were 3 weeks ago. Thumbs up!
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|The free version had a lot of locked features you couldn't use. somehow it asked to purchase the upgrade. My daughter knows not to, but somehow it charged our account the 9.99. there is no way to reverse this charge. Not happy with amazon for making this continue to happen.
B00AJF87QU|5.0|I have a number of albums by the &#34;Phonics&#34;, this is one of my favourites, there is not a duff track on the album. Kelly Jones has a unique voice, as soon as he opens his mouth you know it is him! As a songwriter he is a genius. If you only buy one Stereophonics album this should be the one (or maybe Just Enough Education to Perform or perhaps Language Sex Violence Other?)
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|This works as a really good pilot to a Judge Dredd TV show, but as a movie it's really small-scale and doesn't have all that much depth. Mainly it's missing the intrinsic dark comedy of the comic book; by taking the world so seriously Dredd loses much of its charm. Honestly if the Stallone Judge Dredd had just kept the damn helmet on the entire time, I'd probably pick that movie over this one.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|In my opinion the top film of 2009 and one of the top five films of our young century. Sam Rockwell is brilliant, Duncan Jones makes magic with no money in his feature directorial debut, the score is tremendous and the story is sci-fi at its absolute best. There is just nothing bad I can say about this movie. I adore it.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|classic this started the whole star trek fad,  real good and doesn't seem dated  I'll watch all three seasons,  it's o-k
B001L26THY|5.0|Clapton playing traditional blues can be as good as it gets, and he proves it on From The Cradle.  Some really good slide work here as well.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Very sweet and funny. A lovely story about new love. I laughed and I cried. Just amazing.  :)
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|Everything I love in a movie - good actors, good story, and music.  Chiwetel Ejiofor was phenomenal - incredibly multi-talented performer.  The real story behind the movie is interesting as well.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|First of all, what kind of ending was that? Disappointing for sure. Fifty got me started in reading erotica books and was the first I've read of the series kind. Just when I thought Eva and Gideon won me over Christian and Ana then Entwined comes out, poor ending, leading to weak ending leading to book 4 that won't be released until late 2013 early 2014. Really Sylvia. I personally would not have began reading Crossfire if I had known it was 5 books to this series, it's just that Fifty left me wanting more because I loved it and had never read anything like it. I hope book 4 washes away the disappointment of Entwined, they find somewhat of real happiness with of course looking forward to their great sex. I do want more of Crossfire but am pissed off too lol. Too short of a time span in this book. Sylvia's gotta give us something better than this. Even with E.L. James really how long does it take to figure out who will be playing Christian and Ana. It's getting played out already. P.S. Sylvia if you're getting movie offers from Lionsgate I would suggest you finish the complete series already. Disappointed but of course have to read 4 & 5, hopefully 5 comes out before 2015!
0385528752|5.0|Switch is an easy to read book with simple concepts that everyone can use to make change. try it yourself
B004KZOXJA|5.0|I didn't hold high hopes for this, as they're always crushed by the bland or poor or unimaginative writing and story of other YA authors. FINALLY an author who can actually write! It's clear that Oliver has natural talent (unlike many others), actually written multiple drafts and listened to editors!<br /><br />This book is a breathe of fresh air. It has real emotion, something completely lacking in the majority of YA books.<br /><br />Great writing and an interesting human story of the constant terror of living in a complete surveillance state, which is only too familiar for our contemporary situation. The love story is excellent and I can't wait to read more.
B000L53D4O|5.0|My little niece loved it She got up and started walking around the house with it and she is only 1

B006LSZECO|5.0|Don't want to give away the ending but highly suggest reading. Very entertaining and hard to put down at times.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|i love little women because of all the people in it with this book non of the charcters are alike but yet they are in thier own way . their always compaining about how they wish they were rich but yet they are their rich withlove and care.<br />this book reminds us that we all have little woman inside us.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this and I have seemed to have gotten addicted to it because I play it everyday just about even though I barely win bingo's i still find myself coming back for more and playing it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A daughter of old Philadelphia as well of a member of rabid Eagle football fans (although not one myself; dislike sports of all kinds) I loved this book.  One would expect some one like Pat Peoples to just sink deeper into himself and give up and look for w ay out.  But luckily NO; with his excellent philosophy &#34;be kind&#34; leads you to believe he will survive despite family and friends.<br />  Very well written and with a very literate style it brings reminders of what are sometimes thought of as &#34;men's authors&#34; like Hemingway.  As some one with sufferers of mental illness in my family I found great comfort in the ending<br />  As also a former English teacher/librarian I would also recommend this book for older teens looking for their place in life to see that no matter how bad they think things are a Silver Lining is possible.
B004G0SJU8|5.0|I almost forgot about this movie until i was browsing amazon trying to find something to watch because there was nothing to watch in netflix and then I saw this movie. This movie made having amazon prime worth while because I was able to watch it for free even more awesome.
B00847KFDS|5.0|The review given in Rolling Stones magazine was spot on in ranking this album as 5 star. We thoroughly enjoy it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have always wanted this game but couldn't get it now i am playing it everywhere i love it<br />Fun
B00A3OJBMG|4.0|When starting this season I felt like seen that and heard that...Yeah...I was a bit jaded by the series...it's hard to make a show with 8 seasons interesting for so long...especially when the main cast has only 2 characters...then things start getting interesting between Dean and Sam where there is an ultimatum presented...my recommendation: stick with it...it gets better! :)
B009CG955Y|5.0|I love Dr. Seuss! This is a great movie, and has a wonderful message. We love it! Great quality, and great music!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Easy to work with. One of the rare apps to work with extremely large images with ease. Cool app. Does it what it says.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|I was totally hooked for the first half of this novel - after all, I had been waiting for Kaleb's story since book three!  However, things got a little stale near the end, and the final scene felt anti-climactic.  Without the changelings for most of the story we have a tug-of-war between two defective psy and maybe that was it, although there are many beautiful scenes between them.  This is a great read; I just wish I could have had a bit more oomph in the second half.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I downloaded this on my grandsons kindle and I cannot even play Farmville 2. In fact I can't play any of my facebook games.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|What started off as an inside joke in the studio, quickly panned out into one of the greatest CGI movies this side of the millenia. Gamers and non-gamers alike can appreciate the simple yet lovable characters played by John C Riley and Sarah Silverman.<br /><br />The story of someone; who all their life has been treated as an outcast, shunned for who he is. With a realization that he wants more out of life, Ralph escapes from his game on a search for the key to being loved and respected. With incredible cameo's from video game characters new and old, this movie has something for everyone, regardless of age.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I could not put this book down until I finished reading it.  This book will captivate you, make you cry, give you hope and open your eyes to a world in which millions of women have struggled through with courage and an indomitable spirit.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Great.  Joe and Beth together is more than one could hope for in an album. Loved it!  You have to have this if you like Joe.
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|My first, but not last Kurt Vile album.  I wasn't too impressed at first listen, but the album really &#34;opens up&#34; with repeated listening.  Very nice.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Good read. Classic Grisham.  As always he brings his characters to life.  I don't think we have seen the last of David Zinc and can't wait for the next book.
B00B6OEDS4|4.0|Good stuff all around.  It's the dance-ish album Sade has yet to release.  Very smooth and polished.  Perfect for romance or headphones.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies that I have enjoyed for years. Had it all and kept me interested all the way through.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I'm not even going to get into the whole Team Bill Team Eric topic. I will say I have thought Sookie would end up with Sam as her HEA since about half way though the series and listening to Charlaine Harris in interviews. Did I want her with Sam? No! But that is Not why I dislike this book so much! This was her world she created and her ending to tell...but at least it should have been an ending worth reading! I have been faithful to this series and to this author but after reading this last book that I can honestly say there are only a handful of books I have read that are worse than this one and those I never finished and the only reason I stuck to the end here is the time I invested with this series and now wish I wouldn't have. Charlaine Harris not only changed her way of writing this last book from all the others in the series but she changed the personality of all the people in it. Sam and Eric was the two biggest changes in my opinion. Sam I didn't recognize at all and I have loved his soft heart since the beginning but I caught myself wondering did I know him at all in the series...then Eric was really no where to be seen and when he was he was no longer the powerful determined vamp we have all come to know. I was so confused in this book from the very being...through the whole thing I felt like it was reunion of everyone who come across Sookies life in the past through out the entire series, and half of them I forgot about and some didn't remember at all. It felt more like how many people can we bring back in this book than actually telling a story. For the most part the book didn't make any since and seemed so thrown together and so out of character for Mrs Harris. This did not feel like her writing at all or the story she started out telling... I felt like it was a whole different environment within all new people! As far as Sookies HEA? Let's just say, yes I had my preference and he was a vampire but Charlaine Harris made it very clear Sookie never wanted to be turned and never would be so I excepted that, but would it be to much to ask for a build u with Sam? It went from nothing but friends to sex like they never been through anything...no flirting...no innuendos...no dating...nothing. like I stated before, I already thought she would end up with Sam and although I might not have been a big fan of this idea I was sure the writing would get me there and I would be happy because the build up would have allowed for that adjustment but I was so wrong...I'm left completely empty and although Sookie had her HEA, it in know way felt like it! There is one thing written in this book that felt right...if Eric had to leave at least Pam was left to be Sheriff... but she wasn't her witty self either..... Conclusion? : Never been more disappointed in the writing of a book! It honestly sucked no matter who Sookie ended up with!
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|This movie was full of action,it kept my intrest,was full of exciting parts that kept you on edge. I liked this movie but thinking about children I would not recomend it because of all the violence.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Teaches some basic economics.  Takes a little while to get used to the steering but pretty fun after that.  Try it.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|This was a good movie,but the only thing that made it less desirable,was having to read subtitles,for the language was foreign.
0143121421|5.0|An extremely economical and beautifully constructed novel. It's incredible to think that this was his third novel, written early in his life, while he was working a day job at an embassy! I'm not a spy novel enthusiast in general but I now look forward to reading more LeCarre.
0066620996|5.0|It addresses a lot of issues that you'd face in business and makes you think about the consequences and impact all your decisions will have.<br />Gives you a great framework! I was assigned to read this book, and even though built to last wasn't assigned to us for reading, I will be reading it as Good to Great says it's a prequel.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love the story. It appears to realistic with the cast accepting life is short and making hard decisions. I like the fact that they all have their own demons to content with but when a crisis hit they all pull together to fight the common enemy whether it is a walker or a new human foe.
B002QNBRXS|3.0|This show started off as a great idea, but the further along it got, the more far fetched everything seemed, suspenseful far fetched. I know the series is ending soon, but it could have wrapped up sooner!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. A lot of good plot twists. An overall excellent read & very well written!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game. a lot like can you escape. ;) :) :) play on my kindle fire. niece loves it too. cant wait for more floors.
0812993845|4.0|From Book Description:<br />Lottie just knows that her boyfriend, Richard is going to propose during lunch at one of London's fanciest restaurants. But when his big question involves a trip abroad, not a trip down the aisle, she's completely crushed. So when Ben, an old flame, calls her out of the blue and reminds Lottie of their pact to get married if they were both still single at thirty, she jumps at the chance. No formal dates--just a quick march to the altar and a honeymoon on Ikonos, the sun-drenched Greek island where they first met years ago.<br /><br />Their family and friends are horrified. Fliss, Lottie's older sister, knows that Lottie can be impulsive--but surely this is her worst decision yet. And Ben's colleague Lorcan fears that this hasty marriage will ruin his friend's career. To keep Lottie and Ben from making a terrible mistake, Fliss concocts an elaborate scheme to sabotage their wedding night. As she and Lorcan jet off to Ikonos in pursuit, Lottie and Ben are in for a honeymoon to remember, for better . . . or worse.<br /><br />Review:<br />The story reminded me of the old screwball comedies but the execution is fresh and the characters are fresh. Lottie is adorable and Fliss is lovable even though both have some flaws. The relationship between the sisters with polar opposite personalities is portrayed well. Richard, Ben and Lorcan are also developed nicely through out the book. Fliss has an adorable 7 years old son. He is super cute. He contributes a lot to the humor. The characters grow as the book progresses.<br /><br />There are a lot of laugh-out-loud funny moments which will keep the reader entertaining. The pace is also very good. I finished the book in one sitting. Definitely, worth reading. Give it a try.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use every night at bedtime. I like trying to do several sounds together. The sounds are kind of different together.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Well written and gets better with every turn of the page.  It's an erotic love story mixed with suspense & mystery.  Can't wait to read book three.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|i JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET ENOUGH OF HER BOOKS.  THIS SERIES IS ONE OF THE BEST THAT I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME.  CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK TO COME OUT
B00633W614|5.0|The saga of the two families through three generations was extremely entertaining.  The abrupt finish to the last novel left me wanting another.
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|&#34;Enterprising Young Men&#34; was the piece that really got me into composing and arranging my own music, and I was incredibly eager to see the next Star Trek installment since I heard the music in the first. I got to the theater, watched the movie, went home and bought this album just because I was so impressed. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to be a composer, for Giacchino is a genius and if you really listen close you can hear some pretty amazing sounds that will inspire you, well they did for me at least.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|A This alarm clock is functional and easy to use. Works extremely well and ease of settings make it very good and simple to use.

B00BFV1JZI|3.0|Not much to say about this one. It is an easy read. Is this the second or third book? Those two are both just okay.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|After the walking dead this is the best zombie story line I have read in a long time.  Can't wait to . Try Mr. Brooks other books.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|The acting is stellar. The viewer is right there in the space with the actors....it seems so spontaneous!  If aging is this much fun and love....sign me up!
B009KYQO8E|3.0|The subject matter of this movie and some of the action was interesting, but the characters were pretty shallow and disposable.
0345529057|3.0|The first two books were very good; however the 3rd and 4th were disappointing. You keep reading because you want to see what happens to the characters, but they are not central to these last books.

B0076HNMU0|4.0|Fun, quirky show.  The cast settled into their roles well.  The characters were written well, with nuance.  Certainly, at times, stereotypical, yet all plausable and real.

B00C1BHQXK|5.0|This book is a must read for every Business Owner!<br />I am so impressed with Keller-Williams' company philosophy and see why it has grown to be #1 in Real Estate.  This book has so many attributes...one is that long after I stop reading I think about what Keller said in the book, and have implemented his suggestions in my business.  I realized that my business success has been that I stuck with one thing through out the last 12 years....so that was validating.  In addition to my own book, Attracting Perfect Customers...I now recommend Keller's  book to my Coaching Clients because trying to be everything to everyone is something I see with many of my clients who are struggling.<br />In the book I appreciated Keller's authenticity about how he overcame challenges he faced in business.  It's truly inspiring to anyone who is building a business and will add fuel to keep going...never give up no matter what!<br /><br />Jan H.

B007ZXK08C|4.0|A good read.<br />Lots of interesting twists.<br />The characters were really vivid and I felt sympathy for the main character.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Incredible cast of characters with such complex relationships. So much like the book Remains of the Day. Loved this season, except for ending.
B001E7EONC|3.0|I really enjoy Jason Statham movies even though they can border on the ridiculous.<br />He's a good actor and perfect for action movies.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Scorsese adapts to modern technology and modern crime briliantly. It is not as revolutionary a film as &#34;Taxi Driver&#34; but it is one of the best films of the past 5 years.
B0050X1OQ6|1.0|I purchased this memory along with a new Synology DS1512+ NAS and five Western Digital Red 3 TB HD's.  When I put this memory into the Synology unit and booted it, the system reported 5 GB RAM is present - which is impossible (you should see either 1 GB or 3 GB).  In speaking with Synology technical support, they said that sometimes 3rd party RAM is flaky, and recommended that I purchase their Synology memory - which I did.  With the Synology memory inserted into my DS1512+ unit, the system reports (correctly) 3 GB RAM.  Maybe I got a bad batch of Kingston ValueRAM, but for whatever reason, it DOES NOT work with my Synology DS1512+ (even after I upgraded to DSM 4.2).
B004GYY714|5.0|I downloaded this while at our cabin over the weekend, and loved how easy is was to use and the variety of listening choices.<br />I think I will be using it a lot.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I find all of Disney's movies are great for kids and adults, good messages and animation.  Children and adults love them.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The story is of the Orphan Trains in American history.  I had no idea  the number of orphan children who roamed the streets of New York in the late 19th and early 20th centuries of the united states.  The story of a young Irish girl was horrifying ,yet had a great ending.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story, and also some education not mentioned in our history books.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Great movie, bought it for my grandchildren, movie sends a good message about how to treat the planet we live on.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I enjoy puzzles but I have young kids and my pieces are always getting lost. These pieces don't. It is challenging enough to not be boring. I like this app
0345529057|5.0|I love this series.  Book 4 disappoints, especially after the masterpiece that is book 3.  But there are definitely some joys in book 4.  Remember book 4 and book 5 are on the same time line so if you are so inclined to do so, you should read them at the same time and that way you can read about all the characters you like without missing them for a whole book. :)<br /><br />Waiting on book 6, GRRM!
159463176X|5.0|This book leaves your heart hurting, but in a good way. Another relatable tale of family, love, and tragedy. Really an amazing read.
B005IT0V8O|4.0|Some spelling rules etc. have changed, but for individuals who can't afford a new edition, this Kindle version is useful. It still has good advice on writing itself.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After reading the reviews I decided not to buy this book.  I sympathize with all of the people who now feel cheated.  I only read two of Silvia book and I am now thankful.  This book demonstrates that she is greedy and I will never buy another one of her books.  You do not make people pay $20.00 for two books advertise it is a three set series them add two more.  That is disrespectful to the readers and a stab in the back.  It demonstrates that you are greedy.  I feel sorry for all of the people who paid $10.00 for %$#*.  I hope they never read another one of your books.  I am done I will never purchase another book from your Silvia.  Shame on you, Silvia.
1781162646|5.0|I could not put this book down!  The Master had me guessing all the way. Loved the setting, the people and the touch of the supernatural. I highly recommend if you are looking for a great read. Leaves me wanting more, more more.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Homecoming was the best episode. This season wraps everything up but the finale is unsatisfying. You kind of feel like you get sucker punched at the end.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|This is the first Volbeat album I have owned.  I am really impressed by the variety of styles that they mix into the album, and I enjoy the old western theme.  I have already listened to it countless times, and it's in my car's CD player right now.
B001FB4VZS|4.0|It was okay. I got excited about Doomsday when I started watching this season but it didn't meet my expectations.
B008133MDK|5.0|Thanks, BBC for such a great show, our family loves it!  We downloaded Season 2 instead of ordering the DVD's for viewing convenience and price....a great deal.
B004G606K8|5.0|Read this book almost twenty years ago while in high school. Just as amazing now as it was then. Looking forward to reading the rest in the series again.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|Will not work on my kindle fire, bougt it expecting more but you have to pay extra for function items.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun game, makes you use your brain even when you think you have it you may not. Wish there were more than 10 floors.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its is very fun to play,<br />i love it you can really have fun playing my horse and i played it ever since i was little and i still injoy it as much aas i did before
B009RH9J7W|4.0|Overall the case is nice.  It's what I expected except for one thing, I would have liked to be able to charge my Kindle Fire HD with the case closed.  This is one feature that I will certainly look for when purchasing another case.  Thank you
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is entertaining and creative. I've built so many things! It is a game that is good for your brain and fun. Minecraft is AWESOME!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I begin reading Lee Child about 24 months ago and have read about 10 of his books.  So I am a fan.  I am not reading in order, so I just completed his first Jack Reacher novel.  I thought the violence was over the top.  And I believe he has refined the violence over the years.  I recommend this book and after reading several of his books, I suggest read in order.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Very enlightening.  There is a lot of fraud going out in the world.  This uncovers a lot of it..a very speedy delivery as always.  I also ordered Roy Rogers previously and we thoroughly enjoyed it.
B005544TRQ|4.0|This is a really light series, but the characters are such fun I can't stop watching it. It is entertaining, but doesn't require my undivided attention, which makes it perfect for watching while I'm in the kitchen cooking. I like having the full series available on Amazon Prime, as the quality is generally pretty good. I subtracted a star for Amazon's clunky interface, which requires many clicks to navigate from one episode to the next, and does not save my &#34;latest watched&#34; info, forcing me to go back and search for the next episode every time I start.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I was so upset when they took Eureka off the air, but now I can see it from the begining.
B00C1S945G|4.0|Always like Star Trek. Original series was my favorite in  the 60's then NG and Voyager in the 90's.<br />NG and other Star treks really work the characters.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Love Dr Who and now I can see it when every I want too. I am starting at the first Dr I saw the first time I saw him.
159420411X|3.0|The subtitle of this book is \\"Why so many predictions fail - but some don't.\\" How well does this book answer this question?  In my opinion, not very well. A better design for this book would begin with a formal model of prediction and then continue with a set of specific cases that show how the author's formal model can be applied. This book supplies a set of specific cases but only an incomplete and superficial model of prediction.<br /><br />By the way : there are many books on the (mis)use of frequentist statistics. I thought that the author's treatment of this subject was poor. In addition, he doesn't describe how Bayesian statistics may be inadmissible according to some philosophies of science but not others.
B008645YH6|5.0|Great songs with meaningful and clever lyrics, but it's Marina's voice that will win you over. She's a vocal treasure with excellent range a beautiful &#34;top end.&#34;. If you don't fall in love with the way she sings &#34;Lies,&#34; then you need your ears examined. I usually think an album is good if it has three or more songs I love. Electra Heart has at least eight terrific songs on it.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Another great game. I loved. That we are able to get hints when we need it.I recommend it. My only complain is that it ends and the price should be cheaper.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|This movie was entertaining but not great.  I liked the special effects...hobbit like trolls...but the storyline could have been better.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Rarely do I feel this way about an album, but it is truly the case that every song is great in its own unique way and well put-together as an album.
B004YKSXYW|5.0|Usually history is set in a particular time frame.  this book is a panorama.<br /><br />Six words to fill out the stupid.quota.
B006JPS1OM|2.0|I love this game but once I got to chapter 2 it crashed so I  had to start all over and it did it again and again and again. So don't play it because you will never know how it ends! I and a few others have the same issues!
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I am not quite finished with this book, but it goes a little slower than the first book, due to the storyline. It's still engaging and enjoyable for YA fiction.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I have never read any of Cassandra Clare's books.  This was the first one.  Now I am totally enthralled in the series.  It's a bit confusing at first, but once all the basics told, you start to see why.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This would be a excellent game IF Gameloft would actually try to fix known problems. I've been playing this game for months now. It was great at first. Then, over time it started to have problems. For example: One of the goals of the game is to accumulate/recruit allies. According to Gameloft's information about this game, you can have 5 allies for every level you achieve. I'm level 51 and can get no more than 101 allies. I should be able to get 255. There are several different reasons to gain allies. One is to be able to visit their bases and collect hearts. These hearts can be used to purchase items in the game that you can't purchase any other way. You collect 5 hearts for each ally every 24 hours, and you can only collect every 24 hours. Over time, when I try to visit an ally's base, I get the message, \\"Failed To Load Ally's Base\\". This really becomes aggravating when half your allied bases fail to load. Another \\"Failed to Load\\" is enemy bases. You attack other players, and if you win the battle, you're supposed to be allowed to invade their base and steal some of their coins they've collected. Here recently, I MIGHT get to invade 1 in 25 enemies attacked. Most of the time I get the message, \\"Failed To Load Enemy Base\\". This really ticks you off when you see that you've been attacked, see how many coins have been taken from you, counter attack them, win, then get, \\"Failed To Load Enemy Base\\" when you click on the invade button. AAARRRRGGGGHHHH! There are other glitches that Gameloft refuses to address, but I think this will give you an idea.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is so FUN!!! The only thing about ot is that to get lots of puzzles u have to buy full version but it is still awesome :) :):):)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I thought it would just be one .room - pleasantly surprised. A few too many &quot;enter the number code&quot; puzzles, however.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|This movie was quite entertaining. It had a fantasy, mystical quality about it. The cinematography was outstanding. The story was inspiring. To me it was about facing your fears and overcoming tremendous obstacles. Well worth watching.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I found the movie to be extraordinary and is now one of my all time favorites. The book in my opinion so much better and very detailed to where it's painting the scene out for you! I really recommend it!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Product was in great condition and nice addition to my collection of movies.  Can't wait to sit and watch it!
B001NLKT60|5.0|GREAT book fast paced and a real action leading characters.<br />Author puts you inside the characters head and paints a vivid picture.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Being able to hear my favorite song to wake me  up on mornings  ...i love it<br />I wake with a smile every morning
B0037VNX44|2.0|boring and unsatisfying.  This movie left me wondering why i bothered to take the time to watch it.  Maybe if you are &#34;artsy&#34; you will like it... but dont bet on it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series continues to deliver, season after season.  Its an awesome portrayal of history and how it impacted families of all shapes and sizes.  I really do enjoy the series.
B0081336FO|5.0|Written by Steven Moffat, so it's a guaranteed win.  Amazing acting, brilliant dialogue, and a fantastic translation from Doyle's writings to modern-day plots.  As a reader of Doyle's works, I have been impressed with every episode!  a must watch!
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|I thought it very dissappointing after his first two novels.<br />Started ok. but then dragged on and seemed he was just filling in the pages with uninteresting info to get to the end
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have been waiting for a game like this on Kindle for a long time. They did a great job with the conversion to mobile on this one.
B008602KQI|4.0|new idea. quite interesting as a theme. she is mrs. smart but kind of tom boy. i would recommended to friends.
6305132984|5.0|West SIde Story is a modern rendition of the classic tale of Romeo and Juliet, which is made even better by the addition of music. Though there are a few negative bits, the show as a whole is incomparable. The cast makes it even better, with  the beautiful Natalie Wood playing the star-crossed lover Maria, and Richard Beymer as her ill-fated escort Tony, passionate support being given by Rita Moreno. I would recommend this to everyone, no matter whether they are interested in romance, drama, or music.
B004TRJRD6|5.0|It's the exorcist.......what more needs to be said, great movie and ahead of its time, great effects both sound and visual. It contains plenty of extras a must have for an exorcist fan and the 1080p was crystal clear.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! Entertaining as well as showing the values and feeling of children and adults. I could hardly stop reading!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The cable which came with the Kindle did not seem to set securely into the Kindle.  This new one fits perfectly.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game. Fun for my 6 year old and I to play together. Not too challenging at least not yet.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Things are expensive to get on the game but other than that it is fun. Love seeing all the characters.
B00821PCJS|2.0|JUST DID NOT LIKE IT.  I GUESS I DO NOT LIKE ALIEN MOVIES.  I LIKE ZOMBIE MOVIES BETTER. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT
B00785P2QC|4.0|Reminds me of old school city builders game which is cool would have given 5 stars but I don't need to let my Facebook friends know my every move.
0316056863|4.0|Not as funny as I had hoped.  It is more her life story versus a book written for laughs like something from Woody Allen.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|This movie gave me the creeps, If you like scary movies, turn out the lights, get some popcorn and watch it
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|this movie is awsome i love how R gets a makeover and has my fav song midnight city by m83 and i will probly watch this 10 times and i defienitly recommend this i love warm bodies and nick holt
0307346617|4.0|It's written in kind of a historical event, instead of a A-Z type of story.  Overall I liked it and wanted to read it before I saw the movie.  My understanding is the book and movie are not really close.
B002RI9M2U|5.0|I never read a story told this way. It makes you see how much you can affect the life of someone you barely know without even realizing it.<br />I loved the way this story is told. Reading her thoughts while reading his, made me feel like I knew them a little bit more.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Awesome . So easy to use. Stores so much stuff and never gives me any issues. I recommend it to everyone.
B00447L4KA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever! I was so excited to find it on DVD at such a great price.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|The whole game is based on accruing 'glory' rating, but your glory points won't actually acrue and this is a \\"known issue\\" so all the time/money you spend on this game is a complete waste, the worst part is they know about this issue and won't fix it. Scam.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|I have always loved Megadeth and Dave. I am a metalhead and a Christian and love to see those in the metal world love God and also continue to put out awesome albums.<br />Dave stays true to form in this book and you can almost hear his voice speaking as you read. Thank you for letting us see into your heavy metal world and your beautiful heart
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|It's by far the best game I have place on my mobile devise. I like it a lot and it super fun and addictive.
B004GYY714|4.0|Although new to TuneIn, I find they have plenty of variety and allow me to listen whenever I am near a wifi signal. I have yet to explore all the offerings (ha...there are plenty of them) and know I will enjoy doing so in days to come.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Shows how you  have to depend on others sometime and friendship. Love plus a great party. I.  Love this movie and my grandson. Love it too
B0063IH60K|3.0|Actually, this only had one kind of solitaire. I won the first game...that was cool. I will probably look for one that has more varieties!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very enjoyable game that keeps you sharp. Not too difficult but not easy either- good game to pass Tim  and to keep one's mind active.
B004HXIZVC|4.0|My son and his friends and many other young artists upload their music to SoundCloud and I love to peruse what is offered. I am sure there are many more musicians I haven't yet discovered, but that's for days to come!  I highly recommend for those who don't really need to listen to the same thing that everyone else is hearing on the radio. This is real alternative stuff!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Hannibal Lecter... Need more be said? While one surely misses Anthony Hopkins' iconic Lecter... One can not help but be impressed by the series that delves deeper into the story of literature's greatest serial killer. I must admit the new Lecter took some getting used to... A much more euro trash version if I may be so bold.... However it WORKS. Lecter's character benefits greatly from the new acting and the story becomes more believable as an unstable man with a gift for understanding sociopathy slowly trails his own doctor through a series of grisly and sophisticated murders... That show a certain appreciation of art. Lecter is surely shown as a darker character... But one that you can truly see as the serial killer doctor we all know and love. I give this brilliant addition to the series five stars without a second thought. And I urge all to watch the first three episodes before making your decision. It's a brilliant psychodrama with great acting, actors, and a dark twisted story that will keep you repulsed and fascinated. Bravo.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It's hard to charge your Kindle without one of these. The dealer upgraded automatically and it works perfectly. I plug it into the charger at night and my Kindle is ready for the day.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|Like the idea behind the theme, generations need to learn from each other, but didn't like the spiritual theme in the movie. Not a movie I would recommend to Christians, Jews, or Muslims; at least not to those who takes their faith seriously.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read,could not put it down!!  I love Nicholas Sparks' books and this one met those high expectations!!  I highly recommend!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great love that you have to play to get new games...it's both challenging and entertaining ment to just play for a few minutes but it turned into a few hours 0_o
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|This is a lovely story, beautifully portrayed by a stellar cast and directed handsomely by Dustin Hoffman.  Deals with issues pertaining to old age with humor and tenderness.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|it's rare that a tv show comes along that is as well written, complex and well acted as this,  geared for adults but suitable for children.  Very creative and fun.  Robert Carlylse is phenomenal  as Rumplestiltskin.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I agree with the other reviews. I really enjoyed the first 2 books and I am totally bummed that what I thought I was reading was the final book was just a segway into another book. While the plot was okay, and there were a few interesting twists... I just could not handle how unbelievably, incredibly, outrageously, amazingly hot Giedon is. If I had to \\"hear\\" about it one more time I might have lost it. Other than that, I am just dissappointed at how the perception was that this book would be the end of their story. I am not sure I am interested in reading what happens next.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is awesome. easy, choices. the only thing missing is more scenery. do not need to bug anything to play.

B0031Q0XCA|2.0|I guess everyone has a right to their feelings, but why didn't Summer feel that whatchamacallit was good enough for her? Was it because he was just a &#34;lowly&#34; greeting card copy writer as opposed to an architect? Certainly she didn't feel that way when she was dating him. Also, sometimes people have to do things that they don't necessarily sign up for, for the time being. He was on a hero's journey. Do you penalize the hero for saving the himself and going through the process? He finally came into himself. She seemed like a two-faced, stuck up, condescending wench. It just seemed like he wasn't good enough for her. Couldn't she have broken up with before he committed himself to her? His time, his feelings, and emotions?<br /><br />I also didn't like that the days jumped around.<br /><br />I just didn't think this film was complete. Basically, at the end she goes to his favorite spot to show him she was pregnant. Like you didn't hurt him enough? What was the point of that?
B005544TRQ|4.0|Not my favorite attorney type show,  but worth a watch.  It is somewhat whitty and funny with worth while characters
B009YP9L7U|4.0|To be honest, I thought this was the book that inspired the movie what happens in vegas. Well, I was wrong. Different from what I expected, the story line is interesting, different, easy to follow and you actually get invested with the characters. I think this is a good read!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Had this been a standalone movie, with no mention of Oz, it would've fallen in line with a summer popcorn flick, like Pirates of the Caribbean (although I like Pirates better). As a prequel, this movie shouldn't exist (kind of like The Matrix, parts 2 & 3). There are so many reasons why The Wizard of Oz stands on its own, and doesn't need a back story. However, being that they chose to go there, here are a few reasons why this film falls short.<br />For starters, Raimi attempted to replicate the feel of the original film's flow (black and white to color, Kansas characters showing up as Oz characters), and did so poorly--it felt more like copy catting, than an homage. Then there was the land of Oz. Here Raimi failed to capture the quaint fairytale environment of Oz, and instead decided to make it look like epic Whoville, from Ron Howard's horrible re-telling of How The Grinch Stole Christmas. The environments are extremely CG, with no organic texture, just a lot of bright colors and \\"3D.\\"<br />And the Wicked Witch--ugh, what a disappointment. First of all, I don't recall Margaret Hamilton wearing a bustier in the original, but maybe she ditched the Playboy Bunny look, when she realized she had no chance with the Wizard. I don't have a problem with the idea of the witch starting out as a befuddled, attractive young girl, who gets duped into the \\"dark arts\\" by her psychotic sister, but if you're going to go that route, casting an actress who can actually act wicked is a good place to start (Mila Kunis can't act AT ALL, so that should've been a red flag from the outset).<br />There are a lot of little things I'll forgo mentioning, because I really don't have time to pick the movie apart, and I actually don't hate this film, it's just not memorable. The bottom line is this: there are certain classic, landmark films which SHOULD NEVER be re-made, re-booted, or expounded upon, and The Wizard of Oz is one of those films. But, if you just HAVE to see this movie, then go in expecting it to not live up to the 1939 original, and you might not be let down by such a large degree.xpecting it to not live up to the 1939 original, and you might not be let down by such a large degree.
B006LSZECO|5.0|**minor spoilers**<br />Had me biting my nails the whole book. Good suspense, Good story line. Couldn't decide who to believe and then all of the sudden, Amy shows her true colors! I didn't expect that. She is one messed up person and needs physiological help! That's how invested I became with this book. Really good job on the narrative. Loved how everything ties in eventually revealing the mind of a crazy person. I really wish for a mean ending for her but as the original story, the ending was also original.
B00B7G3BUW|5.0|I feel like they tried to squeeze too much plot into this film. They introduced so many characters in this sequel but didn't really develop them that fully. Of course, you could argue that all the characters have been built up already through the previous films/comics/TV series, but this film threw the action in and kept it coming without taking much time to examine why Batman felt a certain way when Joker said certain things. Also, I feel like his backstory with Superman could have been explained a little better too. It's not like everyone watching this is familiar with the comics or The Justice League. Also, where was Batman hiding this super strength suit during the first part of the movie?! Regardless, it was a great movie! Would recommend it to any batman fan.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the third book in this series!  Finished it two days after it came out.  I was sad when the book ended, but was pleasantly surprised to find that there will be a fourth book.  Just wonder how long we will have to wait.
B004DP9QFS|4.0|Graphics are very good. Lunar info. is very good and informative. I haven't learned how all the features work yet, but look forward to finding out how they work.  Yes, I would recommend this app. to anyone interested in the moon and its phases.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I go on every day to take care of my dragons and watch them grow. However, progress moves a little slow if you are not willing to spend extra money. I still find the game enjoyable, though.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|This is a great app. if you're into time. I like the way it covers the time zones in the U.S. automatically. You can input other countries time if you have a city in mind. It may not cover every city you can think of, but it does cover most of the major ones. You can probably give yourself jet-lag if you stay at it long enough. This should be great for kids to get the concept of time zones and they work on this great earth.  Highly recommend !!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved the surprises.  Just when I would have it all figured out, there would be a new twist to the plot.

B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly has made managing my news and web / blog updates a pleasurable experience. I was struggling with how to keep up with all of the sites I track, and Feedly came at just the right time. If you had Google Reader, the transition to Feedly is just one click.

Feedly helps me focus on the pieces most interesting to me.
B004EPYZOY|5.0|Okay, I live in Europe, and don't get out much.

1455870137|2.0|If I never hear the name again, Margo Roth Spiegelman,I can live a happy life. I think I could write a thesis paper on the ways this audiobook grinded on my nerves. I gave it two stars, one for me finishing it and one for Dan Miller, for doing a great job with the voices. Part 1 was good, Margo pulling Quentin into her one night adventure of revenge. Part 2 started the downhill journey, Quentin desperate to find missing Margo. Part 3, road trip to discover Margo, I was hoping some redeeming quality in her like she might be dead or injured but no just the reader realizing Margo Roth Spiegelman is the most self-centered character in history and Quentin needs to get a life outside of her.
0679809015|4.0|This is a really cute book, and both my 2 year old and 10 month old really like it.  The pictures are cute and the flaps are really cute too.<br /><br />As other reviewers noted--its quite small.  However, that has worked great for me.  I keep it in the diaper bag and it doesn't take up much room, and when the kids are getting bored or fussy when we are out and about, this will keep their attention.<br /><br />My two year old will read this book in just a couple of minutes (so that doesn't buy me much time when she's bored and we are out of the house), but my 10 month old will look at it for quite a long time.  She really likes the pictures, and loves opening and closing the flaps.  I show her the flap on each page and then she opens and closes about 30 times.  Turn the page, and repeat.
B000X64CC8|5.0|Great, But is very sad how those people die and how it was before in those time. True story movie
1935707590|5.0|definitely not the book you need to score high on the quant.  but if you are like me and need refreshing on the most basic concepts, then this book is ideal.  use it as a refresher before using the more advanced Kaplan books.
B005WLZ7BY|5.0|This is a great movie, very sad, but true story i recommend this movie to every all those people like true story movies

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was my first Colleen Hoover book and I was hooked, instantly!! The relationship between Sky and Dean was very respectfully done for it being a young love. Some of the things that happened to Sky early on in her life had me in tears (and I'm not a crier...just a mom who couldn't imagine having that happen). I love the way she writes, the interactions with the characters, everything about her style. I bought this book on a Thursday night and was so into it that I purchased the next three to add to my reading list (&#34;Slammed&#34;, &#34;Point of Retreat&#34;, and &#34;This Girl&#34;). I finished all of them by Sunday!! I preordered my &#34;Losing Hope&#34; and can't wait to begin reading it!!
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|I'm glad to hear that Queensrÿche has, in a round-a-bout way, been reborn. Since I've had more than a week to listen to the digital download of the cd, I find myself drawn back to it, time and time again. Is this the exact same sound as in the 80's/90's - nope...that's why it's called Progressive Metal. I've had the chance to listen to BOTH Queensrÿche's offerings, and THIS VERSION is the winner. LaTorre's vocals are full of emotion and take the listener on a fantastic journey, where Tate's vocals seem to lack the emotion. I am a singer, and I know it's up to me as the singer to convey the message of the song. Todd does, Geoff doesn't.<br /><br />Yes, the CD is short in time, but all the music fits together. I've heard some people say it's a concept album, not necessarily here, but I'd disagree. It's a starting point; a new beginning...the rebirth of a Master Metal band.<br /><br />There are some technical aspects to this album that are evident, and they're none that hasn't been discussed already. The recording is hot if you're listening through headphones designed for any of the 'portable .mp3 players.' I'm not an engineer, but I do know that even at 50% of an 80% limit on my .mp3 player, I get distortion and a little hiss.<br /><br />Other than the engineering issue, this CD RYCHE-ing Rocks! Great song writing and great lyrics - the music and lyrics fit together awesomely (not sure if that's even a word or not), and the direction of the music is no longer autocratically decided...it's decided by the band.<br /><br />I can't wait for ALL their new releases, no matter what they may be called...this group is going places!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|WOW...I wasn't sure what to expect when I read this. I instantly fell in love with Will and Lake (and Eddie and Gavin...really the whole clan). The idea behind the slammed poetry and how she used it to express the feelings and desires of the characters was amazing. I appreciate how, even though the poetry was the focus of the novel, it wasn't in your face every time you turned the page. I love the way she writes and captures your interest from page one. I could not put this down (I actually read &#34;Slammed&#34;,&#34;Point of Retreat&#34;, and &#34;This Girl&#34; in two days). Definitely one of my new favorite authors and can't wait until &#34;Losing Hope&#34; is released!!

B000FC2L1E|5.0|After reading the first 2 books in this series (Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber) I decided to take a break from this saga. However, the sample that Amazon/Kindle allows you to preview without purchase got me hooked once again. I purchased this book on my Kindle and love it.
