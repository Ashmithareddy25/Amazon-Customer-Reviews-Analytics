B005CRQ4GU|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BOOK OUT OF THE WHOWL SERIOUS! I love all the books but I like this one THE BEST
B009JBZH54|5.0|Exactly what I purchased. All three movies on Blueray plus Ultraviolet, I don't see how this isn't a steal. Not to mention I got it in a day after ordering. Don't listen to the 1,2 star reviews. Their parents didn't hug them enough.
B009O2XY12|5.0|this game is awesome there's no other way to describe it. I mist love it compared to any other bubble shooter this is by far the best one. get this game and you wont regret it. now any other bubble shooter you will its a waste of your time don't get them there horrible
B004AQR24W|1.0|I knew that it would be predictable and very Hollywood.  But even with those low expectations going in, it was still awful.  Out of the all star line-up, it was such a shame that Stallone was the leading man. Written by/for a 6th grader
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's simple enough for my kids and engaging enough that I enjoy it too. It's just an endless runner type of game but you'll enjoy it.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Not like the big Cinemascope theater screen as I saw back in the 1960's, but truly an excellent small screen version.
B007NCSQFO|5.0|She did a great job on this album, very upbeat and fun. I love love love me some Nicki Minaj
B004V5QWU2|5.0|The sound is good and you can change what sounds you want by combining different sounds.  It puts me to sleep.
0634049011|4.0|The system is excellent, and there's a whole lot of useful material beyond just learning where the notes are. If you do all of the exercises as you're supposed to do, you will either learn the fretboard (and a good bit of other stuff) or maybe you should take up another instrument.<br /><br />It's only fault is that once you fill in the exercises there's no way to go back and do them again. All music instruction books with exercises in them have this problem, however, so it's a little hard to complain much about this one. I suggest copying the exercise forms, though that means a lot of copying. It'd be nice if instruction books would provide three or four copies of the forms needed for the exercises.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Although I love motor sports and dogs, this book is much more, a look at the complexities of life and how we cope through the eyes of a dog.
B00000DHTF|5.0|This is my favorite Springsteen collection. I love this guy but sometimes he can sound a little commercial or repetitive if you're listening to all his studio hits together. This collection has its own personality, and dare I say a soul. In a couple of words, it's highly musical, and authentic sounding.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I order this for my son who writes and records music.  He stated 'professional, do you see the words professional?' he was so proud of these head phone although they were pricey he loves them.  The feel of the pads on his ears and the sounds that are amplified makes this a great hearing aid for persons who like to hear and feel sounds when they are recording.  The quality of the headphones and the ability to stretch are great. The service and shipment was great.  Will recommend and will be ordering some pads for the headphone soon.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Really slow moving movie. Great cast. I love Meryl Streep. It had so much potential with that cast, but did not deliver. It was incredibly boring. Too much negativity & conflict. Best part of movie was the last 10 minutes - but that's it. Be very careful about buying this as a gift for mom or grandma - much of the story line revolves around their lack of intimacy. (I'm trying to write this without using certain words, that might cause this review to not be published...)
B005URRCUY|5.0|This is the best Black Keys CD so far.  I can't get &#34;Run Right Back&#34; out of my head. Bwa bunna bwah bunna noaw noaw.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|This detailed study of the rivals for the 1860 Presidency is excellent, but slow going.  It shows what politicians can do when they actually do their jobs and govern.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I liked this book because of the mystery of the pictures ! I liked that he wrote this,story around the pictures! I would,recommend this book!
1439156816|5.0|I've read many books on how to write. This was by far the most enjoyable. Stephen King illustrated his points by creating a living example of vivid use of language, engaging stories, and driving home his key points. What I liked the most was his description of how he lived his life. It's clear that to be a writer you must read and write and read and write and read and write. That's how you learn to use all the tools in your three-layered tool box. That and be patient and trust the process. It may not sound like much, but it's already made a difference in how I view my writing life and how I review my current drafts. Oh, and I read the book out of order. I read the C.V., then skipped to On Living, the Postscript before I began The Toolbox. This sequence was interrupted by my perusal of Further More, Parts II and III and a wander to Wikipedia to review his list of published books. Awesome.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|As others have said....the fact that you can't actually see past the first 10 status updates makes this app basically unusable for me. I really hope an update is made so I can use my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 for facebook.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Well researched and believable.  Always fast moving and riviting.  Have read all of his books and enjoyed every one.<br />Good author.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|No one compares to Sinead O'Connor.  That's not to say she's the best singer ever, but it's hard to think of another voice who can convey strong emotion as convincingly or beautifully.<br /><br />From a breathless whisper to an accusing scream, she renders the alternating feelings of  vulnerability and rage that exist in a wounded soul lashing out. With her unique talent back at full strength, she has produced one of the very best albums of 2012.<br /><br />The outstanding tracks, in my opinion:<br /><br />\\"Reason With Me\\" tells an addict's tale with an urban rhythm and some witty lyrics.<br /><br />In \\"The Wolf Gets Married\\" she manages to deliver a line as simple as \\"your smile makes me smile\\" with an emotional power that is simply exciting. The message is in her voice, not the lyrics.<br /><br />On the final track she lays into the \\"VIPs\\" of her own church for their history of child abuse, which was nowhere worse than in her native Ireland. This is a cause she has carried for a long time.  She imagines them standing on judgment day before the \\"real VIP\\" to explain. It's one of the quieter songs on the album, but powerful.<br /><br />I'd count this as her best release since the first two, and that's going back more than 20 years.
B005LAIII0|4.0|Castaway meets Planet Earth with a few pointed spiritual overtones thrown in for good measure. As the plot slowly develops, it takes the slant of a classical fantasy adventure, akin to the serial novels and comic strips of the early 20th century, granting the screen an entrancing, otherworldly sensibility. As is, that would've been a perfectly acceptable stylistic decision - after all, director Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon made no apologies for its less-grounded moments - but such stylish exaggerations actually become an essential part of the telling when an admission in the final act changes everything we'd just seen. Magnificently composed and spectacularly beautiful, it would be worth watching for the eye candy alone. Lee's restraint in this regard is especially impressive; he knows precisely when his audience will want to linger in a moment and indulges them with one breath-catching vista after another. Kudos to the enormous team of effects artists; their combined efforts have produced a cinematic masterpiece. A bit sluggish at times, with a few moments that tease the boundaries of plausibility, its visuals are a revelation and I'm still considering some of the story's underlying meanings a day later. Worth experiencing.
141659521X|4.0|\\"And so it is written, 'The first man Adam became a living being.' The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.\\" -- 1 Corinthians 15:45 (NKJV)<br /><br />I found The Last Man to be better than the last two books in the series. The story gripped me in a way that some of the recent books failed to do. It's tough to talk about the book without using spoilers, but I enjoyed the way that Vince Flynn used unexpected events to put a new slant on Mitch Rapp. Some may not like it, but I found the shift to be refreshing and interesting.<br /><br />There are some weaknesses in the story that may make it seem too incredible to you. Be prepared to swallow hard, and I think you'll enjoy the story anyway.
B008220C92|5.0|The disturbance. The eerieness. Welcome to Sinister, a 2012 horror flick starring Ethan Hawke. While there is a few pop out parts, the whole plot line and story is chilling itself. This movie disturbed me with its horror, but not like a gruesome and gory SAW movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good scare.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Watched by chance.The story and action are great. Dicovered Tom Hardy.Outstanding. I will probably buy this and &#34;Warrior&#34;. Both &#34;must see flicls!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Love the story it was funny the way they met and married.  Is a love story with dramatic scenes that made a knot on my throat.
1451638450|5.0|I've always liked Ivan. Of all the members of Miles Vorkosigan's merry band, he was the closest to an Everyman. Which made him the reader's surrogate when he'd yelp protests at whatever suicidal scheme Miles was trying to pull off. Yet I always felt there was more to him than met the eye.<br /><br />In this romp of a book, Ivan gets a chance to prove it by escaping Miles' eclipsing blaze (you can't say Miles casts only a shadow). I thought the book's romance was great fun and precisely engineered. However, if you're a male romance-phobe, don't be frightened. My husband loved the book too, once I greedily devoured it and handed it over with a satisfied mental BURP.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the rest of the cast, from Tej, the lovely heroine who has been as thoroughly underestimated by her family as Ivan, to Rish and the rest of the secondary cast. The twists and turns of this story took me by surprise, and I thoroughly enjoyed every page. This is why Lois McMaster Bujold occupies the top slot of my Gods and Goddesses of Writing pantheon. CAPTAIN VORPATRIL'S ALLIANCE may not be as densely delicious as some of her books -- the Challion novels leap to mind -- but it's definitely worth the price. Yum!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Never before have i reviewed a book on Amazon out of the hundreds i have read. Never before have i been left so empty, so bleak, with so little to reflect on after reading a series i loved. The author takes the first two books of the series, wonderful books, and slowly destroys everything that made you interested in them. The \\"girl on fire\\" is long gone. Replaced by a drugged up, scarred, shell of a person, devoid of any personality, effort, feelings, or motivation beyond a basic instinct to kill. Characters you have grown to love will be slaughtered in one sentence, with not a single moment taken to reflect on their lives or the loss of their futures. Very important and devastating scenes are written about in the book and come out of nowhere, with no explanation, brutal and confused, to leave you wondering if they really happened at all, or what happened.<br /><br />The epilogue is the worst part by far. As my pages kept turning and i knew the book was coming to the end, i realized things were not getting better. By the time you finish the book you will wish she killed all the characters off, because the hopeless, bleak ending they receive is a fate far worse than death. I cant begin to say how utterly empty and abused i felt after finishing this book. I wish someone had been there to warn me NOT TO READ THIS THIRD AND FINAL BOOK. If you are reading this now and its too late for you, there are a few wonderful alternative endings you can seek out on the internet. One i particularly like is by James Mcquivey called Mockingjay Rethink. It does not overwrite what the author writes, but it supports it, and help tie loose ends in a comforting way. We invested too much time to be left hanging, with a rushed, sloppy, confused, sub-par ending, not fitting of the amazing story lines and characters created in the first two books. I must be thankful the characters in the book are not real people, because they deserved SO much better than what they received in the form of thisseries ending from Collins. Again, avoid this book if you care about the series and the future of the characters. Its a fate worse than death, Katniss has become her mother, and empty, useless shell of a person, destined to never fully be present thanks to the past, and fade away without a future.
B002WIDRM6|1.0|I purchased this CD last year and instead of opening iit , I just put it with my other CDs.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the NEW CD only to find out that the disk was Pattsy Cline.
B008G33NFC|5.0|Quite long show but interesting! She always brings the heat, transfers the passion to the audience! The way she moves, she waves and the setlist are good! Especially the ascoutic part <3<3 So beautiful!<br />The high-definition videos, great audio and some bonus material are perfect to satisfy you. If you love symphonic metal, you can't miss this!<br />I've been a fan of her since 2007, quite late but I really grateful that I knew her! Tarja's music means a lot to me!<br />Every CD, DVD of her and from the previous era with Nightwish is always worth to buy!
0807014273|5.0|Excellent and applicable to everyone trying to do their best. Made a huge difference, for the better, in my life.
B008N1V11U|5.0|it is a very good game. the story line is very close too the movie.I really really love it a lot its epic Go batman<br />.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|I thought this was a good romantic comedy. Perhaps even a 3.5 star. I will probably watch it again if it is still on prime videos.
055357342X|5.0|This is really a fantastic book and probably the best one of the series (so far)! The characters, the setting and the writing is just great and I can't wait to see what the show does the material in this book!
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Came in the mail, had everything describe from online description and played great!<br /><br />5/5 for me and a definite buy.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is real cool cause  it has better music selections ... my other one gave loud annoying sounds ...this  one gives wonderful sounds that I wouldn't mind waking up 2 ta go 2 school every day of the week ... it is very very neat :)  wish more apps were jus  like this one.. this is a lot of fun I haven't thought I needed the whole app by  I would consider It just because it will get a lot better :)
B000069AT7|5.0|This is a 4 DVD set with both versions of the movie plus a bonus disc & a music CD. It also has a glossy book plus a frame clipped from the original film reel. The extra bathtub scene was a really great treat. Other than the extra scene, I never noticed there had been any other changes in the newer version until I saw the bonus disc. My only regret is the lack of deleted scenes but this is not unusual for older movies. The extra scene in the new version was a plus.<br /><br />Nothing is ruined. It has both versions of the film on separate DVD's, so I don't know where these morons are coming from. They obviously have never seen this set so why would you take advice from someone like that.<br /><br />I bought this set when it came out 10 years ago for 52 so it still looks like a good deal. I'm surprised it isn't a lot higher. It is a very nice top quality set and only needs a tiny Velcro patch added to keep the lid closed if you display the box. A really nice collectors set.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Loved the story behind it and i loved the charactersI Absolutely loved the books Will most definitely highly recommend them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best app I have an the kindle fire...  but it needs villagers that you can trade with. also every thing in computer.!
B005K17RU0|5.0|super easy to read and navigate weather app with multiple options..perfect and accurate....love the fact you can easily view extended forecast for other cities...highly recommend!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great show, great writing.<br /><br />There are tons of reviews on this show already, you don't need another one. But, if you like apocalypse and zombie genres this one is as good as it gets.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|we nead more time to build and craft and we nead theas. fireplaces, gocarts,  different people wen we play Please?????????????????????

B0084IG8TM|5.0|This Movie was a great price and came with in 5 days me ordering it.  I recommend this to everyone.<br /><br />Thanks
B002DS3982|5.0|Awesome movie but I think the cops that put him in prison should have been put in jail and through away the,Racial crap
B009MO5960|5.0|Stunning CGI Effects and cinematography.  A-list acting, to include, a very interesting story line. There are no dry or dull areas in this movie. Great hard hitting action. Alice is back and she is hard hitting (0-60) all the way through! This movie has balls-to-wall action from start to finish. Lots of fighting, blood, gore and carnage. Plenty of Guns all day long, to include, great fighting sequences. The sound track is off the chain for you ravers out there. So what more can I really say, its Resident Evil and they always deliver...and yes they left this one open for yet another sequel. The franchise is well managed and is producing a great product!  I'm impressed. Get it on Blue ray. I can't wait for the next sequel. Thanks guys.
B005IQZB14|2.0|..I did not ever get really engaged here.....her motivation was not clear, ....not convincing in her dedication....I finished it but it was tedious through the end.....isn't this a memoir??
B007HACDLK|5.0|Yet another engaging and masterful story by Vince Flynn. His characterizations, plot lines and vivid verbal style never fails to absorb and excite.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|great movie combining modern events, roman history, politics, and human emotions all into one. Definitely one to view if you like action movies!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I take great delight in learning new things.  Thanks to Tim Ferriss I have the keys to the Kingdom.  This book really breaks down the ability to become good, maybe great at anything and everything.  I am using \\"The 4 Hour Chef\\" to coach my son's basketball team.<br /><br />Don't tell the kids about this one!
0062213423|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my pre teen niece hoping it will get her to read more. It definitely has more pictures than content but I'm sure she will love it and read it over and over.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|From the very first page until the last you are drawn into this book. You hang on every word and dread the end to come. This is a must read. Beware if you don't have time to finish this series because you won't want to put this down!
B009LDXQGC|5.0|Great CD Great music, great group of men, This band is by far the greatest to see live, they sound even better live then the CD which is hard to come by. Humble men who believe in what they sing and treat their fans great
B00008BXJG|5.0|Before I review this, I admit that I'm one of the people who prefers Bonn Scott's vocals to Brian Johnson's (except for \\"Back In Black\\" which was pretty good). A lot of people have labeled this band as blasphemous, evil, or even satanic over the years but just because the album's called \\"Highway to Hell\\" doesn't make these guys devil worshippers. To the contrary, they're actually decent guys who were putting out the \\"bad boy\\" image and were living in the fast lane of rock and roll lifestyle.<br /><br />The lyrics that Bonn Scott sings on this album are for the most part about sex, fast cars, being wild, and mocking the culture of evil (especially on the title track). Sometimes Bonn's lyrics can get repetitive but he gets some clever lines in and his charisma almost always overshadows anything negative.<br /><br />If things do start to get a little repetitive, Angus Young whips out fascinating guitar lines or just plain shreds out on the guitar and the song is always saved. There isn't really a bad song on this album. It's straight up rock; wild and full of life. It's not meant to have a deep meaning or be too complicated but it succeeds because of this.<br /><br />So for people who like late 70's rock that was just fun to listen to, this is the album for you. This is the first AC/DC album I actually ever picked up, I enjoy some of the other early songs they did too but this is probably the highlight of their career. It's too bad Bonn Scott didn't live to see this released or sing another day but I'm sure he's in heaven and proud of his bandmates.<br /><br />Recommended
B0097GTUCC|5.0|This band is what all rock bands should be. Saw them live as a two piece band it was incredible, then purchased the cd I cant stop listening to it. Highly recommend it!
B002TOJHCM|5.0|Na they don't...but this ones a keeper!! well done so anyone can play and on a kindle it don't take up any shelf space!!
B005D9MUWY|2.0|If you on an htc phone. It is best to download this app from the Google Play Store because the 1 on the Amazon app store does not work the same as the 1 on the Google Play Store. When I try to use the app from the Amazon app store it force closes and does not open. I have a Droid Razr that it works fine on from the Amazon market but it does not work on my evo.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I'm  having difficulty getting through this second in the trilogy.  The first, &#34;End of the World&#34; was sub-standard to &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;, and therefore a disappointment. This second one is similar enough to make me not plan to buy the third.  Too much &#34;hot'n'heavy&#34; stuff... if there is a story, I haven't found it yet.<br /><br />In contrast, I read &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; in hard-back, sitting up well into the early morning hours, sleepy eyes, trying to hold up the heavy book because it held my interest so.... and I hated when it ended.<br /><br />This trilogy is not there.
B00992CF6W|4.0|All of my friends started talking about minecraft one day, and I thought, &quot; man, it's just a game&quot; boy was I wrong! I love this game, but I do think that for the kindle fire it does kinds have a high price.  :(
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|You love the show, you love the old cast? That's fine! But the new cast are gonna blow you mine away. The look good an the sing good, so you just have to love the songs.
0446554995|5.0|There have been a lot of good books from big name authors this year. Brad Thor, Vince Flynn, Ken Follett, Lee Child, Brett Battles, James Rollins, Daniel Silva, Michael Connelly, \\"Robert Ludlum\\", and even Michael Crichton have recentlymade contributions to my bookshelf. Two graves is my favorite, and easily the best book I've read in quite a while. It's not that rare that a book comes along that I enjoy so much I finish reading it in a night or two. But what is rare are books so good that I actually slow down and take the time to enjoy every page, and two graves was one of those books. I gave it five stars because it's that good of a book. Not because I'm a devotee of the authors and NOT because I was lucky enough to be sent an advance copy by the authors. This book has it all. Love, hate, despair, redemption, Nazis, thievery, action, guns, and a plot that twists and turns but never leaves you behind and never loses your interest. Did I mention there are Nazis? Oh yeah, and their secret base is in a _______, seriously. Awesome. Two graves will make you start the next chapter even though you have to be up in four hours.
B004LROMX4|5.0|The show is great, the actors are great. You feel with them all the time, an just think for your self &#34; what would i do&#34;.
B008ANFRGQ|5.0|Vai's new album kicked major tail. My favorites were Velorum, John the Revelator and Weeping China Doll. These particularly feel very Vai. He combines Blues with Metal in John The Revelator which to me is fantastic, innovation is &#34;Vai's middle name&#34; as it were. Buy the album, give the man the money he deserves. Don't pirate -_-
B004YM6JP0|5.0|New vampires, hybrides an more. The show is still on top, an you going from one surprise to an other
B008I43DYU|5.0|I love how easy it is to use and the large numbers for reading.  I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for a calculator app.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed this mini series very much.  We missed it on regular TV.  It was never available in my library, so I decided to just buy the set.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I haven't really created any documents on this app but it looks just like the programs on laptops and seems to be easy to use.  I looks like I would have no problem creating any document.  Love it!
B009O2XY12|3.0|this is your typical bubble shooting game. i like it but my only gripe is at a certain point you have to have a certain number of stars to get to the next island. some of the early levels are super hard - almost to the point of being impossible.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This may be Rodriguez's best album.  Songs from it are heard in the Searching for Sugar Man documentary.  I am blown away by how good this album was and am mystified why it was not played in the U.S.  Thanks to the South African who got a copy of the album and brought it back home where South Africans recognized the brilliance and gave it the playing time and credit it so well deserves.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This one focuses too much on Cercie and the Maiden of Quarth Brie. The Dornish story is good addition and at first the Ironmen are annoying but starts wrapping things together. But only about 5 chapters into the Dance with Dragons and it is worth powering through this one.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I got this along with Cold Fact and the soundtrack to Searching for Sugar Man.  It's another excellent album and songs from it can be heard in the documentary.  I wonder if another CD will be next?
B000FBFN1U|5.0|These books are so good. And they give you better insight then the show ever could, but the show is well done too.
B008JH5CVS|2.0|It tries to have the wit and action of something like Die Hard, but it falls completely short. Gratuitous violence for violence sake, and many attempts to be stupid funny followed by serious right after. Spend your money on Die Hard or Lethal Weapon instead.
0316236535|5.0|This book has been a favorite for all three of my boys. We've given it as gifts to others, and always receive high compliments a few days later. I use this book in my preschool classroom, too. The kids can never get enough!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This movie was good, but not a whole lot of action....graphically it's awesome, it just takes long to get into the movie.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|The app works well on Toshiba Thrive, although it occasionally freezes or when I tap on tile another one lights up instead. Overall I like it.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Pros:<br />Great look and classic design. Good quality canvas strap. Clear backing a nice touch. Accurate timekeeping.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Stops running if not worn for 12hrs (approx)... somewhat of an annoyance to reset the time/date.I don't expect an automatic watch to keep running for days after it's been stationary, so only a minor con.<br /><br />Overall this is one of the best watch values in terms of style, function, and quality. It's not the nicest watch you'll own, but with the color options and classic style it will be one of your favorite &#34;everyday&#34; watches.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The author has considerable credibility and you can feel his passion when reading this book.  If your mind is not already closed to the subject of life after death, this book is essential reading.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I'm almost finished with this wonderful story.  The characters are all so interesting and all are interconnected even though they live in different countries.  It's hard to put down as there are no dull parts to this long novel.  Highly recommend this book.  I finished this book & am thirsting for the next book to continue this wonderful story, however it will not be published until 2014.  Had I known I would have waited to read the first one.  I'm afraid I'll forget who is related to who by the time the next one comes out!!!!
B004LWZW7O|3.0|Entertaining movie with a classic premise of The Rich (In Time) vs The Poor. The Love of Money is the root of all evil and apparently turning time into money doesn't change things. Nice play on an age old societal issue.
1400079276|5.0|It arrived in impecable condition.<br />The book is fat.  The paper is a typical book reading quality.<br /><br />And.. the price is right for the book.<br /><br />I am sorry to say I don't read Haruki's books.  So in content review.  I can't say much.<br />My guess is you'll have to find reviews on the net.<br /><br />Cheers.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I enjoy this game to pass time...I just wish it didn't freeze all the time. I also tried adding my sister's village through all three ways to add and she never got the add (and yes she has wifi) .
0756659841|5.0|I did not think this was such a massive book when I requested it.<br />When it arrived I was amazed at the content of the stickers.<br />The size and all.<br />It is a beautiful book.<br /><br />I am sure my nephews will appreciate as a Christmas present.<br />Books like this in my country are fairly expensive.<br /><br />Cheers.

0756697875|5.0|Briefly said.  I have never found a DK publishing book bad.<br />At least I am talking about the books I've seen.<br /><br />About THIS particular book.<br />It is way good.  It shows all the Lego sets available since the first lego batman came out (I think 2004)<br /><br />Page quality is superve.<br /><br />It has much detail. for seeing all Batman's foes and allies, and also for seeing Batman's gadgets.<br />Lets not make the joker jealous on his famous quote: &#34;Where does he get all these toys&#34;? hehe<br /><br />It's worth it!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Great when out in the dark to help you find your things, such as your keys in your purse on a dark evening.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|This is your typical action movie. It's the same as the other MI movies in my opinion but I'm glad I saw it.
B00004YRQA|4.0|Needed a memory card for the ps2. Nice price. Works as expected. Now I can save my progress and not have to leave my playstation on all night n day lol
B00932A2MC|5.0|I will admit I watched this movie three times. It's your non-traditional alien-attack movie with tons of humor (whether it was intended or not) that will keep you interested and laughing for the ENTIRE movie!
B005LAIIFS|5.0|I took my grandchildren to see this movie at the theater and they were completely taken in by it! We, adults were captivated as well. Awesome movie!!! I want to see it again and again!!
B00782O7IY|5.0|I love this movie.<br />its the best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I love this movie.<br />its the best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I love this movie.<br />its the best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I love this movie.<br />its the best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I love this movie.<br />its the best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I have been listening to The Red Hot Chili Peppers since I was a little kid. My father gave me Blood Sex Sugar Magic when I was 8 and I listened to it every day. It's really amazing to piece all the songs with his reasoning for writing it. His trials are inspirational.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ok game.. some of the games are fun and some are kinda cheesy. Not a bad game for free.. I give it a B-
1595827684|5.0|This is not only the best art book i've ever seen for the mass effect franchise but also one of the best art books in general! Every single page is filled with original note and all concept art. ALL which is a huge amount, the hardcover is very nice! I like how they added rendered 3d versions into the book as well as sketched and just hand colored. The book also include notes of all the original ideas and why each character was modeled the way they are or has something specific they wear. I've never seen such a detailed art book<br /><br />I'm serious this is a freaking amazing art book.
B0086449YA|5.0|very similar to Knopfler's previous efforts, which is to say mellow and enjoyable. Works as mindless background music, but can also stand up to critical listening.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|The album arrived quickly, the day after it's release. It's a great album, I never get tired of listening to it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts out easy, gets harder.  Challenging exercise for the brain.  Just when you think you've got it all figured out... the logic changes.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent books about the nature of humanity and the balance for the greater good- reminiscent of watership down and animal farm.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My grandson and I both, find this game to be tons of fun to play!  The game gets harder and harder, so we have to take turns, seeing who can find the best way to beat the game.  Makes it a fun time for grandmother/grandson time together.
0802473156|3.0|Maybe this is the one for some folks but I found it less than useful.  I would recommend A Conscious Person's Guide to Relationships.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I've tended to purchase HP over the years and have been quite satisfied with the results. I've found them to be quite reliable. Considering the network services and wireless services that needed to be invoked I'm totally impressed with the installation / setup. Quality is really good. I cannot comment on the reliability of this one as it's only been in use for a week.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|My kindle  felt like it was steaming up on many occasions  but the  plot was interesting and kept me reading  to see what  happens. I also like  being aware of what  others are reading and talking about...
B009HEJXFS|5.0|well done. entertaining and nice twist in the end. Can't say I would watch it again but at least I enjoyed it.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Christian Bale returns as billionaire Bruce Wayne, now a limping recluse with bad cartilage in one knee who has unceremoniously retired his alter-ego, the vigilante Batman, after the Caped Crusader's reputation was unduly tarnished in the advent of Harvey Dent's death. However, with his fingerprints stolen, his millions wiped out, and the board of trustees of his estate taken hostage by a raging psychopath who talks through a voice-box like Darth Vadar, it may be time for Batman to reemerge.<br /><br />Assaultive installment in the \\"Batman\\" movie franchise is so ugly, so irredeemably brutal and mean-spirited, that even a first-rate cast and the incredible special effects fail to make much of a difference. Director Christopher Nolan leaves his audience beaten and bowed--much like Bruce Wayne!--while plot-threads are shuffled about, wounds (such as a stabbing near the finish) are miraculously healed, and characters enter and exit and reenter following scenes at a lightning pace. The whole explosive thing is hyped up on angry adrenaline, becoming a series of staccato clips which aren't so much disturbing in their content as they are unnerving in their execution.
B00004RFCM|3.0|Tudo bene, funciona.<br />esta en bene statuto<br />was a used item and are an excelente state . . . . .
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This is a pretty good game. There are two reasons it does not get a five star. One: It can be a little off when it is tracking times. Two: almost every time you turn the game on they show a window to get you to buy something.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|Honestly, this movie annoyed me so badly that I am annoyed again just thinking about it.  I read the book and loved it.  It wasn't perfect but it really intrigued me and I couldn't wait to see the movie.  Well, the movie has to be one of the worst adaptations in the history of cinema.  I read a review that said something like &#34;30 minutes of this movie are watching Tilda Swinton do home maintenance projects&#34;.  This is so true!  The movie had lonnnnnnnnnngggggggg ddrrrrrraaaaaaaaawwwwwwnnnn oooooouuuuutttttttt sequences of NOTHING and then completely glossed over what I would consider to be key, pivotal, and fascinating parts of the book.  Then there were bits in the movie that weren't in the book at all, and yet added NOTHING to the plot.  I wish I could give zero stars, but the one star rating is actually fair because Ezra Miller was outstanding and a perfect &#34;Kevin&#34; however it was completely wasted on this mess of a movie.  The book haunted me for weeks, the movie left me with nothing but a feeling of wishing I never watched it.
B0086700CM|4.0|itss an awesomee gamee and whoo wouldn't wantt too playy it?? well somee people would think its awful just by looking at the app pic. but really u should get it and find out if its a good game.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Glad I bought this.  Our stroller, the CityMini, needed some cupholders and storage and this was a great solution.  I didn't realize it had a little zipper pouch on the inside but I love that part.  You can easily fit 2 large Starbucks drinks in it, plus the center part is great for keys, phone, burp cloth, hand sanitizer, whatever!  It easily velcroed on in seconds and doesn't seem like it will budge. Seems easy to clean too. Great idea!
B005I6EU7U|4.0|This cover really is nice; it does it's job, which is primarily to protect the Kindle Fire's screen.  I like the cover because it does help protect my Kindle Fire, but also, it helps keep my stuff private.  What I mean by that last comment, is most people will think I am reading probably some boring book (IMO, the Kindle Fire is too expensive and even valuable to just leave in plain sight.  The only suggestion I have, is a way to secure the stylis as that little over priced tool has no way or very little means of transporting along with the Kindle; to the manufacturers I suggest they implament a sort of slit in the cover so that the stylis can be hooked to the cover when transporting the whole thing; indeed, the user can use their finger tips, but mine tend to be too large in comparison with a stylis.<br />It is the poor way of transporting my stylis that prevents me from giving 5 stars for the case cover.
0307200477|3.0|This book was a staple of my childhood and I had to get it for my daughter for that reason.  The deluxe edition has pages I've never seen, as well as the good old pages I remember.  It's such a cute book!  Giving 4 stars because the deluxe edition is Super-sized, meaning it's a biiiig book.  Way too big for a baby to hold on their own (my daughter is 6 months).  But it's cute and hopefully it will be a book she remembers from her childhood as well.<br /><br />Edited this review to add that the second time I used this book, the cover fell off of the binding and I had to intricately weave the plastic binding back in to the cover.  Then it fell off again.  Fail.
B009SRJAG6|4.0|I never watch an episode of Supernatural thinking that is some how profound and amazing. The show never reaches or beg for you to take it seriously because you can't. It's fun to watch with the cheesy storylines and campy feel, don't expect \\"Breaking Bad\\" or \\"Lost\\", its more like a corny X files. But its still entertaining and thats it. Its entertainment for the sake of entertainment.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was soooooooo enthralled with this book and it kept me hooked through several twists and turns.  Then I got to the end.  The end was a gigantic WHAT THE?????????????  And it really bothered me and was so abrupt and so stupid and I would have thrown the book across the room but I was using my Kindle, so I resisted ;)<br /><br />Then a few days went by, and I couldn't stop thinking of the book, and its stupid annoying ending.  Then the ending stuck with me a bit more.  Then the ending started to intrigue me.  Then the ending really made perfect sense.  Then the ending seemed like the only logical way this book could end.  Then I realized, the ending was GENIUS.  Perpetual misery for two annoying main characters, and misery and annoyance for the reader.  Perfect.<br /><br />So I'd say, read this book.  Is it a literary masterpiece for the ages?  No.  But ignore all the reviews saying that the ending ruined this book, and judge for yourself.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|We thought this movie might be prequel to the &#34;Alien&#34; series and we were pleased by the movie overall; just a few things were a bit too different for our &#34;Alien enthusiast personalities&#34;  which is why it didn't get a 5, but it was an exciting and well done movie.  It's a keeper.  The seller sent it in a very timely manner and I would certainly purchase from them again, too!
B008Q09K2U|3.0|It is not of Nelson de Mille's better books. There is too many asides with John Corey which detracts from the story.<br />But nevertheless it is an interesting book
B0042FZWC0|4.0|I am a computer consultant who is in search for the meaning of life. What is my rent for living on this earth?  This book unlocked all the answers I have been looking for. Great job
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This charges my kindle fire quickly and it lets my hook it up to my computer. I would have given five stars, but when I connect the cord to my kindle fire I have to angle it downward because the connections don't quite line up. After figuring it out, this little quirk isn't really annoying and takes only one extra second to do. When compared to my old charger that I had to hold throughout the charging time or prop up on a book, this charger is a breath of fresh air.
B0060ANOXY|4.0|Pleasantly surprised by this album after being disappointed by pretty much everything else Roger Waters did after The Wall.<br /><br />Very atmospheric and mocking of shallow human culture, while at the same time the closing title track is oddly uplifting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It wont even let me download it. I love the game for my 360 but right now it wont let me download it. 5 stars because minecraft is awesome
B008458O3S|5.0|Trainyard is challenging and fun. If you like planning and trains this is for you.  It's exciting and fun to layout out the track and watch Tje trains go.
1439102813|4.0|This was easy to read and interesting and informed me about early on set Alsheimer.  Well written.  Arrived in new condition, as sold.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is a great app. I had a lot of fun with it. It is a great combination of angry birds and angry birds space. Get it!!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is the second of these books that I've read. I've already bought the third. It kept me interest all the way through it. The characters are well developed and believable. The plot has twists and a few unexpected turns. I can't wait to find out how it all turns out.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This is a good app. However; it keeps advertising right in the middle of the game. And it can get really annoying. Pretty soon you start to get video ads once you have it long enough. But it's great on the kindle fire.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great way to pass the time. Best solitaire game I've played. The auto-complete help as well, I would recommend this for those who like to play solitaire.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|I love it.  Love the color!!  Makes it much easier to hold the Kindle while reading.  I particularly like using it while eorking out on the elliptical machine.  Without the cover, the bottom of the Kindle rests on the metal plate and unless I turn the Kindle sideways, it pushes the button that turns it off.  With the cover, the button does not touch the metal plate and does not turn it  off.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel was a book club selection and I purchased it knowing only that a wife was missing and her husband was the prime suspect in her likely death.  This was also my first experience reading Gillian Flynn.  What a wonderful, but disturbing ride!  I couldn't put it down!  And, I would definitely recommend it. I really enjoyed how the story unfolded and the pace she kept as she alternated the narration between husband and wife and provided readers with an understanding of both perspectives!  When we do hold our discussion, I think there are many areas to explore.  My short list includes:  (1) What are the values that this couple holds dear?  And, how do those values affect how the author chose to end her story?  Some aspects were extreme enough to WANT to discuss further, but one can simply enjoy it for the pure entertainment value of a good mystery!  I plan to read her other two novels.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|really good.  just longer trial(; and I was like baby baby baby oooh like baby baby baby nooooo thought minecraft would alwaaays be mineee.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Complex intertwined story line. Great fantasy. Many charcters to keep tract of however, Martin pays attention to details, strong character development and the characters grow as time evolves.  I do not know how he can end the series.  Where is his next book... I cannot wait.
B007T99ENE|4.0|I'm so glad I never got involved in espionage.  Who do you trust?  A good read and many memories of the era when I grew up.  I wouldn't say this would be in my top ten, but I enjoyed it.
B007THA4FI|3.0|For a character study of a town I found the characters to be one dimensional.  Story line was promising that is why I gave it 3 stars.
0385535147|4.0|The book had a good storyline with well developed characters and plot. I enjoyed the twists and turns. Great Job Mr. Grisham!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Purchased it anyway, despite bad reviews. Loved it. Writing wasn't the best but the story was an absolutely intriguing one.
B000PEX1IE|5.0|It is a classic.  The old ones are still the best.  Had forgotten how many stars were in the movie.
B009X1398C|5.0|Honestly, I just got the box set, but not from here. I actually went to ebay and was bidding on it and got it for 68 dollars (free shipping and handling!) I'm so excited to have every episode of my favorite show! I always look forward to Thursday nights to the new episode on CBS
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I downloaded this just to play around with.  So far I have not had any issues and it is just fun.
0553801473|2.0|I start this off by saying that if anyone goes into this book thinking anything significant is going to happen in the greater scheme of the plot, then YOU KNOW NOTHING [insert name].<br /><br />I think anyone who has any experience with the last couple books Martin has given us pretty much gets it by now that we have morphed into a kind of soap opera where there is lots of drama but the overall story goes nowhere. Much like in General Hospital, most of the characters are transitory. They come in, they go out, they come back again, but usually never leave for good unless you are a Stark. Of the Starks, they are almost forgotten, as it has been so long, we have heard so little from them, and they have so little influence on the plot.<br /><br />The series has been trending towards an unending \\"now\\" and this book has been worst of all in that respect. The sheer number of characters is staggering. I almost have an adverse physical reaction every time he introduces another one. Even in a huge book like this, one hears little from many of them and nothing from more (get it? many and more?). This book also manages to capture the \\"long-thought-dead character appears\\" vibe that you get in daytime soaps.<br /><br />Unfortunately, also like a soap opera, there is very little action (again, worst in the series in that regard). No kidding, pulse raising moments are very few and really far between.  You had better be in this for the experience as this plot moves s-l-o-w-l-y.<br /><br />I was so glad to be rid of Jon Snow (assuming we are really rid of him) as his story line was absolutely glacial (no reference to the Wall intended). No kidding, a great deal of the book was dedicated to his character but aside from meaningless dialogues with a horde of other characters I could care less about, NOTHING happened.<br /><br />If you are ok with all this, it is not a horrible book. Many of the characters are actually engaging and the world that Martin created is still compelling. The prose is ok, but not as good as it used to be.  Lots of repeating stock phrases that were once clever, overuse of new vocabulary words (Martin must have learned \\"Leal\\" while studying for the SAT or something) and lots of bad language used in an unimaginative manner (e.g. \\"the queen commands you to #$%@ her\\" seriously?, we waited how long for this?).<br /><br />On the good side, Martin never fails to amaze me with his ability to express human suffering and barbaric behavior.<br /><br />For people who have not started plowing through this series, don't start. Stick to the HBO TV series. For those already bought in, go ahead and read the book (use the Library if you can as I doubt you will pick it up again). Just know that the farther this thing goes on the more complicated it will get and the slower it will move.<br /><br />Great example of an average author who had a flash of brilliance long ago and has successfully milked while drifting back into mediocraty.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is much easier to use than the email app that comes with the Kindle Fire.  Much more intuitive and eye friendly.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Nice twists and turns to keep your interest.  Not your typical super hero.  I will definitely keep watching this show.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|You always have good and bad reviews but I only paid $10 for this cover (with sale price and AmazonLocal discount voucher) and it does exactly what I need and expected.  A decent basic cover to protect my Fire.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I purchased this as a gift and the recipient was very, very pleased.  She has been a McCartney fan for years and definitely wanted this CD.
2724224892|4.0|Beautiful book.  I read it on a trip to Vietnam, where I saw the film, the night before visiting the house where the family of L'Amant lived.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A great movie with terrific actors.  The setting makes me want to move to India too!  Share this movie with someone who needs a change in scenery or perspective.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was so fun and addicting that i was going to just play it for 5 minutes but ended up beating it 2 hours later.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Another Gillian flynn novel you won't be able to put down-beware!  The plot twists and turns and will terrify you.

B004V5QWU2|5.0|I am one of those people who have a hard time sleeping without some sort of white noise in the background. What I had been using for white noise stopped working a long time ago, and I never had a chance to replace it.<br /><br />Since this app was discovered for my Kindle, I have been able to program which amalgamation of sounds I want for relaxation (campfire 2, frogs 2, crickets 2). Absolutely wonderful!
B001EAWMGA|5.0|I really like this movie.  While John started out in warrior mode he wasn't afraid to show his more vulnerable side.  This is probably the best thing I've ever seen him in.
B008OOYALE|5.0|My fiance purchased my Kindle Fire for me not two weeks ago, to help me get through the end of the semester. When he gave it to me, he suggested that I find a game &#34;or something&#34; to put on the Kindle so that I will have some sort of stress-reliever in-between assignments. This has been the best anti-work addiction that I have seen in a long time.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|The production values on this movie are outstanding as is the casting.  The costumes are truly top-notch and I was so glad to add this movie to my collection.
B004I744AS|5.0|This app for my Kindle Fire is so much easier to navigate than the pre-programmed dictionary.<br /><br />When words are similar, it even asks if you mean &#34;This word&#34; or &#34;That word&#34; when you enter a search.
B005OHSD3A|5.0|This diet really works.....I lost 9 lbs. in 2 weeks. The first week is the hardest, but after that it is easy. It is true about carbs turning to sugar..You are not hungry on this diet. You also have snacks available to eat. I recommend.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|This is my second Jason Mraz CD and I love it very much.<br />The quality as I expected and the shipping was really fast.<br />Definitely recommend.<br />Happy customer once again!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is an interesting book once it gets into the telling of the story. The preamble to the story flips a little bit but I suppose this is necessary to understand the character Pi. The ending is disappointing but the twist does leave you wondering. I wanted to read it before I watched the movie. I hope I'm not disappointed.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Like this puzzle game. Good choices for free. Nice that it can be more or less pieces. Our whole family can play.
030759565X|4.0|I wish I could give a 4.5 rating, I love the Smitten Kitchen and I use many of the Smitten Kitchen dessert recipes. I really enjoy the style of writing, and honesty.

B00846REIS|5.0|All the reviews were saying that Day plagerized 50 shades.  No way, shape or form did I think this.  I loved this book and Gideon Cross was hot, hot, hot.  And the sex! Wow, some scenes should have scorched my fingers by turning the page, they were so hot.  I immediately read book 2 &#34;Reflected In You&#34; and I am so disappointed that I have to wait until May 2013 to finish the trilogy.
B001FOPODS|5.0|This was purchased as a present, but after viewing the DVD we decided that it would have to go into our personal collection.<br /><br />Good  production quality.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What?  I could not believe that the book left me hanging and waiting for book #3.  The sex was over the top but Gideon had only that one secret and I couldn't beleive he couldn't have shared that in the first book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and am looking  forward to reading the rest of the series. I also enjoyed the action of the hunger games.
B008VRM7QO|4.0|I am not an historian but enjoyed reading this history of Mao.  The time line links his rise, and the methods he used to completely subdue the population of this hugh country of China. It seems impossible to we of the western world to understand how one man can manipulate millions of people to do his bidding.  Without the direct help in the form of money and information from Communist Russia, and the misinformation, and lies to hide his real ambition, surely he could not have succeeded.  The many men he deposed by various merans may possible been able to make a difference. We will never know. I also believe the commutation systems of those days enabled him to conceal his agenda.  Unfortunately, many of  the present people of China still believe the propaganda which has been fed to them.
0375703861|3.0|This book contains some interesting views on several subjects, focusing much of the time on race relations and the problems which immigrants encounter. Most of it is written as a standard story, though periodically the author interjects some direct ideas and opinions. It's not a quick read. There were parts in the middle which I felt dragged along; however, the ending picked up the pace and there was a little humor sprinkled here and there.<br /><br />The story focuses on two families - the Joneses and the Iqbals. Archie Jones was born in England and during World War II he meets Samad Iqbal, an immigrant from Bangladesh. The pair form a life-long friendship which results in their families being close. Samad had an arranged marriage to Alsana and they have twin boys; Archie's second marriage is to Clara, from Jamaica, with whom he has one daughter named Irie.<br /><br />Especially through the Iqbals, you get an idea of the author's views on how women are treated in different societies and the challenges which immigrants to England face. Samad struggles with his own religious beliefs and where he fits in. As a result, he decides to send one of their sons back to Bangladesh to learn their heritage, despite the dangers. Later, much of the story is told from the eyes of the three children who face similar struggles. One of the twins becomes a member of a radical Muslim group while the other one becomes a lawyer who's very interested in science.<br /><br />Overall I found I enjoyed the parts with the adult characters more than the children. Reading about how much the kids smoked and how important it was in their social circles became tedious. Many of the ideas on immigrant life such as how in some ways they are \\"more English than the English\\" were repeated too often as well. The climax included a \\"twist\\" - I put that in quotes because the revelation was something I expected all along. Despite this, I did enjoy much of the book. It did provoke some thoughts concerning immigrants and many of society's struggles in general.
141659521X|5.0|I'm a fan of Vince Flynn's books, and The Last Man is one of his best yet!  Mitch Rapp is back and going to work in Afghanistan.  There are some great twists and turns, some mystery, and plenty of action.  I highly recommend it!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book kept my interest straight through.  It was written by a real Seal Team member, and I came away with extraordinary admiration for the Seals as a result.  It's amazing the sacrifices they make for us and our country.I was blown away at what it takes to even become a Seal, say nothing of going even higher to Seal Team Six.

B0079IEPHA|5.0|Suits is one of the best shows on T.V.  I relished rewatching Season One and will for sure buy Season Two when it comes out.  The acting and story lines are intriguing, and it makes me appreciate the brilliance required to be a really good lawyer.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I love good fantasy and this is spot on.  You can't guess it all and am surprised and entertained by some for the best actors available today.
B0010SKUYM|2.0|Save your money.<br /><br />I've hung in through about half this book and at this point can't bear any more. This is a man literally telling his own legend without a hint of irony. I was hoping for grit, or intrigue, but instead its a black and white world of good and evil, with one amazing guy in the middle who just keeps doling out his superhuman awesomeness. If I were 12 this might be an engrossing read. Might.<br /><br />The 2 stars are for writing skill - Mr. Rothfuss is inarguably good with words, I won't deny him that. But that does little to improve the characters or salvage the story.
B009X01C64|5.0|this the only cover I will buy for my Kindle products. I tried others before this and found the quality to be weak. I have one for my basic reader and now for my new fire hd. the pivot stand option is fabulous. Don`t waste time or money trying others. This gives functionality and professional look.

1594481717|3.0|It looks like there are lot of disparate ideas that the author is making without an effective merge. One issue I find in these books are specifically catered towards Americans and American corporations. On one hand, we have books like The world is Flat, and on other we have books analyzing America in isolation. Why not write a book with all companies in world in mind. I did enjoy the book's varied pastures, but did not come back with set of points to take away with.<br /><br />The book goes into right brain/left brain type situations, laughter as a cure of many ills and so on. It mainly says as American is outsourcing low tech to other nations, it should go higher up in the chain. This to me looks flawed and may be the source of so much so called unemployment in the US. In recent days, Apple has announced it will do manufacturing for a line of MAC machines in US. That is the right solution. I am interested in Dan Pink's book because he is recognized as a best seller and  I am curious to read his other books. I wish the book has a theme and offers good solutions.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really like this book and its hilarious for all ages, even my mom who vain stand comic books read it.

0316227706|4.0|This book has some very funny and beautiful photographs of these dogs. It is one of those books that is not only good for the intended recipient, but also will entertain any guests one may have.<br /><br />One issue I had with this book was the layout. Some photos are centered, which means that due to the binding the photos are essentially disfigured by the layout. You can't see the whole expression of the dog, despite the fact it was enlarged around two pages for the purpose of highlighting that photo. Other photos were off-center, or covered one page, which made it much more fitting for the format.<br /><br />If they would change the centering so that photos were not cut off by the binding, or bind it differently, that would improve the quality of the printing and make all the photographs equally visible.

B00AH9WI1I|4.0|Some episodes are interesting, but the last few are weighed down by what seems to be bad acting (Aurora and Henry in particular), unnecessary dialogue (usually unnecessary exposition), and filler \\"action\\" as well. [Spoiler alert] For example, Red finds a long-lost relative as part of her self-discovery as a werewolf, only to have that relative killed off in a day (I'm not saying who just in case you decided to read past the spoiler alert anyway). What was the point of that?<br /><br />The \\"red room\\" that is introduced in the later episodes is severely lacking in believability-- it looks like a disco floor or DDR pad with fake flames added in around the actors. When Charming is in the mirrored room, that seems more interesting as a representation of the limbo that the sleeping curse creates.<br /><br />Just as Regina's flip to evil (blaming a 10 year old?) seemed a bit quick, which this season does give more background to and thus makes it seem less ridiculous, her flip back to wanting to be \\"good\\" seems quick as well. It seems very deux ex machina for her to suddenly want to reform in just a couple days of losing her powers; how easily can a person who killed that many people and sent children to their deaths in a witches house really come back from all of that? Granted, she did almost kill her own child, but her \\"wake up call\\" seems to happen too quickly.<br /><br />On a more humorous note, Belle and Gold's attempt at dating is hilariously cheesy at times (condiments are really this world's best magic? Really?), as well as lacking in complexity. Granny seems to show her distaste towards Gold in a rather reserved manner by just saying she charged him extra for the pickles. Really? That's it? At the least, this would be a good time for some \\"real world\\" humor such as threats to spit in his food.<br /><br />Grievances aside, there are episodes with strong acting and plot that make up for the weaker parts. Some of the most captivating moments are those revealing more of Snow White and Red's history as friends in the Enchanted Woods. The actor who plays Red seems truly in her element when she is able express Red's inner conflict in the fantasy world; Snow White's best moments also seem to be during the fairy \\"back story.\\"f Snow White and Red's history as friends in the Enchanted Woods.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is my 1st read with wispersync.  I had never read the book, so I found the twists from the movie very entertaining.  I also found the narration of the audio book so appealing that I stopped in the middle to go to the book store and bought 15 book/audio combo's.
1400069289|4.0|ARC received through the Goodreads First Reads program.<br /><br />I'm tagging this as both self-help and psychology, but it isn't either of these things, exactly. And it's also both of them at the same time. Why do we do the things we do? It all boils down to the power of habit--your brain seeking ways to be more efficient by responding to a cue with a routine and receiving some sort of reward. Charles Duhigg's central thesis is that if we learn the cues and the rewards, we can rewire our habits by swapping out the routines that come between them.<br /><br />As you can tell from the title, this doesn't just apply to personal behavior. Duhigg also explains how the cycle applies to the business world and how businesses can improve by analyzing their institutional habits. The story of aluminum producer Alcoa is especially informative--by changing a keystone habit, the company was able to increase both onsite safety and productivity.<br /><br />Recommended for those with an interest in business, the brain, and human behavior in general.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I'm very happy I went with the blue ray on this one cause it has a quality and extras I dont think the dvds have. If you have not read the books, this set is for you as it has extras that explain all the lore, the different family houses, relationships and personal histories of people. This is a fantastic story for those unfamilar and are thinking of doing a blind buy. Think of this as a cross between the Tudors and lord of the rings. Like Lord of the rings, there is a fantasy element present but its more about the people and their vying  for control over the Realm or just trying to survive the tyrany and war between the lords. The Fantasy element is something that starts small and is very slowly building in the background. Its a merciless story where the just are not rewarded and tyrants are not stopped by the good guys. Its alot closer  to how things would really be in a world  that happened to have some fantasy creatures in it. This is a whole world you'll be getting to know with its own history and cultures in different parts of its lands with different families and a cast of about 40 going into season 3.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|i love this product and how it came on time and shipped perfectly. i suggest you get this product. its great.
B0068MNNOE|4.0|This is one of those rare Jems.  The story is a unique but intriguing possibility of who William Shakespeare really was. I can see how it can be difficult for some people to follow and helps if you have some fundamental knowledge of Queen Elizabeth and her court. Clever engaging script writing, great acting, and visually stunning. This film is a treat for anyone whos a fan of Elizabethan history, Shakespeare or shows like the Tudors.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|i was only expecting the first movie to find out that i got all four :) i couldnt be more happier
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|I loved this movie. As a fan of this story, I have seen almost every version and read the original story and this is by far the best version ever made. The character animation is astounding. Its alive and detailed. The voice acting is top notch. Because the medium is computer generated they were able to add scenes from the book that are just not possible to include in any real acted version. It is as close to the book as you can get. I know some people see these CG movies and think they are for kids but you would be missing out if you skipped this over that thinking. This is just as dark and cruel if not more so that any other version made. This is one you will watch even if its not Christmas and you'll watch it again and again.
B00008EYA5|4.0|i love this product and how it came on time and shipped perfectly. i suggest you get this product. its great.
B004BSFC6Y|3.0|They are very pretty when you receive them; however, they are very long and narrow and I was not able to squeeze my son's feet in to them (he was only 3 months old at the time.)  I think they work better for a new born or very small thin baby.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is definitely a smutty novel, no doubt. Not much plot in this book and the author tends to use the same 2 or 3 adjectives over and over which drove me a little crazy, however, for a romance novel it is addictive and hard to put down.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Kelly Clarkson has greatest hits cd and I can not wait to listen.All of her cds are awesome.<br />I would recommed this to anyone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So obviously this isn't the highest quality literature but if you are looking for something to read that doesn't require much thinking and is totally smutty then go for it! Once I got going I couldn't put this down. Also this second book has far more plot than the first book.

B003L20IJM|5.0|I preferred the first installment, but this one is still an excellent movie and a keeper. a little gritty in the beginning but it smooths out and entertains as expected
034552554X|5.0|Fantastic, Realistic , Book!<br />Im an adult survivor of abuse - this story so close to my own.!<br />It's not a pretty life , what happens to us out there but you can work through it & make it out into a better life. This was a great story & NEEDS to be a movie...
1592802974|4.0|If you're interested in gaining some knowledge relative to making stock market decisions, this is good background material.  It deals not only with facts about making trades but also gives insight into the psychology that may influence your decisions.
0307120007|1.0|This may be a classic but I ended up tossing it out.  There's a page with &#34;flowers&#34; to smell.  The perfume used gave me an instant migraine.  It was awful!!
B0020PJJHS|5.0|If you've ever heard the Ace of Base song, it makes so much more sense than the Tina Turner version, which just makes no sense compared to the movie. While the movie is one of the best Bond's, it has gotten a bit dated over time. It is slow in the beginning but picks up near the end. Great performances overall.
B00705GEO4|5.0|Short synopsis of the disc: It tells the story of two of the baddest conquerors to come out of Scandinavia. Don't think anything else needs to be said about that.<br /><br />--Excellent songs: all but track 4. Tracks 1-3 are a real treat, 5 will kick you in the pants, 6 sounds like it would make a good drinking song, and the title track (7) will make the short hairs on your arms stand up the first time you hear it.<br />--Good songs: Track 4 (A Lifetime Of War) is rather morose but teaches a very important and overlooked lesson of wars prior to the industrial revolution, in that religion was often used as justification for things that wouldn't fly nowadays.<br />--Acceptable songs: None fall in this category.<br />--Bad songs: This is Sabaton we're talking about. To my knowledge, they haven't done a bad song yet.<br /><br />Final word: it is a very good change to shift out of the eras of modern warfare and look back into the history book. I recommend for any serious student of history or any Sabaton fan in general!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett does an amazing job of making the past come back to life through his characters, their families.  Book One covered World War I; the families stay with us as World War II devastates the world.  Follett covers the times approaching the War in Germany, Russia, England & the U.S.  How easy it is to forget the wickedness of those times and the people who lived during them.  This is a great novel for helping us all understand why these  Wars happened, how they affected the world, why leaders did what they did.  I am a Follett fan through and through.  He doesn't disappoint when he brings his characters to life and intermixes them with the likes of Hitler, Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin.

B00A77II0U|5.0|The story line was good, puzzles were easy but the entire story line had to be deciphered so that made up for it.  I also appreciated the bonus chapter at the end so I got to play longer.  I didn't want the game to finish! Graphics were fantastic.  I also appreciated the zoom capability for us older folks.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|This is a compilation of some of the most talented musical artists of this young decade. From the very first few bars that I heard of Some Nights I knew that this group had their minds in the right places and that being not to put out a studio album just because they could. If you read the credits in their CD leaflet and count them, there are a very large number of studios and talented people that have lent their time and talents to this project. I believe it to be because they desired a certain richness/fullness to their music and would settle for nothing but the finest and that translates to the enjoyment to every Fun. listener. My children are the band members ages but I relive my youth vicariously through their music. I wish I had their talents. I cannot wait to see them on their current tour. I think that Fun.'s music is desirable for all ages and lovers of all music genres. If you don't enjoy Fun.'s \\"Some Night\\", you are either too \\"barred out\\" to enjoy anything or you just have no good taste whatsoever. Fun. THANK YOU for this CD. Hope you win that Album of the Year Grammy in February, 2013. DON'T BE FOOLISH - BUY THIS CD - N-O-W !!!!! Quit reading this - hit \\"Add To Cart\\"

B008673ZAQ|3.0|When I finished Bared to You this summer, I could not WAIT to get my hands on Deeper/Reflected in You. I was obsessed. This book however... where do I start? It started off slow, and continued that way until about 2/3rds into the book. When it finally did pick up, it went right back down by the next chapter or so. To me, it felt like she was rushed to get the book out (since the title did get moved back a bit). There was no character development. Maybe since it had been a while since I read Bared, I felt like I did not even know who these characters were. No one grew since the last book, it was almost as if they were all regressing.<br /><br />This paragraph will have mini spoilers in them but nothing I feel will ruin the book. Skip a head if you would not like to read. Okay... here we go. Gideon gave me a headache! Every chapter they fight, never solve the problem, and then have sex instead. They break up like two or three times just to get back the next day. When Brett came into the picture I was hoping Sylvia would go completely left field and make him the new love interest. At least he grew up and saw her self worth more than Gideon did! The extent of Gideon's privacy invasion, and magical wealth in his twenties also aggravated me. He owns the hotel the stepbrother stays at, he owns a pediatrician office, he owns Brett's record label. He probably owns the company to the tampons Eva uses. That is the end of my \\"spoilers\\".<br /><br />Many reviews on here said that we never find out Gideon's secret but that is not true. It is just very VERY close to the end. I guess they were so upset at the book they chose not to finish it. In fact, I almost didn't finish it, and I rarely do that to books. I found myself just reading to finish it, not enjoy. I am seriously debating if I should read the third and possibly final book in the series. Luckily this book did not end in such a hungry cliffhanger like the last one. I would give it 2.5-2.8 stars due to the previous novel and hopes for Reflected in You to be better and wrap all this up.<br /><br />In other news it is nothing like  Fifty Shades Darker, since so many people were up in arms about how simular Bared to You was to Fifty Shades of Grey (Personally I thought BTY was better). In fact, this does not mirror the Fifty Shades series at all.

B00A9C3RB8|5.0|First, the talent in these two actors shines, their performances are perfect in this movie. It's not often I find a movie about which I have no criticism, not even the tiniest, but this is one. I also only give 5 stars to my all-time favorite movies, and I was surprised that a movie like this made the cut, as I usually categorize this type as a 3...4, tops.<br /><br />I think it is a movie for men, as well as women, though I wonder if the men would rather watch it alone, without their significant other, in order to avoid allowing them to see them get emotional, which undoubtedly some men will. The movie describes the frailties of men's emotions, which are too often covered up by the tough exterior expected - no, required - by society. The pressure of this idea is palpable. Though he goes down with a fight worthy to become legendary, to the end, he is eventually forced to make a choice between exposing his long-supressed hurts and fears and losing what he loves the most. Tommy Lee Jones is one of the greats and his golden performance here is not to be missed.<br /><br />Meryl Streep delivers as gloriously and subtly and funnily and fragilely and strongly and crushingly as one would expect from her. The burden of Tommy's character is shared by Meryl's, as well, as she must face her own failings and insecurities and make a life-altering decision.<br /><br />It becomes established in this movie that the unusually versatile Steve Carell is a force to be reckoned with in drama. Any naysayers will now silence themselves. No one but Clint Eastwood comes to mind offhand, though I know there are others, who can say so much with so few words as Steve did in this performance.<br /><br />It's Tommy's character who touches me most, though, even though I am female and one might think I would be most moved by the problems of my own gender. There's just something about seeing a rare glimpse of mushiness come begrudgingly from a strong, stern, manly man, that really melts me. Ah well, so now you know my weakness. This movie has made me give away my secrets, too.
B000FC130E|3.0|An imagination allowed to run wild. Definitely a fun read, and super-consumable. The plot and characters are a bit forced. I never escaped that sense of being told what to think and feel, so while the ideas are fantastic the story itself wasn't very rewarding.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I could read this book over and over- wonderful book.  The characters were very interesting.  I thought I was watching a great movie, while I read.  This book really pulled me in.
1455519006|4.0|Lots of Baldacci twists & turns and much detail on the buildup and tension. Characters come thru clear and real in different locales around the world. I was dissapointed in the relatively simple ending that was sort of a letdown.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|This movie has amazing effects . It is great when seeing in a big screen . It also has the music video &#34;Time for Miracles &#34; from Adam Lambert. Beautiful song . A must see video . Powerful voice and lyrics .
1451695195|1.0|I'd love to believe that I could have what this book proposes: Life after death. The problem is that it never compellingly makes its point nor does it separate itself in any meaningful way from any of its contemporaries. In essence it is a feel good trip and nothing more. I still want to live forever but I'm given no good empirical reason to believe that is the case. What we are left with is yet another proposition of eternal life and nothing else. This is a book that relies on peoples' desire to live forever rather than to discover any truth behind life and death. Disappointing.
B0001VTPWM|5.0|So happy that it was released in DVD. I could finally donate my VHS tapes . Great quality and sound .
B0052ZQMLO|4.0|I'm thrilled with the dictionary.  I bypassed the cheaper dictionaries, preferring to go with a name I knew.  The $9.99 price seemed good, if it integrated with the Kindle.  My choice of delivery by WhisperNet (instead of download to PC and copy via USB) was also on the assumption it would install properly -- which it did on my Kindle 2nd gen reader (keypad version pre touch-screen).  I was encouraged to try the dictionary by a Kindle techo saying the multi-dictionary support had been there from the first gen devices. (But there actually is confusion about how, or even the need to configure the dictionary).<br />The pleasant surprise was that it integrated smoothly, and 'knows' the language of the book that I have open.  So the English dict still works with English books, as it did before -- which is GREAT! And the Collins German dictionary pops up when I have a German text open. It makes reading so pleasant when, as a struggling German reader, I need to dive for the dictionary a lot.  This makes the Kindle even more of a great companion.<br />The only quibble -- and this is more about the German language's complexity -- is that many compound nouns result in no-hits.  But, knowing this means I have to look up the sub-words.  So it's not a failure.  I'm not sure if advanced semantic parsing would allow the Collins/Kindle software gurus improve on this, but I suspect the combinations of compound words makes this a tall order.<br />Overall, I am really 'stoked' (as they say).  It is a treat to have the ability to have multiple dictionaries coexist.  (I've got an old-German text that it works okay on, but I haven't really got into the book in a big way yet.  The more modern German \\"Frau Bovary\\" -- 'Madame Bovary' is keeping me entertained for now).

B00931JMRE|5.0|The best thing they have done since the 70's. Rick Rubin's hands-off approach seems to bring out the best in whomever he produces. Fantastic performance from &#34;That lil ole band from Texas&#34;.
B004NH8BWU|4.0|Intelligent, well written, obviously by an over-achiever who pressurized her daughters a bit (much) too much. Recommended to all mothers (and fathers) - as to what to do, and not to do, with their children (education being such an important issue).The Western world in general has lost much control over them... or, rather, it has relinquished its responsibility - as it has lost control over so many other things.
B009YU62H2|4.0|Not the biggest Soundgarden fan. Always liked the hits, but haven't been their biggest fan. Bought because it was a $3.99 download. Having said that, it is worth paying full price. Solid effort. Would buy again if necessary.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK. I cried, I laughed.....could not wait for the end, and then was sorry it had ended.
1451620829|4.0|Decent autobiography. Like most rock autobiographies, Criss isn't afraid to tell you about the debauchery of the 70's and 80's, but at the same time, seems to be afraid to admit to being manipulated. Peter wants the reader to believe that indifference or bad advice led him to be in some situations, instead of his own lack of insight. Peter does a great job of opening up about the power struggles within KISS. Unlike Ace's book, he also goes into the reunion and Farewell Tours, and the abuse that was heaped upon him by both the band and management. Worth buying if you're a KISS fan.
1567184855|5.0|This is a book I would recommend to anyone who is afraid of death.  Michael regresses people back to the in-between space, where we review our lives with our guides, it is quite an eye opener. If you are stuck in your life, or just afraid<br />of the unknown, I would highly recommend this book to you!!!!!
B008MZPUXW|3.0|This CD is the first I've heard from Neil Halstead's solo career. I love Slowdive and Mojave 3, so I bought this out of curiosity regarding Neil's adoption of the folksy sound.<br /><br />While I rather like the lyrics on this album, the music feels somewhat limp. The chord progressions are pretty generic and don't meet my standard for creativity. I guess I'm spoiled rotten on Fionn Regan's spectacular guitar work (Mark Kozelek is also very far from being a slouch). Even in his use of open tunings, which offer a wealth of wonderful possibilities, I was unimpressed.<br /><br />I'm of the mind that Neil's approach to songwriting is better-suited to a band setting, where the layering of instruments and vocals can lend more complexity to otherwise simple progressions.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|I bought this movie knowing it was used and in 'acceptable' condition.  nevertheless, this movie skips way too much and freezes way too much.  You cannot watch the movie and enjoy it and without skipping scenes. terrible purchase.  This is NOT in 'acceptable' condition'.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Classic Reacher, a man's man.  No grey areas, take no prisoners, not the least bit concerned with life being fair.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Anyone who likes classical music will enjoy this CD, it's really good and I would recommend. It's fun to listen to the music and read the books. ;D
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|For everyone who loves Richard Castle, his sense of humor and it is a fan of a very good police investigation story!!!!!
0007466064|5.0|As advertised. Book was a gift and receiver had no complaints. Great doing. Good condition. Couldn't be happier worth purchasing
B005721Y7Y|5.0|Great Movie Good actors and i like the storyline consistant and not predictable. predictable movies are the worst. I ejoyed the symbolisim behind it aswell.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It is amazing how the writing can cause so many emotions at once. This was a great ending to the trilogy, but left me wanting a fourth just to see how the relationship continues to grow and change.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Deep movie meaningful and thought provoking for a Disney Movie. I loved how they took real life lessons and mix it in to a childs movie.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|I never read many of the classics except the ones required in high school but I am enjoying  reading  \\"New\\" ones. and rereading \\"Old\\" ones.
B005IA9JZO|5.0|This great movie has been available on DVD in standard definition for a good long time so I'm guessing that many of you reading this are long time fans and are wondering if the upgrade to Blu-ray is worth it.  I was wondering the same thing so I took the chance that this wasn't a poor quality Blu-ray transfer and purchased it.  I'm very happy I did!  The first big differece you will see on the Blu-ray version is a beautiful animated main menu.  This replaces the washed out still photo type menu you remember from the standard DVD version.  Once you get into the movie itself you will be amazed at the dramatic difference in picture quality of the transfer.  Now instead of a washed-out upconverted standard def picture you will enjoy eye-popping clear crisp colorful images of Peter, the Lost boys, Tink, Captain Hook, and the rest.  The sound has been upgraded too.  Watching Hook in Blu is like seeing a whole new movie.  It looks like a film that was made yesterday.  An extra little perk is that this is a 2 disk set, 1 Blu-ray and 1 standard def version of the moive are included.  So if you're a true fan of Hook you MUST have it in Blu!  See everything you've been missing.  After all, what would the world be like without Captain James Hook.  Big thumbs up!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Waking up married ...I really liked this book I read the entire book in less than 24 hours.  If u liked fifty shades u will love this
B006ISJQ26|4.0|I loved this movie. Colin Farrell's character was someone we would all want as a friend & he played it so well.  I especially liked the scene in the restaurant as Mitchel is stating why it would not be good if he was a gangster!  He was very convincing & looked so cool, which always helps.(what a scene!)<br />As for Keira Knightley's character; why wouldn't she fall in love with Mitchel?  He wanted nothing from her, only to love & protect her and for free no less!<br />Plus there is David Thewlis, who was absolutely wonderful. His acting/timing was impeccable.  And yes, he very nearly stole the show, but then he often does.<br />Then there was Ben Chaplin, who was also very very good. He is another actor that does not disappoint.<br />I'm quite surprised by the negative reviews. Plus I do not think it was 'just another gangster movie' at all. That's why I bought it and will continue to watch it many times!<br />(Oh, I loved Mitchel's graveside 'any last words?' statement. It's a classic!)
B009P5K4HK|5.0|Amy Winehouse is in top jazz form on this double set.The dvd takes place in a little church in Dingle Ireland,and Amy has never been more charming,relaxed and consummate. The live cd on the BBC is so terrific too,and there are a couple standards here that are a pleasure to hear.After &#34;The Lioness&#34; was sadly less than her best work.This reminds one of her greatness.The recordings are from different locales but all are fresh and lively!
0545259096|4.0|This book wraps up the trilogy surrounding Grace, Sam and the wolves of Boundary Woods. At the end of Book 2, Grace was in the hospital with a disturbing high fever and her friends were being told to prepare for the worst. This book revolves around a new threat to the wolves. Tom Culpepper is organizing a hunting party to come in and devastate the wolf population. So, it's a race against time for Sam and Cole to figure out a way to save their friends and pack mates. Is there a way to cure the werewolves? Not everything is answered in this book, but that's the way it should be - some things ought to be up to our imagination.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I started watching this movie on a flight on unbox on my PC. Great movie, completely engrossing. The next day I watched the decided to watch the movie on our TV at home on PS3 and the version was horribly cut. Terrible editing that lead to plot confusion and a far inferior film.<br /><br />I am tempted to buy the DVD but am now very concerned about Unbox movies and their editing
B006QPX7UI|4.0|Confederate general Longstreet and Union colonel Chamberlain(later a general and medal of honor recipient) were two fine officers on opposing sides in the U.S. Civil War.

B004LX0DHC|5.0|In a world where we are taught to hold on to things that make us unhappy because it gives us something we call security; this book helps us to find a way to leave and get over that part of the journey...to get to our goals that may be just around the corner..but on a different path.

B0029ZA3H4|5.0|This is a great book about how you can find the brand behind the individual:YOU! Each person is unique, so this book is for everyone! A guide to finding your individual brand and marketing YOU!
0393316041|5.0|Pros: Great price. Arrived on time. Condition was perfect (it did not even look as if it had been opened... let alone read).  What a great read.  Written in prose - almost as if Dr. Feynman was sitting with you on a porch recollecting his life. ...And what a life it was!  This guy did everything from work on the Manhattan project, to sculpturing, to safe cracking, to bongo drum playing, etc, etc. He even has some tips on how to approach women at a bar!  If you like biographies about eccentric, intelligent people...you will most likely enjoy this one.<br />Cons: shipping and handling was more than the price of the book!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I LOVE GIDEON! i was so excited when the book came out. It has actually been a while since i finished the book (the first time i read it-read it twice now). i dont usually write reviews but i really do love the crossfire series! Reflected in You has everything i love HOT sex, interesting plot, and i love when books have the ex coming back and wanting the guy back but he has found someone else he loves. It is actually kinda sick how much i love when books have that, I kind of search that kinda thing out. I guess its the whole fighting for your man type this, just love it. I cant wait for Entwined with You comes out to see in Eva puts Corrine in her place for doing what she tryed to do.
B009MF5BXK|3.0|The Expendables 2 is the best movie to ever put me to sleep, I think. Well, it's neck and neck with Shoot 'Em Up. And let me tell you that is saying something since a lot of movies have put me to sleep. Heck, I've probably nodded off while watching half of the movies I've saw this year. That's how much I love movies! Anyway, The Expendables 2 includes some of the best acting since I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. Sylvester Stallone proves here why he has won 7 Academy Awards. Or is that zero Academy Awards? I forget. And then there is Arnold Schwarzenegger, proving why he is still acting at the age of 80. He's good! And let's not forget Chuck Norris. He'll probably kick my butt for saying this, but he is a very handsome man. Why girls are drooling over One Direction and Justine Bieber, and not Chuck Norris is beyond me. And last and also least, is Terry Crews. What a talented black actor he is. We need more black actors like him. He's the best black actor since Chris Tucker, fer sure. As all of you know, Christmas time is upon us. So buy that special person in your life The Expendables 2 on DVD or Blue-Ray. And they too can fall asleep while watching the wonderful acting from a seasoned cast of professionals!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved it!  The ending threw me off completely.  One of John Grisham's best.  Keep them coming!<br /><br />Would definitely recommend it!

B008JF8O9M|4.0|I wanted to print from my new Kindle Fire HD 7 directly to my HP WiFi printer.  HP has an app for this, but it does not work for my Kindle - yet.  Amazon tech folks are looking at this.<br /><br />In the meantime, the Amazon tech suggested a few apps that were compatible with my Kindle.  PrintBot is available and does print directly over WiFi to the printer.  It is not perfect, but it works.  As a test I found that I can easily print a web page, but if the page goes over a page of paper in size a line or two of text is lost.  With the free version, the graphics were just blanked out.  Anyway, this does give me the general functionality I want, and it is easy to use and set up.
B0051CSI0G|4.0|Over the years, certain Horror/SciFi films have been dealing with pandemic viruses usually turning the human race into rabid beasts or the zombie living dead.  Now, Director Jim Mickle and writer/actor Nick Damici have updated author Richard Matheson's epic 'I AM LEGEND' by having pockets of people surviving against loathsome vampire hordes instead of one last survivor in 'STAKE LAND', a film combining the morbid atmosphere of Director John Hilcoat's 'THE ROAD'-2009 and the living nightmare of AMC's hit television series 'THE WALKING DEAD' and  utilizing the vampire mythos of Director David Slade's '30 DAYS OF NIGHT'-2007 but without the clannish euphemisms.  The theme focuses on an adolescent played brilliantly by Conner Paolo as we grow to maturity through his eyes as they experience the nightmare which unfolds.  Director Jim Mickle who also helmed the brilliant 'MULBERRY STREET'-2008 is aided by Producer Larry Fessenden who also appears as a bartender ; lead actor Nick Damici who also appeared in 'MULBERRY STREET' and who shares the writing honors on this one ; a ghoulishly evil performance by actor Michael Cerveris and a beautiful cameo by actress Kelly McGillis.  The atmosphere is beautifully stated by photographer Ryan Samul and the nightmare is abetted by a melancholic music score by Jeff Grace.  It may be a zombie movie with fangs but the film emerges as a pleasant surprise as an overwhelming sense of dread hangs over the proceedings.  I saw the Blu-Ray single disc version which has beautiful sound and a crystal 2.35 widescreen transfer but there is a limited edition two disc set also for those who want more special features. Its definitely one of the best Horror films of the last decade and comes highly recommended.
0060919760|2.0|This book has some great insight on how to be happy. The general idea is to stop blaming other people for your own mental states.<br /><br />Here are the negative bits of the book:<br /><br />He states the commonly held idea that emotions are the result of thoughts. I agree with this in part, but only in part. Many times you can be thinking about an unpleasant event and that can make you sad; or maybe you're thinking about a very happy time and that can make you happy. OK. But certain emotions aren't based on thoughts. If you see a car coming straight towards you at 120 km/h in the opposite direction, the vast majority of people will have an emotional reaction. Nevertheless, this reaction was not caused by thoughts. It was a result of your survival instinct. So here, you most definetely do not have control over your emotions. Or if someone does, please talk to us about it.<br /><br />Another case where emotions can be out of our control is due to mirror neurons. For those of you that don't know, in an Italian university they made certain experiments on monkeys. The scientists reached the conclusion that the monkeys felt what other monkeys were feeling. Sad-sad, happy-happy, nervous-nervous, etc. Well, these neurons are also present in humans. How many times have you seen somebody cry and have started to cry yourself, even though you didn't know why they were crying? How many times has somebody been so happy that you felt the very same happiness. Then again, maybe there is a way control this, but let us know. The studies were made after Your Erroneous Zones was published, so the author isn't to blame: it just means that the information is outdated.<br /><br />The worst thing of the whole book is, IMO, the chapter about doing, seemingly, whatever you want, irrespective of others. I'm oversimplying but the ideas in this chapter are dangerous. \\"Always tell the truth\\"; \\"don't be tactful\\" ; \\"don't protect people.\\" As Allan Pease once said, if we were to tell the truth always, we would all end up in either in hospital or in jail. Awful advise by Dyer. What he should have said was that when \\"lying\\" was bad for both parties, they shouldn't engage in such behaviour. But often \\"lies\\" (I put this in inverted commas because I consider many people don't know enough about the world to tell the difference between a lie and a truth, as their perception can be distorted: in other words, the map isn't the territory) can be used for good. Imagine the case of a boy who was travelling with his family on a plane who, while rescuers are desperately trying to get him out of the fire, asks them if his family are still alive. The rescuers know they are dead, but if they say that to him, he could get paralyzed and end in dying in the blaze. Lies aren't always bad.<br /><br />He also implies that some states like guilt, worry, etc. serve no useful purpose and I disagree with this. These are natural emotions that are supposed to be there; it is only when they get out of proportion with the facts that they must be acted on.<br /><br />Here are the positive parts of the book:<br /><br />He says that your happines must come from within and you should not derive your sense of worth from society. He says that our culture encourages the idea of being needy and I agree. How many songs can you think of that go along the lines \\"if I can't have you, I don't want anybody.\\" It says you should have your own mind.<br /><br />In general, I think the book would have been great if it had omitted the negative parts I mentioned.ays, we would all end up in either in hospital or in jail.

1451613512|5.0|A few weeks ago I turned the dial on my television to discover \\"The Untold History of the United States\\" documentary. The series is directed by famous filmmaker Oliver Stone who is famous for such biopics as \\"Nixon\\": \\"JFK\\" and \\"Alexander.\\" Stone has produced this massive historical tome (almost 800 pages) along with scholary co-authorship by Dr. Peter Kuznick. The book is a revisionist history of American history from Woodrow Wilson to Barack Obama;s administration, The chroicle is chockablock with remarkable photographs illuminating the era.presidential administration being examined, The popular history will prove to be very controversial. Neo-Cons, Tea Party Members and conservatives will hate it challenging its negative view of the nascent growth and enormous power of the present American empire throughout the world. Liberals and persons who want to hear another side of the usual textbook school history of the republic will find the work a challenge to the reader's understanding. Among the themes in the book:<br />a. The United States has proven to be a supporter of right wing dictators and strong men in Latin America, Vietnam and the Middle East as long as the rulers are anti-communists and promote US business interests in their countries.<br />b. They present a negative account of Harry Truman contending that Japan was already defeated and the atomic bombs should not have been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Highly controversial view!<br />c. The US exacerbated Soviet-US relationship due to the vast inrease in the nuclear firewpower.<br />d. Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan were failed military ventures.<br />e. The authors trust Stalin and the Soviets much more than does this reviewer. Stalin was one of the cruelest and devious men to rule a nation in human history.<br />f. The Neocons during the Bush presidency led the nation into war against Iraq.<br />  As a patriotic American who loves this nation I was sometimes aghast and upset about what I read in these explosive pages. The book is well researched. Others books could be read which would have widely different interpretations of the events.

Don't spend more for this.  Just buy a plain Blu-Ray copy or just get it on iTunes.<br /><br />Very disappointed and wish I hadn't opened the packagg a few moments ago.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|At first I thought the book was so so and not very well written..After reading book one I had to get the other two to see what happens to their relationship.  Book 2 and 3 are much better than the 1st one.  I might not recommend purchasing the trio however..Might want to get on the library list..Didn't feel it was worth the cost.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|It was fast-paced, and kept my mind wondering what would happen next. Overall, I loved it, and would definitely recommend it to friends!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a great show, kind of like 24.  Lots of action, intrigue and twists and turns.  Recommend to those who like action shows
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|It came before it was supposed too. I would definitely, extremely, recommend this product. It is a super awesome show.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Excellent purchase! Shipped quickly with no issues. The movie and the purchase are flawless! Highly recommended to anyone. Many thanks!
B004UID2LC|5.0|songs are expensive so this app rocks and it WORKS!!!! if you have Internet connections this app will work. the only time you need Internet connection is when you are downloading the song or video but whether you have Internet or not when you listen or watch the song or video rodent matter!! the best part is its FREE!!!!!! you gotta luv it. also there us no limit to how many videos or songs u can have. get it get it get it!
B001EBWING|5.0|One of the best movies of all time.  Adventure, romance, intrigue and twists of fate - what else could you ask for?  It makes you long for a simpler time when it was easy to determine who the enemy was and everyone did the right thing, in spite of their own personal sacrifice.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I enjoyed this book more then any mystery I've ever read.  I highly recommend it to anyone, especially mystery lovers.
0140195076|5.0|Don't have words to express the praise of such a scholar (Hart deFouw). Very detailed information about vedic astrology. Learned a lot. Sending my  regards to the writer
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I am a writer myself, and am very particular about what I read: it has to have verisimilitude, a plausible character I can identify with, a sense of humour, tech (in the case of sci fi) that makes sense, and ingenuity. Andy Weir's novel has all this and more. As soon as I finished, I looked for more by this writer, but regrettably found nothing.<br /><br />I was pleased to find a book that goes against the trend of inexpensive sci-fi that contains a plethora of illiteracies --- I mention this latter because, unfortunately, in this age of self-published ebooks, too much appears that is littered with distracting typos, incoherent sentences and unintended homonyms. That is certainly not the case here. Weir demonstrates that he certainly knows his way around the effective use of English. Reading this book was a relief and a pleasure for me.<br /><br />The book was very satisfying on all counts, except that I would have liked a bit more denouement. It ended rather abruptly.<br /><br />Weir has created a very satisfying and particularly engrossing read.
B006ICOK00|5.0|This camera is highly customizable, can be mounted to a standard tripod mount - including a suction cup window mount - and can run for a REALLY long time on the AA batteries.<br /><br />We ran this camera at 10 minute intervals for almost two months and the batteries show now use at all.<br /><br />It's spendy, but it's worth it if you need to make frequent time lapse shots.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|We just discovered this series and it was fun catching up on all the old segements we had missed and weren't on rerun.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I'm definitely addicted! I love the lightsabers and use of the Force, so clever. I have already recommend this version to a couple others who also enjoy it. Can't wait for more levels!
B001MTENOC|5.0|Finally, things fit into place for me. I have had so many questions and this is the only book that has answered them. It makes perfect sense, all of it. For me anyway. Deja vu became clear to me, even that feeling that I have when I meet someone for the first time and swear that I have known them for years all makes sense now. What about when you look at a new born baby, and you think, thats an old soul.... you will get it now.. Excellently written, held my attention throughout. I found myself shaking my head and saying wow a lot. It just works, because thats how it is. I am no longer scared of death because I always knew in my heart there was something more but now I know for sure, because it just makes sense to me now.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another good book by Riordan.  I was so hoping this would be the end because I really wanted to know what happens in the story but of course he left it at a cliffhanger again :)<br /><br />Good story and very entertaining.  Two thumbs up!
B0036T31YY|4.0|Being a movie buff, i enjoyed this movie for a rainy Friday night. It is a combination of movies we've seen before but it was worth watching. They should of made a part 2.
1441412840|3.0|This is okay for what it is.  There are much better books out there that will teach you a lot more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so.much fun you can never be bored because it has so many hales in in big game I love it so much.
B004EKCNMA|3.0|There is just so many versions of this story, I was just not very impressed with this one at all.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game it is amazing fun and addicting. that is one of top 5 games and I can say that it is now my #1 fav.
B009GX7IRA|3.0|I only purchased this episode because Steve Valentine was in it.  Not the best CIS show but it was okay.
B000002MY3|5.0|loved it, it was a great price and came very quickly. You all always got what I want and need... thanks
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Forget &#34;Lincoln,&#34; this is the real way to experience our 16th president in all his ax-wielding, vampire-killing glory. Watch it!
0792164903|5.0|loved it, it was a great price and came very quickly. You all always got what I want and need... thanks
B007W8S2MG|5.0|It's the BEST GAME on the VITA, Period!<br /><br />If you're a fun of JRPGs, interesting and intricate story, and addictive (in a good way) gameplay, get this!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|loved it, it was a great price and came very quickly. You all always got what I want and need... thanks
B005LAIHSG|5.0|loved this movie. had a great story line and LOVE K- stew and Chris Hemsworth together. A great version to a classic story.
B00001MXXH|5.0|loved it, it was a great price and came very quickly. You all always got what I want and need... thanks
B008VBYN80|4.0|spend too much time on here although I never have enough energy kinda wish recharge rate for energy was quicker
B002BWP49C|5.0|loved it, it was a great price and came very quickly. You all always got what I want and need... thanks
B003ODIZL6|4.0|The dictionary is cool all I have to do is highlight a word and the word is defined for me it is cool
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|loved it, it was a great price and came very quickly. You all always got what I want and need... thanks
B0061S073A|5.0|Works great! Nice to know my child cant access the Internet while playing! Recommended for all parents and very easy to work!
B00003CXWV|5.0|loved it, it was a great price and came very quickly. You all always got what I want and need... thanks
B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved the suspense. The twists and turns in the story line were great, it really made me think about things.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|love this movie, a must see by all ages, this miracle on 34th street movie is my favorite of all the 34th street movies
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is probably the best book I have ever read. I gave it the best raring because the book kept you reading. With Peeta's real and true love and Katniss' fake love for the games you can't help but feel sorry for him. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes at si fy dystopian world books. I would also strongly recommend the last two books in the series. This is by far the best series ever.
B0053IOZBE|5.0|As a reward for finishing the book, I downloaded this movie to my iPad for my son. He loved it! And quickly started the next book.  The Amazon video was a quick and easy download.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|You should read this book if you like mythology mixed with real world stuff.<br /><br />Pros:Great book<br /><br />Cons:Kind of confusing<br /><br />Have fun reading.:)
0446547654|5.0|This has very easily become one of my top two Sparks Books. He always does amazing work, but this was above the rest.
B006VRDZ44|5.0|Great acting, directing and photography. Buscemi is the best, but all the other actors are really good. Plot teases make you want to watch more right away.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Time just melts away as you play.  My 6 year old granddaughter enjoyed playing along with me.  I recommend it.
B005LAII8K|2.0|The film is pretty good, but I hope they fire the guy that decided to use ultraviolet instead of digital copy.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|If you don't care about basic substance to a film I guess this could be okay.  I found it to be a great disappointment.<br /><br />There were too many points that just didn't add up.  In the beginning, Bruce is so injured he needs assistance from a mechanical leg device just to function, then after being beaten and thrown in a prison, he is suddenly able to preform as if he is in his peak of health.<br /><br />Did anyone else notice that the pit for prisoners to climb out of actually had a climbable wall both going up from the first platform or going over to the second platform everyone tried jumping to?  It seems like someone with batman's skills should have been able to climb across vs. making a leap based on fear.  It also did not make sense that no one else could make it out.<br /><br />The physics of the motorcycle he used also annoyed me, but I won't get into that now.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|I liked the ending and was pleased with the movie series. I look forward to more from the main actors.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This movie is very funny. I love the humor in it and it's got a very sweet ending, not to ruin it. I watch this every year with my family since we all find it funny each time we watch it during the holidays. I've shared this movie with my friends and one has even adopted in my tradition of watching this show every year. Definitely worth watching once. Kids and adults alike will get a chuckle.
0525953728|5.0|With the intense media coverage, I choose to order the book immediately in case there is ever a recall of the book or removal of it from the public being able to have access to this in the near future.
0143119680|5.0|Loaned out this one, finisshed the second, need the 3rd! Wish she would hurry with the 3rd installment! Can hardly wait! My Birthday is in January! :)
0385535147|4.0|I have always loved Grisham books and I eagerly awaited this one.  I was not disappointed and devoured my kindle version in two days.
B0032Y8XH8|1.0|This band is truly offensive and I can say that I have not said that about any band in last ten years. I wonder how this load of crap gets played on the radio.
1476712042|5.0|I picked up this book when I woke up this morning around 8am and I finished it by 4pm the same day. It's an excellent read. The writing style is very casual, just like people would talk in real life without a lot of extra flowery verbage. The tension between the characters is intense and definitely pulls you in. It tugged at my heartstrings and made me want to cry. I think the story would make an excellent movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the first few seemed ridiculously simple, but some challenges arose and i found it to be very fun. this game would be the most fun for people who would consider themselves visual thinkers.
0780619951|5.0|My family member recently lost his copy of this movie while he was moving out, but I found it here.  It's one of his favorites, so I'm glad it was available.  If you enjoy horror/science fiction, you'll probably enjoy this film as well.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie gets better and better the more you watch it and bluray is the best way to watch. This series (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises) is the best out there, with lots of characters to love. Even the small characters are great. If you like movies with a full range of emotions check out The Dark Knight Rises and the rest of the series. Inspiring fiction. Did I mention top notch action, great actors/acting, unparalleled visual effects(not just used for the sake of visuals, but to better the story), and great musical scoring? These movies will be remembered long after most of the other garbage out there is forgotten.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Cornwell never disappoints! I've read the entire Kay Scarpetta series and each one is better than the last! Great read!
B003SQZFHQ|5.0|Great quality. Love the cast. Love the show. I am glad it is coming back. I am missing my Jules and Dime Eyes.
0525952926|1.0|Someone needs to write a critique of folks who may, nowadays, puke into a mic and just babble on for 1000 pages.  This is a good example.  I was attracted to Mr. Follett with Key to Rebecca; then, with Pillars of the Earth, I was revived as an admirer.  But...<br /><br />Please do not waste your time on this trash.  I have come to regard Mr. Follett as just another horny old man.  Here he attempts to capsulize the WWII era from the contending forces and families: Brits, Americans, Germans, Russians.  What it comes down to is this: \\"Readers, you might not realize this, but WWII is just one big bed-hopping orgy\\".  And on top of this, his Marxist sentiments are forever shoved straight down your eyes.<br /><br />I am only on page 600+ of this, fortunately, library copy of this piece of nonsense. And I doubt that I have the desire or time to see it through.<br /><br />Will Baker (willbaker@nvinet.com<br /><br />PS: I am not aware of what assets (people) Mr. Follett might have to hand to put his thoughts to print...ie, 14 year-old transcribers...but the result is most juvenile.  Not to mention his numerous historical errors. (ie, his recount of the \\"Battle of Saragossa\\" (Spain, 1937) has no basis in fact.  The man has talent, Mr Follett.  But the pressure of timely publication to attain maximum revenue must be hard to combat.  And the result is very bad literature.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Excellent price-performance. I was very pleased with the range of volume for mic and music fed in from a karaoke song.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|So many people compared these books to FSOG. I think they are completely different. Reflected in you was very well written. In fact, I read it twice, but now I have to wait until May 2013 for the next book. That is a huge disappointment, but I guess worth it.
B0013ND30M|5.0|The animation is beautiful, the music is wondrous to hear, absolutely everything is perfect. Every frame is a masterpiece.This film is the definition of perfection.
B005OP7162|5.0|This show is great. How can you not love it? Great plot, a little romance & of course some revenge!
B008NNNF7G|5.0|The latest by southern rockers Blackberry Smoke takes me back to the seventies. Great guitar driven rock,yet they merge soul and blues into the music! Best album yet,and keep up the good work!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I can't imagine anyone considering this set would be disappointed. It's really cool to hear the mono mixes, which are noticeably different from the stereo. But these are Beatles albums... It's a bit like rating Shakespeare or fire. They changed the world and nothing has ever been the same since (or so I'm told).<br /><br />But the point of the review is to comment on sound quality and packaging. I'm not really an audiophile, but this does sound better than the eighties masters. And the packaging is great: little replicas of the original LPs!
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Full of advertizing. Can't play without popups and can't let kids play. One wrong tab and they have ordered something.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|have no complaints about the product. It came just as described. However, I'm not used to waiting more than three days for a shipment. This seller took a long time to package and ship. I normally receive notice from seller next day that item has shipped. Yes, it arrived within the normal timeframe but I still expected more since I get quality results all the time. Will I recommend this seller, yes only because the item was very reasonable.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|Said it fit on Kindle Fire, but not on my Kindle Fire HD. No specification listed that it wouldn't fit on it. Amazon took care of that.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|If you don't have anything else to do, this would be OK to watch, probably. I rented it because of Bruce Willis.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I read this hoping to see &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; only to find that another person almost died and had a fantastic dream that felt very real.  Being a neurosurgeon I would have expected more than to fall for the same old fantasy.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|Balanced for both men and women.<br />Great date flick.<br />I don't normally like musicals - this is the best!<br />Ok, Sound of Music was the best.<br />Second best then...
B009KS4XRO|4.0|As with any new app, bugs need to be worked out and not all features are loaded as compared to the online version. Hopefully the developers will be able to re-create and intragrate the online features to the app. Overall, it is a decent app.
B00337KMAA|5.0|I used to travel a lot.<br />I used to be married with kids.<br />My life was the road.<br />I had no real life till I quit that crazy life.<br />Good for single people, maybe.<br />Technology should do away with this sort of thing - but I doubt it.<br />There will always be people like this.<br />Excellent character study - especially if you ever consider this sort of employment.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|Heard a song or two on the radio by this band that I had never heard of.  Submarines is what really caught my attention as well as Ho, Hey.  There is an infectious beat.  I also previewed some of their performances on YouTube.  I purchased the CD and was not disappointed.  I like every song and most I really, really like.  That is saying a lot because sometimes you buy a CD and there is only one good song on it.  If you, like me, sometimes want to find a new band/artist to stimulate your musical taste, I would not hesitate to recommend The Lumineers.  Preview the songs here at Amazon and, if you like what you hear, you will like the CD.  Oh, and I just heard the Lumineers were nominated for a Grammy.
B00158K0S8|5.0|Old blood and guts Patton come alive on the screen.<br />A no nonsense general came upon the scene in WW2 and did what few could possible do - win a war against an opponent as strong as evil could be.<br />Not wanting to waste time with formalities or political correctness - get the job done - he did.<br />Bigger than life character portrayed by George C. Scott.<br />Supreme acting by all in this movie.
B0085LUEMK|5.0|I liked everything about this book.  It went over so many aspects and different fabric design options.  What I loved the most was that it went over how to do repeats and resizing in Photoshop.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|You cannot make a movie like this today.<br />It is estimated that today (2012), it would cost about 1.2 Billion. Yes with a 'B'.<br />The sets, panoramas, and locations are breath taking.<br />The acting is like nothing seen today.<br />The patience and love that went into this movie are evident from the first 10 minutes.<br />See for yourself.<br />You will be glad you did.
B003CI90MQ|4.0|I wish there was more content.  Expanding on what is already there anyway.  That's probably why this is a series...but I still felt a little let down that there wasn't more.  Scott Kelby's writing style, on the positive, is awesome!  He is so funny and I think I laughed at almost every page.  Well written but needs more.
B003EYVXUU|4.0|This is based on the Scandinavian version of \\"let the right one in\\".<br />It puts this to shame.<br />Otherwise - this is a good movie by itself.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Koch kody Koch kody kody kody kody kody kody kody kody kody mikayla mikayka mikayla mikaula mikayla love love love lzovd you yuo
0786182466|5.0|Hilarious. A style like no one else I've ever read. Great characters, especially Ignatious. And it all comes together in the end.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|When Ridley Scott signed on to make this Alien prequel, I definitely had my reservations. You always hate to see the legacy of past films tainted by mediocre follow ups that are nothing more than tepid attempts to make a quick buck off sentimental viewers who feel compelled to watch because of how much they enjoyed the previous movies.<br />Naturally, I went to see Prometheus in theaters because of my love of the series, especially Alien and Aliens. Absolutely loved every second of it. I thought the film was visually brilliant, fantastically minimal story line that does enough to draw you in but does not bore you with overwrought details and it did justice to the previous films in the series. Therefore, I knew I had to get it on its Blu-Ray release.<br />The movie itself is a reminder of why you bought that pricey HD television in the first place, a must have in your collection of high def movies. The 4-disc colllector's edition has a lot of great bonus material and I feel Scott himself put great effort to make sure the viewers get their money's worth.<br />In conclusion, Prometheus is a sci-fi film done properly in 2012.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Great concert through and through. No frills and keeps in line with the studio albums unlike their heyday when their was so much improvisation. Of course they all are older but still smoke anybody that is out today. Kashmir and For your life are my top 2 songs on this CD/DVD. A must buy for and Zep fan.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|This movie really is gold. I loved every single second of it. Inspiring, touching and incredible. The only thing I hate is the fact that Disney will not produce the second part of this amazing film, but I respect their decision, they think they already shown everything of the history in the first movie and they might be right, this movie had everything. I love it, and I can promise you will too! Everyone should watch it! 5/5 stars.
B009329ZF2|1.0|Terrible acting, horrid dialogue, this movie is terrible. Even if you just want to watch a simple dumb action movie there are waaaaaaayyyyyy better ones out there. Do not watch!
030759565X|5.0|Wonderful cookbbook!  Can't wait to try all of the recipes!  Great job Deb!  So far, I have made Alex's chocolate raspberry rugelach, very good, and the marbled pumpkin gingersnap tart, to die for!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I wish I could play this game over and over and I wish there were more levels. This was such a fun game and never disappoints!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Viewing this in Blu Ray and in the special edition made the series have so much more sense.  Especially as I had purchased and viewed Prometheus.  Crisp color.
1400049628|5.0|I bought this for my husband because he is a big fan of the Zombie Apocalypse. So I got this book to put into his &#34;Zombie survival kit&#34; that i'm making him for Christmas. I know for a fact that he is going to love this! Can you say best wife ever?!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best season this far. Looking forward to the up coming seasons. A a a a a a a a a
1582406723|5.0|I bought this for my husband for xmas. He absolutely loves the walking Dead and so do I...so I can't wait to read this after he opens it!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The title sums it up, WAKING UP MARRIED, and this is a trope that I love reading when it's done well. No worries here, as Ms. Kelly did a fabulous job of setting up the situation and then following through with the aftermath.<br /><br />Megan's first thought upon waking up with a stranger is that she and Carter? Connor? need a divorce, like NOW.<br /><br />But CONNOR has other ideas. He thinks that Megan is exactly what he was looking for. He wants a family, but he doesn't want love. He wants affection and fidelity. But love? Well, that just brings heartache. Surely it's better to have someone that you can count on, but not someone who is going to hurt your heart.<br /><br />There was a twist later on that hurt my heart. Well done, Ms. Kelly!<br /><br />Since this is a Harlequin, we all know how it's going to end up, that's why we read these books. But what a road these two had to follow. There is sweet, hot loving...and then that dose of drama to mess with your mind and to get your heart rate up. Again, well done!<br /><br />Thank you, NetGalley and Harlequin KISS, for giving me the opportunity to read WAKING UP MARRIED by Mira Lyn Kelly.
B007TMON8M|5.0|This was a fun and learning game that was quiet a challenge but i loved it! It was everything I thought it would be!
B00999VI0Y|4.0|Sometimes it works well other times it does not.  Do not know if it is an issue with the new iPhone or the product.
B00782O7IY|5.0|This definitely deserved all the Academy hype. I enjoyed the fact that the actors had to get their emotions across thru their actual acting ability and not be dependent on scripted words. Beautiful movie
B008WCP2PG|1.0|Attention Soderbergh: While women can appreciate hot bodies, that does not mean you can throw away everything else.<br /><br />I could only watch this movie to about the middle before I turned it off.  I found myself wandering away to do other things, like checking to see if any dishes needed to be washed.  Boring, boring, boring.  I haven't seen such bad acting in a long time, and the whole movie seems to comprise a bunch of guys wandering around making up the script as they go along.  The whole thing just drags.  And the supposed love interest?  She's the worst of the bunch.  I hope she doesn't quit her day job, as Mike says at one point.  I thought the dance sequences might be a saving grace, but they aren't.  It really makes me wonder about the people who said this was a good movie.  What a waste of film and talent.
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|Not bad for a scifi series. Prefer Fringe due to character development and less predictable. It did finally improve the last couple of shows.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I love Dexter..recommend it to all Dexter fans!!!!  I really enjoy being able to watch one episode after another and not have to wait....
B006HGXGWU|4.0|This movie gave me a much better watch than expected. It had twists and turns that came out of the blue. Do not judge this one by its cover. More psycholgical than expected.
B008MEM24S|5.0|We bought this game for my 6 year old, after having played Where's My Water, and he loves it just as much! Makes him think, which makes me love the game too!
B006PTL1QM|5.0|I really enjoyed the excellent acting skills of all the players. It was a riveting tale and kept me spell bound.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|I bought this dvd/concert as it was available. The new songs are esplendid and goes direct to the heart. The sound is very good, the cameras do not take as much of the public and the feelings you can see in their faces. The public, english, are no as refined as the ones in tne concert &#34;An evening with IL DIVO&#34;, from Barcelona. In the late one, the scenery, the public is very identified with IL DIVO, they gave and throw flowers to them, they sang with them. In England, the feeling is different, i don't know why. By this time, in my opinion, the Barcelona concert is the best, for far more. It is not the fault of  IL DIVO, but of someone in the staff, and don't forget that the Coliseum is an extraordinary place to film a concert.
0307943259|5.0|Even though Grisham is not writing as quickly as he did earlier, he has kept up the good work. The plot was solid and the story was riveting. Any one who has enjoyed his previous work or wants to check out his talent will like this one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its funner than I thought! and I like how you have to get points from the other games to get more games:) I like to go and just look through different apps when I'm bored and I'm glad this one caught my eye! plus its free! deffinetly worth downloading:)
B004LWZWBU|4.0|I really liked the actors in this film and their interactions. It was fun and had some nice scenery. Not the typical Jack Black or Steve Martin flick.
B000004166|5.0|A must have if you enjoy Mozart. O-O-H ! the and those VIOLINS. A true joy to the EARS !!
1600247245|5.0|Michael Connelly does it again with a story that twists in a totally unexpected way. I am always mesmerized by his writing. I have followed him since his first Harry Bosch story. His characters are crisp and flawed and so true to human reality.
B007RP4D5Y|3.0|This CD is OK, It has some Classic Metheny style but is not like the days of His Bands (70-80's). Metheny and Mays when together were just outstanding, Those are the HIGH points of Metheny. Do not get me wrong He has a TOUCH for jazz that No One can match, especially when he plays with musicians outside of his norm. The man has JAZZ talents NO DOUBT !!!
B006KSAPV0|5.0|If you like a movie that is well directed, well acted, and has a great script, this is a must have!! The story was riveting and held my attention from the first. This is just such a wonderful but also very real movie. Not a kids movie due to the sexual scenes (no overt nudity but plenty of sex).
B00005KARK|5.0|I'm glad I bought this.  My kids and I enjoy this movie.  It's about a mother and baby elephant who are in a circus but get separated and the baby (Dumbo) discovers (with the help of a mouse friend) that he can fly - so he's a big circus hit and becomes reunited with his mother.  It's a touching story, full of clowns, action, tender moments, music and adventure.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|The acting in this movie was good. Especially appreciated the work of Charlize Theron. This move is a bit harsh for young kids. The actual fairy tale gets lost in this version.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|Great music. Classic 70's and 80's Rush rocks and so does this '90s work. I'm in my 40s and liked Rush in my teens.  I'm glad I've rediscovered them and I'm sharing them with a whole new generation and they like it to.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like the game but all of a sudden it wont let me play? I hit the app and it comes to the app store, and if I hit &quot;open&quot; it doesn't do anything. I don't get it. Help?
B005LJETYI|4.0|Like others have said, this book is like Groundhog Day mixed with Starship Troopers.  But that isn't all, it is that plus stereotypical anime themes such as a young introverted male lead, a very young but assertive female supporting character, and many cases of anime teen awkwardness.<br /><br />I don't really like anime so these references and themes bothered me when they kept popping up, but I still was hooked all the way to then end so I can't really complain too much about it.<br /><br />If you absolutely hate anime, then I'd say wait and see the Americanized movie adaptation with Tom Cruise as the lead.  If you can stomach it and just love sci-fi and action, then I'd recommend this book wholeheartedly.<br /><br />What I Liked:<br /> -Great Sci-fi Premise<br /> -Plausible Science<br /> -Great Aliens<br /> -Great Action (Though some parts could have been improved with more detail, you sometimes feel like you're reading a montage...)<br /> -Good Hero Development<br /> -Fast Pace (Quick Read at ~200 pages)<br /><br />Didn't Like:<br /> -Anime Teen Awkwardness (Most characters seemed like they where in their early teens, and not in their early twenties.)<br /> -The Anime Feel  (The writing style makes you visualize an anime while reading this book.  Not really my taste)<br /><br />All that being said, I'm still fighting the urge to go back and read through it from the beginning.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I bought it and right after I beat the whole game first try. it has almost no challenge and I never even saw slender man. he never showed up.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much....it lifted my spirits when needed.  Was very fast and easy reading.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|This is a great little movie. Good action, solid budget. Very real soldier scenarios. Surprisingly good, halo fan or not.<br /><br />FYI, It's also free on youtube.
B009O2XY12|2.0|Actually let a friend of mine's daughter download onto my phone to play with.  When I tried it later...dull dull dull
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game will play as long as you want to play. just don't get in a hurry and spend a lot of real money it is easy to do.
B004IQ78HA|3.0|But before I go my review is -Seemed dated - not classic. watch the Johnny Dep version- way more enjoyable
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My little girl is so interested in this game when she comes from school this is the first thing she asks me for. She loves this game and so does she. It's a great way for girls to get I to adventure.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This is the greatest movie I have ever seen  you must watch this movie it is amazing nothing it wrong with it!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|If you liked the direction Soundgarden went in with Down on the Upside, you will definitely enjoy this album. No, it's not as dark or heavy as their earlier works, but that's not to say that it doesn't feel very organically like a Soundgarden album (and I do own and listen to all their previous albums). King Animal feels like the work of a band that still has great ideas musically but has also matured significantly in the sixteen years since they last put out an album.<br /><br />The classic elements are all there musically and lyrically, but it's striking to me what a difference in tone there is on the new album. Even at their most aggressive -- for example, on the somewhat political track 'Non-State Actor' -- it's hard not to get a sense of hopefulness from the lyrics and music -- and much of the rest of the album is like this. 'Bones of Birds' is on the surface a very dark song (with a catchy chorus, by the way), but it's also clear they are writing about family and the fears of trying to raise one, and it's expressed beautifully. This is a song that the 20-something, sarcastic, angst-ridden, substance-abusing kids who wrote Badmotorfinger probably couldn't have written. The converse of that, of course, is that we probably won't get another 'Rusty Cage' from middle-aged Soundgarden, but that matters little if the music is still good, and it is.<br /><br />So despite the rather audacious tone of the album's first track (which initially turned me off, though it's grown on me), King Animal is not really a &#34;comeback&#34; album in the sense that they're clearly not trying to recapture some past glory (or past image of themselves) a la Metallica with Death Magnetic, or countless other such albums from older acts. Rather, King Animal sounds like Soundgarden pretty unassumingly picked up where they left off after Down on the Upside -- still Soundgarden, only aged like a fine wine.
B000UR9T8W|5.0|Must have this movie watched it over 20 times and still love it! Spiderman is the coolest superhero in the world!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A definite page turner! At first it took a bit to get into because of the author's style of writing, but it turned out to be a great book. It kept me guessing the whole way through!
B000BFH2S2|1.0|I was so disappointed with the performance. Michael looks so classy but is so rude and crude when talking to the audience. I was so offended I threw the CD and DVD away!
0345803507|5.0|Would recommend the complete set of 3. A well written story line by E.L. James, everything fits perfectly into place.
0446573027|2.0|I found the Puller character quite boring. No twinkle in his eye and definitely not Jack Reacher. Too predictable and the dialogue was sometimes right out of the Walton's tv show.<br /><br />This was not up to Baldacci's usual books. I won't buy the next Puller book. Plus, Pullers father was ridiculous.  Sorry David.
0345803493|5.0|Anyone who is into good romance novels  - this series of 3 is it. Completely satisfied at the end of book 3, yet left me curious enough to want for a book 4. Well written story line. Will follow E.L. James.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|I love the color of the case. It fits the phone great. My only complaint is that when I took it out of the package, it had several scratches on it.  I did keep it though for 2 reasons. It took 3 weeks to get it and I paid less than $2 for it.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|I bought this upgrade after the incandescent bulb on my Maglite Mini burned out. I was considering getting the LED Maglite Mini, but chose this for a couple of reasons:<br /><br />1) I was happy with the brightness of the original incandescent bulb that came with the Maglite mini.<br /><br />2) The LED Maglite Mini which is much brighter only lasts for about 2.5 hours. This kit claims up to 25 hours!<br /><br />The brightness is great for simple spot lighting. It is alot brighter than the standard bulb (I have a second Maglite Mini - it will get one of these upgrades when the bulb burns out on it).<br /><br />If you want a brighter light that lasts longer per battery charge, then this is a great way to keep your Maglite mini working, rather than throwing it away and buying a new flashlight.
0811870413|5.0|This book gives clear, easy to follow instructions for making the easiest, most delicious sourdough bread.  It goes into detail discussing technique, so much more useful than those cookbooks that just provide a list of ingredients.
B009FXIICK|4.0|I had to buy my wife a Kindle Fire HD to get my Kindle back from her.  She became engrossed in the game.  I kind of liked it too. :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|virtual city playground is really a great game and a great way to pass of your time bored. you  need to install it. i give virtual city playground like five stars. its better than most of the other city building. games.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|A group of sleazy people, including the main character, off on a quasi-corrupt mission.  As someone else remarked, even the author didn't seem to like or feel empathy for any of the characters.  Not one of Grisham's best by any means.
B003XT603Q|1.0|Things that were so important to him are just not to me. Too much detail and self absorption. Not sure why this has such a high review.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a quick easy to use game.  It required no learning. It is very intuitive.  It is also easy to play one handed.
B0009A40ES|3.0|American Psycho is a great movie. It was really interesting to see which scenes they decided to put back in. I personally think the theatrical version is better, and that is not included on this disc. I thought since it was a collector's edition it would have both. Nope.
B009APMNB0|4.0|The product worked on Windows 7 64 bit laptop. Also if it is connected to an external monitor. It allows you to compare an image that comes with it at the end of the procedure that takes about 10min. But, if you are going to re-do the calibration, it is still going to show you the same picture. Wouldn't you expect to see the previous status?<br /><br />The application that you install will prompt you to register the product and will also pull the serial no and model info into the registration page. But when you try to register it will say invalid serial no. Same result even if you enter all the info manually. How could this be? Did I get a product that was previously registered? Tried contacting Xrite multiple times with all the required info thru their support page and received no response. I will try to replace the product and see if I can register the product to receive free support. But they already did not show any concern to my previous requests. What am I thinking about?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved this book! I like how I can relate to the characters and that time in their lives. Just to be able to remember those times in high school!! Did not see the ending coming, but still great.
B0091THRCU|5.0|Very good case for the price and fits easy into a shirt pocket.<br />The Card slot will fit only one credit card however and would be tough for more than 5-6 business cards.<br />A good value all around
B00003CXGG|5.0|I brought this DVD because i'm an Aaliyah fan. And it's actually a very good movie. As noted by other reviewers Aaliyah & Jet Li chemistry was great. They both played there roles perfectly. It's action packed and funny. You won't get bored watching this movie, especially if you're a fan of Aaliyah or Jet Li. This DVD also has special features. I'll name a few: Two Aaliyah music videos (Which is awesome for Aaliyah fans), Behind the scene footage of Aaliyah filming \\"Try Again\\" music videos, & Behind the scene documentaries of the cast. If your an Aaliyah or Jet Li fan you should buy this DVD. If Aaliyah were still alive today i would of loved for her and Jet Li to have worked on more movies like this together, there own screen chemistry is amazing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is simple but challenging. A fun puzzler. It makes you think. Its easy at first then becomes more tricky. Many levels, and its free.
B009K0P10K|4.0|I'm so addicted to this show!!!!! Can watch on Hulu for free though. Bought the regular not hd and its really horrible should have paid a little more because its all blurry looking
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|I bought this CD as a gift but I had to check it out for myself. When I got the CD it was just like how I would buy it in the store. It actually came earlier then delivery date. I'm very happy with this product and recommend buyers add this seller to their favorites.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Arguably my favorite season thus far of Walking Dead.  I will easily continue to watch the rest of the season.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey at his best and you KNOW there will be the next chapter, hopefully soon!  I think a lot of this story can be traced to actual events.  Very exciting!
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I enjoyed this film.It was a fun movie the cast is great. Needed a little more humor. &#34;Tonight.... im going to kill myself.&#34; lol
B003H4I4JU|1.0|If you are looking for a continuation of all the things you loved about Ender's Game this is NOT the book for you.  I loved Ender's Game so much that I went right on to Speaker for the Dead and was very let down.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I had already seen this film and I loved it and now seeing it again, but in blueray even better!
B00005MP58|5.0|Love this movie.  My previous copy was scratched.  So I needed a new copy.....Love this movie and would buy it again.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I thought that i bought the wrong movie with subtitles but that was not the case I really enjoy this movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is definitely a book difficult to put down. Witty and fun from the start. A book I could read again.
1419702238|4.0|My son has all of the books in this series. This one does not disappoint. Its in the same text / cartoon format as the others. Kids enjoy it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This was a great game! The first levels are easy, but they get harder and more addictive as the game processes. 4/5 stars!
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This is one of my all time favourite movies. I would buy it all over again just to hear Whitney sing I will always love you. My pores raise whenever I hear her sing that song. Not the greatest storyline, but its so romantic, who really cares? :)
B002TYZKIM|4.0|This video was mostly footage from the rehearsals that were part of the prep for the last tour. It was really interesting to see the behind the scenes footage and listen to how the people who were part of the production team percieved him. Defintely worth having if you are an MJ fan.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|Collections like this is one of the great things about Kindle.  You can build a library of classic literature cheaply without building a bookself.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|having been a soldier i thought this would be a good read & it was. i however did not appreciate his political opinions thus its ok, if he hadnt done that i would have said 5 stars.
B001Q7JD3Q|5.0|With absolute bonkers anticipation I waited for this movie to show and I was definitely not disappointed.  Fantastic viewing!  Had to have the blu ray dvd, of course the extended version!  I love this set as it gives more of the jungle search with added scenes of other confrontations with prehistoric beasts that weren't in the theatrical version. Believe me there will be no regrets purchasing this set!
B008J05EL8|1.0|I am very disappointed I can`t figure out to return it I have only had it one day it won`t open and just plain old sucks Very misleading app and I will not purchase with this company again.  If anyone can tell me how to return it or let me know if I am just stuck paying for an app I can`t use. The rating would not have any stars if I could take the one off!!!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Again, they've done a great job combining horror with kinky. The new setting, the asylum, has made it even more mysterious and scary.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|Lawless------  Very slow moving.  Basically poor acting. The main character had no personality at all very bland.  Definitely not a first rate movie.  A very dark movie.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie.  I thought is was good, but not a blockbuster or a movie I would care to see again.
1932100660|5.0|Read this book!  If you are interested and your health and your family's well being get this book and become enlightened.
0525478817|5.0|This book now stands on my shelf for favorite books...next to a first English addition of Tom Sawyer. I felt like I was seeing with the eyes of these exceptional teens...teens living with terminal cancer. How you can do this with humor, respect and without it being depressing...is amazing. Every night I allowed myself a chapter so it did not go too fast. Like a well-written piece of music...it ended with the same brilliance as it began.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A strange but engaging book with twists and turns and lots of lessons and insight into human nature.  Hard to put down!
B0063IH60K|1.0|This app froze on an add for singles. I uninstalled it immediately thinking it was some type of spam-ware..Don't waste your time with this one. There are other free solitaire apps that work well.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I saw a travelling production in San Francisco a number of years ago and I was unimpressed. When I saw this on public television, I was bowled over! The acting and casting, the production values, all add up to a gorgeous production.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|MARK OWEN (REAL NAME MATT BISSONNETTE) VIOLATED THE OATH OF SECRECY HE SIGNED TO WITHHOLD CLASSIFIED INFO. HE WROTE THIS BOOK FOR PERSONAL GAIN AND DESERVES TO BE THROWN IN PRISON
B009HEJXFS|5.0|It's a shame it took them this long to make a MIB as good as the first, but at least they did.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|DVD arrived in great shape. I am a huge fan of this show and have watched every season available. Would definitely order again.
006197806X|4.0|This review found originally on All The Stacks [...]  If I had to pick my favorite new-to-me author of 2012, I would pick Lauren Oliver. I was first introduced to Lauren Oliver through her first book Before I Fall (my review can be found on my other blog here). I loved it so much, I had to pick-up Delirium which is amazing and let me to read book two in the series, Pandemonium.    Lena is now in the Wilds, having made it over the fence alone, at the end of Delirium. The chapters are broken up into Now and Ten which depicts Lena when she is first found in the Wilds and the present, where she is working for the resistance. The concept of dual personas, remains throughout Pandemonium. Lena is a broken shell when she is first found, weak, heartbroken over all that she has lost. She starts to build up walls against feeling the pain and tries to put the past behind her.    On her first mission for the resistance, she is forced to confront the two Lena's and decide if she wants to continue not to feel. If she wants to let society, either the zombie society of the cured or even that of the resistance, to tell her how she should feel. Through Oliver's deft writing, the choices Lena makes begin to unfold until she decides to take a stand for what she knows is right.    I really enjoyed the many shades of gray throughout Pandemonium. The lines blur between the good guys and the bad guys. Lena is forced to make her own path, even if she has to do it alone. The passion and feeling of young love is written beautifully. You get just a taste to feel some of what the characters are feeling. That fleeting hint of young love and passion.    Pandemonium is a great follow-up to Delirium. The progress that Lena makes leads us effortlessly into book three without Pandemonium feeling like filler. I am anxiously awaiting the conclusion to this wonderful series.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its great. my kids love doing all the different games. they do wish it were easier to get more points.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is fun and at times challenging but there is always a great picture at the end. I highly recommend this game to puzzle enthusiasts.
B0042UEU8M|5.0|This movie wasn't what I expected but it is worth watching! You wont be disappointed as long as you have an open mind!
B0061S0A64|2.0|Its an entertaining idea, but I can't seem to find a practical use for it<br />other then wasting time and making alot of noise.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|Its a good board, but the on board fan speed controller changes from time to time on its own.<br />over all 4 star 5 at gaming
B00913DPW2|3.0|It is a fun game, with an interesting premise, but after awhile the puzzles just become needlessly tedious.<br />I mean, three sliding puzzles just to get one artifact. Those things can take hours. Sorry, not worth it.
B0091XRL86|5.0|My daughter loved it and my husband did too. Who could ask for anything better? Cute story-line and had those funny moments for adults as well.
B006C1DH92|3.0|As far as games of this genre go its entertaining.<br />Only get it if you can for free though.<br />The Puss in Boots skin really doesn't do anything to<br />enhance the game over the original. But its still a good way<br />to kill a few minutes here and there..
B0096HID5M|5.0|We are big musical movie fans and this one translated well from stage to video. Instead of renting it we bought it because we knew we would end up watching it more than once. My husband who swore up and down they would ruin all of his favorite music, loved it, he was even singing along!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Its a fun game to play, but it will take forever to try to win without spending a ton of real cash on in-game resources.<br />Which are really overpriced, and not something that is a good idea in a children's game.
0345803485|1.0|I recently read this book just to see what the hype was about and was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED! This book is horrible and makes Ana look crazy and just simple disgust me! I was really bored and read up until page 332 and just couldn't take it anymore. I would not suggest anyone read this book and I shall never buy another book by this author.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|For such a phenomena that angry birds seems to be...<br />Its a fun game for sure, and a good way to kill time.<br />Maybe its just me, but only so many times i want to keep<br />trying to toss those birds at increasingly ridiculous pig-built structures.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|I thought the plot and acting was that of a &#34;B&#34; grade movie.  The audio was terrible and without closed caption we could not understand what was being saild and needed to increase and decrease the volume.  If all Amazon movies do not have closed caption capability, we will not be watching any more movies on Amazon.com.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the true form of minecraft on the kindle and no matter how many ripoffs are produced by third party developers like Rose or.Modscenter Minecraft will do better than them all and sets the bar for exploration and building
B003YBUSMW|5.0|I highly recommend this wireless racing wheel to anyone into automobile racing games.  I use this racing wheel with my Xbox 360.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Works great on my kindle!! Hands down my favorite app!!<br />I like using this app on my kindle more than pinterest on my computer.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|This app is great! I had been looking for just this type of application to use on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I am testing it on my Motorola Zoom while I await the arrival of the Fire 8.9. I love the user interface. I also like the many available paper options and app settings. The app is quite intuitive to use. It is similar to Genial Writing that is in the Google Play Store but this app is better, faster and much easier to use. Great job!
B0086213XW|3.0|This was an odd, but somewhat compelling movie.  I say somewhat because I couldn't find anything better as I ran on the treadmill to watch.  Video killed the Radio Star remix as she sits on the scrambler?  That's a bit artsy and precious for me.  This movie was artsy and precious throughout but Ms. Williams has a cute body and emotive expressions.  That's really all that kept me watching.  Seth dude was overly one dimensional.  His thinking woman's Will Ferrell delivery didn't do it for me here.  This sort of New York feminine minimalism that's popular in the blog inspired literature today grows excruciatingly tedious at times.<br /><br />I don't think I would have gone to a theater to see this movie.  It was okay on a treadmill.  The whole ends with a waltz thing is the equivalent to screen writing that It was a dark and stormy night is to a bad high school creative writing assignment.<br /><br />It shouldn't become a cult movie though.  Too dumb and her cute body and facial expressions doesn't quite carry it.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I recently downloaded this version for my 7 y/o son who loves this game.  So far, no complaints and keeps him occupied when we are on the road running daily errands.  The only downside is that I now have to consider buying him his own kindle or tablet so I can get to read and play my favs.
B003DT19F0|5.0|Another fantastic movie in the Tinker Bell series. The whole family enjoys these movies immensely. We plan on obtaining the entire collection!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I hope there is a sequale for this one. I liked it . Too bad Timothy Olophant will not be in the future ones.
B009EAALII|2.0|After listening to his previous bluray release (Chris Isaak: Live / Greatest Hits: Live [Blu-ray] (2005)):<br />(...)<br />I was expecting the same level of video and audio quality.  Unfortunately this production falls far short in both areas.  The audio level is quite low and the audience applause seems to much more elevated in the rear channels.  In addition fast moving objects have a strobe-like effect -- similar to a 24fps->30fps transfer without motion compensation.  Whoever did the mastering on this disc obviously did not know what they were doing.  Finally, for whatever reason, they cut out the Wanda Jackson parts.  So if you're expecting the same performance that was broadcast on PBS you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />I'm a huge Isaak fan and this disc is a disservice to him and his band.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|I love this movie I seen it when it came out and I have watched it on and off for 40yrs. I am a Clint Eastwood fan.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really. enjoy the game- but most of the time it freezes on me.  I have to unstall it half the time.  I bate to start over again and lose all of my stuff.  I. love to finish it one these times.
B000JIHP88|4.0|I got this mobile for my first son and and am now using it for him 2 years later, AS WELL AS for his little brother. I love the classical songs, with the Mozart option being my favorite. They are so soothing and they last just the right amount of time, not too long, not too short. It has two sound levels so you can have it very quiet or louder, but not too loud. The light emitted is perfect for nighttime, it's enough to let the baby to gaze into it but not too bright. The remote is fantastic for those times when it does cut off before your child's asleep and for someone who sleeps with the babies in the same room, I can turn it on from my bed in the middle of the night if little one rouses. I not only use it to soothe for naptime and bedtime, but also just for play; both of my little guys loved to lay in their crib and stare up at the mobile and kick their legs and smile and coo and laugh. I've been able to get a lot of stuff done because of this mobile! I've only had to replace the batteries once so far in two years, and I use it CONSTANTLY.<br />One star pegged off because the leaves can and do bend if you don't handle it properly, which can cause the animals to get stuck. But it's nothing that a little rebending on my part couldn't fix. Highly recommended!

B00846REIS|5.0|Great read. You won't be able to put this one down until it's finished. I love the writing and how much I got to know the characters. I hope this is a long series. Right now I can't get enough.
B004I744AS|1.0|Wish this had kept working, but it locked up & I couldn't use it after a few days.  The few days I had it, it seemed like a great app - included some games & bios & word of the day & much more.  Could've even tolerated the advertising popups.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|The cast enter the scene with the usual appearance or usual look. Never saw a gel of talents. This movie did not win me over.
B008VBYN80|3.0|Pretty average for a &quot;free&quot; game. Build stuff, buy gems. Build more stuff, buy more gem. Can get expensive if you don't have patience.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I always love reading these books!! I reccomend this book!! I loved it!! I am sure that you will too!!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|This movie was just great! For all batman/superhero fans you will undoubtedly enjoy this. I cannot believe I had no idea that they came out with this. I accidentally found it by searching for the Dark Knight Rises Blue Ray, and I am so glad I came across this. I will wait & check everyday for part 2. If you haven't seen this already, watch the trailer and see it immediately...you won't be disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I hope you love the game it is awesome and fun you will like it because you do what you want not what they want
B005EPFA8I|5.0|This movie gave me more insight into the past then anything I have read or watched before.  I have recommended the movie to my Humanities class.  Deep very deep
B00006I53S|5.0|I got this for my Daughter in law....It is a very good zoom lens for portraits and sports.  So far it performs as advertised.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Glee is the best!  I got hooked after watching season 1 :) Watch it and you'll see.  Great show, so addicting
B000FC146C|5.0|One of the greatest stories ever told!  Father Ralph and Meggie and Drogheda have become part of my life! I have read this book many times and I know I will read it many more...
0979019710|5.0|What a great book. I have been doing the suggested exercises for over a month consecutively. I suggest you read this very simple book, take the suggestions and change your life (really). It's a beautiful way to wake up, start the day, and stay focused.
B0063GORYU|5.0|spider solitaire is an sash to understand game that suits everybody. this app is easy and fun. I use it everyday
B000FC2L1E|3.0|I really enjoy these books but if your are a critic the writing may be a little disappointing.  If you like historical detail - these books have it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I tend to write long reviews so I will try to keep this short.<br /><br />Swiftkey does an excellent job of predicting what you will type next on a level that is eerie. I text very well on a touchscreen, but this has increased my texting speed by 100%. When you start a word, it predicts the next word, and the next, etc.. When you get use to this, you can text or write emails at a rate that is close to a keyboard. Touchscreen texting has always been hit or miss, and auto-correct helps, but this app has made it possible for me to write text at a rate I never though possible.<br /><br />I paid $4. Kinda high for an app IMO. Don't regret it.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|The bodies and dance are eye candy, but the story or plot was very thin or lacking.  Is definitely a &#34;rent the DVD&#34; type of movie.
B006TLFPKO|3.0|It kept freezing and I didn't get to watch it-I purchsed it so that I could download it to my own library, but could not (had to use streaming). Got a refund so I'm not mad...but can't rate the video
B0041VT6H2|5.0|Order it today you will love it. this is a Great movie and the cast is great its one you will watch from now on
B002ZG997C|5.0|If you want to think about life and what takes priority and the stamina of a person -- this is a great movie.  Danzel Washington is absolutely great in this movie.
B009MO5960|5.0|This is the 5th installment of the RE franchise. It was named #1 Movie & Best RE yet. I think all of the Resident Evil movies are amazing. You will not regret getting this movie or any of them. Lots of fun & action, also lots of great scenes, but for me I don't have a favorite part I love the whole movie. So hopefully this helped you change you mind about getting this movie. (:<br /><br />Milla Jovovich, Sienna Guillory, Michelle Rodriguez, Oded Fehr, Johann Urb, Bingbing  Li, Boris Kodjoe, Kevin Durand, Aryana Engineer, Colin Salmon, Shawn Roberts, Mika Nakashima, & Megan Charpentier.
0399157565|5.0|My gift buddy loves this series and would be dissapointed for not receiving the annual entry in the series.<br />Strong female characters and intricate details keep this series going. If you are into this sort of thing, highly recommended.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I like it so far from what im reading. After all since I am getting older I want to continue eating healthy and learning how to cook.
B009VB97EY|5.0|This movie is fun for all the girls in your life.  Great dance scenes and cute men to look at.  I definitely recommend it for those who enjoy good, clean fun!
B004LP3AYI|3.0|Wonderful story, terrible presentation in the e-version.  Hope the rest in the series aren't translated with as many errors.  Surely an editor can be found for the e-versions of this otherwise wonderful series?????
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I truly love this show.  The characters are real and the writing is quick and witty.  I wish they could have continued this show a little longer, but now I will have to wait for a movie (crossing my fingers).
B007HACDLK|5.0|This was one of the best it touched on a lot of different areas of the way the goverment looks at things - in fact almost to close to the truth. Very good thinking and action - one of the best in a long line of the best.
B000P0J09M|1.0|The quality sucked on this movie. Worse than a bootleg. Don't buy this product but spend the extra few bucks and get the real thing at best buy
0743270754|5.0|TEAM OF RIVALS<br />This book is a fascinating look back into the early 1800's and what was happening in the political world after the country was formed.  The key personalities of the time are reviewed, Seward, Chase, Bates, Douglas, Staunton,and how Lincoln--from the western frontier--became acquainted with these men and how he slipped into the political scene.  Lincoln was anything but an ignorant backwoods lawyer.  He had a keen intellect and would ponder a situation, then would just know that his solution was right, and that was true.  His political friends, and those who weren't so friendly, soon recognized this to be true.  He chose his cabinet carefully from many men who had opposed him before 1860 and they meshed together.  I must confess that here right before Christmas I've only read about 300 pages out of 700+, but I enjoy each page and the history of the time.  I've seen the movie Lincoln twice.  Stanton was right when Lincoln died, Now he belongs to the ages.
B00005JKNF|4.0|I ordered Gosford Park and thoroughly enjoyed the movie as well as all the extras about the lives upstairs and downstairs.  A great film for people who love Downton Abby and Agatha Christie mysteries with lots of characters.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I have always been into vampire movies, and when I read the book and watched the movie and loved both.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was the best....it is almost like fifity shades of grey but eva is more of an domenient person. But the sex scenes are hot and steamy and will have to wanting to read more...i read the book in a day and a half...i would recommend this book to my other friend who like fifity shades of grey
B000J670ZI|5.0|While the zany goings on and lines may be too fast for some people, &#34;Bringing Up Baby&#34; is worth the effort of seeing twice. The mark of a good comedy is when the actors look like they were having a lot of fun doing it - and Hepburn and Grant look like they had the time of their lives! The scenes with &#34;Baby&#34; were split-screened in sometimes for the safety of Hepburn, but she insisted on doing most of her own stunts. Grant was in his element: his quick talk counters Hepburn's smooth ditzieness to perfection.
1401937519|5.0|This book is very timely for all of us because it not only is about dying but our feelings about ourselves while alive. She really transmits a very beautiful, honest message. Very comforting.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Slow paced movie. A melodrama... with pics of action from time to time. Too quick and too easy fix to the happy ending.
B008S7EPXA|4.0|really enjoy this album. No complaints.Might give it 5 stars after a few more listens. Saw them in Berkley and their talent live is astoundingly beautiful. Their voices are both truly amazing.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|ROFL. You are alive to read this review ONLY because Chuck Norris allows you to be :)<br />If you are looking for about 100 minutes of near non-stop action, peppered with super hero cliches, you have come to the right movie.<br />Don't waste your time searching for a deep rooted story-line, simply sit back and enjoy the heck out of this.<br />I enjoyed this so much, I may have to go and watch the original.<br />Have Fun.
0805047905|5.0|A classic. Eric Carle has the best books and my son loves them all, this one in particular. He loves going through the animals and trying to remember their colors and now that hes 4 he can read it all by himself and he's so proud of that fact.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a fantastic ap for the price.  It offers a plethora of selections and gendres for all tastes.  Some of the &#34;Oidies&#34; stations are nearly ad free.  High quality feed through my V-moda headsets.  It also will show how good the built in speakers are on your new kindle fire Hd 8.9.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like it. but now that they want you to breed 3 dragons and haven't figured that out so now I'm frustrated.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|DeMille never dissappoints, however this story had a really slow start. John Corey is just as crusty as ever and very brilliant in figuring out what may happen and why. I always look forward to ND,s new books. Keep them coming.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie is a classic - well acted - one of Chevy's best movies.  This movie is funny from beginning to end.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it's very entertaining. I like that you have to fill in all the grid. it makes it more  challenging. great app
B007FC3AAI|5.0|There is nothing better than vampires, beautiful woman, and love. I needed to see this so I could view ppart 2
B0000AQS0F|5.0|With almost 4000 reviews of Firefly having accumulated over the years, it seems rather silly to post another one, but I'll think of this short reaction piece as a message in a bottle and see where it goes. I had and still have deep affection for this series. Almost everything -- the characters as individuals and their relationships with each other, the writing, the settings, the production -- came together so well, and it is a shame that it that ended before its time. Though I thought there was a little confusion regarding space geography at times and a bit too much string-and-rubber-band artifice about the spacecraft, those were minor quibbles that were forgotten as each engaging episode rolled by. I admit that I dislike the film it spawned, but the television series remains on my list of all-time favorites. If you have happened to find this bottle lying in the sand and read this message, then I recommend you follow my last request: Get Firefly; I doubt that you will be disappointed.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I liked this movie very much. I think the actress did very well. Perhaps there culd have been a little more clarity in the story telling
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  It`s a book about redemption, forgiveness, humility and courage.  Read the story, it will pull on your heart strings.
B00735HGQ6|2.0|Was good for a while then it just got to &#34;frilly & Cutesey&#34;, The end was nothing but a disappointment.
B007N8RULO|4.0|It was a little harder to use at the beginning but I find myself on it more then i should be.
B0086700CM|5.0|its fun because it is just super awesome it makes me feel like im actually running in the real game.
0062127241|3.0|Or who's the fool? This guy or the people that bought the mostly mediocre music. Nicely edited though.<br />Now I feel like my teen years were teenage waste land listing to this guy's stuff inspired by a bottle of Remy.
B009VB97EY|1.0|I rarely hate films I select.  This film had very little plot, mediocre acting, and was a waste of the actors' time as well and mine in attempting to watch it.  I found myself nodding off to sleep.  The hype in promoting the movie is way off base.
B008NF45S2|5.0|Why has this apk been voted 5 stars? It simply works and works well. The apk has taken all guess work out and put you in control of your printing needs. No tweaking necessary and you get straight to the business at hand, printing what you want. What could be easier?
B009329Y30|4.0|It is sweet and romantic.  It is definitely a chic flic, but even my grumpy hubby liked it, possibly because Zac Efron was an exmilitary guy.
B004LROUNG|3.0|No real twists and turns here but basically a good story with a happy ending.  I like most things that Grisham writes and I have read a lot of his novels.
B007URCTOG|4.0|The movie seemed to drag in parts but definitly took time to develope its characters.  Another sweet and romantic movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I had to read this since I read the 1st two in the series. It was good but I didn't like the ending. Everything done by Katniss was to save her sister and that hope was destroyed in the end. disappointing that her main objective from the very beginning (to save her sister) was not realized even though she saved the country.
B0018RC7QE|5.0|I loved this movie, cos the feeling portrayed in the movie are genuine, innocent and compleks, free and controled, everything that people go through when in love!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; and really was hooked so I had to read the sequel. It was really riveting!
0979019710|5.0|I have been having days where I just don't know what else to do.  I've just been so run down, lacking motivation, not being able to feel that spark of enthusiasm...It's not the way I want to live my life.  I heard about Hal Elrod's The Miracle Morning and I knew I had to read it.  Well, I did. Like a miracle, my life is turning around.  I look forward to waking up and I can't wait to get things done.  I actually WANT to wake up early!!  Thank you!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game was difficult at first. Once I got the hang of it,  it went really fast. I love this game.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|really fun game. I love the light sabor and how you can deflect gun fire. So addicting, I can't go on without getting 3 stars. Some levels are way too easy and some it takes a while to get that last star. R2D2 levels are a bit lame and easy.
0393327345|5.0|I bought this book for my son. The book is in excellent condition and the price was very reasonable. I would look here first for any future book needs. Thank you so much!!
B007704HO6|5.0|This almost homeless recovering addict did all the right things for this cat , including getting off his last drugs.<br />It is the ultimate story of man and animal and how much we need each other!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|keep working Bobby. Your next release gives us something to look forward too. I'm finally getting to where I sing Dylan better than Dylan. If I wanted a lounge singer, it would still be Bob...not Barry M.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I gave season 1 five stars. This is a brutal season. So much torture and humiliation. I love the cast. Jessica is such a great actor, as is Lily Rabe. Boy Lily Rabe was able to let her talent shine in this season but will never forget Mrs Montgomery.<br /><br />I wish it wasn't so brutal. So ghost are much easier to watch than doctors torturing poor souls.
B008Y768XO|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I love Richard Gere, and he made me love him even more after watching this movie! Makes me cry every time I watch it!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My 4 year-old loves the other tinkerbell movies. This one is a great addition to the others, only it doesn't have any frightening, scary, or parts with bad attitudes (like the Lost treasure movie). This movie is the best yet.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. Almost like computer version but different. No nether portals or anything but there is creative and survival world it helps to have seed pro. Seed pro help you create cool thing like lots of gravel or something. I suggest getting seed pro with this app.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|I have been a fan for many years, and have dreamed of seeing the 79 paris show on DVD having heard it on 8 track, cassette, and cd over the years. The video and quality of this dvd is fantastic! To watch these guys perform this show live is nothing short of fantastic! Supertramp was so talented and being able to watch the performance of this show was PRICELESS!!! A true momento of rock and roll history! Buy It !!
B009SQQRH2|5.0|Looking for aChristmas movie and rented Arthur Christmas. It was a great movie. Funny and family friendly. Put it up there with my Christmas Favorites.
B001OST0LW|5.0|My daughter is a Batman fan will love finding this under her tree on christmas morning. thank you again. Excellent
B006GWO5NE|4.0|USB cable brought to replace another that was lost.  Can't charge my Kindle Fire without it.  These are perfect for traveling as they don't take much space.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Would recommend to friends, Daughter very will be very excited on christmas moring. Highly recommend buying from this buyer she will be happy&#62;
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|love the game but wish you got more coins. the coins are too expensive to buy so you have to wait... wait... wait for more coins to build up.
1401937519|5.0|If you are looking for a book describing heaven after an NDE, this book is not it.  If you are looking for a book to change the way you look at your life, this is it.  Dying To Be Me chronicles the author's life and her inability to conform to her traditional Indian upbringing.  After her Near Death Experience, she recognizes that the best gift we can give to others is to be true to ourselves.<br /><br />\\"In the tapestry of life, we're all connected.  Each one of us is a gift to those around us, helping each other be who we are, weaving a perfect picture together. ...It all became so clear to me because I understood that to be ME is to BE LOVE.\\"
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is the funest game I have on my kindle fire!!!! I play every day all day!!!! so so so so much fun!!!!
B0091REZMW|2.0|This game started out fun that is until I kept running into the problem of not being able to touch the bottomed of the screen to either download, continue, etc. the game. The size of the pop-up screen was just to big for my phone with no ability to scroll down.
B004SBULWE|5.0|Awesome for saving the battery life, especially on my droid4, not sure how it works on the Kindle yet because its a christmas present. But awesome little guy.
B007SGM084|5.0|At first I just wanted to see what all the hype about this book was about, but as soon as I began reading it, I found out what everyone was talking about!
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Another good movie turned into 3D. We watched the DVD version when it came out and liked the movie so we bought the 3D version when released. It was worth the extra money. Great movie and good 3D effects.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun and its free u cant get a better deal than that oh yeah and I say that I love this game
B005IZLPME|5.0|We watched this movie in DVD when it came out and liked the movie so we bought the 3D version. We really enjoyed rewatching the movie in 3D and the the 3D effects were good. Worht the extra money.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Anyone looking for some deep deep message from this movie will probably rate it low. The visuals were great, the story a bit weak. Some of the characters weren't likeable. But on the whole, I would recommend the movie. I loved Blade Runner too, but no one can say that story was the best, either. Same sort of thing here. Don't look for answers. Don't question why they didn't make the obvious, &#34;correct&#34; decisions. Just enjoy the movie.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I was concerned about buying this movie since it was like combining characters from 4 different movies. When I saw they were putting the original characters into this movie I bought it. It was well worth the money and I don't say that about a lot of movies. 3D effects were good also.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|In a world of egg stealing monsters, a hero emerges to battle for what is right. Shunned by his own people, a rogue cop undergoes the ultimate transformation and makes the monsters pay.<br /><br />Awesome idea, classic game play, great fun.
B00867GHS8|2.0|We had this on pre-order forever. It arrived Turesday and we tried watching the 3D disk tonight. It hung/skipped from 1:00 until 1:07. We have returned the movie to Amazon and are having it replaced. I saw another person on a different site complaining about the same problem on the DVD disk. Very disappointed in Disney trying to save a few pennies at the customers expense. Typical America business pratice today. As far as the 3D portion, it was good to watch the movie again after such a long time but I expected more our of Disney for the 3D portion. I want items to pop out of the screen and very few times did that happen. If you do not own Nemo and want to buy it though I would recommend buying the 3D version over the reguler version. BUT, make sure and play all the disks to make sure there are no bad spots on them.
B001XV3LSS|3.0|This movie would have been more realistic if a male had played the major role instead of a silly girl!!!!!!!!!!!
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie considering I hear a Part 2 is coming out. I didn't think there was anything special about the movie and I watched it in 3D! If you are buying this just for the 3D, save your money. If you already have watched the movie and like it but want the 3D, I didn't think they put a lot of effort in the 3D portion worth buying.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|This was &#34;billed&#34; as a comedy and there were moments of humor, but what was so good about this movie was the story of two people who have been &#34;married&#34; and lapsed into taking each other for granted.  Their journey &#34;back&#34; to rekindle their love is funny, sad and so very true!  Of course the acting was a total 5 stars .... you can't have a &#34;bad movie&#34; with Streep and Jones in it.  Highly recommend!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Love that vampire......Twilight...there's a new vampire in town.......just as loving and caring... but.you must get  SHADOW OF NIGHT........too really know what happens.....enjoy
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I enjoyed the book. It was light reading but entertaining. It's not as good as the writing in the Castle TV series but it was worth reading.  I will read another most likely.
B007SGM084|5.0|LOVE this book.......will  recommend to friends.....openminded...try it.  .You will enjoy every page no matter how hot it will get.....<br />once you start ..you just can't  stop........don't panic  ........DON&#34;T  PANIC  !!!!!!!......  Ha  ..  enjoy.......  step aside  vampires, spies...
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|I recently read Philip K. Dick's \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" and was a little disappointed with it. For me, that book lacked the wild speculative nature and imaginative concepts I'd come to expect from Dick's stories. Thankfully, \\"Ubik\\" has both those things in spades.<br /><br />\\"Ubik\\" exists in a world where there are a variety of psychic humans who can be hired (like the precogs that were central to Dick's \\"Minority Report\\") for nearly any psychic activity, including nefarious things like corporate espionage.<br /><br />Ubik takes it a speculative step further, though, in that while whole companies of psychic individuals exist, there are also companies dedicated to countering (or blocking) psychic activities. So if you have a telepath reading your mind, you could hire an anti-telepath to block that reading. Interesting and unique idea.<br /><br />Another interesting \\"Ubik\\" concept is \\"half-life\\". This is the idea that some people, if they are caught soon enough after death, can be frozen and communicated with for many years after they otherwise would've died. The story opens, in fact, with one of the main characters communicating with his dead wife. She helps run his company!<br /><br />The book is a real page-turner, and many times I found myself wondering where the author was going, only to find he was going someplace complete different than I expected. If I had any disappointment with \\"Ubik\\", it is with the character arc of Pat Conley. She possesses a unique anti-psi ability, which never seemed to get the use that the buildup of her character suggested. So many things in Dick's stories are mere diversions, though. He gets you watching one hand, only to sneak the ball into the other.<br /><br />What shouldn't be missed here, though, is the metaphor of the substance Ubik (Is it a salve? Is it a spray? Is it a pill?). Like nearly everything in the story, the real Ubik is more than you might originally suspect.<br /><br />\\"Ubik\\" is worth every penny. Read it!
B004GJDQT8|3.0|&#34;Purchased&#34; 3 free apps when I purchased my new cell phone. Was only able to download 1 to my phone and it was very difficult for a non-techie like me. Neve tried to do the others.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Loved watching this.  Packed full of action and a great story line.  Stephen Amell is an amazing athlete and sooo hot!
0553062182|5.0|I have been spending my life LITERALLY MY WHOLE LIFE wondering why am i thinking and acting so differently from the rest of the world. My sensitivity is causing me a lot of stress to the extend of giving me fibromyalgia. I tried to adjust my mindset but I never felt that I fit into the majority of the population. I have tried very hard to find explanation for myself looking into areas like horoscope, birthday and even mental diseases like anxiety and depression but nothing seems to explain perfectly. I blamed myself for my sensitivity because no one really appreciates this side of me and I only seem to create troubles for others. Thank you Dr. Aron for spotting the HSPs and see the goods in us :)  I feel TRULY relieved for the first time that all the clouds in my mind are cleared.  Now I know that what I used to hate and dislike is actually one valuable trait of the rares :D I will learn to love it and make good use of it from now on !!!!
3464207072|4.0|I purchased this along with the [[ASIN:3464207080 Studio D: Sprachtraining A1 (German Edition)]] to be used in conjunction with my beginner German courses at the Goethe Institute.  (This review covers the text [[ASIN:3464207072 Studio D: Kurs- Und Arbeitsbuch A1 (German Edition)]], for some reason reviews for both products are grouped together.)<br /><br />The books together make for an effective teaching tool, using repeated exercises to help you with each new section while keeping it interesting.  It generally stays away from \\"corny\\" scenarios as I have seen in other language books and instead (generally) seem to jump into real world dialogue.  The exception of course is a certain amount of grammar and vocabulary.<br /><br />Initially I was put off by the fact that the entire book is in German, even the instructions for each exercise.  Sometimes this slowed the process down as I might have had to look up a few terms to understand the point of the exercise.  In the grand scheme of learning a language, this is definitely the best way to learn these words or phrases.<br /><br />I'm not sure how effective it is to sequence the chapters in somewhat of a non-linear way.  For example, you don't really \\"start\\" by learning the alphabet, numbers, days of the week, etc.  You really do jump into situational exercises like how to make an appointment over the phone, ask for directions for a certain location, etc.  I believe this works, as it helps the speaking process and should you be making a trip to Germany will help you there.  It also comes with a supplementary CD which helps you with listening.<br /><br />The exercises allow you to write directly into the book, and the answers are provided in the back for checking.  My criticism is that there aren't that many good charts or \\"cheat sheets\\" to help you with grammar.  This would be harder to use without an instructor, as you often need verbal instruction to go along with these books.  Generally, I feel this is a good tool and better than other language books I've used.d better than other language books I've used.
0062060562|5.0|I generally prefer action/adventure novels but this book is special. Each day is like a different story(without totally giving the plot away. It isn't a page turner, not because it isn't an easy read, it's just that I enjoyed absorbing the events of each day. Also, I found myself empathizing with the author and understanding what it must be like to live a life a she did.
1451648537|5.0|This is a just amazing book. I read it in less than 10 days during my last summer holidays in the Domenican Republican. Easy read and entertaining. Would recommend to anyone who interested in knowing more about Steve and his amazing and particular life.

B005GG0MIS|4.0|I am enjoying &#34;The Presidents Club&#34; very much. There is a lot of information and history to be learned, but it's written in a way that's eary to understand. I suggested the book for our book club in January.  It will be interesting to hear their opinions.
B008J34466|4.0|I really like this album, it is worth buying especially when you need that sort of heavy rock, with a light feeling.  Her albums seems to fit my phase in life for some reason so just listening to the songs just sort of makes feel better.  I am looking forward to hearing some more of these songs on the radio.  This album really shows how well she can sing, it is worth buying.

B009LK6JS2|5.0|The game is not hard and not to easy.  It plays like a real aircraft and it has missions to fly although  the not combat missions.  I would like to see this developer make a realistic modern air combat game I would buy it.

B008KE3960|5.0|The choice of airplanes, maps, and game mechanics make this a no brainer to pickup. The unique mechanic of mapping out patrols and strafing runs for your planes is a good twist on the tower defenese genre. Also the developers seem dedicated to providing updates on a continuing basis, so the game continues to grow. You could do worse for more money.

B0084BMUFA|5.0|I would have given this book a good rating before I even bought it, having read the story and had it read to me decades ago and a re-reading simply confirmed it - five stars. The language is old and the descriptions go on a bit, but thats what people enjoyed then. Besides there is poetry in it.<br /><br />Tedward
0307263118|3.0|I don't know about the Brit's criteria for awarding prizes, but I wouldn't have given it to this book.  Rather plodding, meandering, study of the protagonist's mind and thoughts.  Not much action.

B004SD5GZ4|3.0|The Kindle PDF reader is almost useless except for simple reading. Adobe Reader at least has some useful annotation tools. It doesn't compare to what I'm used to with the free Foxit Reader on my desktop PC, but it does allow me to highlight and make short annotations while sitting comfortably with my Kindle.
0544045203|4.0|I read a number of reviews after I had finished reading Life of Pi by people who complained that the book had been spoiled for them because they knew the plot. However, the plot is not really all that important here, rather it is about how stories are created to enable us to make sense of our lives, especially because of the power of stories to be able to deal with paradoxes and contradictions that are inevitable and not solvable but which we attempt to reconcile when we try and describe facts rather than tell stories. Just as Pi examines religion through learning about the different stories of the 3 faiths he comes to embrace - christianity, hinduism and islam - he examines broader life events of survival through his story of being ship-wrecked with wild animals that are seemingly dangerous to his own existence. The ship-wreck story narrates how he learns to tame the wildest of the animals (a tiger with an aptly human name - Richard Parker - who has killed the other animal survivors of the ship wreck - a zebra, an orangoutang and a hyena) and finds that they can co-exist and actually support each other in their quest for survival where they need to meet their own physical and even emotional needs against the backdrop of a life that seems to want to throw as many obstacles as possible in their way. While the idea of a boy surviving for months on a small boat set adrift in the Pacific Ocean with a tiger onboard is highly improbable we are provided a different version of the story towards the end, where the animals are replaced by human actors who end up killing each other in their quest to save themselves. This more familiar narrative of the survival story is actually ultimately more disturbing because it shows how selfish we can be when our own life is under threat so that we are drawn to the more improbable tiger/boy story, just as the Japanese insurance investigators are. Neither version of the 'truth' is possible to verify, just as we can't verify the truth of the stories from the different religions' teachings. It is how well the story is told and what we can learn from the stories rather than their truthfulness which is ultimately how we decide whether the story is a good one. The story of the shipwreck here is told with a lot of vivid detail which allows us to believe in what is being described, even when our more rational side might be saying it is not possible. Moreover, the lessons about beliefs (faith kept Pi going even though he was sometimes brought very low by his situation), endurance (he slowly but surely tamed the tiger), resourcefulness (he made use of all the various objects that were at his disposal to help in the survival quest), and social connections (even with those we fear) as the keys to survival are surely relevant to us all as we struggle through life.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I added this to my Kindle apps to test my WiFi since I had never used this feature of my router (I've only used wired connections so far). The router was on the floor about 50 feet and two walls away from the big screen TV where I wanted to stream Netflix videos in HiDef through the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\". It turned out my signal was a little weak at that end of the house. By simply raising the router to eye-level in the room where it is installed I increased the signal substantially. I've also used this to find and measure open WiFi networks accessible on my Kindle from parking lots where I was waiting for my wife to finish shopping. It's a useful and interesting tool. WiFi analytics Tool also works, but I preferred the displays on this app.
B008518MOW|5.0|I watched this and found it as good as the firt one.  That isn't usually the case on movies with sequels, but I was especially delighted at the ending.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The most glaring software deficiency of the Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; that I encountered during my first week of ownership is the lack of any method for organizing documents. It's easy to copy PDF files and other documents to the Kindle, but the Documents menu on the Kindle will display their existence only if the documents are in the root documents folder. This app lets me organize my documents into folders the way I do on my desktop PC. I keep wondering whether Amazon has not yet adjusted to the idea that 32 GB can hold a lot of documents and simply displaying them in a long list is no way to keep them organized. Highly recommended because so far it has been absolutely essential for my use of the Kindle. If anyone has other suggestions I'd be very interested to learn about them.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I just finished watching this for the second time (the first time was in the theater) so I thought I would write my review now. I was eagerly awaiting the release of this movie. I have been a huge fan of the franchise ever since the original [[ASIN:B000PC6A3E Batman Begins [Blu-ray]]]. Whenever I am really excited about a new movie, I tend to feel a little disappointed the first time I see it. That is why I watched this movie a second time, and I definitely enjoyed it more the second time around. I am not going to give an overview of the plot. Other reviewers have done that. I am going to simply list what I liked about the movie (and one thing, at the end of my review, that I did not like). There are some spoilers in my review so if you have not seen the movie yet you probably should not read my review. This is also a very long review. Once I start writing I usually find it difficult to stop. Alright, enough preface, onto the review!<br /><br />I have always liked the idea of super hero movies, but there are actually very few super hero movies that I really enjoy. In fact, I do not even watch very many of them, because in my experience I am almost always disappointed with them. The three Nolan Batman movies are really the only super hero movies that I think get it right. There are a number of reasons I think these films work so well. Here are some of the reasons I think this particular film works so well.<br /><br />First, it is set in the real world, and not some cartoonish world. I realize that some super heroes can only exist in a cartoonish world. Batman is one of the only super heroes that is, ultimately, just a guy in a suit. When you start talking about actual super powers you have obviously left the real world. Still, I am amazed at how few super hero movies attempt to create realistic characters, with understandable human motivations. Christopher Nolan has done a great job in this film, and the other Batman movies, creating a whole host of interesting and realistic characters. Ra's Al Ghoul, The Scarecrow, The Joker, and Bane are, in my opinion, the most interesting villains I have ever seen on screen. Each one is different, they have different motivations, and, most importantly, they are each unique. Most movie villains are essentially interchangeable with one another, you cannot tell them apart. The villains in these movies are real, full blooded and fully realized, characters, and so are all the other characters. That, on its own, is a real achievement.<br /><br />Second, the writing is very good. I did not think that the writing in this third movie was quite as good as in the first two. There were some lines, which I did not write down and cannot remember off the top of my head, where I thought \\"I have heard that before\\". But mostly the writing is quite good. I have been noticing lately how many cliched scenes tend to show up in films and television. I am starting to get the feeling that there are ten or twelve scenes that literally get passed from writing room to writing room, implanted directly from one movie right into the next (how many times have you seen the \\"it's not your fault\\" scene?) I did not get the feeling that any of the scenes in this movie were stock scenes that I had seen in half a dozen other movies. The writers put some thought into what they were attempting to say. I especially liked the underground prison which, I thought, was a particularly good metaphor for a kind of Chekhovian despair, and the solution (climb without the rope) was a good piece of writing. I had a few minor quibbles with the overall plot, holding the city to ransom with a nuclear device, but ultimately I think it worked.<br /><br />Third, it is more complex than the standard super hero flick. For example, is Cat Woman a hero or a villain? I love the way that they decided to make her both. All of the Batman movies tend to move past the simplistic good guy/bad guy dichotomy. The world itself is more complex than that. Everything is not all black and white. It is rare to see any kind of moral complexity in a super hero movie.<br /><br />Fourth, the acting is superb all around. Christopher Nolan has a knack for picking really good actors. The repeat characters, or the characters that appear in all three movies, are all excellent of course. Some of the best actors in the world. And all the new characters in this movie were equally excellent. Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane, Anne Hathaway made an excellent Cat Woman, I have always been a big Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan, and Marion Cotillard, who I have had a minor crush on for years, was also excellent as Miranda Tate.<br /><br />Fifth, I love everything about Bane as a villain. Super hero movies are, in my opinion, more about the villain than the hero. If you have a really interesting villain then you are on your way to a really good movie, if you have a lackluster, or overly cartoonish, villain, then the movie is already ruined. Evil, for some reason, is just more interesting than good. The super hero is almost like the straight man. You need a good straight man. A bad straight man, or hero, can ruin a movie as well. But the hero represents us, the viewers, and our values. That is not where the true interest lies. The true interest lies in the villain. Bane is a very interesting and compelling villain. You feel his presence as soon as he enters the screen. Just the way he walks is enough to mesmerize. There is a scene where Cat Woman and Batman are fleeing from Daggett's, and there is a moment where Cat Woman turns around, there are probably a dozen henchman firing guns at her, and then there is Bane, just silently walking, and somehow Bane walking is far more interesting, and menacing, than all the henchman firing guns. He draws the eye, his presence is so much more powerful. It is only a split second, but it is one of my favorite scenes in the movie.<br /><br />Sixth, super hero movies need to be visceral and stir up emotions. I am a philosophy student, and I have actually spent quite a bit of time thinking about why people enjoy super hero movies. I do not really know the answer, but I have a theory. I think that super hero movies empower people. I think most people probably walk around with some unconscious fear or anxiety in their everyday lives. Bad things happen in the world. Even those of us who have never been the victim of a violent crime, know that they happen, and we have all probably been in situations where we were unsure of the outcome, where we felt things could go either way, or where we thought \\"If things go badly here I am going to be in a lot of trouble.\\" I think that super hero movies are cathartic in the sense that they temporarily purge us of our fears. This movie does a good job tapping into that. There were a lot of \\"goosebump\\" moments in the movie for me, and when Batman finally starts to get the upper hand with Bane, you can feel it viscerally, in your body. That is what movies do, I think. They make you feel helpless (which is why you need a strong villain) and then they empower. This movie does that exceptionally well.<br /><br />Seventh, I know some people have complained about what they perceived to be the political message of the movie. It seems as if Bane represents the Occupy Wall Street movement. I do not know what Nolan's politics are, but I saw an interview where he said that they were just trying to show the cracks of society that people would try to wedge open. I actually think that was a good device. It made the movie more realistic, and it tapped into emotions that are already there. That is part of what made the movie visceral. Movies cannot create emotions in people out of thin air, they have to tap into emotions that are already there. I think the movie did a good job tapping into emotions that already exist in our society, complains that people already have, without becoming an overt political statement one way or the other. I think it made it a more powerfulmovie.<br /><br />There is one minor complaint I had with the movie. I know there were some plot holes, but plot holes, unless they are particularly gaping, do not usually bother me that much. I try to look at things from the writer's perspective. Movies are not meant to be carbon copies of real life, so it makes no sense to demand absolute realism from a movie. If you want absolute realism just live your life. Life itself is very realistic. So I am not going to go through the movie and pick apart the plot holes I thought I saw.<br /><br />There was, however, one place where I felt like the writer's made a real mistake, and that is the way that Bane was killed. Now, it makes total sense that Batman would have a \\"no gun\\" policy. When I say \\"it makes total sense\\" I do not mean that it makes sense from a moral standpoint, or from the standpoint of realism. No one has any moral objections to cops carrying guns, so they should not have any moral objections to Batman carrying a gun, and I am not sure it is really realistic to assume that a vigilante would adopt a \\"no guns\\" policy, for the same reasons that police officers do not have a no guns policy. When I say it makes sense I mean that it makes sense from a movie maker's perspective because Batman is a super hero. No one wants to watch Batman have gun battles. People want to see Batman fight, hand to hand, up close and personal. A hand to hand battle between Bane and Batman is way more interesting and engaging than a gun battle would be. However, it is not a good idea, in my opinion, to constantly remind the audience of the fact that Batman has that \\"no gun\\" policy. Particularly when a nuclear bomb is involved.<br /><br />The notion that Batman would still object to using guns when the city is being threatened with a nuclear device is obviously ridiculous. Now, I am not saying that the writer's should have given Batman a gun. Like I said, the audience wants to see Batman fighting, or using his bat stars, not shooting. What the writer's should not have done, in my opinion, is remind the audience over and over that Batman is not using guns. By having Cat Woman ride in on the bike and just shoot Bane the writer's are just reminding the audience that Batman could have killed Bane at any time if he had just been willing to use a gun, and just in case there are any audience members who do not make that connection immediately, they have Cat Woman make a \\"humorous\\" quip about Batman's no gun policy right after she does it! Why would you remind the audience that Batman could have killed Bane at any time? Perhaps they were trying to \\"own it\\" by getting out ahead of the criticism, but it tends, in my opinion, to undercut the whole movie.<br /><br />Bane took over an entire city because people were afraid of him. Why was everyone so afraid of him when anyone could have just shot him at any time? You do not want the audience to be thinking about such things, which is why I think they should have found another way to have Bane killed, and they should not have highlighted Batman's no gun policy (like the fight scene with Cat Woman). The no gun policy was already established in the prior movies, it should have gone unspoken in this one. That is a minor issue, and it certainly did not ruin the movie for me. All in all, I felt like this movie met my expectations, which were extremely high after the first two movies. Alright, that is the end of my review. Sorry it is so short.

B00000K3UU|5.0|If you LOVE Adam Sandler movies then you will love this movie! My son loves Adam Sandler and will<br />be receiving this as a gift. However I am 49 and love every genre' of movie from &#34;Lincoln&#34; to &#34;Four Christmas'&#34;<br />to &#34;Casino Royale&#34; , this movie is laugh out loud. Can be watched with older kids, 10 and above.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Ok have enjoyed other works by this author but find this one a little tedious. The ending is not expected and interesting but the story is slowly paced and involves characters who are hard to believe or relate to.Serena is a character who is hard to relate to in any way. McEwen is a wonderful writer but the plot flaws and slow pace diminish the overall effect.
B009QWNS9I|3.0|I enjoyed the first season. It had the plot, characters, dynamics, intrique to keep you in suspense and waif for the next episode. The second season is boring and overdone

0307591549|4.0|I saw him on PBS and bought the book, it is a bit perplexing that his presentation was basically repeating the book verbatim. But since I am reviewing the book, I will stick to the book review. I found a lot of interesting research in his book and actually it only proved the fact that every person is about as happy as they decided to be.

B009VB97EY|2.0|Other than sexy, almost naked men, there was nothin impressive about this movie. The plot was un-exciting and slow and rather predictable. The whole movie seemed like more of an excuses to see almost naked men and lots of tits.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I believe this is the book and style JKR would have written had HP not become an epic success. Once successful in a children's genre, she was hampered from using her character skills to show all the dark sides of human nature. She makes up for it in this book, but it's difficult for a huge HP fan to accept this very adult subject matter. The constant, endless cussing was hard to bear. The lack of redemption at book's end casts a pretty severe shadow over the whole book. Is JKR saying that humankind never does rectify? That people never do supersede their prejudices? It seems to be the theme, which is a hopeless and sad theme.<br />I do still enjoy JKR's clever word craft and her superb ability to depict a character. The reader &#34;knows&#34; these people. That was the best part of this book. But don't read this book if you're looking for an uplifting tale of good triumphing over evil. In this book, evil sort of wins.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|I got this for  my daughter. She loves Harry Potter books and the movies. They are very entertaining. Just great.
B008220C38|5.0|I was hesitant about going to this movie because the coming attractions looked so gaudy and overblown. Then we got to the movie at a four o'clock show and to our surprise it was sold out and the only seats we could find were in the second row. I was ready to just pick up and leave. But this movie just blew us away. The staging (which actually was \\"staging\\", using a theatre stage blended into various scenes), the acting, the production, the filming, the costumes, the settings, it was all spectacular. All beautiful. We walked out feeling we were granted the opportunity to witness a masterpiece. This is truly an incredible movie. Go and see it on the big screen if you can (and sit closer than you usually do to immerse yourself in the film, it worked for us), but if not, don't miss it on DVD.

030758836X|1.0|Why this book is so popular is beyond me. Both protagonists are hateful creatures who deserve each other. There is a hole in the plot a mile wide at one point. It is clever with plot twists and changing points of view, but leaves you with a sour taste and no desire to read another book by this author.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|A very sweet and amusing movie. I'd watch it again...especially for the horse.....He was laugh-out-loud funny. A great family film.
B008GJV4F2|4.0|This is a very good movie, not just a &#34;chic-flic&#34;. There is a message here about being true to yourself in the face of external pressure to conform, and in learning to accept others as they are. Johnny Depp has a minor role, so if you are looking for another &#34;Pirates...&#34; this is not for you. Dame Judy Dench is terriffic!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|You can easily relate to the characters. Totally worth it! You will love the story line and again, you will love the characters.
B001C61W1W|5.0|John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath is an epic novel in many ways, but ultimately has a simple message that anyone who has had setbacks or struggles can relate to. It's the story of the underdog. This underdog is fighting for a piece of the American Dream during the harsh 1930s Depression. Those migrant \\"Okies\\" who trekked west weren't out to conquer; they just wanted to make ends meet, to be able to work, to survive, to provide for their families. In our current state of economic woes, we can identify with crisis these people faced-- the risks, the work involved, picking up and leaving everything: possessions, cherished items, homes. All this for the prospects of a better future that California and the West seemed to symbolize. It was a difficult journey and many didn't make it; those who did often found out that the \\"land of milk and honey\\" wasn't as rosy as the handbills indicated.<br /><br />The conflicts of this journey West, the spiritual fight, is what Steinbeck depicts in a raw, poetic, realistic way that it is no wonder The Grapes of Wrath has become such an important novel for its historical perspective as well as literary merit.<br /><br />Within the framework of the novel, we follow the Joad family--a microcosm of the displaced family having to head out West. The novel also shifts from the Joad's story to \\"bigger concept\\" chapters dedicated to illustrating what the migrants were facing. Tom Joad, after being released from prison, finds Jim Casy, former preacher, and they discover that everyone from the Joad clan appears to be heading out. With little prospects, they make the journey with the family, and we follow along, encountering the many conflicts along the way. There are those who cling to their roots, who are skeptical about the prospects of California, those like Grandpa Joad and Muley Graves, who believe leaving is a form of defeat. However, with bleak prospects, the move is imminent and necessary, even though they realize it will be a tough road ahead.<br /><br />Among the characters, Ma Joad, Jim Casy, and Tom Joad emerge as prominent figures. Ma Joad, the leader of the family who holds down the fort when things begin to falter or break apart; Jim Casy, the former preacher and spiritual man who sees the deeper soul of humanity; and Tom Joad, the rebel who makes strides to transform his character, to carry on Casy's fight and the fight for his people, who speaks for an entire group when he says \\"I'll be there.\\"<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath, on one level, connects Depression era migrants with the dream of heading west and finding some semblance of an idyllic existence. Although many dreams are dashed, it is the struggle of this journey that becomes a main symbol. On another level, this novel is a picture of a time period, people trying to make it and survive, something we all relate to, which Steinbeck aptly and poetically captures. This is a timeless novel on many levels.d ahead.<br /><br />Among the characters, Ma Joad, Jim Casy, and Tom Joad emerge as prominent figures.

B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Because I would have felt cheated. Bad acting, bad fights, bad story, bad casting. I loved the first two Batman movies but this one stunk up the place.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Free Flow has just enough challenge to keep it interesting and make you use you brain but not so much you can't 'disconnect' from the world.
B007HACDLK|4.0|If you like fast-paced stories with lots of action, you will enjoy Vince Flynn's new book. It had quite a few twists and turns, a very good read. I am and have been a Vince Flynn, Mitch Rapp fan, so I am definitely a fan of this book.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Coin Dozer is just like the real deal. It would be great if you could 'buy' coins with those you've collected.
B000SXMNI6|5.0|Legendary, this album is a piece of art that keeps getting better with time. I would recomended Aqualung to anyone.
B005LAIHZY|2.0|This is so not a kids movie!!!  I am so glad I was impatient and watched this before letting her watch it.  She had seen the commercials for this on tv and was asking for it more than once.  I bought it for her but thankfully watched it before she did (after he went to bed).  Take my advice watch this before letting your kids watch it.  Personally I think it is a bit scary for kids!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is full action and has a great plot that rises and falls I rate this book 5 out of 5 stars
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|such a cute and fun game I love it so much it keeps me entertained great for kids I love getting kibble and bathing the pets
B007K3JCAE|5.0|This movie wasn't too bad, always liked the actor Robert Downey Jr. Though I like him better in Iron Man, still this movie is great.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Flawless, for what it is and who produces it.<br /><br />I followed the simple instructions: #1 install correct driver before plugging it in for the first time on each machine #2 start using it :)<br /><br />Plugable.com already had working (perfect) windows 8 drivers for my Samsung Slate. Using com3 & PuTTy I was able to connect to the many different routers & switches I have, as if I had normal serial port. Not bad for such a rarely used tablet and a brand new OS on it!<br /><br />The connections screw down tight and line up well, the cable jacket is strong, yet flexible. It looks nice, without looking cheesy.<br /><br />Using the driver downloads I can confirm that this works flawlessly with CentOS, Mint, Win 8 Pro, Win 7 Ult & Pro, Server 2003R2 & 2008R2 (running on old/new Foxconn, Asus, Gigabit mobo's with a plethora of different usb controllers).<br />The coolest thing is that it works through my Starview (SV431USB) KVM switch! I'm going to get fat, now that I don't have to get up and move anymore.<br />Honestly, the chipset and build quality is top notch... If I ever need another USB-Serial adapter I'll buy another from Plugable.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Now this was an amazing movie. I like the Iron man, always has been my favorite Marvel character. This movie was jam packed with action, some funny, and all the great stuff the hulk could do. Everyone loves hulk, even when he dumbs out and just starts destroying everything. xD Can't wait to see the second one, till then, Iron man 3 would do. O.O
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Um, this game rocks. Period. It's Angry Birds and Star Wars. What could be better? It has levels that are similar to the regular AB games and also some modeled after AB Space. Plus you get a Millennium Falcon upgrade bird, a Han Solo bird that shoots phasers and a Luke Skywalker bird that utilizes a light saber. Great graphics and some really thoughtful little touches that pay tribute to Star Wars. Can't say enough!
B00540G3G6|5.0|This one has been my favorite for a while now. I got it cheap from Amazon, as always, the best deals are on here. :3 Anyways, the movie was beautifully animated, the story once again great, and Tim Burton did it again... he made a great film. I took a chance the day people started to talk about this film, and well, now its a Halloween tradition to watch every year. To all others, I hope you have enjoyed watching this.
B00785P2QC|5.0|if you are a creative person you will love this game. graphics and ui is awesome. love the animation as it reminds me of Sim city.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|Its a bit slow for me at the beginning but over all it was a good movie, I was able to watch it all the way through without having to get up and find something else to do.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is a very good type of game so much fun! if u have'nt got it yet there's something wrong with u.:)
B0043EV774|5.0|Okay, first of all I know there are a lot of people that didn't like this film, but... I thought it was great. I mean, its a crazy dream come to life, and whats great about is that everything is done in a special place. The story line was good, and the twists kept it going. Tim Burton sure made this movie great, also can't wait until he makes more movies. :D Hope everyone can at least enjoy this film, I did.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Bought this processor to use in a custom gaming build.  I am very pleased with the speed and overclocking performance.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|It was okay, though I liked the other one better, but can't argue because this was different than the other.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Its pretty good... I would rate it a 2 out of a 5. Really disappointed. What else can I say?
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Captain America was great, nice way to see how he had come to be, being the one that was picked on for not being as great as other and then turning out to be a hero was pretty great, though being frozen for years, not so much. Poor kid.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This movie really ties up some loose ends from the other movies in the series. The expected alien humor and exciting action. Great ending!
B004LWZW4C|4.0|Wasn't really into this version of X-Men, but seeing how the story was from the past, it was okay. The way the professor was paralyzed was funny, not that it was funny, but the way he said he can't feel his legs was too dramatic. xD
B00992CF6W|5.0|Downloaded this for my grand son on my Kindle Fire. He had been playing it on my wife's phone and since he is the expert on it so this rateing is from him. It so so much beter then on the phone he will never go back. Good news for my my wife for me not so much.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Ahhh the twilight chick. ;D She didn't do too bad in this movie, liked the story and the action. Hope you give it a try if you haven't already.
B00005MP58|5.0|This version feels the most authentic and everyone who has read and loved Pride and Prejudice loves this miniseries, too.
B000K4WPCM|5.0|Great movie, always liked the whole power thing where someone always has to be the bad guy because they want more. Well, I had to buy this movie even if I already had it, it was worth every penny.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Ridley Scott tries to add deeper meaning to the great mayhem that the Aliens movie brought us in the 80's.  But we (the audience) is much wiser now and its hard to watch the science team make the same bumbling mistakes as the earlier teams.  The interaction with the &#34;master race&#34; is not as expected and leaves many questions.  But the alien species is as virulent and destructive as ever.<br /><br />This movie had a high bar to reach and maybe that's not fair.  It was good but it did not deliver on expectations.  It did not offer a clear good guys vs bad guys scenario.  This may frustrate some audiences.  Perhaps to the point that they will demand another movie to clarify the mysteries.  I hope so.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|The visual effects are awesome and truly shine in the HD transfer. The scenes in Asgard are so beautiful you could frame them and hang them in art galleries. I loved the Destroyer, it looks just like something Jack Kirby himself would draw, in fact the entire look of the film is very faithful to what the King of Comics drew. The blending of CGI and live action is seamless, you can't tell where one ends and the other begins. All this in a flawless Blu-Ray transfer. The HD picture looks tremendous and sounds great.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|Amanda Seyfried is definitely one of the current \\"IT\\" girls of Hollywood; there's just something about her and those big, wide saucer eyes that's alluring and captivating.  She plays Valerie, a daughter of one of the local woodcutters, in a far off out-of-the-way village up in the mountains that is beset by some werewolf monster who is killing some nasty deeds.  And, as the film suggests early on, the werewolf might just be grandma!  But as the film unfolds both as a who-dun-it as well as a guess who the were-person really is thriller, we are allowed to uncover more and more clues and more and more potential persons become suspected of being the were-person.  Snaggly-toothed actor Gary Oldman is the impetus of this widening of suspicions as he comes to the sleepy village on the hunt for this sinister monster; he is perhaps all too familiar with it himself.  He certainly isn't all that he's cracked up to be...<br /><br />And so the story goes until toward the end when we get copious amounts of on-screen werewolfage and wonder why it has such an intense interest in our heroine.  The actors may be playing their parts too earnestly or overintently at times but this isn't masquerading as some great theatrical moment.  Take it for what it is.  There are some twists and turns that play out well though we've been there and done that.  It still is an enjoyable little thriller and even one that you will probably end up watching again in a year or two even though you know the outcome.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|Always loved the green lantern, the who ring choosing the one to have the amazing green powers was good, nice story, almost like the anime but switched up a bit. Hope there will be a two.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I am an unabashed Vonnegut fan and even have one signed book that I treasure  That is why I am fairly confident that people who are new to his voice should probably start with one of the less confusing offerings.  I would recommend \\"Cat's Cradle\\" as it is told in a more linear fashion, but introduces a lot of Vonnegut's thematic elements well.<br /><br />Vonnegut has several themes in all of his books.  Time and the nature of time is a frequent theme. He also explores the concept of monogamous ecstasy, the twining of two people physically, intellectually, emotionally into a 'nation of two' that is a bond nothing can break.  He also shows contempt for the wealthy and the poor in equal portions, finding fault with both conditions with occasional saving graces. He is anti-war, anti-conflict, but, as is the moral in \\"Mother Night\\" most of his books are cautionary tales that remind us all that we are who we pretend to be, so we need to be very careful who we pretend to be. In most books his narrator or his 'hero' is buffeted by events rather than being a mover, shaker, influential, important.  They are all almost always observers and commentators whose lives are overshadowed by what is happening around them rather then by the choices they make.  One exception being \\"Mother Night\\".<br /><br />Slaughter House Five is one of my favorites because Billy, though being unstuck in time, learns to accept his life as a series of events that he controls at some times and that is pummeled by forces so large and so small that the end result is little control over anything.  This ranges from his wife's never ending battle of the bulge to the fire bombing at Dresden.  While an anti-war novel, it is also an anti-apathy novel.  Billy accepts all things because he has come to see his life, not a series of events in which he is the prime mover, but as a millipede, ordained, foredoomed, without purpose.<br /><br />He is not an example, he is a cautionary tale.  He does nothing to save or help or change, he goes along for the ride and blames being unstuck in time for his apathy.  How sad. His constant returning to important and deeply tragic events, like the bombing, instead of staying constantly within his time with Dallas is the picture of regret and shame.<br /><br />Do something, is my personal take away from the novel.  You do have choices, you must make your choices based not only on your personal comforts and well being, but as a part of a larger whole, as a player in a vast cosmos in which you may not matter, but you probably do.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I love this movie. It was in great condition when I received it.  The disc and container were perfect as expected
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Just downloaded this & I absolutely love it. Every song has something that &#34;speaks&#34; to me. Can't wait to see what he comes up with next!
B004J64QSI|5.0|Can't believe they caught all of this on one DVD!  Alfie Boe was outstanding!  I have seen Les Mis 3 times over the years and loved it every time I saw it.  Seeing this concert allowed me to actually pay attention to the lyrics.  What a great show!  Can't wait to see the movie!

B006P96PAO|5.0|Every father, every family should see this movie.It is very powerful and has a lesson we all can learn from.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I have seen this movie many times and also seen it in the theater when It was first released.  This will always be a classic and almost everyone can relate to it because we have all been there.  We build things up in our heads and somehow we are disappointed.  From the opening scenes of picking out the Christmas tree to the flying Santa at the end, this movie is just simply funny.
142212312X|1.0|There are about 5 equivalent pages in this book to a real size book.  Good advice, but there's not much of it.  Not worth $9.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|This was the first time I had seen this movie and I have to say I was very surprised.  First of all, the animation is SPECTACULAR!!  The detail and fluid movements of the characters and scenes is amazing.  Secondly, the feeling that you get after watching this version is that this is the first time you have ever seen a movie version of A Christmas Carol.  I love the old Alistair Sim version but this one is very well done.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Once again, Johnny Depp breathes new like into an old story. This one, premiering in the insufferably drawnout cult class of the 60s, is brought to life within the time span of mere mortals. Lots of dry humor.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of the Mitch Rapp series and this is by far the best. Vince Flynn makes you feel like you are one of the good guys.
B007Y36K46|5.0|This is one of the better epic sci-fi myths. Great premise, lots of action and even a little romance to please the ladies.

B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The final film in this trilogy was a &#34;  Grave Disappointment!!! &#34; It just didn't make any kind of sense at ALL!!! I mean, what the hell was &#34; Cat Woman, and Bane all about!?!?&#34; They just didn't fit into the narrative and/or plot of the film...it would have been better to bring back the character of &#34; The Joker &#34; to finish the trilogy...especially since the character didn't die in the second film...&#34; The Dark Knight!,&#34; which I found to be the &#34;Very BEST of the trilogy&#34;...especially w/ the 'late' Heath Ledger' performance as the &#34; The Joker!!! &#34; I keep asking the question: &#34; Why keep putting &#34;Cat Woman &#34; in the film franchise, if all she' is going to be is a &#34; glorified sex symbol &#34; w/o any &#34; real sense&#34; of purpose to the story or plot of the movie!?!? &#34;  And...&#34; Bane&#34; left me w/ huhs?? & &#34;WTFs?! &#34;  This particular character was just &#34; a waste of time, and effort!!! &#34;  I expected &#34; much better substance&#34; from Christopher Nolan,&#34; but that' NOT what we received...and that' a &#34; tragedy in and of itself!!! &#34;  So...I'm giving it &#34; 2 Stars&#34; only because I liked Christian Bale' performance of &#34; The Batman!!! &#34; -Mikey
0547581033|3.0|I find the size of this book, which is 10.5\\" wide by 9\\" tall, to be awkward to hold, and it is fairly heavy. The writing is very nice and the drawings are cute but too lightly colored for my taste. It would be a better book if it were smaller and the drawings had a deeper color.
1932100660|5.0|This is a very good Read, highly informative. I have been vegetarian for a while now. after reading this and doing more research i am now vegan and planning to stay that way the rest of my life. I have recommended this book to everyone i talk to.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|I actually like this game &amp; haven't had any problems with the controls or lagging or anything else. My 1 complaint (and reason for only giving 4 stars instead of 5) is the interface. There's no way to choose individual levels &amp; if there is I can't find it. The only thing you can choose is which difficulty mode you want to play. If you choose to replay a level it takes you to the previous level you had played. As far as I can see this is the only option to replay any level so if you want to try a level you had played 2 levels ago I think you're out of luck. I am really surprised this game is made like that because it seems like any game now has the levels menu set up just like angry birds anymore. This is extremely annoying to me. I think this would be a 5 star game when comparing it to another basic game of this type if there was a level menu! Btw, the developer reviews are just ridiculous and annoying. It's kind of an insult for them to think us so dense that we wouldn't be able to tell those reviews are written by the developer and are obviously all by the same person. Wow! It seems like all developers have their own language or something, like real users really talk like that lol
B006X5L6VS|5.0|this app does work on kindel fire. your kindel must be broken. my kindel fire works just fine. the app is awasome by the way.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|This book hands down is a must have for anyone working, or interested in working, in a technical software development environment. Pragmatic Programmer, really does a good job at explaining the trials and tribulations encountered as a developer, and provides great words of wisdom, from years of experience, on how to cope. This book is perfect (Actually HIGHLY Recommended) for students.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Interesting although maybe a little exaggerated especially in the rendition of Carrie's behavior taking chances with other people's life's and ignoring her chain of command.

078324228X|3.0|\\"The Hurricane\\" is an inspiring and powerful film, although its historical accuracy is flawed. This film was directed by Norman Jewison, and is apparently based on a true story about a professional boxer named Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter. Carter was wrongly convicted twice for a triple murder and imprisoned for almost two decades. Carter is helped by an underprivileged youth named Lesra and his Canadian foster family, who dedicate themselves to proving his innocence. The main characters in this film are Rubin Carter (Denzel Washington), Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon), and his Canadian foster family: Lisa Peters (Deborah Kara Unger), Sam Chaiton (Liev Schreiber) and Terry Swinton (John Hannah).<br /><br />The film focuses mainly on the 1966 and 1985 period, and is a narration of Carter's life. 1966 was the year when Carter and his friend John Artis were wrongly arrested and convicted of murder, and 1985 was the year the Federal District Court ruled that the court hearing in Carter's second trial violated the Constitution and that the foundation of his accusation was racism rather than facts.<br /><br />Some of the historical facts in \\"The Hurricane\\" are questionable. This film has evoked controversy as to whether the many facts of Carter's life and the case as shown in this film are accurate. \\"The Hurricane\\" has misrepresented some of the factual information from reality and has received lots of criticism. Some critics include: Robert Lipsyte, a reporter from The New York Times; Cal Deal, a reporter from Herald-News, and Jack Newfield of the New York Post, who said, \\"I knew Rubin Carter, attended his fights, covered his retrial and I didn't see much reality on the screen.\\" David Denby, The New Yorker film critic called The Hurricane \\"false, evasive and factually very thin - a liberal fairytale\\".<br /><br />The film briefly glosses over Carter's life, and he is portrayed as an African American who has been unfairly victimized by the system for a majority of his life. In the film, Carter says, \\"I've committed no crime, crimes been committed against me.\\" True enough, Carter was placed in prison unjustly, and race was one of the reasons for his conviction. The film portrays Carter as being placid and completely innocent, with a criminal record that resulted from solely being unfairly accused. However, Carter was never exonerated. He was released in 1985 when a federal judge ruled that some procedural errors had occurred during his second trial. Carter was sentenced to a juvenile reformatory for assault and robbery shortly after he turned 14. He has also committed a series of muggings, all the way from assault to robbery of a middle-aged black woman, which he had pleaded guilty to, in 1957.<br /><br />Setting the accuracy of the historical content in this film aside, \\"The Hurricane\\" is a both a powerful and effective drama. The performance of the actors, especially Denzel Washington, was excellent. This film was an entertaining one to watch and the sympathies of the filmmakers could clearly be felt whilst watching the movie. The warm relationship between Lesra and Carter that gradually develop in this film and the similarities they both share are incredible and touching. However, some parts of the film were unbelievable. I found it hard to believe that Lesra's Canadian foster family would leave their job in Canada simply to commit themselves to Carter's case. The cinematography was ordinary - nothing out of the blue nor exceptional, but not bad either.<br /><br />\\"The Hurricane\\" is a great film, if its historical accuracy is not carefully taken into consideration. It neatly encompasses many emotions and effectively makes viewers feel a sense of anger, sorrow, compassion and hope. This film is a great one to watch solely for entertainment purposes, but not for its historical content.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I got all of the Angry Birds game, its a little challenging, but its still great fun.....something to take your mind off things
B004JN1D2I|5.0|These books are amazing and they suck you into the world. I started reading the books right after the first season of the show started, since I didn't get HBO and I wanted to know what everybody was talking about- well worth it. I ended up buying these books both in Kindle and physical editions. They're great. Insta-buy.
0385474547|4.0|My daughter had to read this book for school.  This book is about what assumptions society rests on. The man in the book could not adjust to a society that was not prestige driven. This book is an interesting study in unintended consequences
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I first read this book after it came out because I saw it on the shelf at the library and it drew my eyes. Neil Gaiman is excellent as always and the story is one I find myself coming back to time after time.
B005M2V2K8|5.0|I love these new stuffed animals with the big eyes. They are cuter than other versions. My girls love the cat and husky. I plan on buying more for them to collect.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I was expecting more from this book.  The title tempted me and I was very surprised that I rushed through it to see if anything interesting would actually happen.  It didn't!  I found there was not enough to the storyline, or enough intersting characters and it got to the point where I really didn't care what happened.  It could have been a great story as it started well - waking up finding you are married, but then it went downhill for me from there. Sorry - it wasn't enough for me.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|Megamind is a great movie for any family that loves to laugh. My kids and I have watched it several times and it never gets old.

B004GJDQT8|2.0|Does not support digital downloads and other features on Google Nexus 10 running android 4.2.  I am an Amazon Prime customer, come on and update this.... I want to buy more stuff from you using the app.
B0063GORYU|5.0|My favorite game and would highly recommend it to anyone, Very relaxing for me when I am stressed.  I would recommend this game for anyone who plays solitaire. Very addictive.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|One of our whole family's favorite movies. Good thing too since our son (almost 5) had us watch it about 4 times a day for the first several weeks aftervwe got it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Up to date, easy to read and can check it any where any time.  Never like to be without The Weather Channel
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great app and deserves my praise. Very reliable alarm clock. Never fails to wake up this heavy sleeper, has tons of options to customise. It's just flawless =)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Highly recommended for taking to the market to keep up with your grocery amount. Ideal for keeping your check book up to date and whatever calculations you need to make.  Would highly recommend this application to anyone.
B009B2VBWE|1.0|I know artists like to expand their area and develop new things but.... The soft porn cover is not needed Diana. You are a beautiful lady with a great voice. That photo only cheapens you.<br /><br />I have many of your CD's but this is nothing I would recommend or even play. Different strokes, like they say.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Everyone should have this game. I luv it and the only thing is that I can't meet someone that has the gem island with the dragons. But still everyone should have it. I always have something to look forward to.
0446580848|5.0|Wow!  I know some didn't like this novel, but I loved it.  I couldn't put it down.  It raced ahead, sometimes predictably, and most of the time into unknown territory.  I learned a lot about Yemen, and hidden CIA that is always a bit of smoke and shadow.<br />Only weakness might have been a little more info on the Panther himself, but I clearly was influenced by John Corey about the other characters. A great read, and I highly recommend it.
B008YWY0HK|2.0|Hopefully unbiased (or at least low-biased) part of review:<br /><br />Important Point: Know the content of this movie. The animation is spectacular...but some of that techno-pizzazz is used to show, to a high degree of realism, men's naked butts and women's cleavage. Granted, the scenes are short...but they are in there.<br /><br />That being said, I enjoyed the movie...and the animation was incredible. I'm a computer scientist with many years of experience and advanced degrees and I was blown away by the technical prowess in animation that was demonstrated.<br /><br />The story was, at least to me, entertaining. Did I love the story as much as I did for The Incredibles? No, but The Incredibles truly WAS incredible (to me). I found Brave to be an enjoyable movie so long as you understood and was comfortable with the content.<br /><br />Now comes the biased part of the review and a rant...so feel free to skip this part...<br /><br />I gave the movie only 2 stars for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) Subtracted two stars for squeezing in \\"brief\\" nudity (men's butts and a too-often fixation with animating women's cleavage) in a movie clearly aimed at a demographic that includes young children.<br /><br />2) Subtracted one star because Disney/Pixar officials knew EXACTLY what they were doing. Shame on you!<br /><br />Yep, I'm an old fogie and a prude...but given that I still won't excuse Disney/Pixar for putting this content (\\"sneaking\\" it in sounds like a better characterization to me) into a movie clearly aimed at kids. Never again will I be able to buy a Disney/Pixar movie clearly aimed at kids and know that there is no question about whether or not the content is age appropriate. If it isn't rated-G, it is not automatically okay for kids. I cannot believe that Walt would be pleased with what they've done with his name.<br /><br />Disney/Pixar will argue that I should have known this from the PG rating...but they know full well that most people don't know that PGallows for brief nudity. I suspect most adults, like myself, figured that an animated movie could get a PG rating from intense scenes ...but that the movie makers would NEVER be so foolish as to animate nudity into a kids movie (the Incredibles is an example of what is expected. It was rated PG due to some intense scenes...not because of nudity or anything like unto it).<br /><br />Guess what? I was wrong. Whomever is in control at Disney/Pixar clearly believes that pushing to the very limit is the way to go. I wonder if they calculated into their projections the number of people they would lose as loyal customers due to feeling betrayed?<br /><br />I was doubly ticked off because content aside, I *liked* the movie. I would have liked to have sat down with the nieces and nephews to watch this. Nope...not the younger ones to be sure. To borrow from one of Pixar's non-Brave characters, the movie was visually captivating and very entertaining...and then you had to just go and ruin the ride...<br /><br />My rating is just that...*my* rating. However, if you feel such content is perfectly fine for your young children...then I think you'll enjoy the movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love it its so much easyer than the game on the phone or ipod touch jh hjn kj j
B005EHQGTS|4.0|I agree with all the great raves, but I have one small issue. The PC image on my Kindle HD does not allow me to easily manipulate the various PC icons. For example, top right of a PC's window has 3 symbols (minimize, Restore, Close) that are so near to each other, that I keep hitting the close (X) when I mean to hit the Restore. Also, when I play music in windows media player, it's hard for me to select individual songs from the list.  Maybe I have big fingers, but it seems to me that I should be able to enlarge the fonts to allow me better control.<br /><br />Other than that, it is a great product.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|That's right, absurd AND clever.  You knew the first from the title; the good news is that this is actually a clever movie, and an enjoyable one, too.  That's all you need to know, right?  You know what you're in for from the title, so going all Ebert on it in the review is as absurd as this movie's premise.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I love this whole album. Many of the classics here, just a great album. And Rod Stewart is one of the best in the business, IMO.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|You  know how some movies SHOULD be awesome?  You want them to be, you're rooting for them to be good / get better as you're watching ... sometimes they just don't.  That's what happens here.  It coulda been great.  Really.  But something about it (pacing?  dialogue vapidity?  character blandness?) just falls ... short.  Sure, the end has a nice 'surprise,' but I can't say it's worth the effort to get there.  Google the end instead and watch something else.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Once again an insighful well thought out well researched book.<br /><br />It is well worth worth your time to read it.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Just the kind of movie for some Saturday night couch riding, beer in hand (which will help with the suspension of disbelief).  Kinda slow-moving at times (is this a Sci-Fi or highschool puppy-love movie?), and it takes way too long for Number 6 to be introduced as an actual character, but stick with it, the last 20 minutes are top notch.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie to watch with the family! Everyone loves the minions and if you don't then that's just insane. Lol
B00AA7O22U|3.0|The movie was somewhat suspenseful, but not nearly as action-packed as the first film. With such a star studded cast, most of whom are famous for starring in action/thriller movies, I was expecting to be wow-ed and on the edge of my seat the entire movie.  There was a lot of build-up, but the major thrills dont come until the last 15 minutes of the movie.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|T'was cool. I liked it a lot.  The action was perfect and the plot was complicated, but followable. Batman Fan
B009YP9L7U|3.0|If you are into fairy tale romances with rippling abs, muscular thighs and too good to be true wealthy businessmen, this will not disappoint. Well written and engaging for what it is = a Harlequin romance.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|After seeing my girlfriend roll out for a video assignment, I knew that her loadout just wouldn't do.  Multiple bags and odd placement of her monopod made it difficult to haul all of her gear.  Clearing subway turnstiles was just ludicrous.<br /><br />I searched around for a good photo backpack and was blown away by how expensive they all were.  Then, I stumbled across this little gem.  For the price, I couldn't say no.  Man, am I glad I found it.  It holds all of her gear (DSLR, mics and audio equipment, 2 lenses, spare cards, etc.).  There are great pockets for holding all the little things like spare batteries and cards.  It even has a strap on the side for latching on her monopod.  Perfect.<br /><br />The bag is small.  That's great for her (and most women), as she has a small torso.  On me, though, the bag looks like a joke.  But, then, I'm not the one who's consistently using it and it's still comfortable even if it does make me look like the Hulk.<br /><br />The one downside is that there isn't a laptop sleeve, but we'll deal.  For the price and the amount of thought and experience that went into making this, you cannot go wrong.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This is a necessary component of the batman trilogy, which is now complete with the release of the dark knight!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I've been using this on a variety of knives, from my camping gear up to my set of Globals in the kitchen.  The sharpener helps put a quick edge on the blades and has been keeping everything very sharp.<br /><br />But, it doesn't quite match the abilities of a whetstone.  Once I figure out where I put my whetstone, I'll put a good edge on my knives and use this for upkeep.<br /><br />The little steel is also great for getting serrations back up to snuff!  It can take a lot of material off, though, so be careful when you start.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Yes the app does constantly run in the background but I like the reminders it gives to read. The short reading plans are great for someone really busy who wants to get into the bible more and needs to start small.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Typical Vince Flynn Mitch Rapp tale with lots of heart pounding excitement.  Love the multiple story strands that are woven well even with a relatively straightforward plot.  Contrary to the norm, Flynn has us believing that an assassin is a good guy.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|i like this game but its kinda hard to stear on a kindle fire!!! but it fun i guess. ok gor passsing time away. in some ways. but its ok
B002ONC9NC|1.0|This movie is very, very bad.  Where should I even start?<br /><br />***** Contains Spoilers *****<br /><br />1) It glorifies an affair between a teenager and an adult.  Written by Nick Hornby, based on a memoir by Lynn Barber, I can only hope the book was better.  This screenplay by Hornby is such simplified male drivel I cannot fully pass my disgust onto you.<br /><br />2) The film explores absolutely no realistic issues that are presented in the storyline.  The mysterious wife of this lecher, who knows about it all?  She is in about 1 minute of dialogue.<br /><br />3) This 16 year old girl: she thinks she can spend her life in clubs?  And no one tells her different?<br /><br />4) The ending is so stupid I cannot believe it appeared in film.  My only guess is that they edited out the story of the end, and just made a montage.  Because the way she magically got into Oxford is absurd.  Plus, you don't get a one sheet piece of paper saying congratulations.  One piece of paper means you are rejected.  A packet means you are accepted.

B004GVUPFE|3.0|It's a fun game to kill time with, but the counter that keeps track of moves is very buggy and almost always turns one move into three or four. If you decide to try to beat your own previous score in a level this will become frustrating.

B008S80PCE|5.0|From someone who buys a lot of music, this is one of the richest purchases you can make. Bill Withers is that rare breed of performer who gets to you on an even greater level personally than he does musically. This set neatly compiles all of his albums, and leaves us to treasure hunt for some very worthwhile material. However, given the low price, and the company's admission of most of these omissions in the original press release, it's hard to get too sour. Here are the main (i.e., songs with Bill on lead vocals) omissions I've identified:<br /><br />1.) Better Days - theme from the 1971 film \\"Man and Boy\\".  It can be found as a bonus track on the 2003 Raven twofer CD of \\"Just as I Am\\" and \\"Still Bill\\".<br />2.) The Gift of Giving - 1972 holiday single.  It can be found on the \\"Smooth Grooves: Sensual Christmas\\" (!) compilation.<br />3.) Let Us Love - the studio b-side to the above track, included in a live version on the Carnegie Hall album. It appears the original version has not been released on CD or for download.<br />4.) It's All Over Now - 1975 duet with Bobby Womack.  It can be found on the same CD as #1, as well as \\"The Essential Bobby Womack\\".<br />5.) Rosie - a beautiful demo recording of an otherwise-unreleased song off the 2008 reissue of \\"Menagerie,\\" which also contains a single edit and instrumental track of two songs originally on that album.<br />6.) Just the Two of Us - The hit 1980 duet with Grover Washington, Jr. off the latter's \\"Winelight\\" album, and any Bill Withers compilation.<br />7.) Soul Shadows - 1980 collaboration with The Crusaders, off their \\"Rhapsody and Blues\\" album. It can also be found on Bill's 1989 \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation.<br />8.) USA - 1981 solo single. Unreleased on CD or for download.<br />9.) In the Name of Love - 1984 duet with Ralph MacDonald.  I believe this is a vocal version of an instrumental track that originally appeared on Grover Washington Jr.'s \\"Winelight\\" album. It can be found on the \\"Love & Happiness Mix - Classic Soul,R&B,Slow Jams - 8\\" compilation.<br /><br />*UPDATE: Tracks 1, 6, 7, and 9 can now also be found on the recently released \\"The Essential Bill Withers\\".*<br /><br />The majority of these tracks are terrific, and would make for a helluva compilation to complement this great and well-priced box set (shop around and you will find some ridiculously cheap prices, but the difference in retail between the US and UK puzzles me).<br /><br />Other, more recent guest appearances:<br /><br />10.) Playin' the Loser Again - 2004 duet with Jimmy Buffett off the latter's \\"License to Chill\\" album.<br />11.) Lovely Day - Maroon 5's cover from the 2006 \\"Hoot\\" soundtrack, featuring Bill and Kori Withers on backing vocals.<br /><br />Bill also wrote and played on two otherwise-unreleased songs (Better You Go Your Way, Tenderness is His Way) from Gladys Knight & The Pips' 1974 \\"I Feel a Song\\" album.<br /><br />So nice to see the humble master get his due, and hopefully sales and renewed interest in his overall work will spur further releases of archival or new material (the documentary \\"Still Bill\\" indicates he has hardly been twiddling his thumbs these last three decades).- Classic Soul,R&B,Slow Jams - 8\\" compilation.<br /><br />*UPDATE: Tracks 1, 6, 7, and 9 can now also be found on the recently released \\"The Essential Bill Withers\\".*<br /><br />The majority of these tracks are terrific, and would make for a helluva compilation to complement this great and well-priced box set (shop around and you will find some ridiculously cheap prices, but the difference in retail between the US and UK puzzles me).<br /><br />Other, more recent guest appearances:<br /><br />10.)

B000HKW7E0|5.0|This has got to be one of the funniest movies ever. Have seen it over and over and still laugh out loud each and every time. Love Chevy Chase and all of the Vacation movies.
1451675046|5.0|Mr. Dawkins has explained the workings of the universe in a clear, concise way.  You will be overwhelmed at times by his visual imagery.  However, buy the book or the iPad version, not the kindle version, due to the awesome illustrations that will help children and adults picture his descriptions, and due to the fact that they're just cool.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|I love this show its one of the best of its years highly recommend this box set its a collectors item.
B005V4FJC4|3.0|Based on Dechanel's vocal performances from Elf and Yes Man, I purchased this record. It is a decent record, but the version of Baby It's Cold Outside was a disappointment.  I just didn't like the vocal styling vs. her performance from Elf.<br /><br />Overall, Zoey is a good singer, and captures the old fashion style from the 40's-50's. Much of the album is in the same exact style, and it would have been better to have a broader pallet of orchestration and arranging. Thus, listening to the album is boring.  But it fits in well with a shuffled Christmas playlist.  It is nice to have good acoustic music performances (and vocal harmonies) versus most of the modern day digitally refined and controlled recordings.

B0084TWN9K|3.0|This is the first time reading Alice Munro.  It was recommended to me and I was glad to find it on Kindle at Amazon.  Her stories are very real and they  draw you into the story.  I will certainly look for more Mary Alice Munro novels on Kindle.
0756405890|3.0|This book was difficult for me to get through. I found Kvothe unbelievable, underwhelming, and whiny. However, I pushed through and made it to the second book, and I can say that I'm glad I did. The second book is everything I wanted the first one to be. Totally worth it.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is a very well written book that will have you up late just to see what will happen next. It is a thriller that is so emotional it will have you turning your kindle off at various moments just so you can catch your breath. The characters are well developed . The format of going from past to present between chapters worked perfectly with this story. It has a very climatic ending and will not disappoint those that enjoy a great psychological thriller.
0756407125|5.0|I hate leaving a book unfinished, but through most of the first book in this series, I was sorely tempted. While the writing is lovely enough, I found the all of the characters somewhat one-sided, and most of them were more similar to each other than different. The story was also trudging along rather slowly and monotonously. The biggest climax of the book was unique enough, but rather silly. I always wanted to be more impressed with Kvothe than I was. However, by the very end of the book, I was beginning to change my mind. Kvothe whined less (though I still found him far too self-important for what little he had accomplished by the end of the story), and the author resisted the urge for an entire novel to give him the girl. I thought I would be relieved to finish it, but I found myself wondering what happened to Kvothe...I found myself searching on Amazon for the second book and ordering it. I was skeptical, but a few chapters in, I found myself really enjoying it. I tried to put it down...and I couldn't. It is so much better than the first book, and we've finally gotten into the meat of the story. I am a huge fan of fantasy literature, and I've read pretty much everything there is. The first book was a trial of will, but I can honestly say I enjoyed the second book more than I anticipated and more than most fantasy literature I've read in a long time.

B009LRE040|2.0|There are lots of machine gun shoot outs that begin and end without clear cause and lots of explosions. The story is all over the place and the whole movie feels more like a really bad \\"made for tv\\" flick!  SO Glad I didn't buy the movie, but rented it instead!  The supporting actors have some goofy lines and the extras who got a few lines needed some acting lessons. I had to force myself to watch all the way to the end, but found myself multi-tasking less than 1/2 way through.  The length of the film is too long, especially considering its poor scripting.<br />******************<br />****minor spoilers****<br />******************<br />Bane. Gag. He is a monotone and sometimes hard to understand foe with little explanation of his motivation.  He had a hard childhood. Got it.  Other than that... not much there!<br />And what is with the \\"hay-hay-ha-ha\\" chanting?<br />----<br />Is this even a Batman movie? Batman shows up so little, it doesn't seem like it!  We continually see a \\"woe is me\\" weak and broken down Bruce Wayne.  He has completely lost the spirit that made him so captivating in the other films.  I understand the loss of both Rachel and Harvey took their toll, but there wasn't much in DKR to make you care about Bruce and his mission.  By the way, what -is- his mission in this film?<br />----<br />Anne Hathaway does a good job with what she was given.  She has a lot of spirit, although her purpose isn't all together clear.  Either the picture was dark or there was lots of poor set lighting because there weren't many opportunities to get a clear look at the \\"controversial\\" cat woman suit.  Doesn't matter though.  She kicks butt!<br />----<br />Poor Alfred and Lucas! They're reduced to characters with cheesy lines and shallow, nearly non-existent personalities.  And Gordon? I couldn't begin to care about him in this movie.  Most of the time he is just on camera with a goofy look on his face and no lines.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|When I saw the pitcures I thought that it was just pitcures. NOPE! Sure enough it was like Slender and when I turned around something was climbing down the hill towards me. AAHHHH!!!!!! Oh God......  I felt like something was watching me. The next game I got to 3/8 pages. Once I saw that HUGE building I quit. Compared to Slender this is better. Also better than all the other Slender games (including the kindle ones). The next one I dropped my Kindle. I started to cry. BEST GAME EVER. Period. Said it already. Play it. See it. Believe it. Spender's Watching. Always. JUST KIDDING!!! Seriously. Play it. Make sure to check this review out. You'll love it. If you love Slender get this. NOW. I just can not stop typing. Don't turn around while playing. You'll die. Just a tip. You'll thank me for this review. Till the next review. Bye!

B0070Y46UY|5.0|There were times, while reading, I became frustrated with &#34;When is the tiger showing up?&#34; I thought at first that the book was not living up to its hype.  Now, I find myself thinking over the situation in the story many times and many days after finishing the story and realizing so many things about Pi and how he told his story. And, isn't that what you get from a good book?  Forget that you learn a totally new way of looking at animals in zoos, the story telling is the thing in this book.  I would recommend it to all adult readers, may be a little graphic for even some teens.  Loved  the story.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it's amazing and it's a great game to spend on. I really recommend you to try it out because is the best game I have ever play :)
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This e published version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is beautifully illustrated  and an absolute joy to read.  This is the first time I read this book.  I expected a revision of Hollywood's version of this story.  Obviously, no movie can do justice to any book or novel; this book is no exception.  What is excellent about this version is that it gives a brief history of the historical background that Dickens' wrote his work in and the history of this timeless classic. There may be a minor ( and I mean minor issue) on two of the illustrations:  Bob Cratchit carrying Tiny Tim on his shoulders and Scrooge raising his salary. The Kindle Fire version of all the illustrations are recreated perfectly. They are partially duplicated on the top third portion and look like the top third  of the illustration is above the the whole of the image in the Kindle 3G Keyboard version.  I think that the publisher should look into this. This is no reason to avoid purchasing this version. Again, this version is excellent!
B007B8EX9I|5.0|Everyone else seems to have said all of the good stuff.  I just love this series. Lets just hope the networks don't see how much we like it and cancel it. I can't wait for Season 3 to see how things work out with Lady Mary's story line, and also with the newly married/imprisoned \\"Mister Bates\\".
B0085RQLXK|5.0|What's not to say about this awesome group! These guys pulled it off again! What a great comeback! Highly recommended for those whom are familiar with AEROSMITH! (whom isn't familiar with AEROSMITH?) 5 stars!!!

1594744475|5.0|I double love this adorable cookbook.<br />Not only does it give you great tips, recipes and ideas for healthy and fun lunches for your kids, but it also shows you step by step instructions on how to make them just as cute and you see them in the book.<br />And for those of you that see all the different colored rice or eggs and think &#34;I really don't like filling my kids with chemical food colorings...&#34; it even tells you how you can dye the food all naturally ^_^<br />This is a must have for parents who like to play in the kitchen.
B00846REIS|5.0|I took a chance on this book after Amazon recommended them to me because I LOVED &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; and boy was I hooked after the first page!! I could not put the book down! I love that it's a series so there are more books to come! I enjoyed this book and hope you enjoy it too! HAPPY READING!!
B005LAII08|5.0|Everyone in my family loves it. We have watched it over and over.<br />Was a little nervous my grandson, who is 3 might be afraid of the bear.<br />He absolutely loves the movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK BY NICHOLAS SPARKS!! I LOVED ALL HIS BOOKS BUT THIS ONE HAD ME TURNING EACH PAGE LIKE MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT! I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. IT WAS SOO GOOD! I WANTED MORE! I AM SO EXCITED FOR THE MOVIE! HAPPY READING!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|William Landay's writing in Defending Jacob reflects every aspect of brilliant writing. This book is the definition of a page turner.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you are looking for a great series to read this is it!! I loved these books! I had a hard time putting them down! A MUST READ!! I can't wait for &#34;Entwined with You&#34; May so far away....but I have already pre-ordered it because these books are just that good!! &#60;3
B004LWZWGA|1.0|Love the movie, but I will NEVER again buy one with the horrible UV/Flixster combo. Seriously, step into the nineties and give us a digital copy like so many other movies have done for years. If I had ready any of the 1-star reviews before I bought (and there are MANY), I would not have bought. Lesson learned.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had me on the edge of seat!! I have never read anything like this but I saw a review for it on Amazon and so I bought it. I couldn't put this book down!! It is a little dark and twisted but that's what makes it CRAZY GOOD! This book made me say &#34;WTF&#34; a couple of times. I was even scared at one point and had to put it down because I was reading late at night...it was pretty intense but in a good way! If books don't get your imagination and emotions going its not worth reading! I was very satisfied and impressed with this book I bought Flynn's other two books!!!
032147404X|5.0|One book I would suggest any new photographer add to his or her must have list. This book is filled with great information for a person with a digital camera. Wonderful and very informative.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved loved this book!! It is one of my favorites by Nicholas Sparks! Anyone who reads this book will absolutely need a box of tissues!! But this book is worth the read and the crying!!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The book explains steps to take to publish on Kindle in simple steps that a technically challenged person like me can understand.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|Magical, like heated summer breeze through a grove of spice trees. It warms your heart, gets your juices racing through your veins, as those secret movements of nature mischievously orchestrates a symphony. All the while your tongue imagining the sweet taste of chocolate melting in your mouth, if only it could be one of HER creations.
B009CGYO0K|4.0|Funny and very good if you like cats. The problem I had was some of the print was way too small on a Kindle
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've been a Rush fan ever since my brother brought home 'Kings' from Big N in Watertown , NY during the fall of 1977.  I was hooked: I threw away my Kiss albums and readied myself for the onslaught of Yes, King Crimson and the likes.  Rush was different and never claimed to be the 'it' group.  They've always marched to their own drummer, no pun intended, and I'm glad to have been along for the ride all these fine years.  Clockwork Angels is a masterpiece for them and perhaps a signpost for things to come.  Just listen...
B005LAII8A|2.0|This movie tries hard but achieves little.<br />We're supposed to side with saving the baby hitler?<br />No, Bruce Willis' character was supposed to win, kill the evil kid before he grows up and destroys the world.<br /><br />Sip this and watch 7 Monkeys.
1439196834|3.0|I ordered this for my boyfriend just as a joke since we love the show and found this episode hilarious. The book itself is pretty funny, however there is a black mark on the top pages of the book, a rip on the bottom back cover and last several pages of the book, and the lamination is peeling on a couple places on the back as well. If you want to order this book I suggest you shop elsewhere.
B004SBX112|1.0|Whats the point of making new versions u cant enjoy? Cant finish #1 in winter with more than 1 star even when nothing left to destroy. Games are supposed to be fun these are not any longer. Uninstalling them all.
B002RVCD0U|4.0|I had very poor expectations of this movie, especially since the last Terminator movie was so terrible.  I was completely suprised and totally enjoyed this movie.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|As is his wont, Follett does a masterful job of researching his material.  Some of his character connections are a bit forced, but they move the plot and are very engaging.  I'm a fan of his, and I am now reading the second in the trilogy which I find interesting.
B006YXTRHY|1.0|Only bought this to watch and laugh. The acting/writing is absolutely horrible and pretty much nothing happens so clearly they only split it into two movies for the money.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Interesting thoughts on animals in captivity. Way too Grisley for me, I don't like having those bloody images in my head. The ending was a little strange, not a satisfying one. The story about his mother and the cook was just as disturbing as the rest of the book about the animals, I don't care which was the real one, they were both awful.,
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Keeps you on the end of your seat. Wonderfully acted. Very hard to only watch one episode. Also shows bipolar disorder in a really realistic way
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is what avid readers hope when they crack a book.  A world so well detailed you escape with the characters, and you can't wait to pick up the book and keep on reading!
0920668372|5.0|Use to read this to my mom when I was a kid. Thought it was a great gift idea for her birthday. She loved it
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I've tried to read this book twice and I can't get past the third chapter. Nothing really happens to grab your attention and I don't want to read on. I hear the book starts to get good once you get half way through the book but I can't keep interest in it to make it that far.
B0086700CM|4.0|I'd never heard of this game before, but thought I'd give it a try. It's a lot of fun! I would recommend it!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I like it is a very good Christmas album glad I bought it. Rod Steward never let you down. Cool !!!!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I have been looking for a book I couldn't put down. It is really well thought out in my opinion and each chapter ending makes hit hard to stop reading. There are times when you think you have the plot figured out and it makes a crazy turn you never imagined. I like that most about this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a amazing u a web site to go to and look at amazing things that people make. Or even found or made up if u don't like this app or the web site u r not a human.
B000T433CO|4.0|I like the romance of the two couples. It was also very entertaining and easy to watch. Iliked this movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Many twists and turns but the ending was not anything I expected.  Kind of a let down after all the ups and downs.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Oh well Tim did it again! This book is for anyone - for those who want to learn to make a quick and healthy lunch according to slow carb diet and even for those who want to host big dinner parties. I like the way the book was structered - part for future Pros, part for hunters etc. However, 4hour Chef is not just about cooking, but rather 'meta-learning'. How can Dalai Lama shooting a basketball help you to remember set of card? How can Pareto Law of 80/20 help you to learn just about anything? Tim Ferriss explains everything and make one wonder - what will be his next book about?
1439597286|4.0|I am a preschool teacher, I borrowed a copy of this book from another teacher.  My class enjoyed it so much that I wanted a copy of my very own.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I would like it better if I could change tiles and layouts.  I play mahjong a lot and have played better games than this one
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Ignore that idiot reviewer about showing movies in a van to kids, clearly that is a joke because he wrote the same review on Dark Knight Returns Part 1.  This movie is the top of DC's animation.  Fantastic storyline getting justice done in the form of an animated movie.
B000JQU4TW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I didn't quite know what to expect when I started reading it, and I definitely enjoyed it. It is thoughtful and contemplative, but is reachable for a wide range of audiences.
B004E9T0HW|5.0|Short story: Yes, you should read it. Not only this one, all three books, in sequence. You won't regret it.<br /><br />Long story: I bought the book 22:30, read it through the night, slept a bit and was finished before 10:00 next morning. What can I say? Yes, some reviews here say lots of political details are shallow, tons of happy coincidences through the plot, simplifications. But this is a story, it's supposed to be like this! And one of the best, most entertaining and cool stories I've ever read! The two first books are really, really good and entertaining, but this one goes beyond them. It closes the whole saga with a bang! It's get so much fun reading about the human adventure unfolding before you that all the science fiction comes in naturally and enhances the story instead of being central to it like in so many other books. It's like the first time I watched Star Wars, but on a book - there are science fiction elements, but they form the engaging background to the epic aventure going on.<br /><br />Really, really cool!
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Choose a movie I could agree on with my picky teenagers.<br />It was good movie; worth watching with a full plot.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I know but everyone needs tons of space so you can play it you can have tons of pets to feed and play with.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|My mother in law has Alzheimer's  and seeing the world from the eyes of the person with the disease was an eye opener . I know that she is still there and that if its a &#34;good&#34; day , you can still bring the, back a little. I cried soo much! Very well written.<br />Thank you Lisa Genova!!
B005LLXB9K|5.0|I've always loved Pearl Jam but I am older than they are and didn't follow them closely during their rise.  This video is really entertaining as well as informative about their career, with insights to the controversies, personnel issues, writing and artistry, performances and much more.  Highly recommend it as a Rockumentary.
B0086700CM|5.0|it was an awesome thing to play but there some mistakes that can be fixed but other than that it was great to purchase
B002IR3PSC|4.0|Most of this footage can be seen on a YouTube upload but its a good video to have in your library as one of the famous archives of great performances in rock n' roll.  Anyone who hasn't seen Jethro Tull and Ian Anderson in action is missing out on some of the finest artistic performers in our generation.  Glad I bought it.
B00A2IUDO8|4.0|If you like Family guy then you will enjoy this film. New twist on the carrying things from childhood to adulthood.
B009SQRL4U|3.0|My children really liked this movie. It has good, clean humor and colorful characters. As an adult, to me, the story was sweet, but I didn't like how some of the characters acted and the &#34;aha&#34; moment(s) and the end seemed like a quick tie up.
145470246X|5.0|These are wonderful designs, however, some are not explained as much as I would like. I've made a few and love them. There are many more that I want to make. This book grows a beader.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this game is great and challenging, plus it's super fun! You can grow flowers and bring a monster to life! If only there were more pencils...
160059672X|4.0|This was one of my first purchases as a new beader. I love the designs and have made a few items. Now that I've been beading for a few years (4), I can make many more and get much more out of her book. I love it.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I use this app all the time and I love it!! It has always worked very well for me when I needed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Didn't want it to end! The book gave details that the movie didn't so it was easy to follow and exciting
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Joss Whedon successfully takes what is a complicated and job and make it seem completely seamless and effortless. I was blown away with how well these characters all interacted together so well. I was blown away by the efforts of Joss Whedon, the entire cast and the special effects by ILM studios. Definitely worth buying on blue ray.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Too graphic detail...glad the movie didn't show what I read! Hesitant to see the movie because the killing of the zebra by the hyena was so graphic!  But understand that the movie doesn't dwell on that part.
B008458O3S|4.0|I, too, loved this game and so I am very disappointed that it no longer works. My phone causes all black on the screen to turn to white making it near impossible
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Didn't want it to end! Loved the story and can't wait for the movie. It is a believable story and good for all ages!
B0011TNVLY|5.0|I watch with my grandchildren every year as we are trimming the Christmas tree.  Of course, with hot chocolate! I also watch through out the year, without grandchildren.  I believe.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a young girl. The songs are great, and of course all little girls dream about suddenly becoming a princess.

B0036EH3UC|5.0|you cant pass this up for the price an the series. you will love it an watch it over an over .
B002ZG98UK|1.0|Probably the worst movie I have seen in recent memory. How is it possible that this movie got funded, made and released? The acting is just plain awful and the story was a mess. Zero stars.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|its a feel good movie an one you need to get.dont over look this one if you love a good movie.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|I originally bought this for an Android phone and I also have it for the Apple iPhone and iPad. The app for the Apple products have many more features and provides a better output. This product is a good app for either platform.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|this is great for children (girls) to play and have fun for the day.they enter a whole other world that they love its great.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|OK, the movie is pretty good for a trilogy ending and we know that. I had fun in the movie theater despite of some serious goofs you might find in the IMDB page.<br /><br />However, the \\"Second Screen\\" app on your iPhone, iPad or whatever forces you to watch the movie looking at another screen, something you have to buy additionally. What if you don't have an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy? You're pretty much toasted. The Dark Knight DVD had a feature in the BD that let you watch the features while the movie was playing, same way as Inception. This \\"App sync\\" is a scam.<br /><br />Oh and I agree 100% with the 1-star reviews about UltraViolet, essentially a way to compete against Netflix with low-quality streaming. A rip-off worthy of LucasFilm or Apple (The Beatles' Apple and Cupertino's).<br /><br />In 5 years nobody will care about these Apps, but the movie will live on.
B0017DJ3UW|5.0|I love just this Chistmas Album!  The first was a cassette purchase(lol). It's one of my favorite! The sound quality is great.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|Great, very enjoyable movie.  Really well made, looks great, performances are great.  I surprisingly enjoyed the movie considering all the flak I heard when it came out.<br /><br />Now I get the complaints.  The crew basically do all the cheesy B-Movie dumb \\"mistakes\\" that leads to full on carnage.  Over and over and over again.  Normally, this kind of thing bugs the heck out of me.<br /><br />However, this movie hits all the marks on solid performances, tension vs. action, the awesome look, the weird alien twist in the story, some serious carnage, etc.  All of that elevates this movie that should be cheesy as hell, into an enjoyable, smart film.  It helps you accept all the obvious holes in the story.<br /><br />Now that I think about it, you could say the same for the first two Alien movies as well.  There is a great Ridley Scott signature all over it, which I do enjoy.  You very much feel we are talking the same universe as the Alien series.<br /><br />Thumbs up flick.  Very much enjoyed streaming it in HD through the PS3.  Worthy.

B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|A great procedural mixed with great character development.  Lots of action for those who love action - a little romance - some character drama - and the bormance of the decade between McGarrett and Dano!  it's hilarious! A definte want for you Alex O'Loughlin library :-)
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Loving this series - can't wait for the next release!! Seriously addicted to Gideon and his constant suprises. A definate favourite.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I loved this movie.  Typical Disney/Pixar great animation and story line.<br />Always good morals in the disney movies and this one is no exception.
B001NBEWN6|4.0|I had to read this for my Transnational Feminism class, but I absolutely would have read it regardless. The story is fantastic (though a bit morbid, so if you're particularly emotional or scare easy, brace yourself).<br /><br />The most striking thing about the book is undoubtedly how poetic it is. Roy's impressive lexicon and song-like prose made this book a pleasure to read.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|First adventure-sort-of-game I've purchased for Kindle. The graphics are great, and it's more of a challenged than I'd anticipated. I use the hints all the time and wish I could print out the map!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Gives insight into the thoughts and ability to do a &#34;job&#34; which is most difficult.  This book was written with the passion and the purpose of action of a sniper.
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|I purchased this movie because I wanted to watch the classic tale of Mulan. Sound quality and picture quality were great, no complaints.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Enjoyed the book cover to cover.  The nuts and bolts of an operation  of this magnitude was laid out in an understandable manner.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Pros -<br />Has different videos for different levels of fitness (3)<br />Just have a mat and weights and you are ready to go<br />Great for toning<br />Cheap<br /><br />Cons-<br />No number of &#34;reps&#34; to complete which can be confusing when they change camera angles and you try to keep up with the people doing the exercise.<br />Gets repetitive<br />After completing this the first time, I had to stop for a while because I was having knee issues<br /><br />Overall, I'd say get it but mix it with other workout DVD's as this one can get old and has high knee impact moves.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really enjoyed this book at the start but was so disappointed with the silly ending. It was such a shame. I actually felt like I had wasted my time readimg the book.  it had such great potentialz
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this for an adult Who fan and he loved it. The tenth doctor has always been my husband's favorite (and mine as well). It was a neat tool that makes the noise like the real sonic screwdriver. It has a knob to move the top part of the devise up and down. It lights up and has a pen to write. He loved having it around but unfortunately, the dog got a hold of it and chewed on it. It still works but is not as pretty to look at.<br /><br />I would caution that I doubt the ink would last very long and replacements could be harder to get a hold of. The invisible ink was really neat but would be more fun if there was someone to write to who also had this screwdriver. Also, it could be easy to misplace the pen top that is not currently in use.
B0020M99LC|5.0|If you are a Bond fan, this movie is a must- see. Daniel Craig is excellent as 007, jacked, intense and a really smart killing machine. Casino Royale is fast- paced, full of action, creepy characters and plot twists that will leave you yearning for the next Craig/007 film.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|This had a different story line from the classic tale. It was extremely entertaining and updated. The story did fit in the typical characters, but in an unexpected way.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|An intriguing and amazing story of overcoming pain and suffering interwoven with the provision of information about the language of flowers
B008M34INW|4.0|This movie is similar to Payback although not a similar story. Just a tough guy with a heart that just won't die or go away. It is enjoyable and has sufficient action.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Full of twists and turns. Friends are enemies and e denies are friends. Can't wait to see what happens in last book!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I read Les Miserables while working in Cameroon, Africa in the early 1980s. Decided to read it again when I found it as a free book for Kindle app on my iPad. Although some of the description can get wordy, repetitious and seemingly superfluous at times, the topics of crime and its relation to poverty and socio-economic levels are very timely; as is the idea that mercy and forgiveness can have a greater impact than punishment. Hugo's description of the human condition and the development of his characters are extraordinary. He makes you feel what the character is feeling as he explores the forces and motivations driving the characters' actions. A very long read but I can hardly put it down, the story is so gripping. A must read if you haven't read it before. And very much re-reading if it has been a while since you have read it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I got the package in the mail super early with Super Saver Shipping! I couldn't be more pleased with Amazon.<br />I will add on my impression of the product after I have had a chance to sit down and watch it. But having seen the movies separately in theaters, I can pretty much assure you, getting all three on bluray for under 30 bucks is a STEAL!
B005LAIIFS|4.0|\\"Rise of the Guardians\\" is a fascinating reimagining of some familiar childhood fairy tale favorites as superhero guardians of the wonders of childhood.  It features Jack Frost, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, Santa, and the Sandman in stunning animation, along with the Bogeyman.  There is lots of comedy, lots of action, and some dark moments that may be disturbing for really small children.<br /><br />As the story begins, Jack Frost is born, rising out of a frozen pond and given his name by the Man in the Moon.  Jack discovers at least some of his powers, and his ability to have fun, but his real purpose only begins to become clear when he is summoned to the North Pole.  There, he will be invited to join his fellow childhood characters as a Guardian.  The ocasion is the return of the Bogeyman, a nasty character who wants to replace childhood dreams with nightmares.  The struggle of the Guardians with the Bogeyman is the core of the movie.  Jack will have to discover the secret of his own origins, just in time to save the day.<br /><br />\\"Rise of the Guardians\\" has some name talent behind the excellent animation, and an imaginative storyline that audiences of all ages will enjoy.  Highly recommended.
1575666286|5.0|The book itself came in excellent condition.  Although doing this diet would be a challenge, this is a very informative book, and provides an alternative in helping heal yourself through diet, which I believe is the main cause of illness besides the pollution we put into our air and water.  I would only do this diet if I were majorly ill though, which I hope to never be.

1400067820|4.0|*A full executive summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00HPCF6AA An Executive Summary of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's 'Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder']]<br /><br />The concept of fragility is very familiar to us. It applies to things that break when you strike or stretch them with a relatively small amount of force. Porcelain cups and pieces of thread are fragile. Things that do not break so easily when you apply force or stress to them we call strong or resilient, even robust. A cast-iron pan, for instance. However, there is a third category here that is often overlooked. It includes those things that actually get stronger or improve when they are met with a stressor (up to a point). Take weight-lifting. If you try to lift something too heavy, you'll tear a muscle; but lifting more appropriate weights will strengthen your muscles over time. This property can be said to apply to living things generally, as in the famous aphorism `what doesn't kill you makes you stronger'. Strangely, we don't really have a word for this property, this opposite of fragility.<br /><br />For author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, this is a major oversight, for when we look closely, it turns out that a lot of things (indeed the most important things) have, or are subject to, this property. Indeed, for Taleb, all that lives, and all the complex things that these living things create (like societies, economic systems, businesses etc.) have, or must confront this property in some way. This is important to know, because understanding this can help us understand how to design and approach these things (and profit from them), and failing to understand it can cause us to unwittingly harm or even destroy them (and be harmed by them). So Taleb has taken it upon himself to name and explore this curious property and its implications; and in his new book `Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder' Taleb reports on his findings.<br /><br />As the title would suggest, what Taleb has found is that most complex systems not only gain from small stressors, but they are designed to gain more when these stressors are distributed irregularly, or randomly. This point is more difficult to accept because we tend to dislike disorder and randomness. Disorder can be frightening, because unpredictable, and is therefore not something that we readily welcome. So what we often do is attempt to remove the random and disorderly from our systems (and eliminate the shocks), and thus make them smooth. For example, we may try to take the boom and bust out of the economy, and instead aim for a gradual upward trend.<br /><br />For Taleb, though, this is a big mistake, because while removing the small shocks in a complex system may create stability for a time, it actually upsets the system and makes it prone to major shocks in the long term. What's more, unlike the small shocks (that refine and improve the system), the major shocks are usually damaging, and can even destroy the system. So removing the small shocks from a complex system doesn't create stability; rather, it creates the illusion of stability. In the economy, for instance, you get a long period of stability followed by a major crash.<br /><br />This phenomenon is not just confined to the economy. Indeed, Taleb maintains that it is the spirit of the age to believe that we can remove the disorder from any system (and eliminate the shocks), and render it orderly, smooth and predictable. We are almost always mistaken in this, and end up creating systems that are prone to major damage and even outright destruction (in Taleb's language, we `fragilize' these systems). We call the damaging and destructive episodes Black Swan events (Taleb himself coined the term). Better it would be by far, Taleb argues, to accept and even welcome a certain amount of disorder, randomness and jaggedness in our lives and systems, and put ourselves in a position to profit from the unpredictable, rather than eradicate it.<br /><br />On thislast point, Taleb maintains that it is indeed possible to profit from the unpredictable (without having to actually predict any specific thing--which is next to impossible in the realm of the complex anyway). We simply need to recognize what systems are fragile (and therefore prone to collapse), and what systems are antifragile (and therefore prone to grow stronger from stressors), and get out of the way of the former, and put our faith in the latter. This applies not only to large, overarching systems like corporations, economic systems and political societies, but our own bodies and minds.<br /><br />Taleb presents a very intriguing position, and offers up some very interesting evidence in support of it (though at times we may wonder whether he is resorting to the same kind of cherry-picking of information that he accuses others of). Also, Taleb has a lot to say, and a bone to pick, so his style often comes across as arrogant--even bombastic (think Nietzsche). Some will like this, while others will be annoyed (I didn't mind it, but did not think it truly added anything for the most part). Also, Taleb jumps around and repeats himself often. This was more objectionable to me than his style, but ultimately I think the content rose well above this, and I truly enjoyed the book, and think it deserves a read.

We simply need to recognize what systems are fragile (and therefore prone to collapse), and what systems are antifragile (and therefore prone to grow stronger from stressors), and get out of the way of the former, and put our faith in the latter. This applies not only to large, overarching systems like corporations, economic systems and political societies, but our own bodies and minds.<br /><br />Taleb presents a very intriguing position, and offers up some very interesting evidence in support of it (though at times we may wonder whether he is resorting to the same kind of cherry-picking of information that he accuses others of). Also, Taleb has a lot to say, and a bone to pick, so his style often comes across as arrogant--even bombastic (think Nietzsche). Some will like this, while others will be annoyed (I didn't mind it, but did not think it truly added anything for the most part). Also, Taleb jumps around and repeats himself often.

B000SEI230|5.0|Nicholas sparks is my favorite author. He has written some amazing books. However, I feel that A Walk to Remember tops them all. It was so beautifully written.  It had sadness, happiness, love, anger, confusion, change, and so much more bundled up in one perfect book. It brought tears to my eyes.
B002N1AERI|5.0|I love this album! I can (and have) listened to it back to back, and it just never gets old. It's so much fun, and also very engaging, thoughtful, powerful, and intriguing. If you like gothic metal, orchestras, and/or intense high octane music in general, you should give this a try. This is perhaps my second favourite album from my favourite band, and I highly recomend it.
B005ES1232|5.0|I liked the a lot. Very good materials, very comfortable, very good ventilation inside, very light. Very smooth to walk.<br />Recommended
B007KOMTUI|4.0|As a former agency partner I appreciate the quality of these stories. The politics are real. so is the striving for message excellence and the value of a &#34;big idea&#34;.
B00881VLCE|4.0|One of my 5 yr old twins enjoys puzzles and i got this for her. I like that you can make it easier (so she can do them by her self) or you can increase the puzzle pieces so we can do them together.
B0044WUIHA|5.0|Saw it at the theater, and thought it was awesome. Shows you how small we are in this world, and how we need each other to survive. Besides, you can't beat Tom Hanks movies. I've yet to see a bad one of his.
B0049VZ222|4.0|It is a little too gruesome in spots but I like the series. As I progressed through the series, the story pulled together and really started to enjoy the show. Season 2 is even better.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Good movie for passing the time on a cloudy day. My mom really enjoyed it more than me. Probably better if I had kids.
B00AAU2QA2|5.0|Awesome Album!!!! love every song on this album. I recommend to anyone who likes or loves Ke$ha's Music. Check it out
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The writers keep coming up with inventive murder cases that weave around smaller plot lines.  There is always action to keep you going.
B0026IQYEA|5.0|CATE BLANCHETT AND GEOFFREY RUSH ARE TWO OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS, THEIR PERFORMANCES WERE FLAWLESS.<br />AND I AM A HUGE QUEEN BESS FAN, ONE OF THE GREATEST MONARCHS IN HISTORY
0385535147|4.0|This book (which I checked out of the library) was definitely worth the time I invested in reading it.  There were a couple of things that strained credulity, but Grisham does such a good job with character development, has an interesting writing style, and knows how to tell a story so well that that can easily be overlooked, IMHO.<br /><br />Read it.  You won't regret it.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I fell in love with the series from the first page.  It is written with such description that the images pop off the page and into your mind.  I originally bought the books for my daughter but loved them more than she .  The movie is no comparison to the books.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I like this game! lots of adventure and fun tasks to do.  I recommend it to anyone who likes role playing games.
B005HSL626|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  There is  a lot of action which I enjoy.  You have a lot of choices about which type of play and what type of tools you want to use to play with.  You can choose faster as well as slower modes of play.  I like to move back and forth<br />as sometimes I prefer the slower pace and other times I am happy to do the faster mode.  It makes the game more exciting this way.  Anyone who enjoys arcade action in their games would enjoy this one.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Was disappointed in movie as acting was seemed forced and not the good interaction between people I thought.  For nothing better to do okay.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I liked this game.  It was fun to match all the shapes and the game provided a lot of different shapes to choose from.  The abilty to change the cube around made it more exciting too as there weremore areas of play.  I would recommend this game for anyone interested in finding matches.  Interesting colour choices too!  Would keep you amused for hours.
B007549W62|3.0|This movie stated out with great promise, strangers who flee to a highrise buildings basement after an atomic bomb is set off in their city.<br />You get to see human behaviour at it's best and worst during a crisis.<br />I gave the show only three stars ( average ) because how the show de-evolved and the poor ending however you may like it better.<br />Worth seeing if you cannot find something else to watch on tv.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Awesome game. Really addictive! My 2 granddaughters (ages 5 and 9) both enjoy this game, and, as a teacher, I enjoy the fact that it promotes problem solving. This is not some mindless game where they have to shoot something or dress something.
B0001MIQHQ|5.0|The actors in this movie are my age so I can remember when it came out in the 80's.<br />If your looking for safe for the whole family ( rated PG ) science fiction fun with a dash of humor thrown in you must see this gem of a movie.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|This box is exactly as described and even arrived a day earlier than expected. This will hold all of my little one's Barbies and accessories and the play mat is very cute.
B000NA2776|5.0|Wow, what a refreshing talent out of the UK. Mika doesn't disappoint with his song choices. This is one CD you'll want to play over and over again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of my favorite book series!  Love the movie version as well, wish they would hurry up and make movies of the second and third books
B008S4YZCO|4.0|It is a fun game with monsters. I like the game it's interesting.<br /><br />(/&bull;_&bull;)/  \(&bull;_&bull;\)  (/&bull;_&bull;)/  \(&bull;_&bull;\)<br /><br />(-_&bull;)  (^_^)  ( &bull;_&bull;) <br /><br />(/&bull;_&bull;)/ \(&bull;_&bull;\)  (/&bull;_&bull;)/ \(&bull;_&bull;\)  (/&bull;_&bull;)/   (&bull;_&bull; )  (/&bull;_&bull;)/
B000NA2776|5.0|Mika's Life in Cartoon Motion shows a signature use of Mika's fun vocal range.  The music also delights the ears with a rhythmic blending of clever instrumental juxtapositions.  Just enough candy for the soul.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Saw Vintage Trouble open for The Who in Orlando.  Lots of energy, original material.  Check them out and enjoy.  Recommended.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Definitely one of the most intriguing, captivating stories ever. You become one with the character, seem to know them like your best friend through detailed character description and such individual personality.... Gotta read!
B004HX4RT6|5.0|Computer is a challenge to beat.  You must stay alert and be ready for his moves!  Very entertaining and enjoyable!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|My husband and I absolutely love this series. Could not put it down. Now it's still another year for the last book...boy, but I can't wait!
B0076DELIG|5.0|This author never ceases to publish quality work.  I'll buy anything with his name on it unless he, too begins writing inanity.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|We absolutely love this series. Could not put the books down. It is so great to have something you look forward to pick up and read at the end of a long day, and in between...every chance we had!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love drawing my own characters! D: They're so cute an  the game actually uses them well, no lagging or anything. Everything you draw works right. There's hints if you get stuck and a great story line. All in all I lo e it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Dreaded the end of the book...since it will be like forever for the next one to come out....but awesome, just like the ones before. The man has an incredible imagination. One of my all time favorite.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A moving film about transition and change.  Interestingly, some of the characters embrace the change and flow with it.  Others resist and can't make the adjustment.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love jetpack joyride. Its amazing. My family and I love it and we play it all the time. This is finally a great game for Kindle Fire. Love this game.<br /><br />  Keep on Gaming
B007SGLZP8|3.0|While this book was enjoyable and easy reading, I felt that it fell right into the &#34;Grisham formula&#34; and that I could have predicted the outcome.  I read it while I was on vacation and it was probably the perfect book for a relaxing read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read it twice both books, couldn't put them down. Love Gideon, strong , protective of his love and I enjoy the light moments, they put a smile on my face.... And in my husband face too.  Cant wait for the last book. Hurry please
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|If you liked Expendables 1 then you will love Exp 2.  The action is kicked up a notch and the story line is actually good and not cheesy.  Highly recommended.
B002CVQAX6|5.0|I love Ship Movies and this movie i had on DVD but I wanted the Blu-Ray cause it looks better and Like I say I love seeing Ships in Blu-Ray so thats why I got it a Third time.Seeing the Atonia Graza Sink at the End was Cool.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellens humor shines in her latest book. She is, as always, entertaining and sincere. Lots of  fun and an easy read
B000NQRE1E|5.0|First of all I only wanted to get this movie on Blu-Ray Just To See the Ship in all its Glory and Second I give it 5 stars only because I love Old Ships and Seeing em in Blu-Ray is even Better.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I completely enjoyed this book.  I was pleasantly surprised at how engrossed I was. It was worth reading and did not disappoint.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|The acting was pretty good, the action was excellent, and the style of the film was on par; it's just too bad that the story felt a bit sparse.  This movie could've benefitted from an extra 10-15 minutes of story and 5 minutes less of transition imagery.  All-in-all a solid movie.
B007SGM084|1.0|I started reading this trilogy and finished it only because I'm that type of person.  I felt like I was reading a poorly written teenage novel.  If this book can make so many waves then American women need to get out more.  I felt like E L James kept inserting obscure words to prove to the reader that she knows them. Problem is they were used so awkwardly it became a distraction.  Don't waste your money. If you feel you must read this trilogy them borrow it.  What a nap.
0345803493|5.0|Great Books Trilogy. It kept me hooked for weeks, and I couldnt stop reading. Everything makes you envolved, corous. One of the best novels I ever read!
B009MO5G90|1.0|Please provide a real digital copy, otherwise have to skip it.<br />Ultraviolet is the most fragmented, non user-friendly format to ever hit consumers.<br /><br />Create 1 account on Ultraviolet<br />Create 1 account for Vudu<br />Create 1 account for Flixster<br />Then 1 account per production company to redeem (Sony, Paramount, etc...) travel all around the web to try and redeem them, then you can't watch on apple TV's, Roku1, nor is it DRM free when you put on your computer to import into itunes and have a consolidated movie library to easily put on an iphone/ipad, etc... to view when on an aeroplane.  USELESS!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I like the twist on the Angry Bird model.  The new characters are great and the little touches are great.
0805092919|5.0|bill martin is an excellent children's book author and this book has been a favorite of my little girl forever. we only ever checked it out at the library, the price was finally affordable so she is getting it for her birthday!!
B008ER9QLK|5.0|I am overjoyed at having this . It was so worth it.  I love the subtitles . I always thought the Ring Cycle was too much for me. It's so visually stunning in this edition. It outshines any other BLU Ray dvd. That stage and Le Page /Superb.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Good story, I like it for the kids.  i like it for the kids. i like it more for the kids.  to many words required for review.  I was a disney movie for god's sake.  What do you expect?
1934030597|5.0|After getting basic skills in bike repair (and having read a basic introductory book or two about the subject) everyone who wants to go into more serious and complex bike repair projects should give a try on Zinn's bike maintenance books. Comprehensive but also easy to understand, they go into details well beyond the beginners' guide and offer in-depth descriptions of the astounding variety of systems out on the market with lots of illustrations showing views of their construction and step by step description of the procedures for fixing them and the tools needed for the job. Since I have a mountain bike I got this book, but Mr Zinn also wrote a book for &#34;the other guys&#34; - Road, touring, cruise. Highly recommended!
B00846REIS|5.0|Good read and well written....with a plot! If you love 50 shades you will enjoy this too. It has less extreme scenes but still very exciting.
B000026OW3|5.0|Many great performers have graced the music world in all those years, but Arthur Rubinstein is still among the greatest. For the classical music enthusiast who wants to hear Chopin in thrilling performances this collection (at an astounding moderate price for its priceless historical and artistic value) is a &#34;must have&#34;!
1609611543|5.0|Once you read this book and you won't even have to read it to the end, you will want to change your eating habits. I did months ago and everything said in this book makes sense. I fell 100% better not eating gluten. Alot of people aren't even aware of what gluten is. A GREAT READ!!!!!
B002EBDP9G|5.0|I got Paul Johnson's History of the American people many years ago when I was still living in my old country, and found it absolutely fascinating. It reads well and keeps dry facts which can make history so unappealing to a minimum, and portrays the evolution of a truly unique country with a unique people in a clear, although not always objective manner. Be aware that this book isn't so much a history of the United States as a history of its people - verbatim what the title says. I recommend this book, as other works from the same author because even if the reader doesn't agree with everything he says it gives a perspective which is worth to consider, as well as some food for thought.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Such a good series! I like witch and vampire books that are not cheesy. There are so many books out there to choose from and this one is a good choice for adults  who like magic!
B0063IH60K|3.0|After a while they cram videos down your throat between every game that are hard to click off. And I guess I have a minumum of words so I will add , double what I said.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|This movie is heart warming and just hilarious! Will be a classic. Our family watches it multiple times every Christmas
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I don't understand why they waited ALL this time to release this in 3D for home but IT'S GREAT!!!!! If you loved the hooky plot in the movies...and you have a 3D TV and player...You'll love it!!!!
B009FXIICK|3.0|Samsung Galaxy SII<br /><br />The game is not bad, the animals are cute, but it gets boring after awhile and ithey're hard to see.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|I haven't yet seen the movie, so I don't know if this soundtrack includes all of the songs performed in the movie.  There aren't very many songs, and many of the ones on there are quite brief... would have liked to hear extended versions if they had truncated their recordings for the studio.  Also, at least one (Riff Off) doesn't really match the movie.. you don't hear the banter back and forth like in the clip I saw on YouTube, it is just straight from one song on to the next.<br />That said, the tracks are all well done and well performed, one might say even &#34;pitch perfect.&#34;  I enjoyed what I heard, I just wanted more.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm on day 9 of level 1, already sseing results.<br />Can't wait to start next level,have much more stamia.and will see alot more results when i'm done with level 3 for sure judging form what i;ve acomplished so far
B003Z0BWR2|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed Part 2. it kept me hooked right till the end! Ready to start the next one now :)
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. There are somethings I would have changed but it was a great read I would recommend
B000FC0V3E|4.0|This is Hemingway at his best, a straightforward simple narrative which gives an insight as to how one group of people lived their lives in the 1920's. It amazed me that they could get by without working (Jake excepted) and drink to the extent that they did. But they all appear as self-centred and at the end it's difficult to have any sympathy for them, again, Jake excepted-possibly! After all, he was prepared to live the same life.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once I started &#34;The Last Man&#34; I couldn't put it down. Fans of Mitch Rapp will not want to miss this one.
B008Y7J1Y2|4.0|I loved the movie when I saw it the first time and still do. So much is just right, the excitement of the first time in Southern California, the love and adjustment of a Christmas in  the UK. You really can't bring too many sweaters.<br />A perfect &#34;Happy&#34; Christmas movie.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Ok so this is my third headset, the others are Turtle Beach X12 and Tritton 720+ (I highly recommend both of those).<br /><br />After getting tired of seeing \\"OMG this headset sucks it has such a low volume\\" I have to make an update and put it first<br /><br />THIS HEADSET HAS PLENTY OF VOLUME<br />USE THE ADVANCED SOUND EDITOR PEOPLE!! THIS IS WHY ARE YOU PAYING SO MUCH MONEY FOR THIS HEADSET<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />-Sound Quality is great, in MW3 I could easily tell where the enemies were. I'd give these 9.5 and Trittons 720+ 8.5<br />-Advanced Sound Editor (ASE), make all the adjustments you want to your audio and chat. With a lot of room for presets.<br />-Mic is 10/10 just like the X12<br />-Very nice design<br />-Wireless with no interference at all, everything works great<br />-Voice morphing, yeah, this may be stupid and unnecesary but it can be real fun, you can make tons of jokes with this option<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-Sound out of the box is meh, you have to go the ASE to get great sound quality<br />-\\"EAR GUARD\\" THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE HEADSET TO HAVE \\"LOW VOLUME\\", YOU CAN TURN IT OFF IN THE ADVANCED SOUND EDITOR! DOWNLOAD THE MANUAL FROM TURTLE BEACH WEBSITE<br />-The most disappointing thing for me is that they do feel a bit cheap not what I would expect from a $300 headset, To me the X12 and Trittons are way better in this category, both feel more resistant to falls and everything<br />-Optical cable, it is sooooo slim but I guess this isn't a big deal...<br />-Price is a little high since they feel cheap and the sound out of the box is not what you would expect<br /><br />I had to return these because I had some problems (sound would cut off for 5 seconds from time to time and it would make a distorted noise in the right earcup every 10 mins approx)<br /><br />Even with the problems I had with the Tangos I would say this is a nice headset (although a bit pricey imo) and probably better than the Astro A50 (I am sure my Tangos were one of the very few that were defective, but the A50 it seems like 50% are good and 50% are defective) and from what I've seen all over the internet the Warheads sound is somewhat mediocre for $300.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/25/2013<br /><br />After trying the old Astro mixamp with the Sennheiser PC 360 (which, lucky me, they were defective too) I am back with the Tangos.<br /><br />I wanna say the old mixamp is really good imo.<br />The Sennheiser PC 360 are beautiful for music but in games I don't know if it was because they were defective or I had to get used to their sound (like it happened to me going from TBs X12 to Tritton 720+) but it was harder for me to hear footsteps, I am not quite sure as I just tried them for a few hours.<br /><br />Anyway, I am back with the Tangos and I am pretty happy with these, no defects so far, everything works great as I was expecting. This is the best headset for gaming I have tried so far.<br /><br />If you can get them for $199 that is a great price or even $249 would be fair imo.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am a mom and started to read these books to see what my kids were interested in. I loved the author's way with words and ideas. The books consumed me. I was on the edge of my seat waiting and wanting to read more. Even making up my own ending and cheering for Peeta and then Gale. Peeta. Gale. I was happy with the ending. I can't wait to see the first movie! It's on my daughter's Christmas list.
B009FZFONO|5.0|HD was excellent, possibly better than My ATT Uverse cable subscript.<br />Finally options for getting rid of cabel are here.
B0094KTBT8|4.0|One of the reasons I wanted to watch this movie ... among several ... was that I was looking forward to the grand immensity and surreal vision that Spielberg brings to film. The beginning however was almost too much of the conceived stereotypical image of the peasant farmers of rural England ... but quickly I was engrossed in the story, the landscapes, and the powerful beauty of the horse that Spielberg captured so well. This is a family movie, a family story, set it a violent time in history ... it is however without the extreme graphic nature of many wartime depictions, and concentrates more on the emotional side. I believe it is worth having in your DVD collection. This is the second movie that I have streamed from Amazon Video, and once again the procedure was simple and the execution flawless.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE! It is a movie both children and adults can enjoy and watch together. Definitely a favorite
B007SSDDWE|3.0|Well ... what to say about this movie. I guess I would love for this movie to simply be better than it was. I am a science fiction fan, and I loved the idea of the \\"invisible alien, made up of energy\\" premise, and the story started out well, but then sort of ran out of steam, and eventually became silly. Too bad really, as some of the effects were sweet. I chose three stars for it however, two would probably suffice ... but ... as a sci-fi-guy, I did really like some of the scenes in this movie. Do you sense my frustration? If five bucks does not mean much to your entertainment budget, then why not ... just don't have your hopes up too high.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I love Toy Story! This is one of  my absolute favorite movies! i love Woody and Buzz and now so does my kid
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Not my favorite Dark Knight film in the trilogy as I feel it wasnt epic enough to be the final chapter.  I felt The Dark Knight was a much more epic film than this installment.  I do very much enjoy Bane, but alas not very much screen time. Definitely worth watching.  Hope they continue to make Batman films in this dark fashion in the future.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|I love Coraline! Its a little creepy, a little cute and fun. I love movies like this :) Great buy
B0018QCXH8|5.0|Love this movie.  Love the soundtrack.  The dark gritty feel of the movie.  You really feel the emotion, the dirt, and the grime of this film.  One of my favorites.  Check it out.  You wont be disappointed.
B00005JM02|5.0|I love Finding Nemo!! This is a classic. I am glad I was able to get it for my kid to add to his collection :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The heading says it all. Im a very slow reader. I finished this book in 2 days. I loved it so much. I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first 2 books and anyone who wants a good series to read.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love The Walking Dead! I think the show is awesome! I am glad I have the second season to watch whenever I want!
B009JBZH54|5.0|great quality blu ray, great movies, and cheaper than Target (where I normally buy blu ray sets when they first come out)
B001706I5I|5.0|The Grinch is my favorite Christmas story. When I heard it was going to be done and have Jim Carey in it I was thrilled. I love this story. I'm very happy it has come out on Bluray combo pack.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I personally enjoyed Brave, by my 10, 8 and 5 year old didn't understand it.  Though they were entertained from start to finish, I had to explain the story to them.  The bear fighting scene was a bit too much for my 5 year old.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Why was this show canceled? Its the best and I can watch it over and over. Any Syfy lover will love this show, even tho it ended after only 14 episodes.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|You'll enjoy this movie even more if you're a down-home blues fan. A nice little story that is well-written, well-acted, and with excellent direction. Fun stuff.
B007HACDLK|4.0|As usual with books by this author, it was well written, interesting and full of exciting action. The characters are well known if you follow vince Flynn's books and they never fail to be interesting.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Jessica Lange is simply fantastic in both seasons!!!! And the writing is also great. Best horror series yet!!! Can't wait for more.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|by Gary Clar Jr<br /><br />sounds of jimmyhendrix, smokey robinson and blues. awesome!<br />guitar playing is the greatest.<br />sounds of ole time soul
B005LAII1C|5.0|One of the best movies of the year! Laughed so much my face was sore. If you like Family Guy, you will love this movie.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I was a huge fan of the Alien movies, and had high expectations for Prometheus.  Character development was weak, and the plot jumped around inexplicably.  This film had little redeeming value and I regret that i'll never get back the time spent watching this move.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|Love (LOVE!) this movie! If you say you don't love Babe then you're just lying to yourself. Great movie at any age!
0553801473|5.0|I read &#34;A Game of Thrones&#34; when it was first published in '98 and have waited diligently like a dog for his master for each installment in this series. If you have to ask, it's not for you. If you want to read this, start with book One, &#34;A Game of Thrones&#34;. HBO is good, the books are better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|In this book I felt love,wonder,and mystery.Suzanne Collins blew this book out the water.I felt that I was in the book.
B000W93CHC|5.0|It was just a great as The PILLARS of the Earth!!  I can't wait to read another book by ken follett!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great series! One of the best that ever came from HBO Studios. Very engaging and worthy of any awards given.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I have a kindle fire and parts of this game were very frustrating. I liked the storyline and graphics were good and quite funny sometimes, but there were times when you're trying to pick things up and put them where they go and you have to do it a million times. I even had to exit game and start whole chapter over just to complete some tasks. This game would be 5 stars if not for this trouble.
B0000640VO|5.0|One of my favorite films of all time. Shipped in a few days and I was pleased to have received it so quickly. The film was in great condition and it looked as if the box had only been opened a couple of times. Very pleased with this order.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|First book is great but after that it takes an act  congress to get to the other two books sync keeps taking you back to the last page of the first book each time you try to reopen to read further.......AARRRGGGHHH!!!!!
B001KZG99A|4.0|I think the Iron Man series are great, I can honestly say it does not gives me the same sort of fatigue I get from watching all the Spider-man movies or the like. Robert Downey Jr is masterful and entertaining as Tony Stark.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Great story. Lots of turns and surprises. Way too much detail. Too many characters. Too many plots at once. Difficult to follow.
B008N1V11U|4.0|my son likes the game it has good graphics for a 99cent game. good play action good it was a great buy.
B0031RDUX8|5.0|I bought this book for some light reading at a time when I wanted to find a distraction from some events in my reality.  I was immediately captivated by Scott's writing style and his story-telling ability.  I really enjoyed the interweaving of historical fact throughout his story.  I enjoyed it so much that I read it almost in one sitting and then followed it up with the remaining 5 books in the series - I read all of them within 2.5 weeks.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's a great game to pass the time. My husband and son have it on their phones and are both addicted to the game. It starts out easy so you get the hang of what you need to do and the levels get increasingly more difficult.  Plenty of levels to keep interest.
B0031R5K8G|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  Once started, it was very hard to put down.  I particularly valued the experience of seeing the world through the eyes of a young man with a degree of autism.  The story is engaging in itself, but with this added insight into a different reality I feel that I gained immeasurably from reading this book.  I am now motivated to read more of Haddon's work.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Only 2 levels!  Disappointing!  My son finished it in an hour.  He is now waiting for  the update...  Just wish it had more content.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I'm sure Mr. Bubl&eacute; would give anything to have the track \\"Santa Buddy\\" removed from this CD. The amazing thing is that many executive heads must have been in a cloud giving this track the go ahead. It's just TOO quirky to enjoy and unfortunately breaks up this otherwise beautiful and diverse set of Christmas songs on this CD. (Santa Pal-ey? What the heck is that?) Despite my personal loathing of this track, the rest of the CD is excellent and I'm very glad that it's a part of my growing collection of Christmas music. Removing Santa Buddy and adding the severals tracks from his \\"Let it Snow\\" mini-CD from a few years ago creates the perfect Bubl&eacute; Christmas offering! I just love his \\"Grown-up Christmas List\\" which is featured in his other Christmas Cd and should easily have replaced \\"Santa Buddy\\" on this CD.  Enjoy!
B007THA4FI|2.0|OK. what is up with this book???  JK Rowling must have been surrounded by dementors when she wrote this.  It's like all the happiness was sucked out.  Reading this I felt like she will never be happy again.  She needs CHOCOLATE!!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|MIB 3 is totally silly.  But that's the point of course, and that's what makes this film charming, something that was lacking in the second in the series.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Will Smith's for quite a while, and I believe that he's in his element in very serious roles - I actually liked \\"Seven Pounds\\" more than most - but he's even more in his element when he's just goofing off.  And goofing off is what he does here, while still keeping some semblance of sanity.  Tommy Lee Jones is always really good of course, but dare I say it?  He's getting a little too old I think to play some of these parts.  But the good thing is:  Mr. Jones knows it himself and seems to even embrace it.  Hey, we're all getting older, after all, and he's just doing it with more class than most of us.<br /><br />And this is part of the reason, I believe, for some of the plot devices in this film.  I don't believe that I'm giving anything away when I say that Josh Brolin plays a younger version of Mr. Jones, and Mr. Brolin plays that part pitch perfect.  I thought that he was very good in \\"W\\" but he was really, really good in \\"No Country for Old Men.\\"  Well, he keeps up that tradition here with his mimicry of Mr. Jones.  I got quite a few laughs out of his performance, and I believe that you will as well.<br /><br />When it comes to thematic concerns - which aren't the reason for this film's existence, of course - it seems like the writer and director are trying to argue that it is quite possible that an infinite number of universes do exist.  Also, under some circumstances, it may be possible to \\"fudge\\" the current universe and coerce the outcome that you want, as long as you're willing to make some sacrifices.  It is nice when a movie does seem to have a good theme, as it helps hold the movie together for the audience.<br /><br />Yes, MIB is completely silly.  But I wouldn't have it any other way.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Can not stop watching. The acting is stellar, the story line grabs you and doesn't let go. I would recommend this to everyone, share the wealth.
