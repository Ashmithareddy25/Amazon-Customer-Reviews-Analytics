B00564TEQG|5|Shampoo is working as advertised!
B00CDWU25G|5|a must have
B0046AAVR2|5|If you are ordering the brush heads then chances are you already know how well the product works.  The brush heads arrived quickly and were exactly as described.
B003D7L7OU|5|I'd been using this brand for years and having an outdoor, physical type job demanded I use something extra strong. I never had an issue even after sweltering days in the sun. When my local grocery store and drug store stopped stocking it I had to try something else. By mid day on an average temperarure day, I was in rough shape ( phew !)<br />  Glad i found it available online, and i  bought a case. The simple things we count on really are missed when they disappear.
B002UEIIO4|2|I have very dry hair and this spray just seemed to make it frizzier and sticky. And I didn't use very much of it.
B00FTJTVUM|5|Awesome file that shapes nails quickly. Etched glass means it never wears out. You will get a point from the spouse.
B00QQKPIC8|5|Excellent quality soft and long!
B000X2XX68|5|Stayed at a hotel in Chicago where this mirror was in the bathroom. Retrieved the info off the back of it and ordered it. Was in the mail by the time I returned home.  Easy to mount and I can see to apply cosmetics now!
B00EAOUKSO|5|Great everyday color! Good coverage with 2 - 3 coats.
B000GCXVV2|5|Love this product. I use it when I'm going to crunch my hair curly, while wet and then blow dry.
B00EHN3NDW|5|Great shampoo for my thick processed hair. I have thick hair that is colored, going grey and does not have the Virginia humidity well. This shampoo is amazing and is the best i've ever tried. My hair is smooth, dries faster and I couldn't be happier.
B003VUZKAG|5|Similar to Nexxus Humectress.  A great conditioner. Would buy again. My hair tends to be dry, this might not work for people with oily hair.
B00PYFW05O|5|A good quality and Exellent Product.
B00028OSI0|5|Have had a severe acne problem for 15 years and have had numerous specialists (dermatologists, food allergists, etc) who can't fix the problem. On lots of expensive prescriptions, primarily topical that don't work that well. Randomly was given some this to try on a scratch that needed to heal and decided to apply it to acne areas. Can't believe what is happening to my skin. Will do follow-up research on this but for now I'm shopping for this product in bulk.
B0089Q1XU8|4|I thought this would give a more peachy color appearance to the lips, but it looks light pink on mine. Nonetheless, I like how it looks on me, and application is dummy proof. It doesn't last long, but it doesn't take much to reapply
B00IJ0R72M|5|Looked great and had plenty to share with other actors
B00JLPM8AK|5|Outstanding!
B004JTL2KA|5|I would recommend this product to anyone because of its unique texture and nature, it was well worth the price.
B004R7R82A|1|This product is a complete waste of money.  if you've used a wax pot before, don't expect this experience to be anything like what you've done before.   the wax takes about 45 minutes to heat enough to even get the applicator stick into it.  once you can mix the wax, it never heats to a consistency that spreads easily- it is exceedingly stringy and difficult to manipulate.  when you get it onto your skin you have to pick the exact perfect time to remove it- otherwise it simply cracks off, or continues to spread without finding purchase.  overall it is a giant waste of money and you're better off spending the extra cash to get a real wax pot.
B0052JN7XG|5|Love it!<br />Great job. Don't always make the complete 2 minute mark though.
B007OT1YOQ|5|Just what I wanted. My scalp is sensitive but these don't seem sharp or cause any discomfort. They're perfect.
B007UMQ410|5|It is very relaxing and refreshing! Easy to use I wish they had smaller rollers for the eyes or lips.
B00GJAT4RK|4|I like all the heat/power settings and the concentrator attachment, although it falls off easily. I think it was a good buy.
B001DBBC84|4|I am very happy with my purchase. This is my second time buying it. This shaver may not be the best out there, but I find that it works great for me. I feel like it makes my legs pretty smooth. And it's so simple to charge that it's no big deal to use it every day. Takes me a few minutes doing it dry. The price can't be beat. The first one lasted about a year, and I have the second about 3/4 of a year. We'll see how long it lasts. It's still cheaper than buying a super expensive one which may last long and may not. If I have to buy one once a year it's not too bad. I don't like to spend money so for me this is great, because all the other shavers were too much for me.
B000R87B1Q|5|This is useful for my hot curlers... Thought i lost 2 clips... But not. The box was nice.... Like the clips.
B0015TH2VK|5|I use this product to manage 'incontinence'. It has given me a new lease on life. It is well made and durable. Excellent product. Continue to carry it in your inventory. Thks.
B00CNTJHQO|4|Recent Keratin treatment on my hair left me with the challenge of finding a good dandruff shampoo for my treated hair that is also sulfate free. I didn't want to damage my now- and newly- fantastic hair, but the flakes were driving me nuts and the provided keratin shampoo did nothing to alleviate my constant need to claw at my scalp. This sage shampoo is the first alternate one I have tried and I am happy to report a huge reduction in the flakes after 3 washes. I wash twice weekly, so it's been a week and a half. My head is still itching, but it is far less intense. If it had ridded me of that irritant as well as the flakes, then it would have garnered a 5 star review.
B001ET7M02|5|this stuff is a miracle!! 82 yrs old and the bags are gone.  Love it.  Husband, Hardin, doesn't even know I use it.<br />Sometimes, they do not have to know everything, especially mine as he says &#34;grow old gracefully&#34;....yeah right, but<br />enough is enough and if feel better about yourself, then do it.  Great product. Hopefully we can keep ordering it and they do not go out of biz.
B002TPQPEE|3|I received the three BH eye shadow pallettes. I'd ordered 1st, 2nd and 3rd edition pallettes and I was more than excited to be receiving them and as I opened the 1st one I saw that I'd had 3 broken eyeshadows on top and on the bottom I had 4 broken the second box I began praying that it would be better to find the same on top and on the bottom and at this point I was just eager to open the last one and found that the condition of that one was no better I was furious because my decision on ordering these was not easily decided upon but never the less the colors were soooooo beautiful so that made me all the more uppset. Anyway I did get things put through to return the items. If I had received the make up in tact I would surely give it  a  5 but since it was all broken up I give it a 3 the packaging gets a 2 for effort but after the bubble wrap in the product box being wrapped all nice they had just put in a brown package box and sent off. I am going to try this thing again though and I hope all my make up is in tact with not one thing broken.
B000PE6C4O|5|Great product. I have large pores and this makes them look nearly invisible. Home run.
B0045H1K3A|4|does the job and is light but solid - good quality
B004M1BO3U|5|These are the best electric tooth brushes that there are. We bought 4 to give as gifts because we like how they clean our teeth.
B003O4E3DY|5|The cream does what it says, its heavy and dense but does a great job at repairing cuticles! My mother took my copy as she loved it too!
B006ELSRTA|5|lasts a long time. great product
B00AYGUNR0|4|love this lotion I knew the first time I smelt it that it was good and would definitely buy it again I would recommend this product
B000UZ0OQA|4|good tooth paste, dont like this flavor.
B003LW4LJK|5|This razor by Edwin-Jagger met all my needs and performs flawlessly during wetshaving. The 3-piece head design works well for me with several different blade types. Although the three piece design of this razor can lead to errors when replacing blades, if care is taken to assemble it correctly, there should be no problem. I have not used the Derby blades included with this product, but if you care to try them, make sure you try different brands of blades if the Derbys perform poorly to find what works for you. The handle on this model is smooth, &#34;faux ebony&#34; that looks very sharp but is perhaps not as secure as the chrome, lined handle featured on the EJ DE89 for some, but I have found it to be secure in the hand under normal conditions. Overall, a great razor with mild/moderate aggressiveness, great looks and feels solid in the hand.
B00428DLCK|5|OMG!!! This cleansing gel is AMAZING. I got a facial at Skin Spirit in Palo Alto, Ca and she used this product on me and I just feel in love with it. I wouldn't use anything else ever again on my face. I never break out anymore and my face really does feel extremely clean after I use these.
B004OT29MA|5|love it waterproof is the best. I WOULD ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN
B004ZEQYQG|5|Beautiful! Blends well with my natural lip color for a cool toned mauvey/purple look. This is actually my second tube of this color because I was able to completely finish my first (rare that I EVER finish a lip product).
B00B9FV68U|4|This is a nice size of makeup bag. I just wish it has some type of organization to it. It is open which allows your makeup to freely move around the case. It is lightly padded so the makeup has more of a chance of being broken. The pattern is just as pictured and am very pleased with it. If you were to tack some elastic randomly through it, it would make all the difference in the world. Would purchase again.
B003LBYQV4|5|I am a dark skinned Hispanic male in my late 20s that has been trying different deodorants for years and this was the only one that seemed to work for me. Others would smell good at first, and then a couple hours later, I smell like someone's chopping onions under my pits lol. Never got that with this product. I have that fresh and clean smell and feeling all day. I think I've even went 2 days without re-applying and it was still going strong. Definitely recommend this product. &#34;All Day Clean&#34; is the perfect name for it.
B00BZXNE18|5|I bought this product for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. She saw the commercial on tv and it is definitely a lot cheaper on amazon. Good value for good price.
B00CSFUBRW|5|I really love these little hand sanitzers because they come in handy at work and are great to keep in the car, your pocket, or purse. Though I personally bought this product as a Christmas gift, I wouldn't mind ordering some for myself. The scents are amazing, price was great and the time it took to get here was incredible!<br />I have nothing bad to say at all!<br /><br />--Danielle
B005ESAU2Q|5|Arrived on time.  Comparable to Gelish. Good product.
B0014CC5O2|5|Ordered the product and received it in the next three or four days. Will do business with them again! I rarely got something that fast!
B001CPY74W|5|This is the best perfum Fendi made. I wish I could find it in the stores. It is expense but worth it.
B00LBVYCGA|5|good beginner tattoo kit for the price under $30 with shipping  would recommend
B00949Y7L6|2|While the price was right, the product did not have lasting qualities.  The product did what it was made to do in an OK manner but had no lasting qualities.
B00C6NH8L8|5|Loved it
B000052YJY|5|I so glad I can still find this product online. I had been using this product for 10 years to prevent breakouts and my skin was very clear during that time. Last year my local drugstore stopped selling Clear Pore Treatment, and I started to breakout around the chin and mouth area. I don't think it's a concidence. I'm hoping Neutrogena isn't discontinuing the product because it has been the reason why I had clear skin the whole time I used it.
B00HQ2RB34|1|Cant be just me? The oil stings/burns your eyes which no shaving oil has done to date... looks like one of these  two ingredients to my untrained eye...... &#34;Spearmint Essential Oil (mentha spicata) Organic Peppermint Essential Oil&#34;?  ...why would you enjoy anything on your face while shaving that irritates your eyes so why others love and it bothers mine is confusing...
B003F6VKKU|5|I love this hairspray!  I can't find it in any stores and I need it for my hair.  It is the only kind that holds my style in place and it is not sticky at all.  Where can I find any more?  Why on earth can I not find it in Idaho Falls, Idaho?
B00BBP62HS|5|It is great quality and an incredible price! I use a lot of Estée Lauder products and was excited I found this on Amazon. The bronzed and colors are perfect. Very satisfied!
B000K7E7Y8|5|Always good smell, need just a little for each use. Lasts long, and worth the few extra $$.
B00QRQGLSG|5|I really love this polish. It is clear when warm, pink when cold.  I have ordered other color changing polish from different makes and they have not changed.  Great product, Thank you!
B00GEG0FRM|5|I received a review sample of this serum and I used it for my chin and forehead, where I keep breaking out, for some unknown reason. Diets and other things didn't work, and I was constantly looking for a solution.<br /><br />I didn't expect to see fast improvements, but the serum really works great. The salicylic acid is something I always responded to, not like benzoyl peroxide, which doesn't have any effect on my skin.<br /><br />I followed the instructions on how to use the gel peel serum, and after 1 month of using it, I don't have any pimples on my chin or forehead anymore, my skin looks great, and I am not breaking out anymore. (probably because I am still using it).<br /><br />Great product, I am really happy with the results.
B00D14HW2G|5|love this product, have used for years, take on vacation helps with the tanning I don't seem to burn as easily. I am a bit olive tone so that helps too. but seems to work and will buy again.
B0046753EG|5|Stays on as promised. Color stays pure all day. Less drying than some of the other long wearing lipsticks.
B00G0OLZ4U|3|ehhhh, its the darkest color available but its not dark enough...goes on like a reddish-brown.
B005XIDZHO|2|Pros:<br />Works for thick hair<br /><br />Cons:<br />Does not work on fine or short hair.<br />Ends came off first time using it.<br />Not for precise use<br /><br />I was looking around for this after a friend said to get one and was very happy to get such a good deal. I have to say, you get exactly what you pay for.<br />The first time I went to use it the two pink ends came right off. They are not glued on or secured in any way. They pop back on but it makes using the product very difficult.<br />As I started using it I noticed it doesn't work on most of the hair I try to remove. If the hair is thin or recently plucked/shaved the spring won't latch on. The only hair I could get it to pull out was leg hair that had grown out for over a week.<br />I did not get the product for this, but you should note that you should not get this if you are expecting to to fine plucking of eyebrows.<br />Very disappointed.
B000GLRREU|5|Works as described, I was afraid it wouldn't have enough pressure but I don't think you would want it on it's highest power, not in your mouth anyway unless for some reason you get paint on your teeth, I know, unlikely. LOL<br />Quality product, many extra tips for various uses.
B002HWS7RM|5|It is good for hair conditioning!
B008RODQFM|5|It works great!  The mist coming out from the top is mesmerizing.
B004YOS2JO|2|I bought two of these headbands and, unfortunately they arrived crinkled and twisted.  But I had no choice but to give them as gifts to my friends and I don't know what they thought that the bands were not straight and smooth.
B0052JMME6|4|I thought these would be larger, but they are more of a medium than a large.  The person who received the gift appreciated them though.
B004INEX2Q|1|Was watered down to half it's normal consistacy!!!
B004INIVS8|4|My hair is fine and stands straight up , and I wear it very short , so I need something to really hold it down - this stuff does the trick .
B0006MVS2Q|5|I bought this perfume several years ago.  It is my signature winter fragrance.  I love to wear it in cold weather!      The scent is warm and bright.  Not at all overwhelming.  It settles into my skin very nicely.  I'm very picky about my fragrances and can't stand to have most smells on me all day, especially warm ones, but I just love this one.  It's subtle, but people definitely notice it (especially when they give me a hug) and compliment me on it.  My husband (who hates heavy perfumes) always tells me I smell wonderful when I wear this.    I don't have a spray.  I just dab on my wrists and behind my ears.  My 3.3 oz is lasting me years.
B001VFL89U|5|I'm surprised that no one has reviewed this because it's a fantastic product.  My hair is shoulder length, thick, sometimes frizzy and many times fly-away.  After I blow-dry my hair, I just take a dime's worth of this creme and run it through my hair and it gives my hair great body and shine.  I even keep another tube at the office.  Highly recommended!!
B0025YUZ4U|5|Just as described
B0096EN2D8|5|This Scrub Fresh refillable container is perfect. The pump locks wonderfully and it doesn't spill. The perfect add on to your CND collection.
B00ESBHNRU|5|Its adjustable which I didn't see mentioned in the product description. The colors are great, Its soft and so much nicer than other synthetic wigs I've owned and worn. It looked very natural on, I wished the hair was a bit shorter but that's easily fixed.
B003521CA2|2|PROS: I bought this blow dryer because I needed one with both a flat and diffuser attachment. I liked that it could fold for travel, and that it was branded as 'salon professional'. It feels like a high quality product. The attachments are sturdy when they clip on and the blow dryer itself has a nice weight to it.<br /><br />CONS: This blow dryer mimics the effects of riding a motor cycle on a highway on a spring day without a helmet. It blows way too hard, with very little heat, and will leave your hair in tangles. I have very long, very thick hair. Although I brush while blow drying, I had to completely stop and (painfully) brush out every minute or two. Not worth it. With all the extra work, it took me twice as long to dry my hair and I ended up with a tangled, frizzy, puffy look.<br /><br />If you have short hair, this product might work well for you. If you have long hair, STAY AWAY!
B0012JJMPW|5|Delivery time was excellent I've use my Oster 00000 and the performance is excellent as well, Oster gets a 5 star rating from me!
B000UPMGNE|5|I have used this product for years and can say it is my favorite hair gel.  I highly recommend it.  It is firm but dries so you can brush thru it.  Very happy with it.
B0046AAVR2|5|Love it because it forces me to brush correctly.  It doesn't take up much space and is easy to use.
B005C2NAO4|5|:)
B00112FLFK|2|I got this as one of my first foundations.<br /><br />Positive:<br />-It's cheap.<br /><br />Negative:<br />-It's not good for dry skin; even after moisturizing and using primer, it seems to dry out my skin and settle into and emphasize any little crack and flake it can find.<br />-It's not good if you have very pale/freckled skin.  I got the very lightest I could find (porcelain; W1) and it makes my skin look too dark and sallow.
B002PQ8BQM|1|Not natural though came up when I searched for natural antiperspirants.  Also no mention of Aluminum content which is what I was specifically desired avoiding.  Returned!
B009AINX7K|3|Good, and hot too
B00AFITFGC|5|I LOVE this! It's got excellent moisture and protein in it and makes my hair incredibly soft when used with the Oyin Honeywash!
B004KAVHG2|4|It leaves my hair shiny and soft. Also, I won't straighten without it. I have been using this product for about a year now. I don't feel the need to replace it with anything else...
B0028FNP5C|5|This natural product works better than other deodorants and anti-antiperspirants I've tried.  The fragrance is also light and pleasing.  Well satisfied.
B004I7JLII|5|Gives you good hold throughout the day without any wet look.  Only takes a little to work with shorter hair and lasts forever.
B004GWEG76|3|i love the scent, i love how it is natural.  i wish it was better at deodorizing, however. it just didn't work for me.
B001E5EAUQ|5|Product is exact as described. Seller was fast and efficient with good packaging. It's a shame Clairol has discontinued this product. The substitute product is not nearly close in quality.
B00AN9CHY0|3|I really feel this product does not help with dark spots
B00028M3N2|5|Perfect to use for so many different things!  There is no euro dropper or anything, however, there is a little plastic piece that gets stuck inside the cap.  I read in another review to use a butter knife to get it out and put it on as a dropper, but mine will not work.  I got it out, but there is not way to get it to attach to the mouth of the bottle.  It just sits there.  Very, very annoyed by this as I have to use a piece of straw to get some out of the bottle and wash that each time.
B00RKHTMVY|5|fine powder. good for shampoo
B00H599BHC|5|Very dark, be careful when applying it. It's best to initially dab your brush in and then smudge it on the inside of the cap and apply from that. Go VERY light and build up. Try to keep the ends of your eyebrow the darkest and don't 'square' your eyebrows, blend it with the tip of you brush and gradient the color.<br /><br />Lasts throughout the day, so impressed. :)
B00CD1QU80|5|My old shaver is a Norelco model 5625x, about 15 years old.  It would no longer hold a charge.  I ordered this new model 6948XL as a replacement, hoping that it would serve as well as my old one.<br /><br />It turns out that 6948XL is much improved.<br /><br />It's less expensive, quieter, gentler, faster, and closer than my old shaver.  So quiet that at first I thought it wasn't working.  No need to press against skin and get a bit of a rash.  I can't see stubble that well, but surprisingly soon I can feel with my other hand that I'm finished.  All my life I've kept a Gillette razor for when I wanted a really close shave.  Bye-bye Gillette!<br /><br />I have one suggestion for improvement.  This shaver still has that got-ya for when you clean the heads and their housings.  Don't mix them up because odds are 6 to 1 against pairing them as they were.  And yes, sooner or later I will drop them all in the sink.  Worldwide, I'll bet that happens at least a million times a year.<br /><br />I marked one pair with a black Sharpie, another pair with a dab of red nail polish, and no mark on the third pair.  My suggestion is that Norelco color code the heads and housings when they put them together at the factory.
B000NGH3X8|3|I'm always on the lookout for new ways to dry my nail fast.  I'm not sure if this really works though.  I may make my nails dry to the touch in 2-3 minutes but that's normal with or without this spray.  And they don't really make them so hard that they are smudge or nic-proof so not sure if this is worth it...
B00BM1WLQM|2|i feel like this wasnt the real thing. It was dark and crust -_- and applies horribly
B00RPYALSK|5|Great looking watch and it runs great! Very surprised at the cheap cost for the nice workmanship of more expensive watches! Kind of looks like a Citizen Choronograph!
B000F77VSW|1|I bought this two years or so ago and you can see the metal where the roller heats up. It is wearing away and this should not happen so soon. Would not buy another one.
B00RBVVKNM|5|Deffinately worth more than the pirce they are selling it! Great deal!
B009RWVLYG|1|I have short, dark brown hair. I got the Crimson Obsession kit because I wanted a fairly dark color. This product was awful! It did not bleach/color evenly (varied from no difference from my regular hair color to orange to bright red). I left the bleach and color in for the indicated amount of time based on my hair color/type. I ended up shelling out a lot of money to fix the flaming red and orange mess it made of my hair. The hairdresser was impressed with the disaster this product caused. Never again!
B0010EPQ36|5|J. R. WATKINS HAND CREAM IS MY FAVORITE AND THE CREME POUR LE MAINS WITH SHEA BUTTER IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SCENT.  i SMELL LIKE LEMON CUSTARD ALL DAY LONG.
B0081IB32W|1|stinks! smells old..very strong sour odor, cannot wear it...in a small bottle with name TAPED on it! Where did it come from???
B001AVNE9C|5|Super great, top and bottom coat all in one.  Highly recommend
B004RBZ9R2|3|Definitely more medicinal than an every day lotion.  Good to have in the medicine cabinet.  I don't know that I've experienced all the amazing healing properties expressed by others, nonetheless it has been good for more challenging skin conditions my kids might have like eczema, etc.
B00G8OQODY|4|After using the whole bottle I decided to review and give honest opinion. It states it minimizes dark spots. It did exactly what it was suppose to do. I enjoyed this product and would recommend.
B001RVFUMY|5|Great product! Smells wonderful and results are noticeable fairly quickly. My mom uses it on her fragile skin and it is super helpful to minimize the purple bruising she gets
B000BCXY32|1|I can't tell any difference since I have started using this product about 1 month ago.
B00EWUFETQ|5|haughtily it's cool in the future will have to deal with you
B00GOM1YD0|5|Got this as a gift and love it. Good, deep cleaning
B00C76QO5A|5|If you watch this item the price fluctuates.  I bought my bottles at a little under $4.  Which - is an AWESOME deal compared to bottles at $10 and $20.  I love the makeup also.
B000K8FUFM|5|Great product that other company are charging double or triple for. Doesn't irritate skin and isn't synthetic.
B0026J10CU|5|I Love It! The Colors Are So Pretty! I Recommend It
B00I4ZTDPQ|5|extremely pleased with product and service from seller
B00GGBLQQO|5|I love it purple stuff just like the nail shops!
B003YJAZZ4|4|I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday because his old shaver was terrible, leaving random patches of hair all over his chin. Since he's started using this, I've seen a dramatic decrease in stray hairs and he's had much smoother skin south of his nose. Pretty good stuff!
B008PEMOV6|5|This is the best of all brands.  i was really surprised with the power.  It really cleaned my teeth and i recommend this to anyone.
B00BBA4LZI|5|I used this primer along with Urban Decay All Nighter Makeup Setting Spray for my wedding on a 90 degree hot outdoor September day. My makeup lasted for hours without any need to touch up. There's no flashback in photos (I also used Makeup Forever Mat Velvet foundation). Amazing product.<br /><br />Now I wear this primer everyday on top of moisturizer and press some translucent powder on--my face doesn't get oily at the end of the day. I highly recommend this primer.
B0011NR3EQ|5|love this face wash. it works great, and even removes my make-up.
B00ITFNU5U|5|I love the color and the texture of the straightener. I had one that I had bought at the mall for $100, but this one leaves my hair more smooth and shiny. Try it your gonna love it!
B0011DMOK4|3|I love Befine. Something about this seller was off.
B0014X712W|5|Very excellent fragrance, I do get a lot of compliment whenever I wear this item
B00HF8TAP6|5|How did I ever do my eyebrows without this?  Perfect color, easy to apply, stays on forever!  Waterproof, comes off easily with makeup remover.  Natural looking.
B003SZ4C1W|5|Works wonderful! Used to have this same one 15 years ago. Glad I found it again. Just remember to rinse it a few times while you are using it, and when you are done.
B000W405SG|5|Used it a few times already. For nose and ear hair trimming it is great. The eyebrow combs are a little harder to use.
B00025X9KQ|5|I've been ordering this same Clinique Blush for over 20 years. Need I say more?
B0006NZ2G8|5|I love these sponges.  I use them in my shower and bath.  They are gentle but yet exfoliating.
B00008BFXK|5|I am one of those unusual people who have a film that forms over my teeth after only a few hours, the positive part is that the film itself helps reduce the potential for tartar but I hate the way it makes my mouth feel. When I first got this toothbrush it was a bit much for me.  I had not used an electric toothbrush before, but my husband's dentist and my dentist both recommended it. The first day using it I noticed that the film that usually formed on my teeth wasn't as heavy.  The more I used the toothbrush the less film formed and the longer it took to form.  Also, after using the toothbrush for a couple weeks the sensitivity wore off.  My check-ups were always good, and my cleanings were never difficult, but I never imagined that it could be as easy as it is now!
B0077CNO1G|5|I can see visible changes in skin such as the puffiness under my eyes has disappeared with continuous use. Yes Im happy with this device.
B003H248QK|1|Gross tasting, threw them out.  Tasted nasty, buy a small amount to try first.  Will not recommend to my patients.
B00GTC1HG4|5|I love using this product leave my face soft and smooth
B000GCSCSE|5|I have been using Lilac Vegetal as an after shave since 1970, and I use to condition my skin and not as a fragrance.  I discovered this in my small town barbershop as a kid, and I loved the way that barbershop smelled as I sat flipping through the pages of Field and Stream  magazine waiting for my turn in the chair. The I discovered I could buy this product in stores and we have been companions ever since. This product is a skin conditioner first and a fragrance as an afterthought. Some products are primarily alcohol as a conditioner and this product definitely has alcohol in it. I love the alcohol burn on my face directly after a shave. But that is not the main reason I love Lilac Vegetal.  The main reason is that it conditions my skin, leaving a pleasant smooth finish after a close shave. My skin never gets dry or chapped or tender.  I use soap and brush for lather and a safety razor.  Men waste a bundle buying today's shaving products and I bet I get a closer shave then they do and save $100 plus a year (you can buy a couple of years worth of quality blades on ebay for $15). Aroma is secondary to my after shave needs and most reviews I have seen focus on scent which is like selecting a car because of it's paint job. As to the aroma, I find it bracing out of the bottle and mellowing to a subtle  hint of lilac by the time I am at my desk in the morning. It is so subtle that I don't think anyone besides me picks up the sent, and if they do, they never say anything.  What I really love is that, late in the day, I can rub my cheeks with my hands and my hands and pick up a subtle fragrance of the outdoors on a spring day.  I wear this to please myself and it has done a fine job of conditioning my face after a shave for 40 plus years. Except during deer season as I go entirely scentless from October through December.  So stop worrying about how you smell and start taking care of your skin.
B00328RLMM|5|It was gift for my mom, she loved it wearing it every day will buy more very soon for her and I will get one for me also
B001OXTHJC|5|They are very outstanding razor blades, they provide a nice clean smooth shave and the price is just right, again thank you.
B000YJ2SLG|5|I have had chronic eczema since childhood, and it is terrible over the summer months. I have tried everything over my 32 years to control the itch - from cold tar to aveeno baths to lachydrin to cortisone to Neem oil and more.  I've met with several dermatologists, internal medicine doctors and allergists, and even tried consulting with experts in Ayurvedic medicine. Nothing has helped.  I have been so desperate this summer due to increased allergens that I resorted to using numbing cream to stop the itch.<br />So I just had a terrible eczema outbreak - all over my legs, arms, hands, feet, chest and back (so basically my whole body) and went to an internal medicine doctor.  She recommended this lotion in combination with 2.5% hydrocortisone cream.  A lotion has never helped, and although I didn't believe it would this time I had to try it out of sheer desperation. My eczema went away after the third day and my skin is softer than it has ever been. I can't believe it. To be fair, I did use the hydrocortisone cream on some areas, but because that has never fully worked before I can't credit it with the remarkable turnaround that my skin has made - I only used it on concentrated patches. If you have chronically dry skin please give this a try.
B004RWZ1RE|5|It was time to order some new blades, I've used about 300 7 AMs, and several different (overpriced) drugstore offerings of no particular label.  I saw a review for Shark, and noticed how someone stated they glided quite nicely and were sharper than most.  I was intrigued, and found these cheaper than the brand I expected to order.  I tried them out, and did find them to be quite prone to gliding all over and cutting very nicely.  But the very telling aspect was after the shave was completed and I applied my Bay Rum; there was a markedly decreased stinging in the application.  I deduced that these blades did, in fact, cut quite more uniformly and smoothly due to the lack of skin irritation and abrasions that would be susceptible to my aftershave.
B001BOLVIE|5|I received this in a prompt manner and I am very satisfied with this product. They were wrapped very securely to insure not to break during the shipment. I will be a repeat customer.
B00ITI4PJM|5|Color is very good-looking, also a bargain price, love it
B0056C8O7S|5|Excellent
B00EOB000Q|5|I've been looking for an all-natural deodorant that actually works as stated and I'm happy to say that I finally found one! I'm trying to detox from all the harsh chemicals that are in most everything we use today so this was a great alternative. Very happy I found this and will be buying the larger size next time.
B00ABF2BW4|3|This smells &#34;like Love's Baby Soft,&#34; but it is not really the same scent.  Very close and would remind you of the original, but it's either missing something or they added something. The lotion is horrible.  It smells bad.  I don't even get to &#34;doesn't smell like Love's Baby Soft&#34; (it doesn't, by the way, because it just smells bad.  I loved this stuff growing up. So much so that I kept about 1/8 teaspoon of the powder I got in a set for years.  One day it somehow got wet and I was just crushed. LOL  This makes a decent on the go air freshener, though.  Seriously! :D
B001E0VWOS|5|Excellent product. Fast delivery from amazons.com. I am very pleased with product, price , and fast delivery to my home.
B00005333J|4|Good product , i Nike it very much
B000JF2ELO|5|All the products of Victorie-Inc are just beautiful. Professionally designed and superb product integrity. Scripture based details enhances the heart to know the love in each application. Beautifully packaged and shipped in reasonable request time.
B005TI7L7I|5|Good
B0018A32XS|5|My wife love it.  It does a really good job without pushing very hard.
B004FFEARA|5|I've been using this cleanser for years and my skin has never been better. It was suggested to me after I was complaining about my skin not being clear. I was in my mid 20s & was still breaking out a lot. This cleanser has glycolic acid, which is an exfoliant but it's not abrasive like other exfoliants. The wash is smooth. I use this face wash and always follow it up with an oil free moisturizer. It works great!
B0016LZUW0|5|great product.
B00VMYKCL0|5|Refreshing and strips all dirt from my skin.
B000OLAIMA|5|I order this all the time - much better price than I can find in our local health food store. I personally love the Anise flavor (even though I am not generally a fan of licorice) - it's just so refreshing. The service from the vendor was prompt, and the packaging was secure as well. Thank you!
B005356O34|2|I bought this product directly from my stylist. It worked wonderfully to smooth my edges. But beware!!! After continued usage, it turned my hair into straw! The hair on my edges and nape are now completely unmanageable. A touch-up won't tame it. I need to SHAVE my hair for new growth. I strongly recommend using an oil-based hair gel.
B005DKKBUG|4|A great buy for my dad. Panasonic has offered good, if not one of the best, electric shavers. ES-LT71 certainly is worth buying
B00684F6JW|5|Overpriced, but the best brush I've ever owned. By using it, the brush will separates your hair in a way that your hair seems thicker, and it will dry much quicker because your hair is not clumping together. I barked at the price, but you only need to purchase it once, and it will be the best brush you can have forever.
B008DWDW8Y|5|Usually my hands are dry and cracked this time of year.  Since I have been usung this product my hands are soft and free of cracks.
B0013N483I|5|Why did they discontinue this product? Great waterproof mascara is hard to find, and this was a terrific one. The comb was fabulous, and it truly did make for impactful lashes. This is the only place I could find it....Hassle free transaction, quickly shipped!
B003CP12O8|5|I gave  a bottle to my Mom and she loves it! I like how fresh it leaves my mouth. Clean and fresh and alcohol free!
B00CB6BIYS|4|I just started using this magnesium lotion.  I already use magnesium oil spray and I can tell the difference whenever I use it on my aches and pains on my legs.  I would recommend this
B00J4WHYQ8|5|nice product
B0019ZCX46|5|This is a great brush for women's hair at a great price! I realize that it is designed for men, but I love the way it feels on my mid-length tresses. It massages the scalp beautiful and smooths flyaways. I will definetly order more of these brushes for my children!
B0009XH6OG|5|Excellent kit at a great price. Closest shave in comparison to a razor.It obviously gets a little bit hot after using it for a while but besides that you can definitely expect a lot from this product.
B00D5YSTUQ|5|We have scorpions where we live and I have a 2 year old granddaughter.  I have to have these just in case.  They also work great when she steps in a fire ant pile!  They work very quickly.  Don't know why you can't buy them in a store.
B009WIAH8Q|1|a) it does not smell like a fragrance, b) it lasts 2 minutes. Do not recommend. Might as well spend a little bit more, and buy a fragrance that that is worth calling a fragrance.
B003WR3QSG|5|Every thing they said it was
B000VDAFCY|1|I wish I could say that I have wasted my money on worst things but I havent. I thought I was paying for a review for the state board written. What I recieved I could of downloaded off nyc.gov. As a matter of fact when I studied state board in school my teacher gave us a copy of the requirement for state board practical! Im so angry!
B001I3YWVQ|5|I love the scent of this soap, and the fact that it's a foam means that there is very little waste or mess, unlike liquid soaps that drip and ooze. Most aesthetically pleasing antibacterial soap I've ever seen. Love it!
B00BD3SD98|5|The gel works amazing! I had a lot of acne on my face but it's going away. Love this product!
B00BE6NPZ6|3|Not at all what I expected.... It has sand all in it... so basically sand gets all over everything... I was disappointed to see that. But the product does work.... it just gets sand all over everything.
B00ED3EIT4|5|fast sipment and the price was affordable
B0019V5ZRC|4|I decided to try to use this product to wax my legs and it went less than well.  For touchups it is amazing, but the surface area of legs just make this product a joke.  Even spreading a very thin layer it wouldn't cover all of them.  So, if you make your own sugar scrub at home and store it in this jar it'll probably work well, but otherwise it's not worth the cost.<br /><br />Also, the hair grows back within three weeks.  Nicer than shaving, but not worth the cost.  But, for touchups an small areas, like armpits, it is amazing.
B00CE2JC9W|5|I've only used it three times and already see an improvement in my skin texture. The most visible acne scars are still there but there has been a change for the better with the enlarged pores. I'm not where I want to be yet. I've been rolling \\"gently\\" ( have not sern blood yet or felt unbearable pain). I rather go slowly and see gradual results.
B00PV7BS44|5|Quality!
B000CEFTIM|5|I picked up this cleanser at an Origins in NYC...  guess Origins has to sell other brands now since theirs isn't getting any better. I am always in search of great quality, simple, natural skincare. This cleanser smells so amazing. Its thin and liquidy and only foams a little which is a good thing. Do yourself a favor and visit the Farmaesthetics website. They educate you and reveal all ingredients. Remember that a cleanser just needs to clean, everything else just goes down the drain. Lavender is antibacterial and soothing, while geranium is astringent, anti-inflammatory and mildy anti-bacterial, as well as balancing and calming. This is gentle and delicious.
B007SNGSFS|5|Pricey but they work perfectly with the shaver I have.  No complaints as they are easy to swap out and last a reasonable amount of time.
B000O9O4YU|1|I bought this and thought I would try it, doesnt really have a scent to it and I didnt notice any change or effect  while or after I was using it. You can tell its there but thats about it, if you have super sensitive skin or just want to blow a few bucks then go for it. i wont be buying it again.
B00K2O3NV2|5|This serum is amazing! It makes my skin feel tighter and smoother. It doesn't leave your skin greasy, just soft. I have oily skin so it's important that face products don't leave any residue. It's great quality!
B000NW4I7G|3|I ordered this product because I had a large bottle not roll on and assumed it would smells as lovely.  It smessled like cherries, its ok it I was at a beach.  I live in Alaska and the cherry scent wasn't really working.  Will give to my niece who lives in California.  I have had other scents from Auric Blends but, this one was not a hit.
B0067F28ZW|5|love the brushes. All around great product.
B001A3HPT0|2|I've had this kit for about 3 months and the bursh has fallen apart.  I picked this kit up to replace an older brush I had.  The older brush lasted for about 5 years.  I suppose the money is worth the bowl and soap itself, but I would suggest buying a better brush.
B00B503YK2|5|Works well with my short hair, gives it that hold without feeling like a rock
B000R830IE|2|You can't use it next to your head or you will burn your scalp or ears with the heated bristles.  You can't grip the hair around the brush because the heated bristles will burn your hand.  I am returning it.
B00IN6H6TG|1|These don't work. I wouldn't buy again. Thank goodness they were cheap. Paint went under the sticker and ruined the manicure.
B0013G6M8O|5|This is really great cream.  I put it on at night only because I have oily skin and this cream is a bit thick.  My skin looks great when I wake up in the morning. I would recommend this.  You can't go wrong with Vitamin E.
B007ZN5ATQ|5|Bought this right after my insurance rates went up dramatically and had to drop my dental coverage. (I now floss every night and use  fluoride mouthwash too)  It is such a big improvement over regular toothbrushes. You can tell it cleans very well and you know how long to brush because it has an automatic timer. I recommend to everyone!
B006IFV1O0|5|This is the best product for dry and damaged hair!  It is truly a miracle!!  My hair is soft and shines so much!  I've gotten so many complements.  It just takes a little after washing your hair.  You leave it in while you shower then rinse.  It's so easy!
B0045HYPIM|3|I routinely use the tiny Goody mini clips (normally purchased at Target). I have long curly hair, and I use 3 or 4 of the tiny clips to strategically secure & position individual locks, not large sections of hair. I purchased the Scunci ones from Amazon, and while they are similar to the ones I normally use, they are about 20% bigger. As such, they don't hold my hair as well and also are more visible which I don't like.  Because these are a bigger size, the teeth don't actually secure the hair in the middle of the clip. In my case, with curly hair, the curls pull slightly loose because of this, and it looks messy.
B006UETRWC|5|I freakinnn loooove this color!! Extremely high quality, extremely goood price!!!! :0)
B000OV5QWC|5|A short list of the many ailments that this miracle soap has cured;<br /><br />Ringworm<br />Eczema<br />The flu<br />Impedigo<br />Explosive flatulence<br />Trench Foot<br />Smart Mouth<br />ADHD<br />Rectal/Cranial Inversion<br /><br />The ingredients list for Thieves' Soap reads like a sacred mantra of purity and holiness: Palm oil, Coconut oil, Olea Europea Fruit oil, Glycerin, Clove bud oil....somewhere in the same room, each batch of Thieves' Soap has been blessed by Incan priests and Dr. Oz by proxy. There is a legend that Thieves' Soap was originally formulated by Ancient Egyptian ninjas as a protection against the diuretic effects of drinking water from the Nile and to help ward off flea-infested water buffalo. Even today, carrying a sliver of Thieves' Soap in one's pocket is often an effective counter to ad homeniem attacks and testicular torsion.<br /><br />To increase your IQ, SAT test scores, and fertility, use Thieves' Soap daily in the shower. There are many more uses to this miracle cleansing agent, but need I go on? Your aura will thank you!
B009ARXCYU|4|i love all the colors it works for me! the price is okay anybody can afford to have this...even for collection must have!
B00II19J0K|4|***7Links (seller/maker) has held a contest, for this product and their Vitamin C, best reviews. Early reviews are biased as users want to win for best reviews. The company admitted this themselves on the phone.***    Product experience:  This makes my skin soft when you put it on but other than that I'm not really seeing the perceived effects on my skin, especially hyperpigmentation reduction or lightening. I still get acne. My skin still looks about the same, just feels nicer to touch.    I've had products that make your skin feel great but in actuality your skin isn't vastly improving, it's the product making it seem so. I think this is neutral to good (?) for the skin, but you won't get all the benefits it claims to have. However, because it has jojoba oil I noticed when I wear makeup my skin won't oil as fast since jojoba mimics skin's natural sebum. Upgrading to 4!    Note: My skin is oily, so it lacks water content therefore drying my skin. This does not make my face oily.
B001G7PU24|5|I love it.  It is so smooth when applying and makes my face feel so clean. I would definitely order it again.
B008JEJ2TO|5|This brush is very soft and it does not shed at all. It is on the smaller side, so you can either use it for targeted powder application or for blush. I find it perfect for blush. I like it!
B003FGK4GG|4|This is my second Hot Tools- 2 inch curling iron and although it is good, it is not as good as the prior one.  The pros are it heats fast, and has the large barrel which is hard to find.  The cons are the cord gets tangled quite a bit more than the earlier model and I find that this one tends to produce static in my hair.  I have used this one for 1 month now and the static is getting somewhat better so hopefully after some time that will cease to be an issue.  Overall it is a great buy -- good quality and good pricing.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a large iron.
B002W2JJB0|4|I still got a bit of redness when wearing this outdoors for several hours, even after re-applying.  However the redness wasn't too bad.  I have fair skin that burns easily.  What I DO like about this sunscreen is the consistency and non greasy factor.  It was better than the Bioderma SS in that regard.  It was definitely more cosmetically elegant when worn on the face than the Bioderma was.  This one is also a repeat buy.
B00B91S40W|3|didn't last so a waste of money for me I still have the new brushes in the drawer and no machine to use them on .Battery life was a joke. would not buy again .
B000RGRWS0|4|when the legs start cramping - just rub this on.  My husband has been taking quinine and magnesium pills, but this is instant relief.
B00OTZARM8|5|Does the trick. Like the loose mineral pearls.
B00JQ7SHLM|5|nice finish
B004WX9GZG|4|this product seems to work well and no harsh chemicals for parents of a young boy to be concerned about.
B00G284STS|3|the exfoliating glove is very thin, doesn't look and feel like it will last very long.
B007N7AAPS|1|Revlon works better than this and is way cheaper.
B000NLJFNY|1|It's not terrible. It didn't hurt my hair but it didn't really help it either. I've been using this product for about a month and I haven't seen any results besides the fact that it stripped my hair of its dye.
B00006IV4A|4|if you buy this remember to buy the 'C' battery for it.  also if you use it for too long it tends to smell like something burning , but it goes away if you just ignore it. you also have to claen it regularly(my sweater had a lot of lint ) and you might have to go over the same spot more than once. but other than that it works well. i am very happy with my purchase and have recomended it to others as well. the sweater came out 'like new' which is better than i could hope for. <br />i recommend this for a very nice quick fix to lint. <br />
B009R4735A|5|EXCELLENT tanning lotion! IF you like a tingle. If your not a tingle user stay away from this product. It's HOT! I LOVE tingle lotion son it's a favorite!
B009WUA658|3|The fingernail clippers are fine but the toenail clippers do not have enough &#34;oomph&#34; or power to cut through toenails easily.
B000OKTHFU|5|Simple purchase and delivery, everything went as expected and advertised.
B000H8DUHA|2|looks like it was used before. the lid has been taped shut the scotch tape. The price label was worn and old. I just hope the product still works.
B003FBI9LS|5|I LOVE the Bed Head Deep Waver. Before buying this I was using the Conair 3 barrel iron and it works nowhere near as good as this. It's huge and heavy to use. The Bed Head can be used with one hand. Lightweight. Covers a lot of hair at once. Takes me half the time to do my long thick hair. Very affordable and worth the price. I hesitated for a long time but wish I had tried this a long time ago.
B004YZMKLY|3|The other reviewers are right about the buttons being poorly placed. I like this iron because it does straighten the hair well..when you can get the temperature to remain constant. The buttons are on the thin strip along the top so it takes a while to learn to use this iron without constantly changing the temperature or even shutting it off completely. Once you get the hang of it the iron works well...but it takes some awkward hand positioning.<br /><br />My other issue is that there are no lights on this digital iron. I have bought cheaper irons that at least light up to let you know when they are ready!!!! Another thing is that the bottom of this iron is very curved so it tends to roll and fall over when placed on the counter. You have to really make sure that the 'legs' are not on the edge of your counter or the iron will fall over constantly.<br /><br />I do hear the slight buzzing that other reviewers mentioned and it is not loud enough to be alarming..it is just weird because none of my other irons ever did this.<br /><br />Generally an ok iron but it would not be my main one and I think I will purchase another Remington as that works better for me.
B00C2BHZD0|5|This brush has very small and thin bristles and glides right through my long curly hair, wet or dry.  My hairstylist recommended this, and sells them at her shop for $12.
B004H4VQ4Y|1|I received the &#34;Straightening Cream&#34;  The bottle is grey and the top is BLUE. I thought I'd give it a try but I'm tired of getting screwed over by Amazon retailers.
B002PIY2EU|5|Great stuff. It is organic, oil free and it feels great on my sensitive skin. Will continue to purchase!
B00LPBI2C6|5|Ordered for my daughter and she loved it!! great texture and design of this toothbrush and the cup looked pretty cool!! now my daughter is using it everyday with the cup and I think I'll buy one myself soon.
B010CENS48|5|I absolutely love essential oils. They smell great in a diffuser, and each one has a different, practical use. When I found the Lavandin Essential Oil from Plant Therapy Essential Oils, I knew I had to try it. It arrived very quickly, and I started to use it immediately. It works wonderfully for as an  expectorant making it ideal for congestion. Just a few drops in my diffuser and Voila! It is said to help boost self-esteem and confidence. This will definitely be a plus!  It can be mixed with a carrier oil (I use coconut oil) and used as a great aid in reducing scars and stretch marks. Overall, I love Plant Therapy. I have used many of their oils and I have never been disappointed! I am definitely a returning customer.<br />*I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B0042L29JI|5|Exactly what I wanted.  Can't buy them in the store anymore.
B00UT0AFFG|5|After i use for a week i can tell my eye lashes looks thicker and darker. I love the results!
B00CFFJMLG|5|Just as described.
B00427WJVK|3|Love this perfume, love the smell but it wasn't the right color. I think it went &#34;bad&#34; sitting in a warehouse, but still smells amazing!
B00IKADNAQ|1|I don't know if this is authentic Chaz dean.  I have used this product before but this one seems different. Heavier. Weighs my hair down.  Wish I hadn't ordered two. But won't reorder
B001OBJFK0|1|yes the product is great but this price is ridiculous. You should be ashamed!! This is what I call stealing. this is definately not the Mary Kay way.
B00187PWDY|5|My husband has had every other after shave imaginable and asked for the old reliable Old Spice & he was thrilled.
B00L3LB0IG|4|For the price this is good.  However, I need more moisture than this provides and at the end of the day leaves my face feeling dry.
B001CZ8M98|5|My wife loves this product.
B00T532F56|5|Item received as described and on time.
B000GT0V3G|5|My other bottle that i bought from macys a while ago ran out, so i figured i'd order some on here. Same bottle, same scent, lasts the same! Did the free 5-8 day shipping and it came in less than two days! Very satisfied!
B000ELYIVM|4|I have been buying this item for years, it is the only one that I can find to fit my small mouth, when your an adult and have a small mouth it can be a challenge. I don't have any trouble forming it to fit my teeth I just follow the directions and it works fine. I do only use the one piece as it is the smaller of the two so I go through them quicker it lasts about 4 months. It does stop my teeth from grinding while I sleep
B002GUIDEM|5|great for the joke we play on a person who don't  like coming over to my house to dinner ,put them in his glass of tea .
B00IA501GA|4|Thank you!
B0001G734Y|5|I have used this product for over 30 years & now it is getting very hard to find, so I purchased enough to last me 3 or 4 years.
B004SSFE8S|4|Not as deep as a fire engine red but a gorgeous color, no blue or orange. My favorite red. And I love red.
B005Z49PQG|5|Love these products. Has organic ingredients. Love the smell. Definitely notice a difference in volume in my hair [3A/b curly, thin]. Will use/buy again.
B00ODSL90K|5|This is the second product of LAVO I use now. It is fantastic! It feels cool and silky when you apply it. I like its smell too. The wonderful thing is after 10 minutes application, my face become glowing, soft, silky. My pores are minimized too. I love it!
B0019662YM|5|I brought this for my fiancé for Valentine's Day and he loved it! He's a history major in college and is really interested in Arab culture. I figured it was a winner when I saw it. I would defiantly recommend this as a gift for family member or a gift to yourself. It's very comfortable to wear and great for cold and warm weather (yes I have took it away from him to wear myself a few times).
B006HJRAD8|4|Beautiful red color. Did my nails a week and a half ago, they still look great!!  I would definitely recommend this color
B00D13CGS2|3|Really pretty color.  Doesn't last much longer than other polishes though.  And worst part for me, and I realize everyone's nails are different, when I took it off with just regular remover, no scraping or anything, my nails were flaky and broke very easily for weeks.
B00GSINA14|5|Great
B001QAVME6|5|I can't speak for anyone else but these made my nails beautiful. They provide a smooth and sticky base for nail polish. I find that my polish don't chip as easily as they used to and do not peel off as easily. On days where I don't have time to go the whole nine yards, I just swipe a layer of this on and my nails are hydrated and look beautiful. It's also great for hiding discolored nails.
B003IIJH1O|5|I recently got this primer to replace mu TFSI, and I'm glad I did. This primer is very creamy on the lids and dries to a matte finish. My eyeshadows don't crease or wear away throughout the day anymore, which both TFSI and UDPP did to my lids. Plus I like the doe foot appliator, makes it easy to apply underneath the eye and in the inner tear duct as well. Overall, it is a great purchase, a little bit more expensive but if the other primers don't work well, definitely try this one out.
B001NJKKMU|5|Product is great little goes a long way and all day. Ive tried many bronzers and I recommend this one.
B00J97OA10|5|Product as promised and super fast shipping. Thank you!
B004ROW4ZO|5|I love this product. It really keeps my hair in place.
B004L93918|4|These work really well and smell very good.  Great that they are all natural!  Would buy again!
B003CHZLHA|2|This could have been a good product but fails. The foam holes are made for 5oz bottle, not the 15oz. So you REALLY have to work the bigger ones in to make it work. I've already torn the foam in one place.  For the cost, it is not worth it.
B00PATJU8Y|1|This was hard to wash out and left my hair dry, brittle, and falling out.  I used it once and decided I couldn't risk my shiny glossy healthy hair for something that just cannot replicate that elusive beach experience, oh well.  Nice try.
B000068PBT|4|Tripleheaders Replacement Heads arrived in the proper time frame and was in excellent condition.  Was very satisfied with the service and was able to use the razor in no time.  Would use this service again with no problem.
B004DH1BQI|4|Much better than what I normally buy, doesn't leave the distasteful clumps at the end of the day.
B003F7NVS8|5|Lathers well and smells great.it does not leave he hair feeling sticky or dry.<br />It compliments well with other products
B004XW09AW|5|Amazing product smells great and feel good on my skin I just love it and recommend it to anyone that likes nice things
B00014EH2C|5|I originally bought this book at the store and it was double the price. so I search and found it on amazon. This is a great cream, with helped me with my dry face. now my face is much clearer.
B006QHXDKK|3|Love the colors and the amount of eye shadows is awesome but only thing that I was upset about was about 3 colors on each pallet were broken n they just so happen to be my fav colors on each of the pallets that are broke. Besides that i love it. Just wish maybe it coulda been packaged better in the box to prevent that happening. But Good eye shadow for sure.
B000N8EWXA|5|Perfect!
B002BS43HU|3|I'm still using this product but still no changes, I don't think I will buy it again ,  I think in one month you should see some difference
B000GZEJS8|5|I have been using these for a long time. They have good quality and long lasting.<br />Seems a bit rough at first but if you are careful not to cut yourself after second use it is normal and perfectly working. I use it for face hair and my lands. I use moisturizing gel before shaving to be safe.<br />Price wise, I used to buy these from stores each for 3 dollar and buying 3 of them here for a good price over here is highly recommended.
B006OHM5T2|2|Not especially Thought it would work better than it does.thrilled with it.
B0030W26G6|5|This lipstick is fantastic! I love how creamy it is and it stays on me for quite a while! I love the color it looks good with my skin tone thank you so much !
B00DWOVJVA|5|Wonderful.  Price was terrific too.
B00H57FSWG|5|I use this for massage, has a good moisturization factor so you don't have to keep reapplying and a good glide - not sticky.
B0032NK1II|5|My son is allergic to mosquito bites. This has really helped keep them off.
B000AMUVCU|5|You can actually see the results of this product on yourself and others that use it.  It does what it says
B00JYD3H9A|5|Everything was fine.
B00AMSJ6QO|4|Happy with this product
B00CV9GSJU|2|These connect to the glasses by means of a small black rubber loop.  It doesn't seem very strong, and it doesn't grip well once it's in place.  I put a piece of tape around the point where the rubber loop connects to the glasses.  Otherwise, the glasses would slip out of the loop.  They just don't grip well enough.  The next thing I'm going to try is using tape to attach each end of the retainer to the glasses using tape and bypass the rubber loop completely.<br /><br />Using the tape to hold the rubber loop in place worked OK, if you don't mind having tape on your glasses.
B002RS6JW6|5|this was easy to order, great hold, better price than local or at the hair dresser / will order again
B000MD65FO|5|I bought this for my boyfriend because he had mentioned he used it years ago and loved it. After trying it out again, he said he won't ever go back to using any other shampoo again :)
B00538TSMU|5|Love this!! I received my shipment in 4 days!!! Awesome lashes!!
B003YJAZZ4|5|Coming from a Braun 7526.  It lasted a month shy of either 8 or 9 years, hopefully this will have the same life.  Shave has be closer and smoother, but takes a few more strokes than the old one even on the highest setting.  Can't tell much difference between the middle sensitivity to the one above and below, but switching between high and sensitive has been pleasant.  I'm still not settled on preference for the trimmer.  Old style slid out, versus this popping out to close to 90deg from the unit and ~.  Each has its pros and cons.  New model allows much more visabillty and the slightly slimmer trimmer head allows much more versatility, especially around the mustache area.  But the old style had more sheer cutting ability, could just use a full-size trimmer without a guard for that though if needed.<br />Cleaning system and is improved, and the auto-drying feature is great for those \\"oh, missed a spot\\" sections if you find one after putting it away.
B000HK1OOY|5|Great!
B003V360NY|4|I have used Norelco for years and felt it was time for a new razor. This razor shaves good but not as well as I was hoping - I guess I over sold by the commercials. All that said I feel the razor is worth the cost. I would recommend it.
B000I5HJ2Y|5|Don't second guess yourself! just buy it! you won't regret it at all :) worth every penny spent!!!!!!!!  :0) :)
B007134WGC|5|Only thing that cleans and polishes in one with shine and no oiliness just wish wasn't so hard to find
B0086LC47M|5|I am quite pleased to say that this set arrived in less than 2 weeks although the projection was 4 weeks to 1 1/2 months.  It is a very nice set of ultra fine glitter giving you a good selection of colors.  In the photo some of the colors look as though they are duplicates however they are not; each hue is a unique shade of the color family depicted in the photo, some varying only slightly, mostly in undertones [i.e. there are 2 red glitters, one with blue undertones (not flash) and one with orange undertones (btw these reds are actually poorly represented in the 1st photo, 2nd column, rows 3 & 5, just north and south of the green glitter)].  Overall a great foundation to build a larger collection upon.  Oh, and one more thing, be careful when first removing the jars from the packaging as some of the lids were barely screwed on.  I lost no product but had I grabbed them by just their lids or base jar alone, I probably would have had a grand mess on my hands.  In case you're wondering, the lids do tighten on nicely.  Overall a GREAT buy.
B00AKYYSCM|4|We made a lip balm at my daughter's bday party, and this little tub was the cheapest I could find on short notice. I haven't had issues with the leaking like the other reviews, but I haven't given them a chance to melt by leaving them in a car, etc. At room temp. they seem to be just fine, and everyone at the party loved them (even the boys took one home... for mom). Very sturdy, and only trouble with 2 of the 50 with the threading being a bit off. Overall, at 30 cents each, happy with our purchase.
B00EWDP45C|5|Great mini polish!
B001F51TTA|5|Shocker- Olay has a good lotion, right?<br /><br />It is lightweight and smooth- a little goes a long way too. My husband swapped over from his regular lotion that helps prevent acne and this one works better on his skin- so now he's taken over the lotion. It's really nice, I recommend it for a nice, light, daytime lotion.
B005CKI9PQ|3|The Bridal Wedding Starburst Pattern Hair Pins are beautiful. The three stars are given for this fact, as well as timely shipping.  Sadly, I had to have my hair cut in order to remove two of the pins.  Two of the pins wrapped tightly around my hair.  The starburst pattern is very pretty, but not practical for my hair.  Because of having to cut my hair, I have some shorter hairs, which make the style look ridiculous.  I used these pins just as I have other hairpins.  It never occurred when pushing the pins into my French twist hair style that the pins might be entangled with my hair and be impossible to remove without cutting my hair.
B002K5SWA8|5|I took a risk and bought this and now  I just bought more.... Don't even waste your time looking at the others because this does everything it says!!<br /><br />My gums are always swollen because my bite is off so I tried this and I am so glad I did, I love it, redued all the inflamation.....BUTTTTT the main reason to purchase this was to put this with a q-tip on the corners of my mouth because I get painful mouth ulcers from my allery inhalers....I have not had an ulcer in 5 weeks of using this I cannot believe that, and those suckers are so painful!!!<br />I love this stuff!!!!!
B00LESGFGU|5|Arrived on time. Does what it says it should. Will be using it for my upcoming wedding (we're having BBQ) and it should work well.
B00182ERTO|5|The best lotion in the market.
B005DKKBTC|5|I have gone through a few shavers and this is by far the best. Rotary shavers would really irritate my skin especially at the neck area where it's toughest to shave and requires frequent passes with an electric shaver. This panasonic barely irritates my skin around the neck area and outperforms the others shaving trouble spots quicker. I shaved last night a week old beard and it did a great job. I have a tough beard and grows in different directions but was really impressed with this last test for a week old beard.<br /><br />I'm glad this shaver worked out for me because it was my last shot and if it didn't perform well I was going back to a razor. My previous shaver was a Phillips Norelco AT810 power touch and man did that burn the hell out of my face. Not bad if you have a weak beard but for me a foil shaver is the way to go and this one did not disappoint.Also have in mind that with electric razors it's better to aim for one in a higher price range than the cheaper ones. If you are like me who was almost ready to give up on electric shavers then please give this one a chance. Between amazon's return policies and Panasonics money back guarantee I saw no reason to not at least try it. Panasonic seems to have it right and I'm sure you will not be disappointed. Go ahead and give it a shot!!!
B00VDKZ5U6|2|It was too messy for me and in the middle of the day you could see the Orange showing through under my regular concealer.. I suggest using a super super small amount and blending it out really well before applying your concealer if you are going to use it. But definitely not something I would repurchase. I recieved the product in perfect condition :)
B009UFF4R0|5|I was really surprised to see avon on amazon, I used to wear this when I was younger the smell is still the same, and the price was great for the whole set again really pleased with my products.
B00006BN44|5|i love it good
B00CFBHJAQ|5|Excelente
B005LQRYKM|5|Love it!! Love it, love it!!!
B000SZMGL8|4|This is such a great deal.  I go through these batteries with my grandchildren's toys.<br />Company delivered very quickly and a great value.
B009T47YZ2|5|I thought it might stick to my hair but it doesn't at all.  It's super cute, light weight and easy to put in and take off.
B004FK49L2|2|I have thick curly hair that I allow to air dry. This product lets my hair get frizzy when dry and looks too &#34;wet&#34; when wet. There is also an issue with excessive build-up. Ironically, the Sebastian Wet product, which is my favorite, does none of these things.
B000QB77NQ|3|I just recieved and started yesterday. I read reviews that say the pills smell. My capsules do not smell at all. I am wondering if i have been tricked and not recieved the real pills. Can anyone comment if the pills smell. or they produce a smell in your breathe after taking them.
B006O473S8|4|I cut the bangs of this wig and it was pretty easy to deal with. It's got soft strands, and as an experienced cosplayer who owns many wigs, I like this one. Good quality, I would recommend it. Just make sure you comb it and groom it a lot, because like any long wig, it gets tangled and frizzy after a lot of use. It's also a nice, pure black.
B00MWDBT1M|5|I have fine hair that gets tangled up in the rubber band kind of hair holders.  This is my second purchase of these kind of holders (l find they do disappear somehow...but I don't think it is the products fault, lol).  Having fine hair semi curly hair the crease business isn't an issue for me, I have never noticed a crease line, wouldn't matter to me either. I wanted something that was soft, easy to remove and gentle.  These are perfect.  When these disappear I will buy more!
B001JQGK12|4|The product is great. But the shipping took waaaaay longer than estimated. It's the only dry shampoo that actually works for me instead of adding more greasy grungy texture to already dirty hair.
B00013TQRE|5|Amazing product!<br />Every woman fears the time of her life when our precious hair falls out. I noticed more and more strands falling out around the time I turned 30. I'm 50 now (Ssh! Don't tell anyone!) and I thought there was no hope left for my hair. Today, my hair is thick and just the way I like it. It's my own hair, that I grew! I would recommend this product to anyone with progressing hair loss. It works!<br />I was skeptical at first, as it took about 4 weeks for improvement to show, but two months later I'm loving my hair every single day!
B006UET4XE|4|This liner goes on very easily and doesn't cake up. Big pro in my book.<br />My con - halfway through the day, I had liner on the top of my lids because I have oily skin.<br />Had hoped that this would have longer staying power.<br />BUT when you combine the price, the easy of use and the level of precision you can get from this - its a winner.
B00AVP37G8|5|Granddaughter loves them! Color stays on, no chips!
B00OSKNWLC|1|It was very loose fitting and I have a big head! It was also extremely thin.  I gave it away.
B0034KYDQ0|5|When I got this in the mail 2 of the eyeshadows were broken and of course it made a mess in the case! Lol<br />Within 10 minutes I had the mess cleaned up and the rest of the eyeshadows (95 I think) were still all perfect!<br />There are lots of colors, they do shimmer, and they are long wearing & it is not sheer color. I love them! Two broke shades did not make me want to return this set and I am a picky person! Lol<br />Just know when you buy these you are taking a risk that some colors may be broken, but the colors that remain are GREAT!
B004CS578Q|5|I don't have a lot of beauty products, but this one? I'm never going to be without it again. I have had dark circles under my eyes since I  was a kid and now that I'm a &#34;woman of a certain age,&#34; those circles have morphed into purple pouches. So attractive. Only not. This stuff works. (In a way that the infamous Preparation H trick never did.)
B0009RFB76|5|have used for years
B0080EEMCA|5|It's amazing
B00HNWNXAW|5|Product works well, I am very pleased with this product and Purely Northwest's customer focus.
B0018QHSH8|2|Color was very bright and did not work for my skin tone.  Would return, however, cost too much.  Do not buy unless you know what color you are getting.
B00DQU73B0|5|AT long last...a moisturizer for sensitive skin that actually works. I have tried a ton over the years...and nothing worked for me. Really impressed and thankful.
B00R0POZJ0|5|[[VIDEOID:c37c96cc649ce9c6efee07bc4b1698f0]] Really great moisturizer :) I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.
B00027D8IC|5|I only buy Duo Lash Adhesive, as it's the only thing that works! Even when we buy less expensive lashes, this glue keeps them on and looking good.
B009GYVMAS|4|After hearing all the hype about glam glow I had to try it. I've always had problem blackheads that I can't get rid of.<br />It works nicely and you can really see it pulling the gunk out of your pores. Leaves your skin supet soft and healthy. I expected it to work a little better for the price. Like one application and zap no more blackheads but thats not the case. Theres difinite improvement each time so im hoping by the time the jar is gone i get the results i was hoping for.
B000NKHNHK|5|love it, it works
B00429BV3K|5|I ordered this comb set mostly for the white comb in the picture, but since the price was right I went for the set. Good quality and works well.
B000EMWFBQ|5|This is my favorite brand of tweezers!  I've gotten them as gifts for friends and family, and all of us love them.  With the product's guarantee of resharpening it once it becomes dull, how can one lose?
B00BEQG53A|1|Gotta be fake positive reviews on here.<br />By far the worst white gel polish i have ever seen or used.<br />Used three coats and it was still completely see through and didn't have much color to it.<br />I took it off right away because it looked so ugly. What a waste of money.
B00CQ7U69A|3|I would have gave it a five star but I don't like how you have to take it out but other than that the cup was great you don't feel it when it's in<br /><br />I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO PEOPLE
B003H146PY|5|When i first looked around to purchase a reliable honest product i figured this would be a place to buy. I decided to purchase this perfume and when i tried it for the first time i didn't notice any effects. This happened at work and around friends and relatives. I decided i will give it another try when i go out on the weekend. It was amazing! I was being checked out by girls as soon as i passed by them. I didn't think it was a big deal but then later on in the night it got worse i was chilling with a friend at the bar having a drink and this girl looked at me and started talking like she knew me or something. The whole night she was all over me and asked me for my number! Im not sure if it was a lucky night for me but i did notice a crazy weird effect. Honestly the smell is not noticeable but the effect was. I hope this helps and cant wait to try it again next weekend and see what happens.
B001Q52VNM|5|I have used it before but I dropped me old one on a tile floor and it cracked.  I use it all the time and it's great.
B001JPH44K|5|As stated in the title, this is a rave review for Snake Brand Prickly Heat Powder from Thailand. For the past few years I have suffered from heat rash on my chest and shoulders when doing hard work in warm weather. In the past I have gotten fair results with Benedryl pray. This year when the mercury hit 80° and I was working on remodeling my house I got a terrible rash from shoulder-to-shoulder across my chest and upper back and spreading onto my neck. Nothing was working, even the Mayo Clinic-recommended anhydrous lanolin. After I read the reviews on this powder I ordered it in slight hope it would do something.<br /><br />The cooling sensation of the first application was delightful. It felt like something was happening. Within a day the redness began to go and after two days the blisters started to disappear. After a week of twice-daily application there was just a hint of roughness on my shoulders. After three weeks there is no sign of rash or bumps, even though I am still working on the house daily in 90° temps with a lot of sweating. A small application to the nether regions has also eliminated the usual use of Clotrimazole anti-fungal for the occasional jock itch. I couldn't be happier with a product than I am with this one.<br /><br />For those wondering, the ingredients listed on the label are: Talc, Kaolin, Camphor 1.4% w/w, Menthol 0.8% w/w, Perfume, Triclocarban 0.2% w/w. No doubt the camphor and menthol are what cause the cool, tingly feeling that lasts for as long as an hour after application.<br /><br />I think this 150 gram tin will last me for the rest of the year, but I plan to stock up just in case. And for those who care, I've been told the can is quite attractive sitting on the shelf in my bathroom.<br /><br />One additional comment: After posting this review I went to the product page to add more to my wish list. When I purchased this item three weeks ago it was available fro Amazon Prime, but that no longer appears to be the case.
B001FE0UKU|1|I bought this item from Amazon Marketplace along with many other gifts that I was intent on ordering only to make it easier for myself. When I went to the mall the other day and stopped by Victoria's Secret, I was shocked to find that the product that I had ordered and received was an older model. Not only was it an older model gift pack but there is a new gift pack out this year and the products are packaged very elegantly for a fraction of the price online here. BUYER BEWARE
B00598SS70|5|love it and read the directions unlike me and messed it up a bit
B00146JODS|5|My son uses his tablet daily and so uses this case daily. He has had the case for  3 months and it is still holding up. Couldn't be happier.
B00IZCNPGQ|5|Fits well and allows all ports to work easily!
B00R3IDBZ8|5|Love this little bag. Very good padding. Love the violet color. Easy to use  Keeps my oils organized
B005H5QOCQ|5|Thank you
B000LPNJ4I|1|I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY THE IRON CURLED MY HAIR. I SENT BACK THE ITEM.
B00A2TXS2Q|4|when i finish applying this lotion i envision i have also applied a light cloak of flowers and that i am happily strolling along a sunny pathway.
B00EZXUTJU|1|product was defective. makeup could not be delivered since the dispenser didi not work. I could not return the product because I already opened it and tried to use it. Good idea but not always working.
B0035RE2TA|5|I'm not sure yet if it is helping...but I really do love using this dry brush.  I just dry rub my body before I get in the shower. Takes about a minute and makes my skin feel amazing.
B00K7HVHYE|5|Being one in the sun with my profession, I've always looked for ways to protect my skin. Finding HC3 has been a blessing for a lot of people. Skin is not greasy while it hydrates and this helps accelerate the improvement from sun damage, no question.
B00J0SK648|1|Not enough.  The cap is bigger than the bottle.  Wish I hadn't paid so much money.  Didn't understand the keychain.
B004NMR6TY|5|I've been cutting hubby's hair for 25+ years and my mother's hair to their complete satisfaction and simply wouldn't try my own for fear of messing it up.  This takes all guesswork out of doing your own hair.  I watched several youtube demos and ordered it immediately.  Just follow instructions and start off slow to begin with til your confidence is built.  I won't be paying anyone to cut my hair again!!  I have long layered thick hair and it turned out perfect after letting it grow out for over a year I now have exactly the style I've been wanting.  Try this for yourself.  You won't be disappointed.
B005UFN3VS|2|Just received my kit. I only received 50 beads. Not happy about this. My kit came with curved tipped needle nose pliers.
B003BOM1ZO|3|Nice mascara for a light, natural look. No clumping. The applicator is like a comb with teeth rather than a brush with many bristles. Does stay put pretty well....until our summer weather became quite hot with some humidity. Then I noticed after a couple hours in the heat I had smudging and a bit of &#34;raccoon eyes&#34;.
B0002TSCZY|2|I have been using FHI Heat irons for a couple of years now. FHI Heat irons seal my ends and make my hair supershiny and sleek. The compliments never end when I use these. I'm an African American with a nice grade of thick medium length hair. People think it's a wig sometimes after I straighten it.    I heard good things about the Solia irons and decided to try something different. The Solia hair irons make my hair dull and don't seal the ends like the FHI irons seem to do. They make my hair look unfinished. My ends look frayed and raggedy and the shine isn't there. I am returning this product asap.
B000EHNE0M|5|I order this to clean my hair because washing with other shampoo my hair would tangle up so much.
B0019GX6RI|5|I've been using this astringent for years. I don't even look at any other, and I've tried them all. It really works, and I only wish I had of known about it sooner. Great product.
B001MA0QY2|4|This is a great device and it was delivered promptly! Thanks!
B004885USW|5|I like the coating on this curling iron surface. It came with a tiny bottle of argan oil, which smells really good, but is not new to me as I've been using argan oil for several months now, but nonetheless I like it. It gets hot very quickly, and though it says fine hair only needs a heat setting of 10, I crank this baby up to 25 (out of 30) because my hair doesn't like to hold a curl. Another great thing is that the kickstand doesn't get hot, so your fingers don't get burned when you swivel it out of the way. Part of the plastic tip on the end closest to the metal gets a little too hot but I've been able to adjust to that quickly.<br /><br />Got this one when my basic Conair died of old age.
B000UW3XCA|5|I found this product to be very helpful for my skin, I currently wear a liquid foundation and applied this make up very lightly after my foundation and It reduced the greasy/oily look I sometimes get after a long days work. I applied the power once in the morning and once more after about 5 hours just to refresh my face. I really like this product however I could use a darker shade. I highly recommend this powder for people who have oily skin.
B008H0ASZC|5|Great product! Bought two packs and it works great! Color matches my hair perfectly! Couldn't ask for more! Texture is great!
B0026IBSVE|5|My husband and I both shave our heads and we wanted a sturdy model to replace our old plastic Wahl.  This Chrome Pro kit is excellent (the parts are sturdy and the shaving abilities have upped a notch with the extra shaving parts and solid chrome body.  Very very happy with our purchase!
B00AW4QAC6|5|Really liked it, it was what I was expecting.  High quality for the money<br />would recommend it for a friend
B0035LCSUG|5|Thank you!!
B009RNUH8G|5|I just luv this product! its easy to use and convenient. I spray it on every morning after I shower and it does not leave a greasy residue at all!! It is easily absorbed in the skin & leaves me feeling refreshed! I have dry elbows and hands & this really helps! It is great for moms on the go or anyone that has a hectic morning routine! Moisturizing hasn't been this easy well in since forever!!!  I deff recomend this for everyone that needs something fast & easy to use!!
B004VD25DM|4|The personal groomer doesn't have a stand but I deal with that because it is such a good grooming tool
B00OP24ZRS|1|very small quantity - travel size at best
B00KD73PBQ|5|Just Love this oil blend.  I always forget to do the deep conditioning treatment but am so happy when I do!  I am amazed how easily it washes out and the incredible shine.  I do use this as a leave-in treatment almost every time I shampoo and the results are terrific. I have just past the shoulder length hair and apply to the bottom third while still damp.  Whether I blow dry and style or just let dry naturally, my hair is soft and super shiny.  Love this!
B003BLBLVC|5|Was a gift.  Very much appreciated.
B001E77OY8|5|I don't know how many bottles of this I've gone through but it's a lot. I use it morning and at night. Once I put it on a cotton pad I inhale it a few times because I love the scent. Fragrance can elevate a person's mood and this one does the trick. Seriously - it's my favorite part of my facial routine. And it leaves my skin feeling clean and tight. Even though I wash my face first somehow there are always still traces of make-up that this astringent removes in addition to everything else it does. And I'm very happy that it is sold in 3 packs because I seem to go through an awful lot of it!  It is very well packaged - I've never had a bottle that leaked. Great product.
B004C432FK|2|I just ordered my first Hope in a Jar and when opened it I noticed it was slightly neon yellow!  I thought it would be white! I am not sure if I got a bad jar but I am disappointed in the appearance and texture.  It is very runny.  I wish I could ask for a replacement.
B002PMSEM2|5|This color is perfect and easy to use. Wiped off of my skin easily and true to the color swatch. It is a very rich brown color and am very happy. Many people reviews I read complain about the smell but if you wash all the dye out of your hair the smell disappears and isn't even an overwhelming one almost a faint baby powder. If you do get the smell it easily washes out at your next shampoo and with the royal jelly conditioner. The royal jelly conditioner was super moisturizing and made my hair beautifully glossy. I am extremely pleased with this purchase and plan to continue use every month.
B008B3NUZA|4|The color pigmentation is very great. It's not to dark or too light and it's very easy to apply. Great product.
B0037HP9OA|4|I upgraded from the older blue model to this one. This one is a little too sharp for the &#34;boys downstairs&#34;. It does get you clean shaven all over but just be aware that you can't speed shave downstairs like you could on the older model.
B004UMTKVE|4|Highly recommended by EWG which rates sunscreens every year, based on effectiveness and safety of ingredients.  This is my sunscreen for 2012.  I swim laps (in the sun) during the summer and don't want to get tan.  This sunscreen has prevented burning, but I still get color and freckles.  So I gave it four stars for safety and efficacy.  I'm still looking for that perfect product that will allow me to be unfreckled!
B0035RKT2Y|5|Works Great. Would highly recommend it.
B0009RF8AG|5|my favorite
B007K6K0IY|4|I have been trying Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for the last couple weeks! I am impressed that the deodorant actually goes on clear and stays clear! I have yet to find any marks on my clothes!! I also believe I still smell good after a full day of activity and working outside! I would give this deodorant a five star rating if Secret didn't use Aluminum, which has been proven to not be good for your body! I'm going to finish using this trial size product given to me free from Secret and BzzAgent! It doesn't take much either (one click) and enough gel comes out to do one armpit. It drys quick and I haven't had any problems with it!! #gotitfree #freesecret
B00OWFDNDA|5|[[VIDEOID:bcc5d018c33555db3792822c14c20d34]]I love the scent! It has an interesting combination of scents with the strongest being lavender but it has some other tones which makes it quite unique.  The bottle has a dispensing mechanism that dispenses a small amount but more than one drop at a time.  I take hot baths quite often to help my aching back and add a drop or two of this oil to make it smell great. One or two drops is enough to create nice aroma.<br /><br />The bottle is quite small, it is 2.5\\" tall and the entire bottle weights 1.4 oz. But the oil is very fragrant and just one drop goes a long way to create a great scent.<br /><br />This oil is provided by Essence of Cleopatra Aromatherapy.<br /><br />Ali Julia review
B001OOLLVS|3|Was hoping it would work better
B001QTW2FK|5|I bought this for an upcoming trip.  It is super lightweight and easy to use.  It doesn't have a cold shot but I don't need one.  It also doesn't have a folding handle, but it is still super small.  My 2 year old can handle it as it is lighter than her toy one.  It is also perfect for her hair on low.  I do recommend this to anyone especially those with mobility and dexterity issues.  It is super lightweight, super small, about the size of a female's hand spread out, dries almost/ as fast as my Babyliss Toniro full sized dryer.  It is also cheap and comes with a little bag to put it in, though my baby has took it as her own along with the dryer!<br /><br />Edited: It does include a concentrator and a diffuser, though that diffuser is so small.  I don't have curly hair, so I don't' use it.
B00OFMSF06|5|As shown, with the cute artistic curvature. Nice and sturdy. 😊
B0084X9E20|3|You have to use a lot of it, other than that, the scent is great.  It suggests a handful, but it took much more in a tub to get even a faint scent, or to even know you were using it.<br /><br />I'd buy it again, if it was stronger, you could use less, and it lasted longer.  .
B000GI3UA8|4|This shampoo is a very good shampoo that leaves my hair feeling clean and rejuvenated.  You can feel it tingling and working any nastiness out of your scalp.  The only issue I have is that I'm requiring more than I thought I would.  Shampooing with a \\"normal\\" amount (for any other shampoo) will leave me sort of \\"un-lathered\\".  At it's high price, this is kind of a let-down, hence the 4 star review.  As far as hair regrowth or anything like that, I think it's helping.  I use it with rogaine foam, and started both at the same time.  I haven't regrown any hair, (or lost any more), but it does seem thicker on the top.  Not sure what is helping with this of the 2 though.  But either way I'll keep using it.
B002R10JCE|5|Very soothing after a long  day of using my eyes.  They have a very soothing aroma as well.  Incredibly fast delivery and reasonable price.
B00778LT9O|2|coverage was ok, spreading everywhere, and got on everything, so if you touch your face please don't touch anything else...
B007K8JE0W|5|muy bien
B00GX8H59C|4|good
B00DNK4Z96|5|I am in love with this product and the brand.  This is the first time I am using LimeCrime and I picked the best product to try and it left a lasting impression!! I am definitely buying more of their lip products.  It is easy to apply, so pigmented and lasts!!! It does not leave my lips dry.  Wish they can bring out more colours in the velvetiness!!
B00BCHIM1O|5|Not only is the packaging so cute, but the balm is the best! Not greasy at all. You can apply it to your skin and blend it in and it will keep you moisturized. Love this product!
B00K9YO68O|3|I have an ear length bob and only had to use 2 packets.  colored all of my hair in the 30 minutes suggested to a black and that is with bleached highlights.  Did its job but color still rinsing out after 3 washes.  Stains EVERYTHING.
B000FED5DU|5|I was a bit apprehensive about buying since I had not used on earlier, but went ahead given the extremely low cost of the product. And the product is really good. It gives you all you need - is a real deal.
B00JUGX4J4|1|Horrible... the color was NOT dark brown... more like mahogany/reddish auburn. Was NOT 20 inches... more like 14/16. Just awful. Be careful if you purchase this. Also looks nothing like the picture.
B00HFQQ0U6|5|As expected
B0091OCCD4|4|I like the smell of this product and the fact that it is a non-chemical SPF. That's about all I like. It's VERY thick and takes a bit to rub in. It's also not oil control in any way. I believe it's made with jojoba oil. I'll use it until I'm out however I don't think I will repurchase.
B0076K5PC0|5|[[ASIN:B0076K5PC0 Efferdent Power Clean Crystals, 48 Count]] works just fine. Personally, that little denture cup sitting on the counter of my bathroom sink, with my small partial bridge, is the first thing that's made me feel...not-so-young! Well, all my teeth made it for 60 years, thanks to a little paint-and-paper (cavities filled, caps, etc.), but a few gave up the ghost this past year. When looking online to find the best denture soaking cleanser, denture toothpaste, and denture adhesive, Efferdent is the only one that won the \\"ADA Seal\\" (from the American Dental Association). That's good enough for me!
B00K32MO5O|5|I love this color!  It is a very pretty pink! I first received this as a free gift in promotion from Macys.  Would definitely order again!
B00AX3YNPC|3|I'm not sure but I feel this is just okay.  I've had this for several months and feel that it's a bit slow.  I also don't like the fact that you can only use it when it is unplugged.
B0050HO9MI|4|Old fashinon razor.Just what I was looking for inexpensive and works.  Blades are cheap and gets the job done. Not for everyone but works for me.  For a few bucks I now have a life time supply in shaving equipment. Whoop, whoop!
B005E4A6KQ|5|Love these little gems!!
B005FYGREE|4|These needles are pretty big and the curve wasn't as pronounced as I would of liked it to be but it got the job done.<br />Each needle came inside a baggy and was proven to be sterilized.
B006QN43IA|5|The rollerball works great...easily fits in purse...scent snells as good & lasts as long as the bottled perfume, but any perfume needs revamped after a long day & the rollerball is perfect for this. Also great for an overnighter when you don't want to carry a loarfe bottle. I will definitely purchase again when this runs out.
B0074NDF26|5|very happy and loved the special packaging.
B00427WJVK|5|Fresh, clean, and seductive. I purchased this fragrance for my girlfriend for her birthday and she absolutely loved it. I decided to purchase the fragrance considering Summer was approaching and was looking for something unique from all the typical sweet and floral fragrances that usually become overbearing in warm weather. It's versatile, which means you can use this fragrance as a casual scent or for special occasions.<br /><br />The dry down on the fragrance has a combination of citrus, woods, and floral notes. Neither of the notes overpower each other, their presence compliment each other. It has a \\"youthful\\" vibe to it rather than how some fragrances have that \\"old lady smell\\" vibe.<br /><br />The fragrance has great longevity, especially when it is worn on hot days and projects really well within the first 2-3 hours. After that, it begins to settle down making suitable for intimate moments where you'd like to have your significant other near you.<br /><br />Overall it is a safe blind buy, but as I always say about buying fragrances, \\"Try it before you buy it!\\"
B00B588F12|5|Love this stuff - my skin looks amazing! I don't like using foundation because it's so heavy and I don't need a lot of cover up, but this provides the perfect coverage. Very light and easy to use. Absolutely recommend!
B00HA7KZBK|5|Great value and fast shipping too. I would reccommend this product and company. Has a smoth flavor. I use a Teavana pot also available on Amazon.com.
B0017PUPMK|5|excellent brush
B000C1UD4K|5|I always buy this for my boyfriend.  It has a fresh citrus scent, but a masculine background.
B000TC1CVU|3|If you have very thin or no hair, this comb is for you.  Otherwise the teeth are not long enough to comb through to your scalp.  It is nicely made.  I returned mine for a refund.
B005VT7AJ4|5|Got as a gift for a friend. She loved the color, and it was a few dollars cheaper than buying it in the store.
B006QFVF4I|5|This is a great conditioner for over processed hair. It smells awesome as well. I would recommend it to anyone.
B001VHLH9Y|5|I love this scent.  I confess though, it really smells nothing like strawberries to me, but it has a nice clean, fresh, long-lasting scent.  I was pleased with the speed of shipping.  I ordered four bottles, and they were obviously brand new bottles, they all had shrink wrapped plastic on the caps.  Would definitely order again.
B00DQG0PJQ|5|My skin was getting extremely dried. After a few days of using this product my skin is soft and it has a glow to it.
B004DRCOUU|3|This eye bup did not fit my eye - the solution just poured out the sides.  Different shaped eyes may not have this problem.
B0015KHMRS|5|I bought these for really low price. Less than 10 dollars. Figured I take a gamble on something so cheap. All I can say is these are beast an I feel like I go them for a steal. They come with a nice bit of accessories an are pretty powerful. An it takes a long time to kill the battery.
B00B13GEO6|5|I have only used this one time so far and I already notice a serious reduction in hair growth.  I'm also using it on the lowest setting to get rid of a stupid tattoo.  Very little pain with hair removal, butt puckering pain on my very unfortunate tattoo. I know its not what the device is intended, but I noticed people complaining their tattoos faded with laser hair removal and went AHA, no more explaining in shame what my tattoo means.
B000US081S|1|I have a sensitive dry skin. I didn't like the texture, which is like a soap. You most add a cream after that, not only because this is the regular routine, but because the skin feels sticky, as apply soap on the skin without washing it. I didn't notice any brightening affect. It last me for 1 month only.  Not my favorite...
B000JUV816|4|1875 Ionic Styler/ Dryer - Quieter than most hair dryers and does it job fast.  An unheralded feature is the cord guard at the handle.  Although all instructions say not to wrap the cord around the handle, everyone does which eventually causes the dryer to fail.  Conair has reinforced the area where the cord enters the handle, which should protect it from pre-mature death.
B00A0IWSIO|2|I tried this product it smells amazing but it really does not help with frizz at all I have other products that work much better.
B004XU0VLQ|5|Good price on killer hair spray.
B00BMLOJK8|5|excellent
B00649P2VS|4|Love this and price works great and cute decals
B006N6D7M8|5|I can't believe no one has posted a review on this, it's available in practically any store with a shaving section. Now I don't really have a heavy beard, but I do stretch out my Mach 3 cartridges to 25+ shaves (frugal), so I end up working pretty hard to get a close shave at times. This product lets me get a nice, super close shave, even with a fairly dull razor and without any razor burn whatsoever, and my face always feels soft and hydrated afterwards. It has botanicals, including aloe, thyme and papaya, and the lather itself is dense and gives great cushion (better than the Gillette Foamy I used previously). The fact that is it just a dollar or two a can (and made in the USA!!) is just icing on the cake. Great product!
B000OQBLIK|5|I've used this product before but could no longer get it a local salons.  The order arrived on schedule and was packaged well.
B004ZGZYWY|3|Not many people know about the white shatter, so when i got it I was pretty excited to show it off. I got it in the mail and was literally so ecstatic. Problem. I go to open the white shatter and it WILL NOT open. I tried EVERYTHING and it just wouldn't open! So sadly, I haven't been able to use it. The ONLY reason why I'm giving it three stars is because the Spark De Triomphe is phenomenal and easily my favorite nail polish. If your on the edge because it includes this one, don't be! It's perfect and I was satisfied enough having this without the shatter.
B003D7L7OU|5|Recommended
B001ECQ4ZS|5|My favorite dove deodorant. They are unavailable in stores due to a shortage. Other online markets and eBay are selling this deodorant a bit higher than it would have cost in store.
B001ANMT2S|3|The expiration date was well past due when I got this product.  The product itself works well otherwise and this may be because it has been discontinued.
B003ILK9GS|1|I don't understand why this burns I read the revews and everybody liked it! I hated it with a passion I don't ever give bad reviews in amazon but this stuff is BAD! It tingles where ever you put it, and it burns FOREVER! Never again and it was 25.00 no way will I ever do this again!!
B00FW6YHY2|5|Very cool color skinny dark attractive
B0011E86GO|5|Love it and it's gone.<br /> Wish I could get more with out having to take out a loan.<br />It looks like I will have to try the botanical stuff. I hope its better than the samples that I tried.
B004D17D48|5|This is the only product that works. If I don't use it, my bug bites stick around for weeks to a month and continue to itch then eventually leave a scar.  This product stops the itch, gets the neurotoxin out and heals my skin scar free. It's amazing.
B002UQAUGG|5|I love the Silicon Mix Treatment so much that I got my daughter to use it, and then she liked it so much she used it on her daughters hair. It makes the hair so soft and easy to comb, the shine in my hair is amazing. This product works well with all hair types, my Daughters hair is thin and long, my gran babies hair is long and thick and I have thick dry curly hair. Our hair is so beautiful  I am so happy with Silicon Mix !  I have a closet full of hair products that do not compare to Silicon Mix, and priced at $35 or  more I will not be purchasing again.  I like to keep it on with a plastic cap for about 20 min, I also like to put a little in a spray bottle with water to mist my natural hair in the morning. For me , this is a great product and the pricing is even  better, I'll always be able to afford it !!  THANK YOU THANK YOU
B002NGMENA|5|I have very thick hair and it takes less time to put it in rollers and sit under this dryer. I can work or read and not spend double the time a blow dryer takes to dry my hair. It is noisy but all bonnet dryers are.
B002HWS9GG|5|Works we'll. teeth are very clean
B0058WE8Z8|5|This stuff saved my face. I don't shave because of razor bumps, but now i can because this stuff really does keep razor bumps and ingrown hairs in check. I recommend this for any man of color who wants to take control of facial hair and skin.
B0073668LO|4|When I was looking for a clear bag for work, I focused on size and I was glad to find the sizes listed. So many were listed as totes and that is too big for my purpose.  Plus the price was right. The purse fits my needs very nicely but it is a little on the stiff side and I wish it had shoulder straps.  But I am happy with my purchase.
B003YBLD9E|5|Perfect size for my purse & travelling.
B0048IG400|5|Great Product, easy to use and super easy when traveling, have used it now for about 3 years no drying out of skin and I have mature skin, wouldn't change, recommended *****
B0009V8N5E|5|This tans you with just one application, although I usually apply a second one the next day.  Smells a bit at first, but goes away in just an hour or two - or after you shower off a few hours after applying product.  Color looks great (not orangey).  Would be nice ifit were a bit cheaper - of course.
B00PV15BPW|4|This is the first time I have purchased the Majestic Pure brand of essential oils.  When I first opened the bottle I smelled what seemed like a strong alcohol smell which I thought was odd, but haven't noticed it again when opening the bottle.  I have had an opportunity to use the oil when I was experiencing very bad headaches for several days recently.  I put a few drops of Argan oil in the palm of my hand and added a few drops of the peppermint oil 50/50 and then using my finger applied it on my skin all along my hairline including the base of my neck. Within about 5 minutes my headache was gone and the subsequent times I have done it it has relieved the headache as well.  It takes care of the headache for a few hours and then I just have to reapply if needed. It was a little strong so you might want to tone it down more than I did.  You have to be careful with peppermint oil anytime using it around your face.  It is very strong, but effective for sure.  I rather do this than popping a pill.
B0037LOQQI|5|How are sunblock every day whether it's cloud cover for sunshine and it is just good coverage. Not to mention a good Moorshire riser for the skin. A little bit goes a long way
B00HX8NA9A|5|Love it.. This one does not burn around the eyes.. Works wonderfully .. I have used this for several years !
B0085YKEOK|5|It's a darker blue than I'd anticipated, but I ended up loving this color anyway. It hardly chips and I don't even need a top coat after two coats of the polish.
B002FZ1D3Q|5|very pretty holds great in thin fine hair
B005O3Z0US|5|I love the look and idea for my Airbnb.  The scent is a little bit on the heavy side.
B00A3LVMMQ|5|Looks very nice on my counter next to my sink.
B00GOYH4PA|5|Loving this argon oil. Notice an immediate different when I put it on. Also the company contacted me immediately after I bought it, via email, to give me tips to making the most effective use out of it.
B001ET78HY|5|This is the best foot lotion or creme, that I have ever used. My feet are typically in pretty bad shape, hard, dry, and cracked. Sometimes they are so bad fabric will stick to them, like Velcro. Sometimes it is even uncomfortable to stand barefoot. Even after just one application, I notice quite a difference. It also smells nice, but not too overwhelming, which is also good for stinky feet.
B0056GDG90|5|I'm very happy with this purchase.  For years I've used the Revlon curling brush dryers that have 2 different interchangable size heads.  Well I never use the smaller one and they always end up breaking so that the brush head won't stay on.  This one is one piece and will not have that problem.  Also with the Revlon product my hair often would get caught in the &#34;crack&#34; where the head attached to the base, this product does not have that problem either.  It blow wells and dries/curls my hair nicely.  I do partially dry my hair with a regular blow dryer first as I have always done.
B00LNOIDN8|5|Love the color and it looks great on my nails.
B005DC8M3M|5|The Wahl deep-tissue massager is very good quality. My spouse has chronic shoulder pain and he is very pleased with the relief he gets from the pain with the deep tissue massage. He uses it every day. I would highly recommend it if you can manage the weight, 3 pounds.
B009GEUPDS|5|It's non-abrasive and feels so soothing on the skin. I can't believe I never found it before, but now that I have it, it fits right into my schedule. I have combination skin, or something of the sort. It isn't harsh on my skin, and doesn't leave it dry right after. All I could ask for, really.
B007UJ8T9I|5|nice product 。expect give me more surprise
B000C1UFHU|5|sexy GF
B000N5S0DQ|5|After using the shampoo and conditioner, I noticed my hair was softer right away. I was even to able to flat iron without drying the heck out of my hair! It smells great but without the fake, overly done coconut fragrance that I sometimes find in other products. I'm definitely a fan!
B00CI77OX4|5|The beads are more bands of gold, and medium brown. The blue is more of a powder blue consider that when trying to match a necklace.... Easy on easy off!! Perfect with summer dresses!! Love, Love, Love!!!!!
B005EWF2A2|5|muy bueno
B00AR4BLWA|5|These little tapes are wonderful!  I have used them to secure my bra strap to my boat-neck tops so the straps don't show.  also, I used several of them at the end of a long rectangular silk scarf and voilà -- an infinity scarf!  I highly recommend these tapes!
B001N81TBC|5|This product is great.  It definitely took my stiffness away.  I used  this gel many years ago and wanted to try it again.  It's still the same, great!!
B0051I5TIO|3|It is kind of strong. Stronger than regular code, but it is more citrus smell, like lemon. I do like it but I probably will get something else next time.
B001DXQMS2|5|A little of this mighty serum works wonders.  I have found that this serum really potentiates the effects of the moisturizers either daytime or nighttime.  As with many skin care regimes there are advantages of using entire product lines to get the best results.  I don't feel I have to use this daily, but every 2 or 3rd day is sufficient.  The mositurizing bars that come with the hydration creams really prepare the skin to accept the mositurizers.  I find that this serum improves my skin quality if I have spent more time outside in our dry Colorado air.  This is a definite \\"must have\\" when caring for one's skin.
B00407IFFQ|5|For the price, these are great.  They look pretty just laying on the table.  They are bigger than I expected.  After you fluff them out, they are great.  The clips are long, I would say longer than a bobbie pin.  The flowers cover them up so you really don't know they are clips, so you can use them on the table, or clip to a table clothe, some other decorations...and if the gals/guys, boys/girls, feel festive...wala...in your hair.  I wish I would have gotten another dozen!
B003RC3ZSC|5|excellent product
B00KMB23AW|2|It does very little for my puffy eyes in the morning & leaves my eye area with a greasy feeling. No matter how little I put on, my makeup cakes up in the creases above/below my eye. I was trying to find a cheaper version of Clinique's All About Eyes, but this isn't it.
B00HB2ARDU|4|I'm happy with it.  I can think of a few things I'd change for me, but I think this design will make the most people happy.  Plenty of room for a longer beard.  Easy to clean, but not as easy as my last Norelco with the titanium blades.  In terms of power, it's one of the more powerful than most, but probably not as powerful than the Li Ion Wahl.
B004QWUEAY|5|This Norelco QC5550/40 headgroomer is fantastic. I was using a Remington SCC100R. It served its purpose, enough said. The Norelco holds a charge for long period. It can be used while plugged in, if needed. Doesn't require any dis-assembly to clean. The rotating head allows you to reach from any angle, particularly when using a handheld mirror to shave/trim back of head & neck. The foil razor attachment (aka balder attachment) is great for the neck just below hairline. QC5550/40 came with a travel bag & mirror. Overall its a great product. I've had mine for 2 weeks.
B00JAYW4UQ|4|I gave this product 4 stars because I like the ingredients list, the dropper works well, it's non-irritating and seems to work well with my skin. I know dermatologists say that you see the max results 6 months from starting a vitamin C regimen though so I am looking forward to continuing to using this product and seeing what it can do for me. I will update later on when that time comes. I recommend this product because I have heard dermatologists say that Vitamin C is one of the best things you can add to your regimen and this one has other beneficial ingredients such as hyaluronic acid so that's a plus.
B00IT1HKV4|5|Good stuff
B002ZX78O6|5|For the ladies with fine thin hair, this is by far THE BEST HAIRSPRAY that I have ever used. I have tried a lot of products to hold curl in my hair from gel, mousse, to other hairsprays. Nothing worked. I was just about ready to cut my long hair off! I ordered this awhile back and figured I would give it a try. I sprayed my hair all over before using the curling iron, then sprayed each curl individually, then styled and sprayed again. Not only did it hold my curls all day long, I still had curls in my hair the next morning. I will be throwing out all of my other products, as this is the only one I will continue to use. It makes my fine, thin hair look thick. You can also brush out your hair the next day and re-curl it, and re-style it.
B002K8OEHK|5|The tree face mask helps keep my skin clear.  I've used this product before and really like it.  Thank you.
B00147X6DQ|5|It works well. I am happy with it. I use the remineralization gel or my teeth are sensitive. My teeth are much whiter for having used this bleaching tel.
B00PWSAXAM|5|Another one of my products I will be using on a consistent basis. It works, and it doesn't taste bad at all, I can deal with it. Most importantly it whitens my teeth tremendously!!
B00U2VQW54|2|Note:  Upon reading the product insert, see some of these are BLUSHES and others are BRONZERS or ILLUMINATORS.<br /><br />Vibrant, Flush and Rosy are BLUSHES.<br /><br />Bronzed is a BRONZER<br /><br />LUMINOUS is an illuminating powder or HIGHLIGHTER.<br /><br />Over the years have always loved everything Neutrogena (skincare and haircare), so it kills me to bring the negativity.  Received three items:  Rosy (blush), Bronzed (Bronzer) and Luminous (Illuminator), and was so very excited.  Until I saw the COLORS.  Am porcelain/ivory complected, so the bronzer and illuminator are ineffective on me.  The Rosy blush does look very natural on me, but would like a little more color POP because the shade disappears fairly quickly and becomes all but detectable. Love using blush and reach for cool pink or coral shades.  Overall, blush needs to look natural while also giving your face an infusion of color.<br /><br />LUMINOUS is a highlighter or illuminator which is a very neutral, almost beige toned color (barely noticeable on my face).  Unlike other products of this type, this offers no sheen or glimmer.  Note, it is not light enough to be a highlighter on very light or ivory complexions.  Might work well applied to cheek or brow bones as a highlighter on darker complected people.<br /><br />As for the formula itself, it is a creamy powder formula, and being this is a powder the finish is very matte with very little sheen.  Product blends easily and has the silkiness too of a mineral based product.  The package is cute BUT at this price point you'd expect it a mirror and/or brush or a better pigmented formula?<br /><br />The central problem however, Neutrogena, is the largely the COLOR selection and pigmentation.  Ladies LOVE their high-end blushes specifically for two characteristics:  pigmentation and color selection. Unfortunately, these Healthy Skin Blushes come up short on both counts.
B000Z9449Y|4|I was a looking for a travel case for oversized bars of soap and this was perfect. It is a nice size, very securable, and light weight.
B005DKKBTC|5|Bought this for a person with a disability, but tried it first.  Was it ever smooth!  No &#34;pull&#34; or nicks. I have been buying Remington and Norelco for years.  No comparison!  Am anxious for him to use it.

B000IZO3O6|5|I purchased this soap set as a gift for my aunt.  She absolutely loves these soaps and is always telling me how fabulous and exotic they smell!  She says they leave her skin soft and silky.  She would definitely recommend these soaps.
B00BEOD9AE|5|Works pretty good as part of system.
B0018HOQ04|4|Very well made. Easy to install and use. Make sure you tighten the hose connections well. Had water spraying all over after the water pressure pulled one end of the hose off.    Overall worth the purchase.
B00FRP94RI|4|moister skin but do not like the scent too much
B0002Z8VOA|5|Fast shipping ! This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used. I have very thick hair, and have a hard time finding hair products that can tame my hair. The shampoo does a great job ! Leaving my hair soft and smelling great! I also use the Rusk Coral Therapy conditioner as well, and they compliment each other very well. As far as the product detangling I have to give it a A++. Trust me I have tried them all, and usually they leave my hair at best smelling ok, But I still have to spend a while combing through. If you are considering this product please give it a try, I realize it may not work for everyone, but it sure did work for me.
B00BPICVO4|4|This hair piece is actually really cute, but you need to sew an extra hair clip into the mesh underside so you can lodge it into your hairline to keep your real hair from peaking through on top. This was super cheap and the shipping was faster than suggested from China, so you really just can't complain. ;-)
B000OS131S|5|really helps with sore muscles
B00I0CZKXW|5|Love this... wish they wouldn't of discontinued it at the salons.
B0039LMT9C|5|I love my gillette venus razors, they work perfectly and leave my skin smooth and sexy! =) Good product at good price!
B001MW8IVS|5|Makes my lashes full and look beautiful.  &#34;I received this product as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions stated are 100% my own&#34;
B00A2BTAGW|3|The smaller tubes 3 fl. oz do not have the thick consistency that the 6.8 fl. oz tube has.  The bigger tubes cream consistency is the best.  Nothing beats it!!
B007340QSC|5|the product its self it is good and leaves your lips feeling great i dont like the smell but that is just me the chocolate cherry is too strong
B004EWK2IK|5|I love Mac products and after watching beauty tutorials on this product I knew I wanted to try it. This product is a true full coverage foundation. I have used this to cover blemishes and hide adult acne, I am truly pleased with the results. I will say to use a bit more moisturizer with this product if you have drier skin like myself. The product is creamy and rich but very thick as well. Highly recommend!!!
B000Z65I0G|5|I started using these filters after my hair was falling out and hair was turning a slight orange. This didn't help with the hair falling out but definitely cleared up the yellowing/oranging of my hair. Also, It makes my hair super smooth. Makes me feel good about not putting extra &#34;stuff&#34; in my hair that is found in tap water.<br /><br />I know these are the replacement filters, but the whole system in general is super easy to put on the shower spout and it has nice different options for pressure. I have had a lot of problems with past shower heads leaking at the connector and I have not had that problem with this and I have been using for almost two years now. The filter was super easy to replace.<br /><br />Only thing I would add is, as the instructions say, make sure you first run the water into a bucket or you will stain your bathtub with the Carbon that is in the filter.
B00413CHTE|2|When this product arrived, it was already damaged from the inside.  You can see the glue that holds the mirror dripping down where the light protrudes and it just makes the whole thing look cheap.  I'm sure I just got an unlucky product but it looks like a manufacturing defect.  In fairness to the seller, I never gave them a chance to replace this product.
B0019ZCX46|1|This brush was far too soft like a baby brush, I expected boar bristles to be more firm and would penetrate through my hair, massaging my scalp when brushing.
B0053ZA1ME|5|I just did my first Gelish today and am totally happy with the result! I was sick of having chipped/peeled mani only after 2 days as I use my hands a lot being a mom and gardener but this I hope will last at least for a few weeks.
B0026IBSVE|5|Such a good investment. As a guy with a normal haircut i wish i would have bought these much earlier. They litterally pay for themselves with just 2 cuts. I used to get my haircut monthly, now i do it weekly. Plus i know what to expect when i cut my hair, no more inconsistency everytime i go to the barber. The eyebrow trimmer is a great plus.
B001DNE3KQ|5|I am very happy with this shaver and am impressed with how nice the shave is. I have owned many different electric shavers over the years and this is the best one! The closeness of the shave is nice and the unit feels solid. I did not get the cleaning system, that part seems kind of gimmicky to me. The unit charges up fast and is considerably lighter and quieter than my 3 year old Panasonic shaver. I think the blades and motor speed make the biggest difference in a shaver, not so much the pivot action even though this model has an intricate pivot mechanism. Overall seems like a great unit.
B000141KY0|4|Especially good on the frizz of naturally wavy or curly hair, without a heavy product build-up.  Perfect for giving a little help to calm down wayward hair.
B00278O4IW|5|Creamy, slick, exceptional lather.  A bit light on fragrance.  A little goes a long way/
B001FXUTUM|3|It does a good job on the 'stache. It  is very painful though.  I thought I was used to hair removal pain, but oh mama! This hurt! It got some chin hair. It did not get the corse ones.  In short I was able to ditch the razor, but not the tweezers. Not having to use a razor on your face is a plus for any girl!
B004CG80BE|5|I saw this cologne in Sams wholesale club at over twice this amount. This was a great deal! I loved the smell from the beginning
B004J6WCBQ|5|I have been this product for over a year and it's great!<br />I have very thin nails and it keep them nice and strong and prevents them from tearing<br />Nice to be able to do my nails at home. Save me a lot of money.
B000KQ7X8G|5|Good stuff
B001FYV5T0|2|Perhaps my fault, I was thinking a cream. It is very gooey and like a vaseline. Save your money and buy vaseline or even aquaphor
B0001TP258|2|Not as great as I thought it would be. It has very strong fragrance. I was looking for a calm and soothing fragrance. Would not purchase this item again.
B00GUNYDAE|5|I got them for my daughter who is a nurse, she said it was one of the best things she's ever had on her feet, can't say it any better than that!
B006OMHUZQ|5|I got this set from Amazon. Cheeky is either Terrible or great. This set was really, really great. Deep stamping that holds the polish well. I highly recomend this set.
B001K2DHHA|4|I like the scent of the cream, and also the fact that it absorbs into the skin, and does not leave an oily residue...
B003VUL8IY|4|Holy moly, this is a mouth full of something active.  It makes the inside of my cheeks burn, as well as the tip of my tongue, and I've got no scratches or abrasions as far as I know.<br /><br />And then there's the foaming.  Which is to be expected really.  I knew this mouthwash had hydrogen peroxide and I'm just glad that it doesn't leave me foaming like a rabid dog.  No, instead it froths where I didn't brush good enough.  The back of my tongue is apparently a nasty place.<br />.<br /><br />I wasn't a mouthwash user by the way.  But all of a sudden I started having problems cold and heat sensitivity and I began a search for a mouthwash with some Fluoride to supplement my toothpaste.  When I saw that this wash had just about everything in addition to Fluoride --whitening and antibacterial action-- I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />And lets not forget the lack of propylene glycol.  It might be a 'food additive' to the FDA and big industry, but anything that can kill my cat, isn't something I'm intentionally going to seek out and consume.<br /><br />RESULTS SO FAR<br />--Honestly I think my teeth are whiter.<br />--My breath is fresher.<br /><br />--I'll have to wait to see if tooth sensitivity is effected.  I will report back.<br /><br />NOT for children (high level of alcohol) or those who have super sensitive mouths.  For the time being, I would suggest this product for those with gingivitis --they'll benefit from the hydrogen peroxide-- and the need for fresher breath.
B00EL5S0VG|4|I use will be using these brushes for my figure modeling hobby.  They appear to be decent detail brushes.  They were set at a price that couldn't be beaten, but if you need them fast this isn't the place to get them.  They were truly sent on the slow boat from China.  It took over a month to get here.
B008RAU1F4|5|I had really damaged hair from having relaxers done since i was a little girl. I finally stopped the relaxers, its been 3 years but my hair was still brittle and dry. nothing was working for me unit i tried this product. i would apply it once a week and leave it in for about 45 min to a hour then rinse. I've seen my hair so much healthier and longer. i just cant live without this product.
B00MUMYMD2|5|I just tried the Purple Tonic for the first time.  The color is gorgeous and it goes on easily.  The color change is dramatic going from a lovely purple to a deep blue.  The glitter adds a very nice touch.
B000H6A02A|4|Generally trusting Consumer Reports, I ordered this shaver. Reasonable price, best electric shaver I've owned, as CR indicated. Four stars only because electric shavers can't match a good blade.
B003FEMPS8|5|works for me. great colors. applies easily.
B00ZNZLE5C|5|Excellent Product! My eyebrows are light blonde and this unique applicator that looks like hair; actually made my brows look perfect. I applied it in the morning, went to work (I live in a humid climate) and I went to the gym after work. It stayed on looking perfect all day. I highly recommend this product no matter what age!&#34;<br /><br />The products arrived fast, in perfect condition. I contacted them with a question, and their customer service was outstanding! They raise the bar.&#34;
B0019LT2I0|5|First time user and I'm in love! Made my hair soft and smell so good.
B00UI3OHG2|5|Smell just like an orange, and creamy and hydrated feel. So much smoother after putting it on. it works so well with putting makeup on, makes the power blend so much better. The skin doesn't feel dry at all, just like magic, dry and then all hydrated. Great Product!!!
B006IB5T4W|4|We use this for our 4 year old kid. We have been using it for more than 2 years now and it has worked well. The only problem I see is its very sticky and feels heavy skin for sometime. However it works best for rashes and eczema prevention for my kid.
B000WYZ9Q4|5|I rarely review anything, let alone something like a tube of mascara.  I'm in my sixties, so you know I've been purchasing mascara for many years (decades).  i generally buy L'Oreal, but I'm always on the hunt for a better product.  I dislike having to apply coat after coat to achieve the thick and long lashes that I once had naturally.  That causes clumping and flaking.  I purchased this product at a store in my city yesterday, and I will tell you that I have finally found &#34;IT&#34;!  I applied only two coats, waited for it to dry, and curled them with my eyelash curler.  Ladies, don't hesitate to purchase NYX Doll Eye.  Since I am a frequent Amazon shopper, I'll order from here next time (cheaper, too).  What a find!!
B0082D9U12|5|I have dry/combo skin, need medium coverage, and am slightly acne prone. This never breaks me out, has a smooth matte finish with great coverage. Lasts all day and actually comes in a shade pale enough to match my skin tone! Plus, the price is great! One jar lasts me about 2 months with daily use, and I am using with a brush for medium coverage.
B004TFBVUA|5|I was watching Rachel Talbott's June 2013 Favorites youtube video and she quickly mentioned this product and how it made her lashes look fake.  Being an asian girl with barely there eyelashes I definitely wanted to check this one out.  I went to Sephora to test it out and was struck by how big the brush was. The box even boasts \\"GIGANTIC BRUSH!\\" in big bold letters. I usually don't like big brushes because it's hard to be precise with the smaller, baby lashes around my eyes, so that was a negative for me at first, BUT i applied it anyway and let me just say one word: FALSIES!<br /><br />I was already wearing mascara (loreal power volume collagen) but this too faced mascara seriously added some length to the tips of my lashes and kept a mean curl. They seriously felt fake. I've had it on for a few hours now and I can you assure it's not like those fiber mascaras that start flaking. This mascara does the job by seriously lengthening and extending to the max.  I am not one to believe the hype or buy anything I have doubts about, so you can rest assured that this is good stuff.  this mascara pretty much fulfilled all that I have been wanting and waiting for in a mascara.  The packaging is so cute and feminine and feels really sturdy (not cheap) my only letdown is that it's not waterproof, so I have yet to see how it holds up with water. I'd definitely recommend this product!
B00461F4PA|5|love it
B005KR4TNM|3|I ordered the wrong size and was able to return the item.
B008KEJ1LM|5|works great, does what it's advertised to do. Nice wet/dry use feature. Would recommend this item.
B001DJBW6I|3|this bath pillow is nice and I am using it comfortably....HOWEVER! the packaging is totaly outrageous! Not only was the pillow wrapped up in its very own shiny, thick plastic carrying case (I am not carrying it anywhere) but the box was stuffed with styrafoam peanuts to protect this soft pillow! STUPID waste of packaging and a curse on our environment!Why are people losing the ability to reason out what is killing the planet????? How stupid can it get?
B00E1I96L6|1|Did not clearly state that these were the mini-clips in the description.  Beware!
B000E7WHCI|1|I had to give at least 1 star otherwise could not submit my review.... purchased 3 as they were gifts for relatives out of the country so disappointed not original!!!
B00J2Z1PE4|5|An hour of sheer heaven for the tub
B002DR2TX4|1|I was hopeful that this product will replace my endermology  sessions  and cut the cost but i was wrong  there isent enough suction , parts came apart and defenetly not worth the money
B00AZF9196|4|Yup very good other then the dust everywhere
B00D9XQWRK|5|Smells so good, use it all the time!
B00028QF9U|5|This deodorant is great! I started using it 15 years ago in an effort to avoid aluminum and found it works better than any other product I've tried. It's not antiperspirant, just eliminates odors. It would probably work on foot odor. Packs well, does not need to be placed in 1 quart bag for TSA since it's a rock.
B00CD1QU80|5|This shaver was such a hit with my husband that I bought a second one for my son.  Both love it for simplicity to use and a close shave.
B001CL6QKO|5|I have psoriasis on my hands and feet.  I need a lotion to fight the drying affect of my medications.  Most, even the ones that advertise as good for sensitive skin, often sting and burn.  This doesn't.  That makes it worth every penny!
B00QJ3JB0W|5|I’ve been trying to take a better care of my skin as some signs of aging are starting to appear. I decided to try this Retinol Deep Moisturizer and Anti-Aging Eye Cream because it is made out of a lot of great ingredients that are proven to bring positive results. The bottle is small but it goes a long way because you need just a little bit of it. In addition, it looks like a good quality product. It has a very mild smell and the cream itself is nice and thick but it gets absorbed fast without leaving a heavy or oily feel. My skin is acne prone and this product advertises that it can help with it, so I’m very excited to keep on using it. My eyelids are getting droopy so I’m hoping it’ll help to restore elasticity. I’m already noticing some results, especially in the mornings. My eyelids do not look as heavy anymore. I received a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes and I highly recommend it!
B004BEBVZ4|4|I got this because I read many great reviews about it, It is better then st tropez like  many said i have tried st tropez and i like this one better so i tried this st moriz it gave me a deep dark color I am naturally pale(not like cullen vampire pale, but average pale)  and I did this on my arms and legs and feet I must say I did not fully follow instructions because I didn't exfoliate my ankles to well and because of that I had horrible dark tan blotches all over my ankles and feet which I didn't realize and I wore flats that showed my ankles and feet and people made fun of me so that was major embarrassing also it stained my hands a really dark color and so i'd suggest wearing gloves when applying  this and after I scrubbed my ankles with a toothbrush and &#34;whitening toothpaste&#34; (it really works btw) my tan looked pretty good! Also since its a foam its s little hard to work with but i managed and I will keep on using this and probably buy it again.
B0009VNI5E|4|I bought this because I wanted a more natural alternative to Curls Rock. It does not work quite as well, but it does the job well enough. I have to use quite a bit in my hair to eliminate frizz, and it's a bit touchy and can be easy to then use too much. Sticking with it for now.
B00BUQXMIK|1|I did not see a significant change in the chin line and I do not have a lot of fat so I was very disappointed in the companies claim about its product.
B00D5DI9M0|4|It's too bad that Clinique discontinued this product. It's so east to apply and gives a lovely glow which is very natural looking!
B00ROCG6ZK|4|It was OK. I really didn't like the smell.
B000Z606TY|5|This is a perfume spray I have been looking for a long time everywhere including Sephora. Very happy to find it.
B00006347J|1|stopped working from the very second use. bought 2 pieces, both stopped working. Not worth the money. Totally unsatisifed.
B004S20TOI|5|Best deal anywhere for this product, my girlfriend swears by it and heck, even a guy can use it since it doesn't have a perfume smell and it actually works!
B007B3T47Y|4|My wife loves this line of products
B001JJBC9Y|5|I bought these Osters because the pair of Wahl clippers that I had were dropped and the blade guard had chipped off a piece, causing direct exposure to the blades, as well as because the combs that came with the Wahls were loose and became VERY noisy when the clippers were turned on.     I've got to say, these things are a VAST improvement.    The blade guard is slightly rounded, causing no discomfort or irritation when doing the finishing touches (sideburns, nape of neck, etc) compared to the Wahls squared, harsh, almost sharp guard which frequently caused irritation and sometimes cuts. Perhaps the cuts were because the blades weren't perfectly aligned, but either way still not as good as the Osters.  The motor is FAR superior. It cuts my extra thick hair with such ease and silence it's astonishing.    The Wahls I had had a chrome exterior and got quite hot with lengthy use. The high quality plastic only gets slightly warmer.    These things are just awesome. Plus, professionals use em' so that's cool too.
B009LOJ5MA|4|Received a discount to test this item it is excellent
B00GX6DC0U|1|This wig was horrible. I didn't even get the right wig. I got a long pink wig that was very thin. You could see the cap through the wig.
B005QDL1K4|5|They work great.  The item came in unbroken.  nothing bad to say.
B001V9SXXU|5|THANKS CERAVE! I've had so many problems with dry skin, especially my hands.  My work requires that I wash my hands a lot.  It was embarrassing how bad they always looked.  I've only used CeraVe for a few days and what a difference!  Even on the first day, it was incredible. It's not greasy and disappears into your skin right away.  At the end of the day I put it on my hands before going to bed and it adds to the effect - yet because it disappears it doesn't mess up bedding or clothing. Even when used on feet, you don't have to worry about slipping or leaving residue on floors even if you walk barefoot - it's all absorbed by your skin in just minutes.  I became interested in this cream when I first learned about ceramides (see the link below or just search Google for reputable sites that describe ceramides).  The trouble is, it appears all the ceramide products out there are VERY expensive, and for TINY quantities.  But CeraVe, at least from this vendor (CeraVe), is relatively inexpensive.  Also you don't have to use much each time so this big 16 oz jar lasts a long time. Try it, at this price, what do you have to lose?<br />Site regarding ceremides - recommend you read this...... [...]
B00426S5B4|5|Being African American I have always had a hard time finding heat protectant products for my hair that actually worked.  I have been using this for over a year or maybe even 2 now. I love it. My hair never burns or breaks when I flat iron it. It leaves my hair very soft and shiny. It also leaves my hair bone straight for days. Worth every penny!
B005AZL7O8|5|Love these! A must have for your purse!<br />Cinnamon isn't easy to find in the stores so I was very happy Amazon had this flavor available.
B004LXOLFM|3|I bought this as a sub for Nars &#34;orgasm&#34; but it's very rosy in color. The texture is nice and the staying power is good, just not a great color on fair skin.
B005MIFI3E|5|Amazing!!!
B004BCXC9O|5|I just got my item yesterday (less than a week after ordering it) and I used it today! Absolutely Love it! It is so hard to find a good eyeshadow because I am very picky but this is perfect! Thank you!
B00FZBMT1M|4|Some of them come loose, but for the price I wasn't disappointed. Most of them do stay secure and serve their purpose. Would buy again if I needed more.
B00937VHNA|5|Great value and good quality
B002IJL2BC|2|This is icky-sticky stuff. It might work, but can't get past the sticky texture.
B0039BCT56|2|I didn't really care for the spray.  I couldn't tell where it was going and the overspray made it hard to breathe. Even after three separate coats it was blotchy and when it started fading away it looked awful and I couldn't get this stuff off.  I recommend the Banana Boat lotion. Used it for years and it goes on streak free and when it starts to fade you can exfoliate it off and reapply.
B007ZDM33C|2|Expected the color, itself, to be darker.  The polish is almost see through.  A little disappointed!  Arrived on time and packaged well.
B00PKPGZ7M|5|This smells great and works perfectly w
B007K6K0IY|5|I recently received a sample of this for free from Secret and by being a member of BzzAgent.  Prior to trying the sample I had last tried a gel deodorant about 18 years ago and hated it.  This sample has completely changed my view.  Secret Outlast clear gel deodorant is simply fantastic.  It goes on clear, dries quickly, had a great scent, doesn't leave any marks on my clothes, and keeps me dry all day long.  I am a stay at home mom who chases after toddlers all day and I don't have any time to wait for deodorant to dry to get dressed.  I can get dressed, put this on, and it's dry within minutes.  This is definitely worth trying out! Fantastic!!
B00C1KVZ8I|5|Great shampoo, my wife says my hair has stopped falling out since using it!
B0036YTW2E|4|I  bought this item for my son.  I thought that a natural product would be good.  But when my son tried it he said it just worked so so.
B0020MM8V0|5|Yeah! Yeah it is! I should buy another bottle... I have been out of this scent for a long time now. Every time I get this I get so many friggin' compliments. :D
B007AMOA8Y|5|Like all teenagers I've had a lot of acne. And I still have some left over scrars from the acne. My skin was red espacially on the T zone. I tried a lot of products to remove that redness from my scars going from cheap to expensive. Waist a lot of money and I finally found the one product that made THE difference. I had asked for a sample because I was tired of buying expensive product for nothing. Within my first try on I could see a difference. I was really amazed. Once I had finishes the sample I immidiatly bought it. It worked for me so I would definitly recommended to you if you have old acne scars.
B00BBD508C|5|I read about Magnesium bath flakes and decided that it was a product that would help me as well as my family. I made the oil, put into spray bottles and have seen results. It is a short term relief. But it is helping me with pain. I know it is a great way to get more magnesium into my system. I shared some with my neighbor and she also has experienced positive results.  MP
B001FUMVWY|5|I love how my skin is looking, my entire family is using it. My son complains of itching skin and since he is using this soap his itching skin has eased.
B00V71NVKC|1|Balls fallout of the bottle makes biggest mess.
B002W9H6HC|3|I love the idea of moisturizer sanitizer because my hands are always so dry after using those alcohol-based sanitizers. This moisturizer is a little on the greasy side and doesn't dry very quickly. I unfortunately discovered this when I went to put on contacts several minutes after using it - yeowch!
B006K9OQSC|4|My daughter has thick thick hair and these have a hard time keeping up with the weight, but it's a good way to get a nice bun started if you use extra pins to secure.
B00J2APR98|4|I love the flex ball! It makes shaving muh easier. I always use Gillette razors and this is one of the best. It makes my skin soft and smooth! No Knicks or cuts either.
B001B6AKES|5|RELAX AND ENJOY!
B00SG1JXS0|5|I love this product.  It works great to remove callouses and is so easy to use.  Great product for the price.
B00BL18J8W|5|Been using Old Spice product for years now, and I don't intent to stop.  I'm a creature of habit and loved the ability to buy such a large quantity of deodorant at one time.  There's nothing worse than running out and not having time to get to the store.  I switch back and forth between scents, but also go with Old Spice High Endurance.
B004L96NZW|1|When I first opened it, I gagged a little - it smells like cheap booze. However, I was out of shampoo, so I decided to give it a try.  Then I noticed the shampoo bubbles and the bottle puffs up if I forget and close the lid. I fear it is becoming sentient and not just a little evil.
B00K32VXTW|5|Love this serum. Does as advertised.
B009RJNDCC|4|The price was good, i just wished that the after shave bottle was a whole lot bigger . Overall I made a good purchase.
B003HUSLHY|1|These stopped working after two uses.  My wife liked how they worked, when they worked.  T3 does not warranty anything purchased outside of their site.  But, they offered to accept them back and give a 50% discount on a new one.  Too bad it is 50% off list price ($99).
B005OW9TOM|5|I love this color! I currently have 3 bottles, and decided to give one to my sister since i had so many lol. This is one of my favorite OPI colors.
B00EH26DBC|4|this is a nice little bag for carrying small things in your suitcase
B003II0R7M|3|I used to love Badger's original formulations for their sunscreens, but unfortunately after they decided to remove some of the nice essential oils for some which changed their base formulations as well as using a different zinc type for all their sunscreens....all their sunscreens now seem to be too drying on the skin.<br /><br />I found this sun stick to be too hard and too difficult to apply for the face, it is also very drying so even if you manage to get enough on the face it spreads white and leaves white patching on the face and exaggerates any dry patches you may have on your face, especially if you use acne medications.<br /><br />I now try to use it just on my hands and try to spread it. It may work better if it melted upon contact to the skin, but unfortunately it does not.<br />You can try putting oil on the face first then put this on, but it is still tough.<br /><br />The smell is actually the smell of unrefined Cocoa Butter and Shea butter, it is not a bad smell, so I am unsure why other reviewers stated it as an offensive smell... it is not. It is a natural smell and if you are not used to the smell of unrefined shea butter or cocoa butter it will be a different smell to you of course.<br />It is just very difficult sunscreen to apply and spread on the skin.
B009P4ZJXK|5|I am very happy with the chalk glitter.  My granddaughter thought it was great and her friends orderd it also.
B000C234ZY|4|Smells just like tea Rose but be advised it is extremely strong and hard to remove – the center is almost overwhelming and it lasts all day long
B0042NU7FE|5|Really like Kenra products.
B009YL4TF8|5|These attach to the fingernail with ease.  Just need to make sure that you cover it with 2 coats of top coat.
B000WNVPQ8|5|The only hair spray that I can find that does not show flakes of hairspray on black hair. Never want to be without it.
B000NHQO46|3|I have a generous trial tube of this stuff and it doesn't work for me. On the back of the tube it says \\"For dry skin\\". My forehead, temples, and the sides of my nose get oily throughout the day and using this all over my face as a daily moisturizer made me REALLY oily after about 3 hours or less.     Sometimes I just use this for dry areas on my skin when I need to (cheeks, corners of mouth, lash line). Strangely, it makes those areas oily too so I just end up with an oily face, which doesn't happen with my Olay facial moisturizer for sensitive skin (loads cheaper I might add).    One other nitpick - this smells strangely. I have tried unscented lotions by Olay, Eucerin, and Vaseline and they don't smell as strong and plastic-y as this does.   This also has a similar smell as the Vaseline \\"intensive rescue moisture locking lotion unfragranced\\", which is thicker and white. I'm not saying these are the same, one's for face and the other's for body obviously, but they have the same effect of making my face oily so if the Vaseline brand lotion aforementioned makes your face very oily, the Clinique stuff won't work either, I think.
B00LM3L90Y|1|Did not see any improvements, cream was a little sticky.
B00DPLOK2U|5|Great smell! Love them
B000GHGYOI|5|I have purchased several professional dryers from salons and stores over the years and they never lasted.  I was disappointed that both the professional line and non-professional line from Conair had the same on/off switch that breaks easily.  It seems as if they are designed to fail quickly.  The Babyliss Pro Professional Thermal Ionic 2000 Watt Hair Dryer is a wonderful dryer.  It is very solid and a bit heavier than most dryers and it looks very impressive.  Most importantly, it works great.  The switches are well designed and I expect them to hold up well to daily use.  This dryer has plenty of power to dry and style thick hair.  I plan to buy another for my guest bathroom.  I heartily recommend this dryer.  No problems with delivery: it arrived on time, in great condition, well packaged and with a free gift - I had ordered a set of rollers with the dryer and received a really nice quality, free brush with my order.
B002KCCEGO|5|I bought several of these towels.  Never heard of the brand, but I couldn't find the kind I was using anywhere.  No matter, I like this one so much better than the brand I have been using for the past five years.  Texture is great, and the best part is the size.  It's quite a bit bigger than my old brand.  That might not be important to most folk, but I am a big guy.  The size makes it easy to grab an end with each hand and really scrub my back.  Sweet.
B00FH692PQ|5|My hair doesn't fall out anymore. I may look 10 hairs when I wash verses 100 normally. My hair dresser has even commented on how my hair is thicker. ***I only wash my hair 2-3 times weekly, if I were to use everyday as directed, WOW I would have a head full. I will NEVER use another shampoo, even if it didn't regrow hair, it would allow you to keep the hair you have which makes it worth every penny to me.
B001DBCW10|5|Happy wife means happy life.  Wife HAPPY
B00AFCP418|4|about as good as any old spice antiperspirant.  soled base with regular deodereant anround that and if youre going ourt why not some body sprat and top it off with some nice cologne!
B000QYEK88|5|What can I say about this... this mighty staff of Zues haha, but really, it's a razor that'll make me pitch a sale for it. I use a VDH butterfly open safety razor and got a chance to use this and WOW, the VDH is now part of my travel kit and the Merkur is the stay at home premium. I get an enjoyable shave and it's nicely built, lives up to its HEAVY DUTY title nicely, but will more than likely handle this like porcelain just because it is a maintenance tool, and any self respecting man maintains and makes sure their tools are in the best working condition to reduce the chance of failure.<br /><br />Verdict: Precision and durability under $40 RECOMMENDED.
B0084Y1K30|5|I bought this small container of coconut oil first to make sure I wanted to use it.  Well, it is a very good product to have on hand.  You can use it on cuts & scrapes or take it internally.  Anyone who decides to try it should get the book, 101 Miraculous Coconut Oil Benefits & I can promise, you will get your monies worth out of it.
B00K2KXMHG|5|Update jan 2017 I g e t the lavender bar and this is my favorite facial treatment, helps get rid of those enlarged nose pores that collect blackheads and shrink thepores also. Certian the silver gets into the pores and eliminates any bacteria. Those of you that say it dries your skin, what you may be mistaking for drying may be the astringent effect of the lavender. I Can not get better results for my oily facial skin.....<br />2015... I'm amazed at the results. Skin smooth and that oily feeling of my problem facial skin is gone, even the smallest blemish has virtually evaporated. Even a few skin tags are gone, will use faithfully from now on.....
B007Q0WW0S|3|The smell is great, it's not greasy. I don't know if I can say I love it for my hair, its not giving me the shine and feel I was looking for and it arrived in an opened / damaged box.
B00EEC433K|5|Love it! Worked out great for my 5 year old hair cut.
B001GS6OB4|2|This works, but it takes a lot of time and gives a lot of pain! I'd rather shave thank you.
B000NLAWE0|1|I really love dying my hair bright purple, and every time I have ever dyed it purple I've used Special Effects Dye. I decided one day that I wanted to try a new shade of purple and instead of buying my usual \\"Pimpin Purple\\" from Special Effects, I tried this one. Big mistake. My hair was already reasonably bright purple, and has been purple for 8 months now, it is even bleached, I just wanted to touch it up since a few spots had faded. I bought 2 bottles and put it on, I even let it sit for 4 HOURS, and it looks EXACTLY the same. It didn't even cover the faded spots. This color of dye is definitely the worst Special Effects Dye I've used, it was more watery as I spread it through my hair, and like someone else said, more like a glaze. If you like purple, I'd definitely still suggest Special Effects Dyes, just not this one. Pimpin Purple works extremely well in comparison.
B00CMETI6O|5|Ya very good product !!
B001AS018C|1|Have been using only a week, and have not seen a difference as yet.
B004HR9KQM|4|I like them but they do break easy. The sliky wrap fabric helps the foam roler not dry your curl out.
B00IT1ECBA|4|Great product & great ingredients.  My only negative is that the soap is fairly watery.
B002UUT42I|5|This bodywash has the most wonderful smell. It is a hydrating wash and doesn't leave my skin feeling dried out.  Thanks!
B0069SQW5O|5|Sinus problems? Chest congested?  This is a product that will help. I use it with steam (in a bowl) or I sprinkle some out of the stream in a hot shower.  Helps every time.
B00IBMP79I|3|It was a bit too dry and flaky for me.  I loved the color though!
B000HZCSE4|5|I have been using  White Diamonds for years, and this was the best price and I received it very quickly. I would use this sight again, because I was extremely pleased with all price and how quickly I got it. Thank you very much. Ronni Simon Genn
B00EFGG586|5|We loved this color for the holidays- a great bronze-taupe with a subtle glitter. The CND Shellac products are always good quality, and this color doesn't disappoint.
B00GMCP5NC|1|Never got to wear it because it broke
B0012H0LZO|5|If you like Suki or Arbonne products but can't afford them (that's me!) then try the Weleda baby care products and see how nice your skin looks.  I love this baby cream - it is good to put on sunburns or for softening your foot calluses.  It smells good, is all natural, and the price is right.  What's not to love!
B001LF4I8I|4|good but not dual voltage as i expected.
B005X2F7KI|5|These nail polish work nice for doing nail art.  The brush are thin and not suited for painting your entire nails.  I use them to paint the nail plates and that's all that it is good for since I'm not an artist to do nail art.  I have lots of fun with doing nails with my 4 year old.  But nothing I would in public although she could get away with it. They are decent sized and seem to be of good quality.  I would recommend if you are doing nail art.
B007K6K0IY|4|I was given the opportunity to try this deodorant for free from BzzAgent. Overall I was impressed with this product, but I do wish it had better odor protection.  I would use again, but only purchase with a coupon and/or sale/promotion.<br /><br />Pros: Clean Fresh Scent<br />Does Not Leave White Marks<br />Dries Faster Than Expected<br /><br />Cons: Gel Is Really Cold When Applying to Underarm<br />Order Protection was Not What I am Used To<br />Seem to got through the product much faster than a solid, even when using as directed
B003156OHO|5|We had a bad winter this year and dry skin is a big factor. This body wash is like a body lotion it keeps your skin moist even when you are done showering. I have not had any dry skin problems this year from using Aveeno Ultra Hydrating body wash.  Best body wash I have ever used.
B00JFOQ31W|4|the top was still a bit small for me but the fabric is darling. I am keeping it anyway cause its so cute
B00EZM9ESS|3|[[VIDEOID:fe957f7d4756f14d927942e264dc28a8]]Less studs than I expected. The pictures used in the description shows many studs and what arrived to me was no where in the same range. I do like the neon colors of these studs, and the size of each one. I also like the shapes, it really allows me to have fun with my nail designs.<br /><br />To apply these gems, I paint my nails first. I let them air dry for a minute or two and then I use a pair of tweezers to drop each stud carefully into place. Once I have a design in place I use a couple coats of top coat to really hold them on nicely, of course allowing the application to dry before moving to the next coating of clear nail polish. The clear polish really makes the nail and studs look pretty and shine.<br /><br />I never have problems with the studs getting stuck of clothing with the method I describe above. I wish more of each color was given, I feel as though the photos in description misrepresent the actual amount of product sent..I would of given five stars if not for that issue.
B0058E3XJI|5|I never leave reviews on tanning lotion because I always thought they were all the same until I used Solid Black Bronzer.  This lotion doesnt leave you streaky, sticky, or with a funky orange color.  Absolutely love this lotion!!
B000EG8HLE|4|The Norelco Bodygroom works pretty much as advertised.  It's fast and efficient.  However, something that became obvious only after I'd purchased it was that the handle is short which makes reaching parts of your back challenging for those not gifted with extreme flexibility.
B000PHO1F8|5|I have naturally curly/wavy hair and I just started using this product and bought it from the salon I go to. My hairdresser uses it in my hair. It is fantastic. You will love the way it holds onto the curls and then when you sleep on it and comb it out the next day and for a few days later, it holds a nice wave that is very chic.
B00YF3V6JC|4|The facial steamer worked well but the volume of water it held was small.  It was enough to do one session but it worked well. I received this item for a honest review.
B00BQ76XK2|1|I ordered these and I only received 1 out of 4 sponges. Wth? Where are the rest?
B003QYFVRY|2|Other than the yucky stuff accumulating inside the brush head, the toothbrush worked well while it lasted. The biggest problem is the battery life. After a little over 1 year of usage, the battery could only last for one 2-minute brush. I had to put it on the charger every time I finished brushing. The fully charged battery won't hold power either, as it would become powerless after setting aside for just a couple of hours. For an expensive electric toothbrush, it is not acceptable for the battery to last for only over one year. I have replacement heads that are still in the package!<br /><br />Luckily for me, this happened while the product was still under warranty. The customer support sent me a new handle. I'd like to say that the customer support was helpful. I had no receipt, but it turned out the serial number is printed inside the handle. They can tell from the serial number that my product was still under warranty.  For this reason, I gave the product a two star, instead of a one star. But I can imagine the frustration of people whose toothbrush died right after the warranty expired.
B00FLKP0UY|4|Good, I like it
B00AWE47U8|5|Philosophy 5 piece is a great way to go if you are not sure of what smell u like, but I can tell u that when u put it on u really can't smell it yourself but you sure do get alot of compliments from strangers in the store, and after telling them what it is, its as though they are not strangers any longer
B00I9KVO1W|5|Great to add to neutrogena sesame scented oil. Great with about four 1.5 ml droppers full added of this blend of oils.  Need to wait a day for smell to develop.  Very sensual aroma.
B00B9V99C4|5|Good shampoo at a good price! You can't go wrong!
B0017XE2K8|4|It came on easily and lasted a long time, but was smaller than I expected it to be.
B004UTRH2Q|5|The regulator was exactly what I wanted.  Now I have a spare if needed
B00HG1JFXY|5|I have been struggling with loosing my lovely hair for many years now.<br />I have been to the doctor to see if there is a medical condition causing the issue, they found no answers.<br />I am starting my second bottle of this Ultrax Hair Lush and have been very happy so far. My hair has stopped thinning and there is some re growth. I am hoping this progress continues.
B00243FKRY|5|This root boost spray is great...I have been using it for a few years and was very happy to see it discounted on Amazon.  My hair is fine and beginning to thin, so my hairdresser introduced me to it and I've been using it to blow dry everytime I wash my hair since then. It gives much needed body and has a very pleasant fragrance - not harsh or commercial like some hair spray products.
B00M0CT7UK|5|This product is great, and I love all the recipes that come in the eBook! The seller is wonderful to work with. Thank you La Lune for another amazing product!
B006GQYSFA|5|I was surprised how smooth, comfortable and quiet this razor was.  There were many razor choices available and this one turned out to be a good choice.
B0096U7QBG|5|Very nice I love it.... Good quality very natural looking thanks again will buy again.... You can even use curling iron on it
B001BODO5C|4|works well
B00MBXVE1I|5|I bought it for my girlfriend, she told me that this product is very good because provides potent antioxidant protection, shielding skin from damaging free radicals—those pesky rogue molecules that promote premature aging.  In addition the vitamin C Serum provide a range of benefits that keep your skin younger-looking.
B001B0X05U|1|I got 5 of these. The smell does not last long. A bit of stronger smell that lasts long would have made it an ok option.<br /><br />Afterall, perfumes are to smell good and last atleast 2 hours - This lasts 30 mins may be.
B00H0DW9NG|4|Worked as described, but only lasted about 5 days.
B00JD26CZI|5|Great product
B009AZOM8M|1|It didn't work at all.. waste of money for me
B003CTTZQQ|5|great hair oil that I have been using for awhile. It is alittle thick but you can always dilute it.
B00CLILRMY|5|I saw a difference almost immediately- which I know sounds strange but true-<br /><br />Try it - great price, really seems to give me the glow and the softness
B000V3T0CK|5|This moisturizer is light, non-greasy, and pleasant smelling! The small tubes are great for portability. I am always using hand sanitizer, and this helps my hands not get super dry in winter.
B00FDZ1JH0|3|I WISH THEY WERE A LOT THINNER, THEY ARE VERY NOTICEABLE AND DON'T ALWAYS STAY STUCK TO THE EYELID HAVE TO PRESS THEM DOWN DURING THE DAY.
B004G43UNA|5|I love this stuff, chocolate with coffee and fruit undertones.  Extremely refreshing.  Don't leave on your skin too long or will start to sting! :)
B00JKL7H3I|5|Came before it was supposed to. It was clean. (I cleaned it anyway) Easy to cut. East to use. It lathers well and rinses clean. I will definitely be ordering from them again.
B001E767V4|5|Being an insomniac since 'teens, I'm always looking for cures and things which will enhance my quality of [little] sleep. I came upon this last month and thought 'what the hey!' I SIMPLY ADORE IT and won't go to sleep w/o it. I even poured some in a 3oz travel bottle for a recent trip. Smooth it on your shoulders, chest and neck and you'll sleep more soundly than you have in years. I haven't been paid to write this and don't work for the company.<br /><br />While I sleep an avg of 5-6 hrs/night, this makes it feel like deeper, more meaningful sleep, I don't wake up as groggy and fully RESTED. Dunno how else to describe it.
B000JYZHEG|5|This is the originally formulated scent, created by Dana, of the California cologne for men. Don't be fooled to buy the newer version of this cologne. Although it's a tester, it's still in a full size bottle and was never used. Buy with confidence from this seller, for this product.
B00B0YDLMY|5|I &#34;love&#34; the Redken Curl wise hair product because it is one of the few hair products on the market which &#34;tames&#34; my waves without making my hair greasy! It almost &#34;straightens&#34; my hair a little too! :)) I hope it is NEVER discontinued!!!!
B00B1DR2PQ|4|I've been using this product for over ten years, since I first started to color my hair to cover grays.  My grey pattern is salt and peppery so I've been resisting that platinum princess look.  I'm half Japanese and my natural black is almost blue.  This product gets points for covering the white hairs and making them true black, not purple or blue.  Also high points for the comb shaped applicator.  It's easier to get inbtween the swaths of hair with this verses a regular single nozzle.  Low points though for gloppy-ness.  This stuff is messy!<br /><br />The newer foam based products don't drip as much, but those do not saturate the hair as well.  I gave the Vidal Sasson product a higher rating for viscosity; it did not drip down my neck as this did.  When that hair color went out of stock I returned to Excellence, and remembered how much I like the ease of application.  If someone would put the hair comb of this product into that one we would have a winner!
B000C1UE8A|3|I smelled the sample of this and I loved it. But when I got this and put it on, it was not the same. Did not like it on me. Too bad.
B0001K55NG|3|Does not hold flat irons very well, but good for round curling irons and small bore hair dryers. Does not seem tippy as others have described.  Excellent concept and does get all of your electrical hair tools in one place for easy access.  Biggest grip is that it began rusting after 3 months or so and dropping chrome flakes all over my bathroom vanity counter.  Tried painting the bottom of this unit, but the flakes still continued to come off to the point whereby it eventually got tossed.  Other reviewers must have completed their reviews shortly after the product arrived and did not wait very long before commenting on this fault.  Perhaps a powder coated paint would have been better than chrome since the chrome is over steel and not brass.  You can take a chance on this item and maybe my chrome coating was bad though it appeared perfect when new, but for the reasons described, would not recommend this product until the finish coating issue is resolved and if this were to happen would gladly give it 5 stars.
B00PFEFE3O|3|The package which I got was opened and I doubt the authenticity of the product. If you read this review  please contact me.
B004I2H2GQ|5|Gets rid of kitchen odors like garlic and onion on your hands. I cook a great deal, and sometimes I'm chopping a ton of shallots, onions and garlic. I dislike the smell that lingers on your fingers, so this soap is a great solution. It also removes fishy odors from cleaning fish and shellfish.
B001FWXIL0|4|Smell is good but it isn't as strong as some of the others I have had in the past.  If you like a lighter type musk this is the one.
B00PATJ7AK|5|This item was given to me for my review.<br />It is summer, it is hotter than the surface of the sun, and I am sweating. However, I still want to have nice hair if at all possible, and I still want to be able to use a conditioner without my fine hair becoming oily. Just For Me Detangler Milk Pre Wash is a nice product because it allows me to put the conditioner on my hair dry. This, in turn, allows me to have a better chance of applying the conditioner JUST to the ends of my hair, and not getting it on my root area. Once you have waited a minute or two or more, then you get in the shower, rinse and shampoo like normal. The result, for me, was that I had smooth, shiny hair that was easy to comb without being over conditioned. The smell is a bit strong (to me....I don't like heavy scents), but most of it washes out, and what is left over on my hair is much more toned down. It was much easier to comb, as I said, and I found that while it took some of my curl out, I still had plenty of body. I am pleasantly surprised at how easy the product is to use, and how little I need to get good results.
B003O3YXDK|5|This is my go-to face wash for the last year.  Before I found this I was battling adult acne and had a pretty ruddy complexion.  Initially it was a little harsh for my skin since I wasn't used to exfoliating like this every wash, but my skin adjusted and has had a complete turn around.  I've never had &#34;glowing&#34; skin before but this gets me pretty close -- to where for the first time I'm not completely horrified to leave the house without makeup.  I have it on my subscribe and save order so I save a little $ but I would pay twice as much for the results I've gotten.
B004XN60BI|2|This is just plain old foundation. Not worth the price. It goes on very dry. It makes dry skin show up a lot.
B004AZKLGE|5|great stuff girl friend loves it
B0048IGBD0|1|I have not experienced any noticeable difference or change on my teeth so can't say anything positive.  Have been using this for over a month.  I wouldn't buy this again since it didn't do anything for me.
B00F008GFQ|5|Love this foundation brush!! Blends out my foundation beautifully and makes my make up look absolutely flawless.
B000WHY8KE|5|These are awesome - way better than any drugstore tweezers I've ever purchased.  They grip my fine hairs and it is less painful to pluck them out!  I am very happy with them!
B008AE97O8|4|I am trying this product for the for the first time and I like it.  not sure if it will do what I want it to do.
B000Q80ZTC|1|The product is not biosilk. It is basically water.
B00HJDIAGC|5|I have found this product works very fast and that's good because sometimes I need whiter teeth in a hurry like if I need to be at a job interview I want to look my best. Easy to use and great results.
B00J8DU3M0|5|Omgoodness these brushes are soooo wonderful. They are soft very pretty and fun to look at. And the construction of the brushes and material used allows your makeup to look wonderful! the only thing that I wish is that BH cosmetics would write the names on the brushes of each brush! would defiantly purchase again!!!!!!!!!! Oh yea I look for fullness of brushes and they are very full and DOES NOT SHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEA!!!!!! Bought some brushes from Mac was very very very disappointed! As Mac is super overrated in my opnion
B0053HB130|5|Love the product and it was super cheap for what the value really is. The small bottle is the same price at beauty stores.
B00W1UDBXU|5|I have flakes but it's hard to find a sulfate free dandruff shampoo or conditioner. So when I was offered this Organic Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner set from Derma Change for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion  about it, I definitely ordered it. I've been using it for a little over a week now and my scalp is no longer itchy and I don't have as much flakes! The best part is my hair is still really soft! I definitely recommend this Organic Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner set from Derma Change For anyone with dandruff!
B008SGKHEW|5|I love it! and shipping was quicker than expected. I am going to share with another family member. We have decided about the quality of this product is worth our life time commitment. your skin feel so and look great. Be sure to add your moisturizer after washing. Your face shine and skin is tight. Now I understand why the African skin is so pretty and tight.
B005P9HR7K|5|Nice product. The ladies love this one.  You will love the amell of this.i dont know y they have me writing all of this. It is a great product.
B005KBSHXQ|5|I recieved this package extremely fast, like within two or three business days! And from trying out this mascara I definitely know now that I want to purchase it in the full size when i run out. Definitely worth givin a try, it lengthens my eyelashes without clumping and it doesnt crack or run throughout the day. BUt it also come off easily!
B00KLLKYGI|5|Builds a great tan and looks natural.  It smells wonderful and i love the fact that it is natural and organic.  Drys and absorbes fast so you don't have to wait a long time before you get dressed or go to bed.  My new favorite self tanner!
B000BIXP3A|1|I was really disappointed in this shampoo. I have heard so many good things about it. I didn't feel like it actually cleaned anything, and it definitely didn't help my hair, it weighed it down and probably because my hair wasn't getting washed with this stuff.
B001S0UGTQ|5|I absolutely love this lotion.  It smells great and makes the skin soft and hydrated.  I would buy this again.  Thank you for your fast service and great packaging.
B0092MCOI8|5|My picky 15 year old sister loved it . That says something, trust me.
B00166AZPC|5|I get super dry skin by the end of the day from washing my hands hundreds of times. I put this on at bedtime, and by morning, my hands are back to normal. It has no scent to speak of, which is good because perfumes and fragrances make me sneeze. I have been using this for a long time. My only complaint about this listing, is that the item I received was a tiny 4 ounces. I was expecting the normal size for the price I paid here. My recommendation is to buy this elsewhere and get your money's worth.
B00HJC5JLM|5|Love this product.  Easy to use and chip resistant.
B001KQ77ZO|5|This helps to get rid of any bad energy in your way or your surroundings this is ised to help build self esteem
B00AQX87M4|4|I've been using this instead of the instant freeze pen.  I can't say it works as well, but it's much cheaper and feels great going on.
B001HBR3VU|5|Works great, happy I purchased it. It does not leave my head sore or anything and I have thick kinky hair. It's quite comfortable to use.
B000VKV28S|5|Have had 3 Norelco's before, including 2 of the ones that have lotion inside of them and this Panasonic is by far the closest shave I've ever had from an electric.  No razor burn, even the first time I used it.  I highly recommend this razor.
B002DW71XM|5|I've tried many mascaras from drugstore to department store and this is by far the best.  It volumizes and lengthens without looking unnatural.  It is also gentle on the lashes, I would very much recommend this mascara.
B000C1ZANE|5|This cologne is a unique, classic old school fragrance that will never be beat. My father wore, now I do.
B00763LZWQ|5|Product and price were a good bargain and happy with this purchase.
B009JJA49U|4|But quickly plateaus. Within 10 days, lightened my pigmentation by 50%, but no improvement beyond that. Like dermatologists say, there is no cure for it, only improvement. Overall happy. Recommended.
B00ELUZ68G|5|Always as expected- works wonderful and I love the long lasting color!
B000UY832I|1|Container arrived empty!!! Returned it for credit. Disappointed
B00D8XLAUA|5|nice really pretty
B004Y1OL7Y|5|These nail polish stickers are the easy way to change nail color in a jiffy. It takes about 10 minutes and your nails are already dry. The greatest invention since the light bulb.
B00BWSRFB6|5|They taste great, and even make me type faster. 5/6 jaw jitters!
B0012MVGIU|3|Well, I have to say this is an okay product.  Would be great for kids, but I bought it mainly to use as a body wash.  Good for that, but doesn't lather much.  As a shampoo/conditioner, it is acceptable, but on the so-so side.  Leaves a little reside that builds up and weighs down my fine hair, so I don't use it every day.  Think it would weigh down a child's hair even more.  Useful for traveling, camping, at the gym, etc. when you are in a hurry or want a multi-purpose product for convenience or to save space.  Smells nice, very \\"melony\\", but not too strong.  Will buy again, but I don't use every day...
B00E421ZDQ|2|I love the scent, however, the bottle arrived open and leaking.  I would love to try it again...
B002SJ4ADO|5|I have very sensitive skin and shaving has always been a problem for me. I use a Braun electric and have for years, this just makes it glide and I rarely get razor burn.
B004YBW5T0|5|I will order again
B002S8PTMQ|5|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  Very neutral colors and even colors to give yourself a smokey eye look.
B002U29T80|3|It's really greasy when you use it in the shower, so make sure not to slip on whatever drains onto the tub floor! After it dries it does leave my skin feeling very soft.
B0019YTDK4|5|Bought this perfume for my girlfriend. It has been her favorite perfume for a while. It has a nice sweet scent to it.
B000CSQV3A|2|I did not like this product. It is a deep moisturizer that is thick and feels sticky. It would be good if you had say chapped cheeks. For every day use, no! It broke me out just a bit with acne due to it's not breathing well. My bottle arrived with a bit of oil floating around on top of a very thick goo. Maybe it was old or something, I don't know, but it didn't look smooth at all, and it just felt too gooey for me. I like the radiance day creme.
B004TB9SFE|5|I used the cream three times a day, as directed by my radiation doctor. At the end of my 28 radiation treatments I had no burns whatsoever. I highly recommend this product.
B000JWO7I0|5|My wife uses this because she has problems getting to the bathroom at times. It shipped very quick. Excellent quality and came fully assembled. Can be used over existing toilet which is a benefit but haven't used for that yet.
B000VDES6I|1|Although I can get a 'few' uses out of them, these rollers are very cheaply made.  After opening the bag, noticed right off the seams weren't sewn properly and the wires were already poking out of the ends.  Choose a different brand other than these to try.  Disappointing.
B003XQ7A38|5|This is the best face wash I've ever tried. I've had acne on and off for about 10 yrs.    NO ALCOHOLS, ONLY DECYL GLUCOSIDE as detergent(foaming agent), NO SLS or Cocamidopropyl betaine...so no drying, irritating effect.    I don't know how effective the Vitamin A is in a wash, but Glycolic Acid works the best as a cleanser for my skin.    Note: Glycerin is a drying agent on the skin contrary to popular belief! It attracts moistore from your pores to the surface of your skin. It especially acts very drying when used in a wash or shave cream because the moisture is drawn to the surface only to washed away. Unfortunately it is in about every skincare product. That is the only ingredient I don't like in this wash. I'd rather see lanolin instead. Lanolin (antifungal and antibacterial) acts as a skin protectant and locks in moisture while letting your skin breath naturally.
B009JH5I5W|1|Although I like the color, it was abit too sheer when applied and came off easily.  Would like to see this color come out from MAC in a creme formulation.
B00385WMKA|5|Used this on my long hair and worked great!  It's quite tedius though having to pull each strand of hair through the cap, however saves me lots of money that I would have otherwise spent at a salon.
B00DP4N1R2|5|I recently got into aromatherapy and was so excited to try this lavender oil. I'm not a huge flower scent fan and was worried this would be too strong for me but I was wrong. The smell is light and smells really good. I use it in my diffuser at night when my husband and I lay in bed. It has helped up relax so much. I've noticed I fall asleep faster with this oil. This oil is great for more than just aromatherapy. You can use it for first aid for relief from cuts, scratches, bug bites, and minor burns too. It helps cold sores, migraines, allergies, sinus congestion and more. I can't believe I went so long not knowing about Lavender oil and all the uses it has. I love this stuff now and definitely will make sure I always have it on hand. *sample provided for testing and review*
B000NL0T1G|5|Have always been intrigued by this type of shaving.  Reminds me of my father and Grandfather.  I bought this razor after visiting a store that specializes in shaving.  I couldn't believe the prices of their razors so I bought this one here along with a brush, stand, bowl and shave soap.  This razor is extremely sharp and offers a great close shave that when you are finished feels like a million bucks and is as close if not closer than my Hydro 5.  Plus, it makes shaving a pleasurable experience.  I highly recommend this razor and this shaving technique.
B00ID1OAJU|4|Just right for my fine hair!
B00BJGBEXG|4|Good
B000GLRREU|5|Recomended by my dental hygienist. Works great! Bought two additional units for each of my children who are away from home in college. I'm certain that as as they age, they'll both need far less dental work than I did.
B00880WINQ|1|This stuff made me break out horribly after a few weeks of use, and my skin became much more oily due to the over-drying side effect of this product, even using it only once a day. Will not be buying again.
B003ZX32ZO|1|I've boughten a lot of eco tool brushes before from stores like Ulta and Sephora. These arrived but they looked fake as soon as I opened them. The bristles are too shiny and the bamboo stick part it s bit too yellow in color. I compared them with other eco tool brushes and they definitely look different. Not sure if they're original ones or fake but I won't be buying from this seller again
B000LLYE8W|4|I like that there are not additives and no fake scents.  It last alot longer than other glycerine type soaps
B00J1AEGUU|5|Great product
B000C1UEWG|3|It does smell different I give you that.  But it is not as pleasant as say a summer fragrance such as Lacoste or Burberry Summer, nor a fall fragrance such as Armani Mania/Code.<br /><br />it is stuck somewhere in the spectrum of fragrances with it's unique soapy smell.  Not my first choice by a long shot.
B00SAATNZU|5|Very unique looking scrub hat.  Fits well.  Ordered one for my coworker who fell in love with my hat.
B003YJAZZ4|5|very good i like it so much~~~its too big ~~~Perfect very good i like it so much~~~its too big ~~~Perfect
B001T0HHCE|3|This item is alright.  It gets the job done by straightening the roots of hair. However, I think it works best on people with relaxed or texturized hair, not recommended for curly kinky hair. The thin teeth in the comb attachments would cause a lot of pain to the person using it. I also think you can't use this item alone. A flat iron would have to finish the job of styling your hair. Yet, it can really get your hair line smooth without burning your skin, great for pinned up hair styles. Lastly, a DVD came with the product. It was so badly scratched I could not watch it. So, I watched it on YouTube, it just explained how use the item. I thought maybe the DVD had better instructions than the printed instructions inside the box. It didn't, its the same.
B002F3VBLM|5|Hard to find, but it's the best lip plumper!
B00DCEBD2U|4|Nice smell and good alternate for the original conditioner. Prefer the original but opted for the lighter on recommendation of my hairdresser since my hair is fine. It works well but doesn't tame as much.
B00D9NV2D4|5|Super smooth, fantastic product, customer service and recipe ebook. Will purchase again and again!! Thanks!!
B0009OAGNS|5|Love this smell!
B00085DX0Q|3|I loved the smell, but it didn't  last long,lathered well, but oddly enough it dried out my hair and scalp Guess Im not mountain man enough. Used it in my beard too, over all score..meh.
B00FL30T2K|4|Now to be honest,, I'm not a heavy cologne guy, but when I was younger I had Fahrenheit and girls loved the smell as did I. This is very similar, as I cannot tell the difference and the price is the best offer you can get. I've looked and have come to the conclusion that if you are looking for a deal on an imitation, you will not find anything better than this deal.
B00M9NK43E|5|I use this stool in my Reiki practice. I love the quality of the product. It is very comfortable -- even when I sit on it for a long session. It rolls very easily and looks very professional.
B00V03LNPM|5|OPI nail lacquer rocks! First the colors are slammin' The variety is encless and absolutely fabulous. Second the application is always smooth even at the bottom of the bottle. Third and most importantly, the polish dries solidly and I don't ever worry about holding my fingers in that stiff looking pose. It's the best!
B009FAPVJG|1|After seeing the hype this mascara was getting on T.V I decided to try it out. I was looking for clump free, easy application, and the cool curves for cat eyes like the product advertised. I got none of this, it was SO VERY CLUMPY I was picking clumps off my eyelashes, I didn't let it dry between coats, as the packet instructed so I know it was not how I was putting it on. The curved brush was not pretty and yellow like the packet showed at it looked average just like all the other brushes, nothing new here. It did not create volume or feline lashes, this is just a poor quality mascara in a pretty packet.<br />I would not recomend this mascara to anyone it was a colossal letdown.
B004JYL6F6|4|I have used this product before my purchased.
B00HE67BC8|5|I have used this for several months now. They way I use this is to fill DISTILLED water to the line and put a drop of an essential oil on the top of the water. The aroma fills the room perfectly. I haven't had any problems with this unit. The light is awesome, adjustable. You can let it slowly cycle through the colors, stop on a color, or let it run with no light. It is light weight and looks nice.
B00CE2C2CG|5|My body loves this pure shea butter!  Shea scentsations is changing my skin - I get so many compliments on how smooth and healthy my skin has become! At first it seemed thick, but quickly melts so that a little spreads all over.  I like that it is so pure - no additives, no waxy feel.  It has become both my husband and my favorite skin product.  The dry skin on my shoulders and legs is no more!! You will love it too!!
B000NN3GCI|5|I've been looking for another place to purchase the Dax Pomade.  I use to purchase it at Walmart, but it has been hard to find recently.  Thanks.
B005LN5I3A|5|I love this product and I'll be back for more.  No, it isn't the most 'inexpensive' product... but its effectiveness and the ability to remove stubborn 'waterproof' eye makeup without bringing tears to my eyes makes it worth the $$$.<br />I'll happily put a tube of this in my travel kit so I won't be without it!
B00152TRRE|5|love this cologne, delivery was fast
B00HQUXRDY|5|Great Product, very pleased!
B004WYB1K8|5|I purchased this serum due to acne scars.  I can honestly say that this product does just what it says.  You will see clearer skin in about a month as long as you follow the instructions.
B005LQ006W|3|I bought the multiple amount to save time from running back so often to Walmart<br />the only complaint I have is that Axe is not available in like maybe 3 and 3 different scents<br />instead of all the same smell<br />  Roger Raby 3/7/14
B000CSDDDG|5|These are my holy grail for exfoliation. Pairs great with expensive soap you want to hold onto for a while. Just rub soap on this and lather away! I have these in my travel bag and at home. I don't feel clean without it.
B00FS2N3FE|5|Never before considered an electric toothbrush.  My dentist suggested it just to help keep my limited tarter and plaque away.  It takes several brushings to get to a point where the action does not tickle so much.  I do tend to make a mess on my mirror with toothpaste residue.  Works great.  Can't wait to see how much improved my teeth care may be at my next 6 month checkup at the dentist.
B006XJCHG2|1|I've been using this product now for 27 days. Last week or so I started having short breath. About 7 hours after taking it, I get short breath & can't breath. It last about 12-15hrs Then of course start all over again when i take it again. It's very scary. I only take 1 scoop or a little less with 10 ounce of water. Today is when I put an end to this to see if this product is really the cause. I get 4 hrs of sleep cz of this. I will write another review in 1 week or as soon as my new problem disappear.<br />Update: sure enough 2days after not taken it my short breath is gone. A week later I got back on it jst to make sure and the short breath came back. I talked to so many ppl about it & most ppl said it could b a bad container. I am now on the same brand but the progormance kind & it's been 2 weeks so far & I'm doing ok no side affect.
B00NAQP4AM|3|This is not exactly a very well made wig. I was devastated when I opened the box because it looked like a terrible wig. I was sure I had wasted the money I spent on it until I tried it on. Surprisingly, it looks fairly decent when being worn, not looking nearly as thin or messy as when I had first opened it. I would say that you might want to look elsewhere for a wig, but if this style is what you really really want, then go ahead, because it might still be wearable and decent looking.
B0076OHZVK|4|I love the product but the color isn't lilac.
B006GQYSGO|5|Best thing ever invented for shaving.
B002JAYMEE|5|Has a soft and smooth feel to it after it dries. Makes my skin feel so smooth and works great in the sun.
B00U3CMZXA|5|Great
B004J48Q4U|4|very warm and sexy oil. perfect after bath time! great scent too :) I will buy again for sure :D
B00WL6SVLG|3|Rubs off very easily. Not impressed with the quality.
B00MEAUHJI|5|This is the fourth day I'm sleeping in this mask and I honestly cannot think of anything negative to say...<br />shipped quickly and the bag the mask came in is beautiful and blue... It and the mask match my room perfectly and I keep it in the bag on my nightstand when I'm not using it.<br />Since starting third shift I've had trouble falling asleep because my room was too bright.. that is no longer and issue without having to invest in heavy light blocking curtians or blinds. This blocks the light perfectly with out being heavy or hot. I was worried it would cause me to break out but so far no problem there. It fell off the first night but if I put it under my hair that's not a problem. I've always though my head was kind of big but I have no problem with the fit of this mask. And it's easy to change the size while wearing.<br />when I started shopping for an eye mask I wanted something pretty as well as functional and I am happy to have found the perfect mask on the first try. :)
B00VIMYF82|5|I received this product free for review but as always, despite receiving a free product I'm perfectly candid in my review.  My observations follow below in more or less chronological order.<br /><br />I love the smell of the Frankinsense oil.  It's spicy and earthy and a little bit exotic, a wonderful smell.  I have used it in a diffuser and also have mixed it with the carrier oil and put it on my hands to help relieve dryness.<br /><br />The Frankinsense bottle has a dropper lid, which I really like.  It makes measuring/counting drops very easy.<br /><br />I like the pump bottle for the rosehip oil.  It jammed on the first use but since then has been fine.<br /><br />The rosehip oil has no scent so it does not detract from the essential oil's fragrance.  It rubs into my skin easily and doesn't feel heavy, although it does feel a little slippery on my skin.  I haven't used it regularly so I can't address any effect it has had on dryness.<br /><br />PS: I hope my review was helpful.  If it was not, then please let me know what I left out that you’d want to know.  I always aim to improve.
B00880WKPC|4|Good soap so far - just received it.  It's a PanOxyl 10 replacement since Steifel decided to stop making it.  This soap has a scent, but it's sort of soapy/perfumy.  It's not bad and it doesn't leave the smell on your skin (in my opinion).  The bars are smaller than PanOxyl bars so you'll go through it a little faster.  Also, this soap leaves no soap film residue on your skin.
B000B3ZC72|5|love it the color is beautiful red,I wore this color and went to the mall with my sister and couple of ladies noticed my nail color and asked what was the brand name ,and I said Opi and its called Opi Opi Red nail lacquer,they said its the perfect red for the holidays to wear and I said buy it from amazon.com the best price they have and they said wow.
B00240UWGG|4|This brand works the best for me.  Not running out ever is pretty nice too.
B001XURHG6|4|I've tried more than a few different bowls and mugs over the years and this one can hold it's own!  Wide enough for a heavy brush and deep enough to hold on to your lather with minimum spill over. It may not be the high-end luxurious collectors mug, but for actual use it stands up rather well, especially considering the very reasonable price.
B000S56AX8|4|Love the smell I meant to buy the creme for styling my hair but this works just as good. The lady's always asking what the products is they love the smell also
B001AWJ4B8|1|Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle rose shampoo left my hair feeling hard, dry and tangled.  I had to use a different brand of shampoo and conditioner (Pantene Relaxed and Natural) to correct the problem.
B0035LCSH4|5|Sticks are sticks. What can I say. There are lots of them in the kit. Probable more than I will use in a few years.
B00W69DLFO|5|I absolutely adore essential oils, and lemon is no different. The scent is so uplifting and energizing, a few drops can help get you going in the morning. I mostly use it for the aromatherapy side, lemon can be a little harder on the skin if you use too much, so be sure to use a carrier oil if you do so and be sure you wear sunscreen later as it can make your skin a tad sensitive to the sun. There is no dropper in this bottle, just open and pour, so if you use one or two drops at a time, I would suggest switching your bottles of adding a dropper. If you use it for cleaning and in home made recipes like dish washing detergent or in spray cleaner, then you won't need to do this. It makes a fantastic addition to my spray vinegar cleaner. A little dawn, a decent amount of vinegar, a little water and some lemon oil. This works fantastic in place of chemicals in the kitchen. It's safe to use around kids and still kills the germs. The oil smells exactly like a fresh squeezed lemon and makes my mouth water when I smell it. It smells clean.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. EVERYTHING IN THIS REVIEW IS 100% MY OWN AND IN NO WAY INFLUENCED
B00IUHYA7O|1|Bottle hlf empty and not filled with mousse solution..... Waiting on a refund.
B006UUYLR2|5|I was surprised at how well this product worked for me.  I am hesitant to buy new things, as I have very sensitive skin and my vaginal area is very fragile. I love that it is easy to pump and the foam comes out smoothly. The bottle is perfectly sized and doesn't look awkward in the bathroom. You can determine the amount you use by how many pumps you want. I really am glad I purchased this one and will continue to use it as long as it is available.  UPDATE I have been using this product now for several months. Recently I moved and went out of town on a trip, not able to bring this. I very much missed it after two weeks. I can feel and tell a huge difference without it.
B00M1NMY76|5|Great brushes so far!
B0034BUQ42|1|This lotion came in this afternoon and I was very excited to try it! I opened up the box and took the lid off just to have liquid pour out onto my carpet and arm. The lotion look like it has been separated. It's clumpy and has like an oil mixed in. I took a photo but I'm not sure how to upload it. If I figure it out, then I will! This is disgusting!
B004VDVLA0|4|Good product but my finger always gets caught in the clamping mechanism. For some reason
B00JBCCGUK|5|never experienced anything but &#34;great&#34; from waterpik!
B00GUJJFRY|4|i thought the hat was going to be a dark grey color but when i got it, it was a purple kinda color. it doesnt look bad but i really thought it was going to be dark grey
B00AEUNJPY|5|I have been searching for this product my entire life. It's basically liquid silk once you spread it on – very hard to describe except to say it's perfect. It somehow manages to rinse completely clean, but at the same time it leaves your skin moisturized. Don't necessarily be put off by the price, because a little goes a very long way – this isn't like your standard can of foam from the drugstore.
B001KYQN6K|5|Cover Girl Continuous Color Lipstick is my favorite brand of lipstick and has been for thirty years. A lot of the reviews say that it doesn't last but it does if you put it on correctly. Any lipstick must be blotted if you want it to last, you have to remove the oil but pursing your lips on a tissue, and then it will last all day...or until you eat, and then you must re-apply. I come from the age of women that always wore lipstick, not balms and chapsticks. Always blot your lipstick.
B0010ZU7E8|5|I had the good fortune to smell this burning in a shop I frequent and immediately inquired about it. I purchase a small package of them on the spot and then went home to see what was being offered on Amazon. I bought more, of course!!!
B004BASKAC|5|This was bought as a gift and I have been told that it is doing its job.
B000R8LQ9Y|5|It's been about two days that I received and stared to use this product.  I purchased the CDS and the ReWetting solutions.  I have already seen a great improvement in my RGPs.  I, like many, have been using RGPs for over 35 years and started to get very itchy eyes.  Since I was in need of replenishing my solution decided to research other products for my contact lenses.  I was so glad to have found the optimum solutions.  I just hope these solutions will continue to be available.  Definitely recommended...
B009OZ715O|5|Not used yet but am sure they will work for me.
B00A1WCMDA|4|This cream really work I see the different  I feel less stomach  :p
B0012BNVE8|4|I know this product is intended for the crown of your head but I have to tell you I have been using this product for 2 years on my frontal hairline and it has come with absolute great success! While I do have a hairline that sits farther back than normal, most of the gentleman in my family are either completely bald or half way there. I have to attribute this to my consistent use of Rogain. I don't dare stop using it to see if my theory is wrong because I am enjoying a full head of hair. From my research the only reason Rogaine's parent company does not advertise this for the frontal hairline is because they never tested it to do so. I'm not the only one who has had success with the front hairline either. Many others I spoke with who tried it on a whim have agreed. While I can't say it helps grow hair in the front I can say it absolutely stops you from losing that hair, at least that's what happened in my situation. I think for the price Amazon offers it and the success myself and others have had why not try it for frontal hairline loss? What do you have to lose besides more hair?!
B00277JKY6|1|Have purchased this product before from retail stores and love it. Ordered it from Amazon because of the great price. The product is watery. It is awful to try to put on. It does not smell right either. Very disappointing!
B00R7L65Y0|5|Very good!
B0009P4PZC|4|I did not realize this would be plain old coconut oil, I should have just purchased  plain old coconut oil that is cooking grade in the Health Food Store.  That being said, still great for your skin, I also use in my hair with barely a touch of it warmed up in my hands when my hair needs a little control.  Good stuff, but a better deal if you buy the mayonnaise jar size at the grocery or health food store.
B00I8CDXZ6|5|I love this Argan oil. We have well water and this really helps to keep my hair from drying out. I also love how it makes my face feel!
B00HGU5SLS|2|can't figure out how to make the buns stay, it always seem to fall
B00EJDIWNG|5|I have all three versions of this powder (translucent, corrective yellow and shimmer). It's great! It leaves your face looking absolutely flawless! However, you should use a light hand with it and I wouldn't recommend it as a setting powder - I am extremely fair and if I apply too much it does make me look ghostly. Instead, I use it as a finishing powder, just a light application to seal in my makeup after I've finished everything and, for that purpose, it is absolutely AMAZING! I will repurchase this over and over again, although one container lasts forever ($6 on the ELF website).
B0084FC6PU|5|I'm pretty sure this product was not made for my type of hair - I'm part Cherokee and part Irish, but I got the big poofy hair from the latter part of my lineage. I have bought TONS of hair products - just trying to find the right product for my unruly hair. This stuff WORKS and is the only product I have ever kept going back to buy over and over again. Not a big fan of the smell, but you don't smell it after about 10 mins and it works so well I wouldn't care if it did.
B00021C1LI|5|I had seen several presentations on this on QVC, and wondered if it really did what was claimed. It claims that it gets makeup off in one step, and you do not need toner.  When I used it for the first time, I said WOW!  It got mascara off like I had never been able to get it off before, and my face did feel as though I had used toner; it did not feel tight,just clean.  No more extra steps for toner and eye makeup remover, because Purity Made Simple does it all.  Amazon has it on Subscribe and Save, so I will order it that way next time.
B000VKZMHK|5|I've had this electric razor for 5 years and it still works like a charm!  Honestly I hardly clean it anymore and have NEVER changed the blade inside.  I travel A LOT with this razor and one thing that really sticks out for me is the battery life.  I can probably go about 2 weeks without charging it and using it for 3-4 minutes each time.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a proven, reliable, charger.
B00AEYGIR6|5|in love:)....
B005GO5C44|5|Great whitening toothpaste, the improvements are clear after months of using this product.
B00C674BHS|3|o.k. just wish it was a tad darker
B00KU0HC5G|5|I bought these orginally at a pharmacy type store for an outrageous price.  But it is hard to find purples and blues that are vibrant and not have black mixed in them so they look really dark.  After I tried them and liked the colors, I bought more here for a much better price!  I mean $3 each less.  They are a great eyeliner and does stay on all day.  And the colors are beautiful.  I will be reordering them from here.
B004WPGXMI|5|luv it
B000KL1N3C|4|Does a very good job of crushing. It will do whole small pills pretty easily. The top part is gentle on the hand to grasp and turn, but the bottom part is sharp-edged and tough on the hands. I always get a towel to grab the bottom half and use it that way.
B009GYVMAS|5|This is amazing!!!! Love it. In the span of me using it ( which hasn't been that long) it has balanced my skin and it brightens it as well.I work alot and it has helped me not look so tired.who could ask for anything else?
B003RUOMHC|5|Trimmer is powerful & sharp. Blade didn't need much adjusting. Trimmer runs fast & does not get hot. I like this trimmer so much that I put my Andis T-Edjer up. After all the you tube videos I saw especially the ones from Ron Legend I'm now a believer for myself
B000P22TIY|4|nice smell my hubby likes it
B00AXDCVB0|4|The product itself worked great. Skin felt smooth and soft, with less noticeable pores immediately after application.  Just hard to keep on your face and apply the mask without ripping it.
B004FJ3QQM|2|This trimmer was larger than expected and therefore did not do a good job of close trimming and outlining of a goatee.  Nice quality, but had to return due to size.
B001ECQ4TY|5|Refreshing scent and deep cleaning action with no drying.  I love this stuff.  It is lighter than regular cold cream, which I find greasy.  It's hard to find but worth the hunt.
B00BP0WABG|5|I rubbed it isn't like lotion two times before tattoo and a couple times after the skin was broken while he would be switching needles or what have you and it's the most painless tattoo ever I have a lot of ink and did my whole chest with this and was nearly painless
B0037TM252|4|I've been using Lipogaine for about 2 years. I wouldn't have continued to buy it if it didn't work. It does leave my hair somewhat crispy after I use it though. Expect better results with consistency of use. I began seeing results after 4 weeks. The 6 month mark was about the best it has ever looked. If you want to keep the little hair you have left for a couple more years, I say go for it!
B003RF82UK|5|I was a huge fan of Clinique's Moisture Surge, but took it out of my budget 2 years ago when I switched careers. I've been looking for a gel moisturizer ever since then. This stuff is amazing! My skin is extremely sensitive (I have rosacea on my cheeks which results in red blotchiness and bumps), dryness from prescription Retin-A, and sometimes oily chin or other problem spots. Other moisturizers (even some formulated for sensitive skin) caused my face to burn and turn hot pink or left me feeling greasy and broke my face out. I've had neither of these problems six months (and 2 jars) later. Just to clear up any confusion, this is not a cream; it's a gel. Applying it is kind of like applying aloe vera, minus the stickiness. It feels smooth and refreshing on. My (acne-prone) baby sister was immediately sold when I gave her a sample and is now an avid fan. At this price (comparable or less than any major drugstore brand moisturizer), I think I'm going to stock up. If they discontinue this product, I'll be heartbroken.
B00BOJRGGM|5|Love it!
B00X4YGPYE|4|love the smell
B00LGZ86VI|5|Beautiful finish for brown skinned women like my self who dont want to have that oily look that foundations can leave I love this powder because it give a Matte Finish and its pretty light in its depth.
B007AMR69E|5|delicious scent!
B000C1VYBG|5|Wonderful, unique fragrance! I get many positive comments!!!
B003XU2YCQ|1|The bottle came filled with WATER please don't play with people like that. WHo does that? filling a spray bottle with WATER. people, Ignore this seller if you dont  want to lose your money~~~
B002CMLHBK|5|Matrix Color Smart Shampoo and Conditioner are excellent products for color treated hair. Color Smart Shampoo teamed with Conditioner leaves your hair soft and shiny.
B00262CQ1Q|4|I purchased these two products because I thought it would be useful to \\"clean house\\" after many years of refraining to do so.  I have heard many of the advertisements regarding the health benefits of acai berry juice extracts and also keeping a high amount of fiber in your diet.  I was by no means attempting to lose weight (5'10\\" & 150 lbs.) or anything but as a lacto-ovo vegetarian by choice, I am usually prone to assist my system in any way possible in avoiding future problems with intestinal related issues.  The first week I tried following the instructions but took the capsules without eating and got a bit of a stomach ache which wasn't a problem as I suspected this might be the case.  After a week, I noticed that I felt I had a bit more energy and was a bit more regular which is noticeable when you keep track of these things.  I am always willing to try something that is deemed \\"healthy\\" and have not been disappointed thus far for the price and speedy shipping to my location.  As others have stated, there are no miracle drugs and this did what I thought it would do for my system.  Very satisfied.
B0036BJLJ6|5|I got this set to do a french tip manicure... the nail polish was amazing and I'm going to definitely order more
B00BQHAYK2|3|it came on time and its long I just thought it would look more like the pic. Try for yourself
B008D6ZX4Q|5|Great headband for any size of head. I am very petite so it is hard to find headbands that fit my head. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00E3HYW5A|3|A bit thin for my intended use in the shower, and not as sudsy as my last body wash.  I had to try something new since my previous brand was discontinued.  This is OK, but I'm not sure I will purchase again.  Nothing wrong with it, just I like more lather.  I do appreciate that its ingredients list is easily readable and not very long.  That is a plus in my book.
B003COAFPQ|5|I love love love this product! It does not have the best smell but it does wonders on my hair. It is a little cheaper on another website but it is a great product.
B001257R4O|5|Wonderful incense!
B001DNE3KQ|5|I bought this razor as a present for my 90 year old grandfather's 91st birthday. I have the 4 blade razor and just know how much he will appreciate it. After the party I will tell you his reaction.
B0069SQF60|5|I have been using patchouli for a lifetime now. This is among the best I have ever used. I use it instead of cologne. I love the fragrance and it is beneficial. I just used the patchouli in a batch of homemade soap and it works great. I have also used it as an essential ingredient in a DIYsalve. I highly recommend buying this product as I will continue to be a happy customer.
B001A82DY2|5|I'm sure I would be wearing a wig by now if a friend had not introduced me to XFusion. My hair is thin and I sprinkle the Light Brown in the crown of my head and the skin does not shine through my hair. It is a wonderful product. Rinses out on the days when I do not want to use shampoo but just rinse my hair in the shower.
B004ZD2M6I|5|It really does a great job on my skin...my only problem is trying to remember to use it as often as is recommended.
B00LXQ9OT8|5|Very nice quality wood-handled angle brush. Works great for application of eyebrow color.
B002HWS9FW|5|Working great so far!  -But It seems to brush at about 1/2 the speed of our old chargeable Oral-B brushes.  Can't beat the price!
B007VTRRPE|5|I loved the plastic bottle in that it is not too heavy and the size; I was most pleased.  This was the best purchase I've made all year.  Fast delivery time.  Thanks
B003WVR9Y4|5|I used this product when on the go and it is life save. It does make pimple disappear faster. Easy to apply and easy to use.
B00NFYJN1A|5|I love this product I just wished that Lysol would not have stop selling it in the store. I purchased enough for 6 months but I use it so much that I need to buy more next month. I love this product.
B00NBCD7MW|5|Tried Younique - loved it, so was not too excited to try another a different brand, but Younique isn't as &#34;available&#34; as I want it to be.  I absolutely love it, no fibers in my eyes, and they look fantastic - definately switching.
B0027LSEPS|4|works ok could be more powerful, easy to use, nice size for travel, the way it folds up is a nice size
B00ATFJ8NQ|5|I have been using this line of shampoo for a couple of years now. I have tried various formulas, and like all of them. I'm excited to see what the next new fragrance will be. I received this product ahead of schedule. I will be back for more.
B0036MSS12|4|Should you get this? Yes. First time I used it I actually had a smile after the shower. I felt cool/icy and my skin felt amazing. Great product but the oil in it does mix we'll and settles at the too. Its okay though cause it doesn't effect the use I'd the product. It is very oily but I kinda liked that I still felt clean and not greasy. I just wish the jar was bigger or easier to work with the product and remove it from the jar. Overall though great seller and product...try it!
B001VCUQE6|5|Item came fast. Great blades. Stay sharp for a long time.
B000ET4MTW|5|Ever since my dentist gave me a sample pack, I have used these Rota-Points.  I prefer them over floss and apparently they work as well.  Great product.
B00IMPUTGU|4|Exactly as described.  Good stuff!
B001G47L24|5|I have concerns with the use of fluoride in tooth paste and was researching alternatives when I came across Miswak sticks so I decided to give it a try. I was not sure what to expect, but it turned to be a very positive experience. It's a little hard to get used to at first but when I use it my teeth feel as clean as they do when I leave the dentist. I don't use toothpaste anymore but I do use mouthwash. I found one at the health food store that uses essential oils and is fluoride free. I have not really experienced whiter teeth like other people have but I drink a lot of coffee. I love it though!
B00NWUBZFE|5|My soninlaw loved it. great unbrella.
B003F8DUUG|5|I like Fixodent always have thought I would give the FREE a try better for you I heard.So far so good still get great hold good price. I would recommend
B00IX3K380|5|I always wanted something amazing, cute and glamorous at the same time. Glitter is always a favorite but it’s hard to place them on things sometimes. Imagine my surprise when I saw the Glitter spray. It’s pretty amusing to use.
B001A3ATP2|5|You would be silly not to get this deal
B00MZXT790|1|Didn't do a thing for me - complete waste of money
B00DUJ8OQA|4|very potent,  pure, seems to be good quality thank you for this product ,  will buy again  Sarah
B0015S9NNG|5|Great!  My wife has broken both of her hips and uses two of these instead of a walker allowing her greater mobility. After 20 years in the health care field I would highly recommend this stick for general and orthopedic use.  She also receives comments about the stick almost everytime she uses them in public; people seem to love them and want to know where they can be purchased.
B000052YJB|5|The buff puff back scrubber is the best bath tool ever But they can not be found in stores.
B004RAA5HW|1|Been using this for two weeks and it is not working! I'm not a big sweater but after two hours sitting at my desk at work I can smell myself, which is just gross. I've never smelled like body odor in my life, and wanted to give this deodorant another chance but every day is the same. I do not recommend lavanila, I'm so disappointed.
B00AQCDWUM|3|i am using one of CNP's ample, and it is just awesome product<br />so i believed this product would be an awesome product as well<br />but ummm... yeah...<br />it covers some blackheads, pimples, etc but it dries up my skin
B00DPE9EQO|1|great stuff: 5 stars
B003F18DD2|5|After seeing this color on a friend I HAD to have it.  Well... it is discontinued by OPI so its hard to find.  Some sellers were pricing it at $20.  I got this one for around $7.  Its the real deal and got to me quickly.  Glad I shopped around.
B00EYZY652|4|I received a sample of items to try out. I am a hair junkie and have tried multiple brands. I have used exclusively salon quality products for the last 25 years. This mask is a nice mask for color treated hair. It is not the best that I have encountered but it is up there. The main problem that I have is that I feel there is a residue left in my hair. It gave me shine, but I wouldn't say it made it any softer then my normal products.<br /><br />I am also sensitive to smells and didn't care for this fragrance. It was too overwhelming for me.<br /><br />I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.
B001CYA08K|5|The shippment came fast. The ointment is a kind of thick but absorbs very fast. No oily or messy feeling. I used it about two weeks.  My scar is lighter and little flattened.  Although it is a little pricy, but it worths.
B00GWBR5N6|5|Thank you! Great product! :)
B00A9W994C|5|Really nice cream and it does what it´s supposed to do. I used it after skin treatment, and it helped with healing.
B004MJVVBC|5|Very well received as a gardeners gift.  Lathers well, cleans, lovely fragrance.  Would buy again even at the slightly high price point.  It's a good one.
B000WSJZ5Q|2|These are not meant to be candles that you light to make your room smell nice. They do smell really really nice, but they are so tiny (tea lights, really) that you couldn't burn them for more than 15 minutes. In fact, the instructions tell you to burn them for only 15 minutes, which really isn't that helpful for me. They are lovely, but too small to be useful. I have bought \\"travel candles\\" that are 5x the size of these.
B0007CXXPU|5|This is a great product!  I do not understand why companies who have a great product and sell so many they can't keep it stocked just stop making the product.
B000OYLBJG|5|THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT!  LOVE THE SMELL AND HOW IT HELPS WITH REALLY DRY SKIN.  I USE THIS PRODUCT EVERYDAY!!!!!
B00I5YK8QE|5|Excellent, better than former models...
B00DROWKHM|5|Works good.  Gives the illusion of thicker hair doesn't rub off on your clothes but stays in place before washing your hair.  It's one of the better options out there. I don't like Joan Rivers though she's sort of arrogant.
B000EBAHHG|4|Makes your skin soft and absorbs fast without leaving residues but I did not like the smell of it. Also it is a huge volume, very large container so you are stuck with it for a long time
B00FF68FDI|1|Not worth the money. Didn't work
B008I2IKMW|5|great
B00006IV2F|4|Have used this product for many years, they do eventually not heat as well after a few years and I have lost them while traveling, so I need to replace on occasion, but have not been able to find in local stores, fortunately the \\"missing from the shelves items\\" can be found on Amazon.
B00OLSSP9K|5|I'm not normally the type to write reviews, but this cream gets one from me. I'm on the younger side (24) and was beginning to get some visible fine lines under my eyes, particularly when I smiled. Within a couple of weeks of trying this on a whim, they've been substantially mitigated. If you're fighting fine lines, definitely give this one a shot.
B00E4MLXDS|5|Oh my. If you get those painful cracks in your skin around your finger nails, then you must buy this. It's just about the only thing that WORKS and is affordable. Apply several times a day for a day or two and the healing will be noticeable and the pain goes away.
B008FQGMP8|5|What a great product. Seems so far durable and easy to install. Glad I got it. The only thing is I wish there was a larger option.
B006WQ2SUQ|5|Great!
B003H7D9WO|4|This water soluble spray color was the right color and worked great.  It was not sticky or gummy when it dried and gave just the right amount of color without being too garish.
B0002AHY6Q|5|Great, I went on an extended European trip and the cordless waterpik was perfect for cleaning between teeth and keeping the gums stimulated. I highly recommend it for everyone.
B009M1K396|5|I love it so much!!! Great for my starting nail art adventure. I may need a bigger one LOL! Thank you!
B003U3329A|4|This product reminds me of the Benefit High Beam highlighter...it shows up pearly and beautiful, giving your skin a pretty glow. Although this product is cheaper, I still prefer the Benefit High Beam over this, because I think it has a better texture for my skin...if you're looking for a cheaper alternative though, then this is it
B0009ET5DA|5|Great product, but you'd better be smokin' crack to pay what this seller wants. I bought this same product and size for the low $20's at a bricks and mortar store a few months back.
B001DYK75U|2|This product arrived on time and exactly as it looked.  I bought this for my little girl's hair salon she got from Santa.  The hair is so rough and dry that you cannot comb through it (yes, I realize it is not \\"living\\" human hair).  I expected to at least be able to comb through it.  When you try to it breaks and leaves even a wide-toothed hair pick full of hair.
B000QSPDO4|4|Not exactly what one might expect in a Nag Champa.  More floral than the usual Satya Sai Baba product.  Perhaps sweeter?  Different, difficult to describe.  I suppose I like it, but I'm going to buy a box of Satya Sai Baba just to keep it familiar.<br /><br />* update, two weeks later *<br /><br />I find this product to be more consistently rolled than the usual from Satya Sai Baba.  The bamboo is very consistent as well, and just the right thickness.  Lights quickly and burns very nicely and evenly.  I'm very happy with this and will buy it again.
B008C6NO5W|4|Please keep on market--only really good leg cover cream out there!he others do not compare!It should be available in three shades!
B00K7AVGDI|4|Cute hair clips.
B004KZF7GS|1|I hate this product, my compressor stopped working two months after I purchased it and the trigger on my airbrush broke aswell. this product is not worth buying. I do not recommend anyone else to buy this product..
B0017OJ2HK|5|This cologne makes me swoon...smells manly,expensive,...and sexy!  Get it for your man, you won't be disappointed!
B00564TEQG|5|I've been using it for 2 weeks now and it seems pretty good.
B0011YYJBU|2|i used this product for three months and the half in combination with the ds shampoo  . well i had a small frontal baldness aged two years and these two products have just stopped hair loss and improved the baldness by 10% no more not as the company says it can regrow new hair :) well nothing noticeable
B00ELICNRK|1|I am a professional makeup artist and I was so excited about getting new brushes until I used the first brush. The first brush i used broke in half. The cheap hot glue I guess didn't hold the blending brush together like they thought it would. I am disappointed and returning them.
B000HLCGX6|3|Those that are looking for a toothpaste without fluoride, this is one option. As in many cases with healthy alternatives or organic products, this particular item isn't as good as many commercial grade toothpastes. By the time you're half way into brushing your teeth, you've lost the entire flavor and it seems more like you're brushing with water. The minty flavor is also not as strong as many commercial toothpastes.  Two healthy alternatives that perform better is XyliWhite's platinum mint with baking soda, which is a notch above this toothpaste and Tom's of Maine propolis & myrrh toothpaste. Tom's happens to be the better of the two, the flavor and its staying power is equal to regular toothpastes that you buy from any store. Anyone interested in the ingredients to this product, here it is:  Water, xylitol, hydrated silica, glycerin, sorbitol, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium coco-sulfate, carrageenan, tea tree leaf oil, peppermint oil, spearmint oil, papain and potassium sorbate.
B004K4LMN6|4|come with NO gloves. no after conditioner. its a good color and smells good. but its just the color... like i said. so meh.
B000GLRREU|3|It's ok. No regrets for the purchase but might juss stick to floss in future. I works as advertised, a little messy and I generally do not use it for my teeth. But, that is me.
B00LNJWTHO|4|After watching a billion make-up reviews and every other artist using this product, I attempted to see what all the fuss was about. I was currently switching between Make Up For Ever Aqua Brow in ash and Clinque Ultra Fine Brow Pencil in soft brown. This color is a bit more darker but I must admit it does layer well so go light if you don't want to brush your eyebrow for five minutes after to remove the harshness! This is the only eyebrow makeup that requires me to dab face powder over application in order to make it lighter and also mimick a natural eyebrow color that typically is a tint of ash. Use with an angled eyebrow brush (I use makeup for ever paired with the Aqua Brow).<br /><br />I think this is a great product but I will stick to Make Up For Ever/Clinque.
B00GS7OKHS|5|&#34;Well, Dr. Oz says Peptides work for wrinkles and dark spots. I do not have bad wrinkles yet, but it surely works for my dark spots. It is not drying and I have dry skin. I will buy this again.
B002O1DHIK|4|Seems to tighten the skin so I guess it's working.  Things have been a bit hectic here so I haven't been able to use it as regularly as I want.
B004BLXG5U|5|Need to use as directed. Have seen a good improvement.
B0049LUI9O|5|Great for my face!
B0012BNVE8|1|Rogaine for Men Hair Regrowth Treatment  does not work ..will not work..if it did Bruce Willis would have hair...Disappointed !
B0034BV6KA|3|I'd give it a 6-7 out 10. It does work, however it does not get as close as I'd like. Its more like a hair cut.  The thinner the cotton, the better it works.  Works enough to make a sweater or socks not visibly nubby from afar :)
B00CC89P2W|1|Please do not invest in any of the items in this clarifying therapy line like I did. I tried it and utilized their advice that by the third and fourth week my face would adjust to the new routine, but it didn't. As a matter of a fact, it got way worse! Not only was my face oily, but there were tons blackheads, red bumps, and cystic acne galore. My face has been a wreck and this stuff is definitely, not mean for oil skin people and it not clear up your acne. So please think twice.
B00A3LVMMQ|4|Hey, it holds my razor and brush quite well. Hasn't dropped them yet.
B00SETTZGE|5|Works well. Smells weird.
B0047F70B6|5|Very easy to use，Delicate texture
B00F4YQPYW|5|Love the shade of violet; goes on easily and it doesn't smudge or run during wear. I use L'Oreal Paris lip gloss also and love that product too!
B00SG3BJ7G|3|Its okay, but nothing I would not order again. It made no difference  in my hair what's so ever. It did nothing to restore it,  or add moisture, or add  volume.
B00T6JKDUI|5|Love this.  Not too abrasive like other products of this type.  Works very quickly and leaves skin smooth.
B0009XH6WI|4|This is a great hairdryer.  It works great, has a green night light and is quite convenient on the wall.  The only down side is that sometimes it is hard to turn on, may just be me though.
B006Z9UPQO|1|The pin side is not sharp and delevering time took tooooooo long.
B006OC431K|4|I now prefer to use Thinksport Livestrong as it is goes on even better over the long haul. This product has had a tendency to clump more after it had gotten hot (car, bag, etc) while the Livestrong did not.  The clumping did not go away after cooling down either.<br /><br />Orginal review:<br />We have been using Zinc Oxide (No Titanium) products for the last couple of years and have found a couple we like (Badger and Livestrong) and was hesitant to try this one.  But good EWG ratings and a clippable coupon got me to try it.  I think it is the best of the bunch so far and will be buying more.  It spreads easy and uniformly, the 'white' disappears quickly and feels a little less greasy than the others - This may be attributed to more water and less oils, but it is much easier to apply to our 2 year old.  As for performance, since it spreads great I haven't missed spots and neither of us have any burns.  It seems to work better than others when sweating also.
B00E4PMQAO|3|It works great for your nose however not so great for the ears. It doesn't cut close enough on the ears.
B00KWE08YM|4|ok quality.
B00MWW74FS|5|This is a  really handy little device. It makes a tedious job so much easier & much faster. I really like it. So far I  haven't  had to charge it so I  don't  know yet how long it will hold c it's  charge
B000UULQMQ|4|The only thing stopping five stars is NO Pump comes with this.  Wonderful smell, great protection for color treated hair.
B004YMRU9Y|5|Favorite , no scent light dusting powder to set your foundation and take care of unwanted shine ! Its a staple in my makeup routine and $ is right !!!!
B003PL2D6A|1|Didnt work for me..Made me break out..
B00ABX9Y5S|5|This was greast!!!!! I got this way cheaper then I get it on department stores!!!!' I will always purchase this from Amzon!
B0039K33ES|5|this stuff is great got great results after 1 use will def use again and doesn't leave brown tan lines
B0002SGKN6|3|This item is a perfect protection to the eyes. I've been doing stand-up tanning at the gym I'm working out. It seems pretty cool to use, but it has to adjust the edges of the goggles. The string included doesn't even fit the holes on both sides. Maybe if they can enlarge it a bit, it would be a perfect match. If you're patient enough to tie it over and over on the edges, then it's no big deal.
B005F0BXB0|4|These socks really help to keep my feet and legs pain free during some long days with a lot of walking.
B000U5R030|5|me gustó mucho el producto y llego a tiempo , según lo acordado y comprado, gracias por el servicio. pilar
B00B874LEU|1|really strong unnatural scent. i finally endedup throwing it out because, even diluted, it was terrible.  it is soapy, however.
B001FFKFQI|3|The Nutrideep product seems to work as expected. I used after shampoo. I wanted to try this product for the first time as i received some samples.
B00L4FQVB2|5|I have been in search for a natural shampoo for months.  This product is exactly what I have been looking for.  Has the right amount of lather and gentleness in my hair.  It leaves my hair soft and clean; I like conditioner for smoothness.  Overall great product!  Will be ordering again :)
B00212SXOK|5|exellent perfume and delivery thank you
B00289BNB6|4|This is an inexpensive deodorant that does it's job well.  It has also kept me very dry when other deodorants have not.<br />The smell is just a matter of taste.  My favorite is their power scent, but this one is fine,
B000VTO006|1|They do not ship or you will not receive when they say. I have a bridal shower, ordered in pleny of time, not even here yet,,,,,,bad cust serv from both parties. wheres my stuff????
B00ELN94GS|3|I bought this item in a \\"launch sale\\". Shipping did not take too long. When the product first arrived I was very impressed! It had a great, smooth texture and went on beautifully. It was very moisturizing and felt great on my face. My skin looked really good after applying this and sleeping on it. The color was barely yellow; the company assured me that this was the color of the vitamin E.    The product began turning more and more yellow, though, a sign of oxidization. By around the 4 week mark, it was a  bright neon yellow. It also felt as though it had crystallized somewhat, it had little particles, and my face stung when I put it on. The company refunded my purchase price when I contacted them.    I am torn WRT whether to buy it again or not. It worked very well until suddenly it didn't. I am concerned about how it might be damaged during shipping while the weather is hot now.    ETA: Dr. Song assured me that another order would do okay in the heat. So I ordered another bottle. This one is very different. The packaging is not the same, and while the bottle says that it is 20% vitamin C with hyaluronic acid, hyaluronic acid is NOT listed in the ingredients list. This product also feels different than the first one I had, it is less thick and it does not have the same skin-tightening effect, or the same slight tingle when I apply it.
B00R848RZQ|4|In two weeks my face no only feels smoother but also brighter and tighter. The serum relieves your skin of dullness and reduces fine lines. This product is a keeper!
B002VS0G9Y|5|Tightens well physically and visibly.
B003TJCSUE|2|I bought this stuff from Whole Foods and thought it rubbed in well and worked well. Then yesterday while putting it on the kids I could figured out how it was all over the place. Being in a hurry I didn't investigate the problem right away. Then later I found it had busted at the seem of the bottle and was all over the inside of my purse. I was told to take it back to whole foods by a friend but I didn't have anything else to put it in to keep from getting on other stuff. I ended up tossing it in the trash.
B009MY1P3Q|5|Great
B004KZMJN2|5|I am going to pretty much leave the same review on each of the airbrush stencils sets that I bought.<br /><br />They are stencils. They work great. Makes airbrushing tattoos a cinch. Go for it. Store it flat.
B00DONI9TE|5|used this all up although I am trying a different cuticle oil at the moment, I will go back and repurchase this one...really good product.
B000225ZVA|5|I have been using Lush products for a few years now. First introduced to them when I was in Australia.<br /><br />I always keep some in my linen closet as it gives a faint wonderful scent to all the sheets and pillowcases.<br /><br />Try all of the bath bombs. I use the Tisty Tosty whenever I need an evening of self indulgence. Put the water on and watch the heart-shaped bomb fizzle and send hundreds of rose petals floating to the top of the tub.<br /><br />Put some fluffy bath towels to warm on a rail.<br /><br />Place some Dr Haushka's oil to heat by a radiator.<br /><br />Pour a glass of champagne.<br /><br />Surround the tub with lots of  tea lights.<br /><br />Put on some Rahman music.<br /><br />Get in and imagine a private Ganges.<br /><br />When you get out its very eassy to scoop up the petals- take the pre-warmed towels and wrap yourself in one.<br /><br /> By then the oils will be warm and pour in palm of hand and rub on body.<br /><br />I also like to put some  bath bombs in guest bedrooms with the towels-<br /><br />If you haven't tried the Karma soap do try it ......alone or with someone special...
B00GQU5YY0|2|Clean line just not waterproof like they said it ran into my clients eyes before a shoot I almost lost my job
B00FW2BR0S|5|Simply put, Remedy is the best lotion for dry and cracked skin I have ever used.  No lotion works as good or better.
B000KU91WS|4|A bit on greasy side, but since it is night cream I don't mind it. Nice smell. Not gel like, but not as thick as balm. I would buy it again if it runs out.
B00CX7GE9E|5|GREAT HAND LOTION
B00FI6FVKU|5|I just received.  I have to apologize.  I thought I had already gotten this product.  Its very nice and matte.  So yes I will give it the review it deserves.
B00609D92Q|5|Although this is not as strong as the peels I have gotten at the spa, after two uses I see a difference in some discoloration and the overall look of my skin. For the price, I would recommend it!
B006BYNIY4|5|Great mascara, I love it
B00KAB1TBI|5|I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I have some of the straightest non curled lashes I have ever seen.  I have trouble finding a mascara that will both curl my lashes and leave them looking fuller than they are.  I have used Cover Girl products in the past and generally it is my mascara of choice.  After I received this one, I tried it out both using an eyelash curler and without.  I was amazed with the way the lashes curled even without the eyelash curler.  I have never found a mascara yet that would do that.  I also Loved the way the mascara made my lashes look fuller and thicker.  I will definitely be investing in this mascara in the future.  the only thing I really did not like was how wide the tube was.  I am used to smaller tubes and this one was a bit big.  But otherwise it is a great product!
B009GYVMAS|2|Just an FYI for those of you out there that have yet ro try this product.<br />After using this product on several areas of my face that had some superficial markings left due to acne breakouts, I was left with a very noticible darkened areas on my face. Unbelieveable that a product that promotes the healing of dark marks actually exacerbated the same exact problem.
B00016XJ4M|5|I love it. Smell so good and it works well
B00IDWP4IA|3|I did research vitamin C serums and I found that yellow serums mean two things: 1) the vitamin c has decayed, or 2) the company made the serum yellow to hide potential decay.  This serum is yellow and that is concerning to me.  It has kind of a funky smell.  Other than that, it goes on smoothly and didn't seem to cause any problems with my skin.
B00HNSSPHW|4|it's simply amazing....
B007IAE5WY|5|Absolutely love these.  I won't lie though it does feel like ur scrubbing ur skin with a Brillo pad, but excellent for exfoliation.  I found no problems with it keeping a lather with my body wash.  It's long enough so with the right maneuvering u can scrub ur shoulders, back and butt too. I thought considering it came in a pack of three I'd share them with my family and they love them too. Oh and those of you with sensitive skin,  I myself have very sensitive skin and use this daily and besides looking pinkish when i get out of the shower I'm fine.  Whats that old saying?  &#34;No pain no gain&#34;.
B00HIDT94U|5|Omg I love these the best brushes for the best price ever
B0046JDVXO|3|I was trying to open myself up to new colors with purchasing a green polish, but I remain on the fence with this color.  The green looks exactly as it does in the picture, so it is a lovely shade, but I don't think I'm there yet in terms of non-traditional nail colors.
B0096UEDLM|5|Surprisingly great product. It also conditioned and softened my hair. I think it's not just a treatment but can be used after shampooing instead of conditioner. Smells good.
B006Z8B5HS|4|the miracle shampoo is smaller than i though, but it Works very well, cleans my hair very well, it is a good product
B00GO62192|4|These were recommended by my dental hygienist.  I use them to thoroughly clean and massage the teeth at the gum line, for a problem with receding gums. They are very soft and work well for that
B00FZESMKG|5|I love this face wash! I was hesitant because I've tried so many different face washes. This one works and I am so grateful I no longer have to search for something to clear my face. Also, I wanted to note, this face wash is reasonably priced compared to other organic face washes. The smell is great and my face looks and feels so clean! :)
B001BHLPWS|5|The best product is light and helps the XFusion fibers do their job of making your thinning hair look full again!!
B00I847SXW|5|Great product for color treated hair.
B004COPYDI|5|Ordered this for my tattooing son and he loves it. Smooth operating machine.He uses it more than his traditional machine.
B00GYF65TK|5|Muy bueno
B00HFI0A0U|1|Can't get these to stick on
B003HINK8G|5|At least it didn't fall apart like the other one did from Flowery.  Does a good job.  Always use buffing cream with it.
B004IQIVL2|5|This product adds shine and silk to my dry brittle hair. I apply it wet and dry. I also use Moroccan oil and It's a 10 leave-in conditioner. All of these combined make my hair very healthy and a day doesn't go by that someone doesn't compliment my it. No joke!
B000A8EHU6|5|I was able to repair two waterpiks with these hose repair kits. It's nice both economically and environmentally to know I can repair these without throwing them out.
B000G8LWZI|3|Item shown not delivered. Updated, smaller product delivered.
B003O5NGJK|5|Best ever tool for your feet.
B001SGLDCO|5|cheap shaving cream. cant beat it!
B002U32G66|5|My favorite !
B000C1Z5AM|5|This is the third time I have ordered this product through Amazon since discovering they had the best prices, almost by half, compared to that of a chain store like Macys, J.C Penny, etc.  I was paying $70 w/ tax per bottle for a long time.  I know for a guy it is important to have \\"your\\" smell and other options but my wife met me when I was wearing this and she only prefers that I wear Pleasures because she says its \\"me\\".  Love this stuff.  Give it a try.  You will enjoy it.
B007HO1A9W|4|The curler works really well but the only problem was where the wire turns when you move is kind of hard to turn.
B00657ISR4|2|smells GREAT!!  but it broke me out so I gave it to my granddaughter.
B004XW57ZY|4|I've had embarassing facial hair since my mid-20s (now in my 50s.) I tried everything to get rid of it--dipalatory creams, home waxing (too embarassed to go to a salon for professional waxing), laser hair removal (only worked for a year, then the hair came back worse than ever.) I used a Finally Free electronic tweezer for years, and it did help, but it was so tedius taht I would end up just doing half the hair and then shaving the rest.Then, when I got my laser hair removal sessions, I tossed the Finally Free in the trash, thinking I would never use it again. Well, I was wrong. The laser hair removal wasn't permanent and I had to return to shaving, which fooled no one and I would always develop embarassing stubble by the end of the day. .<br /><br />Until now. The Epilady really works! I was amazed that I could use it on my short stubble, so I didn't have to wait for the hair to grow out over several embarassing days before I could use it. Unfortunately, the Epilady IS painful--in a few places it even drew blood when it pulled out my chin hair. However, it's not really any more painful than laser hair removal and a whole lot less expensive!<br /><br />It didn't get all of my stubble on first using, but it got most of it. I will wait a few days for the soreness to abate and then I will get the rest. I think I've finally licked a problem I've had for more than 25 years! Thank you!
B001JZ5PZA|5|There is not another exfoliate out there that can beat this product.  I LOVE IT!!!  My face is so soft afterwards.  I have very sensitive skin and I haven't had a problem with this product in the 3 years I have been using it.
B00AHAWWO0|5|I really didn't care for the extra 2-hour express strips, because it looks unnatural to go out with lighter teeth than you had the day before, but overall this is a good value, for both time and money, compared with dentist whitening. Very happy with the set!
B0057TPUPY|5|This is the sunblock that my dermatologist recommended. However she sells it at almost double the price. So glad I found it here. Protects my face because I'm prone to hyper pigmentation.
B007N8PJS0|2|this is really thick and difficult to apply.<br />i found myself having to rub too hard on my little one when putting it on.<br />i put lotion on first and then applied sunscreen which helped a little bit.<br /><br />i will not order this again.
B0009EILB2|5|Aveeno is a great brand, but I always make sure I pick this scent for myself.<br />Particular to it since 1990.<br />It is not as minty as it was then, but still my favorite.<br />Not greasy at all.<br /><br />Helped me to get through the chicken pox in 1990.
B004283D64|5|great chair
B00D3G6JAS|2|Did not see any improvement
B0062IWQVU|5|I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide  free via a program by Gillette. I really enjoyed this razor and the overall pack. It was nice and sharp and will surely be buying it soon!
B00CDWSONS|5|I'm loving these lashes, light weight and comfortable to wear. For the price and amount of lashes, its worth the buy
B005HYNI30|5|I used this product within a DIY lotion with kojic acid powder and had lovely lightening results. Would reorder.
B00B594KG0|5|These are perfect and comfortable to wear (*ﾟ▽ﾟ)ﾉ!!!!!!
B0000533G8|5|It is great soap, I love it! The mint feels super tingly (some people might not like that), but I personally do. The only down side is that it is overpriced on amazon. It is sold in health food stores, Trader Joes, and Whole foods at half the price as it is sold on Amazon. It is not worth buying online until the prices match the store prices.
B0014P8L9W|4|Just finished 1st application and I love this.  First value-for-cost is terrific, especially compared to drug-store and department-store competitors.  Plus it's light/not heavy on the skin; mine is sensitive so this is a big plus for me.  One word of caution: directions say mix w/equal parts apple-cider vinegar &#34;and/or&#34; water; I suggest combo because scent of vinegar on your face/under your nose can be overpowering.
B0035RE2TA|5|Love how this makes my skin feel. I use it wet in the shower and it feels like it sloughs off so much dead skin. It does take a little while to get used to since it's so rough.
B002DVHTFI|5|This spray is GREAT if you have dry, frizzy hair.  I use it on the &#34;in-between&#34; shampooing days after I have restyled my hair -- my hair is soft, shiny and non-frizzy.  A must have.
B000621X44|3|I compared the picture the my old Gold-N-Hot flat iron that needed replaced and it matched. I ordered it right away, only to find out it is completely different. There is NO heat control dial. I felt like it was burning my hair at first, I think it was just trying to burn off oil residue or something? I am ok with it now but, an updated picture and or a more detailed description would have helped before I bought it. Semi-Disappointed customer.
B0041EKYPW|4|Fragrance could be stronger..but really softens and moisterizes skin.
B00AZIDJ9Q|5|Awesome
B0020ZEA40|1|this lasted less than a month. i contacted seller and they stated that because it is an air pump and will ONLY work if there is product in the cannister, that i must have used one gram per day, since there were 40 grams. not the case at all. i used a drop or two, so either a. the pump stopped working or b. there is hardly anything in that pump.
B00149MWSE|5|Professional quality.  Beats any I ever purchased at local sources.  Sturdy and good size.  Can't go wrong.
B00BT9TWHI|5|I just received my order and I can't wait to wear them. The quality is good and the hair is really soft. The ship time was faster than I thought it would be.
B00027D6SE|5|A teenagers life saver!
B00GMQUPO2|5|Awesome, it really works when used as directed!
B000KQ1E5Y|5|This is a great product for cleansing, I just got it yesterday and used it evening and morning and already I see a difference with my skin which feels softer, Cleaner, seems to be clearing my blocked enlarged pores and they seem to look a little smaller, I'll keep going with it and see how it works for my skin..
B00PYK2UI6|5|I like let me skin
B009UYDOUK|5|the consistency is very nice, glide on smooth and as I massaged on my skin, it does the job exfoliating well and it feels very light on the skin.  Great product and I would recommend this.
B002WTC37A|4|great fragrance and works really well. a little expensive, but i caught it on sale and had a christmas gift card to boot, so it was worth it. very nice product
B005JDPHII|5|I love this stuff.
B00DPE9EQO|5|The best vitamin c serum I've ever used. Will Continue buying it..
B004PGYRZO|5|I use this on my arms and chest almost daily.  The lotion goes on well and has a light scent.  The skin does look a bit healthier and more 'elastic.'  I'm 56 and at the age where skin changes (menopause) as estrogen drops. Would love to have a vat of it to dip myself in!  I think it's a bit pricey as the formula isn't that much different than regular Olay lotion.
B005HIHD2I|5|For hair that's naturally curly and frizzy, this is a great addition to the hair care regime for frizz-free curls and/or sleek blow dried styles. The results last for at least 48 hours. It leaves my hair soft and shiny whether I leave my curls in their natural state OR when blow dried straight. The bonus is this product is effective at a decent price.
B003FVOMSC|4|Good Blade, smooth but not as sharp as 7 O' Clock sharp edge. Should be cheaper, if compared to the Sharp Edge.
B00H1M0SWA|1|I was really excited for this hair clip, but they sent me the wrong product. Instead of the hair clip I got a box of &#34;surgical steel metal nose studs&#34;. I do not have a pierced nose. Unfortunately, returning them would cost more than the original price of the clip. At least they were cheap I guess?
B000I0U5NY|5|This is a light but fantastic fragrance. It stimulates the mind and senses with its tangy and subtle aroma. I would classify it as unisex leaning more towards the feminine,  as the fig impairs a luscious sweetness mixed with the citrus bite.    I tend to burn frangrances swiftly,  so I'm glad to have purchased the larger 4oz. size. Since I do not like to skimp on my product ... this fragrance can be spritzed generously for absolute pleasure.
B000PHZ14S|5|Of the hair brushes that are readily available, this is simply the best.  Lasts for decades. Absolutely worth the money.
B000050FDE|4|Our Oral B of 10 years finally bit the dust.  This is what we ordered & it works great.  I like the 2 speeds for those sensitive areas.  Would not ever go back to a manual brush.  Try this, a goods deal.
B000XE8762|5|Been using this for years, love it.  How can you recomend a fragrance, it is personal and you either like it or you don't.  That is probably why there are so many fragrances on the market, everybody's different.  But this one works for me.
B00MRU0VGY|3|very hard bristles
B0009PVV4K|5|Daughter with VERY thick and long hair loves it.
B00OVS84CS|5|I use these every single day.  I use them to clean my eyeglasses, sunglasses, and the screen of my cellphone.  Wipes clear, dries quickly, no scent, no film.  These are great- I highly recommend them.
B004VFXVJW|2|Directions indicate that you must use denatured alcohol while mounting the mirror.  Haven't found denatured alcohol so haven't mounted it.  Maybe it works great, but who knows?
B00GQU5YY0|1|Product is much smaller than anticipated and took over a month th get here
B00AHF1GTM|5|This shaves my head bald so, close w/out shaver burns. Didn't need to use my fusion pro glide.
B004H4VQ4Y|4|Smells delicious and I like to believe it works. It really feels like improvement is happening.
B000ZMEW66|5|Very good shampoo.  I have been searching for a long time for a shampoo that is natural but still does a good job of cleaning without drying the hair out (and without being super expensive).  I would recommend the Aubrey shampoos to others.
B000EMDK3I|5|Wonderful!
B00K6O8Z3Y|1|Two nail polishes were broken. A lip gloss had been used and they were not all loreal products. And there was only 39 products in there. I am very displeased
B000EQ1U8G|5|Very pleased with the sweet almond oil; used for making homemade scrubs and eye makeup removers to give as gifts.
B005H8PTR4|4|Got set for my daughter, she loved all the bright colors.  The nail polish remover included is not so good.
B00BQ553QE|4|I got it really fast but when I opened it the box was open and then I checked all the products and they were open too! Except for the retinol cream. I decided to used them either way because I really needed something for my face. I've been using it for 3 weeks now and it really cleared my face. I use the retinol cream during the day and the benzoyl one at night because it drys my face out. I'm really happy that I'm thinking to buy it again but with another seller.
B001LNOEJI|5|I love how pretty and fragrant these soaps are, and they feel silky. I bought them first as a gift, and liked them so much I purchased a set for myself.
B004MGREYS|5|this stuff conditions my hair and maintains my color really well. it doesn't bother my skin like most do and it doesn't build up or become waxy. i have no idea what it is made of which concerns me but at the same time the hair products where i DO know the ingredients haven't worked well. ironically i have lost a lot of money and messed up my hair and skin in that pursuit of eco and non toxic. SO WHATEVER this stuff is made of … it works.
B002RXW5BA|5|The color are very nice and bright.The mirror is convenient.The pigment is great.You can go from day to night with this palette.
B00E0OOV3O|5|Beautiful hair pins. Wore them at my sisters wedding. Had a lot of compliments. Be gentle though- one of my flowers fell right off when I took it out of my hair. But it wasn't a product I was expecting to last forever.
B004NWHG9O|4|I'm not sure if it's just because she is a kid, but this stuff seems to wear off quickly. It goes on fine and she loves it. It's not real noticeable. I guess because it's pink and it's pretty light colored.
B005B5RBNS|5|I love it so much, I had purchased several times....and it always looks good after using this stuff. I'll continue to buy this mask....
B008I2IKF4|5|My husband and I have used this for several months. I did learn to rinse all the toothpaste out of my mouth first and rinse afterward. The health of my gums has improved due to the intense cleaning the peroxide does. I let it bubble in my mouth about a minute and then spit it out and wait about 30 Seconds  and rinse throughly. It does make my tongue a bit odd for a bit and  at one point a tooth became sensitive because it was cleaning in the exposed bit of root. I feel my teeth feel healthier and I am sure I have less bacteria in my gums. When I was a kid and would have inflammation on my gums my mom had me use straight peroxide and it cleared it up. Keep making it Crest! I signed on to buy more!
B000C1ZE1M|5|I Like
B00UZNASP4|4|Combs thru my daughter 's thick curly hair so easily & smells lovely!!!!
B007NJVKYQ|5|I bought these as a stocking stuffer for Christmas for my husband. His toe nails are very thick and extremely hard to trim. Not anymore. These clippers are amazing. Highly recommend to those with super tough toenails.
B00KZ0S80E|5|This works great -- much better than the ones I've bought in stores.<br />I was also very impressed at the handwritten note on the package THANKING me for buying from them, a small company.<br />I love buying from small companies and will definitely buy from them again.
B0001MROQA|5|This was the perfect curling size I've been looking for. I purchased this based on all the good reviews.
B005N9BQ42|5|Loving this product and vendor easy purchase.  Will be purchase again...
B007Z2L91A|5|I love my colorescience products. This lip polish isn't quite the color I thought it was or maybe it's just because of my sking tone but it's still very nice and works great for me going for a natural look. I also received a free sample of a cleanser that was amazing and I will be ordering.
B0006PLP8U|3|Decent but it could use some improvements. The entire surface area does not have the ability to grasp every hair. You need to find the &#34;sweet spot&#34; to remove hairs.
B00KYUXIOG|5|Really great quality!
B009DTND5I|2|Not like the real product.
B0089TDU6A|5|Purchased as a gift for my hard to shop for mom. She opened it immediately to use which is a first! Shortly after her shower, I got an email about how well it worked! Then next morning my dad who thought it was a goofy gift tried it. He also raved about it.
B00F008GFQ|5|So, I have recently been getting back into wearing makeup, and I had been hearing people rave about the sigma f80 brush. So, I decided to look into getting one. 24 DOLLARS! I couldn't bring myself to pay that much. So I was looking here on amazon and saw this brush. I noticed that it overall has a better rating than the sigma one, and it is half the price. I decided to just take a risk and buy this one, and OMG! I LOVE THIS FREAKING BRUSH! It applies foundations and BB creams flawlessly. It just goes to show you that you don't have to pay an outlandish price for makeup and makeup tools to get good high quality results. I TOTALLY recommend this brush.
B00198ZPU2|5|Works really well at pushing back and removing cuticles. I use it with Sally Hanson liquid cuticle remover
B000WD5AIM|5|make makeskin look brighter every time i use it. dont use every day it will make your skin extremely dry.
B00I2IL9BQ|5|I love the Deesse boutique in sycamore Illinois. everything angela has to offer is top quality and hand made by her.
B000052YAN|3|Was hoping for a slightly thicker flat tape.  I am a dentist and still nothing compares to the former J&J D1031 waxed Dentotape which J&J in their wisdom have discontinued.  This product needs to be brought back to the market and I have been begging J&J to consider re-introducing it.  The thinner REACH tape I would rate as about 60% effective as the D1031 tape, as it is too thin to displace plaque effectively and I personally find it more uncomfortable to use as the thinner tape can cut like a piano wire.
B00EB5N2E6|4|The color is perfect! The ponytail is on a clip and it's also really nice. My only &#34;Issue&#34; with it is that I need to re-do the half pony that is on the wig cause it's loose and that I've seen wigs that were better made but it's by no means bad. I'm pretty pleased with this product. It also come with a new wig cap which is an added plus.
