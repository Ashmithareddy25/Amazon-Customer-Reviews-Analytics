630460288X|4.0|I've seen this movie at least a hundred times and it keeps getting better. While the story line was nothing beyond the usual action film gun totting good guy (Stallone) vs. evil psycotic bad guy (Snipes) the social and technological concepts covered in this film really make a person think what could be accomplished &amp; avoided in creating a more peaceful society.<br />It would be interesting to see a prequel movie or book based on the forming of San Angelas and characters like Chief Erl, Mayor-Gov Raymond Cocto and Warden William Smithers, but I don't think this movie did well enough at the box office for this to become a reality.<br />If you are into Stallone films this may not be his best one, but if you are into Utopian Ideals of future societies then this is the movie for you.
0446677450|4.0|With this book, Mr. Kiyosaki has made an excellent case for financial literacy .  His message is clear: Give yourself a financial education, make money work for you, exercise your financial brain.  All praiseworthy points.<br />This book, however, is not a how-to book (the author himself admitted as such).  You won't learn how to evaluate a rental property, develop an investment framework, or discover auctions opportunities.  What you'll take away is perhaps a belief that you need to educate yourself financially.  <br />I recommend this book highly.
B00003CWL6|5.0|The reviews from friends about this movie are mixed, as I think many don't get the true meaning about the movie. Your average American family; the father is going through a mid-life crisis, the mother is completely depressed, and the daughter hates them both. I thought the movie was fantastic and Kevin Spacey was great in his role.
B0000203YT|5.0|This has to be the most romantic movie I have ever seen. I was so pleasantly surprised. I had to drag my boyfriend to see it, but he ended up loving it almost as much as I did. It is so witty, intelligent, funny and charming. The cast is perfect, especially Joseph and Gwyneth. This movie is on my top 5 list of my favorite movies ever. I truly can't say enough good things about it, but if you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for? You won't be dissapointed, I promise.
B00005R2BG|3.0|I rented the video. Moulon Rouge is a stunning riot of bits of songs, color, costumes & dancing, for the first half. The Sound of Music, the Beatles, Elton John (so many I lost count) come fast & furious in this circa 1890's Paris nightclub of the title. The \\"can-can\\" number was the highlight. Oh, the plot: just a tired old love triangle to justify the whole thing. Nicole Kidman enters my personal \\"top two\\" most beautiful movie heroines. Hookers just aren\\"t what they used to be.
B00003CX96|5.0|Great movie and story, and one a young bike racer could really relate to.  Back when this movie was being shown in small movie houses if often came to one in my area.  Myself and a bunch of other bike racers never missed a showing...it turned into a cult movie for us and we probably went and saw it 10-15 times..  It was always fun to watch the reaction of the non-cycling movie goers to the scene when Dave was shaving his legs.  Cracked us up!  Cycling scenes were well done, and the one when he was drafting that big truck was great.  The music score was really good and fit the movies plot.  It was also cool for those of us who owned an Italian MASI racing bicycle like Dave rode! No matter if you are a bicycle racing fan or not do not miss this movie.  My comments are based on the VHS issue.
B00002Z88D|3.0|Metallica and the orchestra lack co-ordination in most of the songs. And most of the songs on the album are from their garbage new stuff. And Hetfield's singing is awful. He trys to crack his voice like Tori Amos. She sound beautiful, but he just sounds awful. <br />The bright lights on this album are:<BR>-Ectasy of Gold<BR>-Call of Ktulu<BR>-Master of Puppets<BR>-Wherever I may Roam<BR>-Nothing Else Matters<br />&quot;One&quot; is pretty good also, but Hetfield keeps chanting &quot;hoi, HOI!&quot; like Jason does in &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;.. it sounds really inappropriate in &quot;One&quot;.
B00003Q43A|4.0|Take the Fresh Prince, Lonestar from Spaceballs, and a bunch of aleins looking to kill the human race and you get ID4. The special effects reminded me why I thought Star Wars was so awesome when I first saw it. It was simply the fact that I've never seen that before and it set a new standard (like Star Wars) in the use of special effects.
0380788624|1.0|Based on a lot of glowing reviews on Slashdot and the e-gold mailing list, I couldn't wait to get out and buy this in hardcover right after it first came out. Boy am I sorry. This book is way WAY too long. It's too long by half at least. I don't deny that Stephenson can write, but this book seems to have been written specifically for young computer nerds who will be amused by discussions of masturbation and cereal. You get the feeling that the book was written by a young boy going through the puberty. There is nothing wrong with this (Isaac Asimov wrote the Foundation trilogy when he was 16) but you don't expect to FEEL this in a book this long or covering the material he covers. I've been a computer nerd and an avid sci-fi reader for most of my life, and cryptography etc. fascinates me a great deal. This book COULD have been really good, but it needs a great deal of &quot;tightening up&quot;. If Neal Stephenson had forced himself to cut the book in half I have a feeling it would have been a truly great book. But it goes on and on and on and on..... From one writer to another, I suggest he spend more time tightening up his book before he publishes, and for goodness sake, have an editor read it before it goes to print! I get the feeling the book was so long neither the author or the publisher wanted to take the time to fix the zillions of mistakes, some factual some grammatical, or to refine the text. Bottom line: Don't buy this book. Borrow it from a friend or check it out from the library. If you still love it, you can have mine!
6302820448|5.0|With the actual Groundhog Day right around the corner, funny how the sales rank is high, haha, just an observation.  This is another favorite movie of mine that I can watch over &amp; over &amp; enjoy a good laugh.  Phil Connors is a self-centered character, &amp; you find plenty of reasons to not like him.  His day just repeats itself...over...&amp; over, which I thought was an interesting movie concept.  It's as if a higher power intentionally put this spell on him to try &amp; make him a better person, cuz that was the only way it would  happen.  Rita, his sweet, unselfish co-worker, is totally unlike him, &amp; he's quickly drawn to her.<br />It's hilarious watching him rehearse different things every day, trying to find out every little thing about Rita that he can.  How we wish we could repeat some things in life...school, job interviews &amp; jobs, meeting the opposite sex, etc.!!  You also start feeling sorry for him when he starts feeling dispair, &amp; desperately wants a break from his curse.  &quot;This is pitiful....a 1000 people freezing their butts off waiting to worship a rat.&quot;  He even attempts suicide, but he's still stuck!!  After this point, the movie starts focusing more on his feelings for Rita, &amp; how he's determined to win her by bettering himself,<br />He becomes inspired to play piano after hearing Mozart,  remembering Rita mentioning that her dream guy has to play an instrument.  Learning such an instrument from scratch requires so much patience &amp; practice over a long period time.  But we have to also constantly remember that trying to do anything well, whether it's self-help or just perfecting skills, requires regular &amp; daily practice.  Being a musician myself, I would definitely use that opportunity to do such things!!  Just one of many examples that makes you wonder what would you do, &amp; what would people you know do in his place?<br />I tried doing the same thing another reviewer mentioned, trying to count the # of actual days he's stuck in, but it's hard!! You become so wrapped up in it, you don't wanna even worry about it.  The end left me believing that though we wish we had all the time in the world, we have to do best with the time we have (oh, they do mention that on Lord of the Rings, don't they?).  We also have to realize we don't have endless chances to get things right.  It reminded me of a Christmas Carol, how the character changes at the end.  They couldn't have picked a better character than Bill Murray , &amp; even if you're not really a fan of him, you can appreciate his character transformation (I personally like him, but I know some people don't).  The other characters are also enjoyable &amp; seem like regular real people.  Definitely worth picking up &amp; watching again &amp; again on any cloudy afternoon!f actual days he's stuck in, but it's hard!! You become so wrapped up in it, you don't wanna even worry about it.

0790736233|5.0|A film very much in the league of such sci-fi giants as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and E.T., director Robert Zemeckis' 1997 film CONNTACT is one of the genre's most stunningly intelligent films of all time. Clearly having learned much about displaying a sense of cinematic wonder from his mentor Steven Spielberg, Zemeckis has fashioned a film that, like \\"2001\\", has elements of spiritualism, mysticism, and child-like awe.<br />Jodie Foster is Dr. Eleanor Arroway, an ambitious radio astronomer who, ever since she was a young girl, has been dreaming of making contact with other beings from outer space. As her ambitions grow, there is, of course, plenty of resistance from other corners of the scientific community to her search--especially from her mentor (Tom Skerritt), who sees this as wasteful, pie-in-the-sky stuff. But when Foster and her team at New Mexico's Very Large Array radio telescope field in New Mexico detect an actual alien signal (represented in prime numbers) eminating from the star Vega, some twenty-six light years away, all bets are off. Despite the somewhat ominous beginning to this (the signal is eventually found to have been in response to the first-ever TV transmission on Earth, which were the opening ceremonies to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, presided over by Adolf Hitler), further research, funded by an eccentric engineer (John Hurt) reveals the desire on the part of the aliens for the human race to build a space pod that will hurl itself towards Vega at or near the speed of light.<br />Immediately, of course, there is a worldwide firestorm of controversy, and not just from the scientific community. The religious community, particularly America's religious right-wing, comes to attack Foster and her fellow scientists for wanting to contact aliens who might not believe in God (or their version of Him). Foster does, however, have one sympathetic friend in that community--Reverend Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey). When,during a test of the new pod, Skerritt is killed by a fanatic religious bomber, it is up to Foster to make that ultra-perilous journey to Vega.<br />When she does, she stunningly meets up with her father (David Morse), whom she lost at an early age. Her return to Earth and her story is met with unbridled incredulity and iron skepticism. But McConaughey chooses to take the high road in this case, stating that although the two of them operate under different covenants of thought, their goals are one and the same--the pursuit of truth.<br />Based on the only fictional novel written by the late Carl Sagan, creator of the legendary PBS-TV series \\"Cosmos\\", CONTACT is a very lengthy and extremely ambitious film that succeeds far more often than it slips (which is extremely rare here). As with any of the great science fiction movies, the special effects and the hardware are incredibly spectacular; but going hand in hand with all this are a highly credible story and some fine acting, particularly by Foster, whose performance here is as good as anything she has given us since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.<br />With newsreel references to the religious cult murders that occurred in San Diego shortly before the film's release, as well as video cameos by Geraldo Rivera, Geraldine Ferraro, and president Bill Clinton (some of them admittedly resembling humorous asides more than they do advancements in the story), CONTACT is also topical. By having McConaughey's character display a genuine sympathy towards Foster's approach to things, the film does not balance science over religion; but it also does not fail to condemn certain segments of the religious community for trying to force their values onto others. In essence, CONTACT is a plea for understanding among all the world's people, and bravely suceeds in telling us that ours is not the only intelligence that God may have bought forth.<br />For anyone interested in the science fiction genre, CONTACT is a must-have for your video or DVD collection.
0553296981|5.0|This is one of the best (and saddest) books I have ever read. Anne Frank is a Jewish girl that lived in Amsterdam during the Holocaust. Her family flees their home and goes to live in the Secret Annex, which is in an old office building. Anne writes about life in the Secret Annex and the group's fear that they will be discovered and sent to a concentration camp. In the end she is discovered and dies shortly before the war ends.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who loves history or to girls.
B00000IMTG|5.0|After nearly losing his sanity with Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore found a way to bounce back.  Music such as this has always been a passion for Blackmore (he is currently touring the country with his beautiful wife Candice, and they have written several songs with....you guessed it..renaissance themes). Consequently, there wasn't (nor has there ever been) a better musical vehicle to vicariously live out medieval fantasies than Rainbow. I'am happy to report that this was done quite well with &quot;On Stage.&quot;<BR>  From the opening recording of Dorothy wondering out loud (and then proclaiming) &quot;That were not in Kansas anymore&quot; (Wizard of OZ) to the bombastic intro of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; this live recording defines Rainbow at one of their finest moments.  If memory serves me correctly, this particular concert was recorded in Japan.  The audience is polite, and Rainbow makes no apologies musically (not that they had to!) it's as if they are saying collectively &quot;This is who we are, this is ouir music, take it or leave it.&quot;  <BR>  Though the main focus of the group was generally on Blackmore's guitar ability and Dio's amazing vocal delivery, one cannot ignore the talent of Tony Carey on Keyboards. His dexterity on the opening number &quot;Kill the King&quot; is one of the finest rock live recordings for a keyboard player I've probably ever heard...and let me tell you, I've heard a bunch.<BR>  The entire band was composed of absolute, consumate musicians. Cozy Powell's drumming is second to none (RIP) and Jimmy Bain had no trouble keeping up with Blackmore (or Powell, for that matter) on the bass.  The fellas blended together very well on this recording.<BR>   Ritchie Blackmore has always been a perfectionist (by his own admission).  I believe this recording pleased him. Dio's soaring vocals on &quot;Catch the Rainbow&quot; would please anybody who is simply interested in music, period.  It had to please Blackmore.  The track ends with a almost pompous version of &quot;Still I'm sad.&quot;  The bottom line about this album/CD/ etc. is that with a band with so many ego's.....the recording is surprisingly free of them.  True musical professionalism is evident here.
B000009QPE|5.0|I grew up listening to Dire Straits, Garth Brooks, Alabama and country music in general (my father is a fan....) thanks God, when I was 14 I found out bands like Carcass, Megadeth, Metallica, Pantera, Dark Tarnquillity, Iron Maiden and Slayer; now (that I'm 24) I still listening to my metal cds but I also discoverd punk music... and I love it as much as I love metal... NOFX, Rancid, AFI, The Offspring and Bad Religion are so great bands with some of my all time favourite songs. As I live in Italy I know Italian music (and I hate it....) and  when I'm at work I usually listen to the radio (Radio Dee Jay since I was 12) that plays pop and dance \\"music\\" (bleah!) but djs are so funny. In the end, I think I've a quite good musical knowledge and this is my conclusion:<br />          \\"Reign in Blood\\" by Slayer is the BEST album ever recorded. <br />Ok, think about an album.... done? Well, this cd can beat it. (even if you are thinking about an Offspring's almun, that is my fav band).<br />Tom Araya as a GREAT voice (what a cool screaming!!) and Dave Lombardo.... my god, HE is an alien!! And I have no words for the guitar solos.... so brutal, rapid and somethimes... funny!...
0446677450|3.0|For anyone who is looking to embark for the first time in the world of personal finance and investing, this is a good place to start.  It is by no means a comprehensive guide on reaching financial success.  Perhaps this is what the author had in mind, judging by the number of books that have followed under the &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; header.  You will need to pick up a few more books if you really want to start the path to financial freedom on the right foot.  <BR>The central theme of this book is very intuitive: if you're working for someone else, there's a 99% chance you will not get rich. You may earn a six-figure salary and still, you probably won't get rich.  The solutions he presents are straightforward and easy to implement.  The key lessons can be summarized in a few bullet points:<br />- Start investing at an early age - note that I didn't use the word &quot;saving&quot;. there is a big difference and Kiyosaki explains why<BR>- Know the difference between an asset and a liability<BR>- Acquire real assets that produce income on their own<BR>- Know your taxes - learn why rich people don't pay them<BR>- Invest first, buy later<br />Kiyosaki's method of describing the spending and saving patterns of the average person via flowcharts is quite intuitive and very easy to understand.  Even the most financially shrewd person will admit that his approach is refreshing and original. His definition of an asset is very intuitive, arguing that your house and your car are not assets.  Even though your house possesses some intrinsic value (the equity gained through appreciation and reduction of mortgage), it is not a real asset, as it does not produce income on its own.  Although Kiyosaki teaches basic concepts that everyone needs to master if they want to get out of the financial black hole, he does not delve into the specifics of choosing the right investments or how to minimize taxes.  As I said in the beginning of this review, this book will leave you thirsty for more and you will need to quench your thirst with a few more books. <br />One final note, Kiyosaki is well versed on the subject of real estate and you will note this throughout the book, but he spent little time on the subject of stocks and bonds, which is another important part of the equation.  If you are looking for a book on this subject, try Peter Lynch's &quot;One Up on Wall Street&quot;.
B00005A0N5|5.0|What makes this CD so much better than bands like Rhapsody (who do the same sort of melodies mixed in with a FAST beat) is the brilliant singer. Great voice! Very clear - and I was amazed that operatic vocals could work with metal. They do, very well. I got this after getting the Wishmaster CD and wasn't disappointed at all. There seems to be another singer featured more on this CD, a sort of death metal growl in songs such as Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean, but it's not a screaming match like some other metal bands I could mention and it contrasts the voice of Tarja perfectly.  <BR>If you want classy sounds and don't mind your lyrics being a bit mythalogical rather than death, death, doom, doom - get this. If you're new to Nightwish though you might want to check out Wishmaster first as I think it has a wider range of material on it.
B000002J1U|5.0|...would be to set aside some time for this album.  It's impossible to say which Zeppelin ablum is best (best to whom?); really, all we can do is pick favorites.  My favorite seems to change by the day - it's that close - but I would say it's Zepp III on more days than most.  There's a tremendous variety of songs here, and perhaps nowhere else does Led Zeppelin sound less like any other band.  I'll leave it to others to run through all the songs (that's always more fun to write than to read) but I will say this: \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is beautiful and will at times even strike me emotionally; \\"Friends\\" is a lovable oddity which is sooo much fun to play on an acoustic, bizarre tuning and all; and \\"Bron Yr Aur Stomp\\" is so foot-stompin good that even my mom feels it. (...)
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I must say, this is encouraging. The Iron Maiden of old makes a triumphant return in this album. The wicker man easily ranks up with run to the hills as another instant Maiden Classic. One of my favorite albums of 2000.
0071373586|4.0|First things first... Before I joined in my MBA course in Aug-2000, I happened to see this book with my brother who stays in US now. I just could read two chapters( the first chapter and the one on &quot;positioning yourself&quot; and career)...Eventhough for a 17 year old guy (then) I could understand what these two authors wanted to convey. More than a marketing or brand positioning book, I would say this is a commonsense book...If you start the first page, you won't feel like leaving till the last page. SATISFACTION GUARANTEED ! <br />This book can be a classic for those people who work in the areas of Marketing, Strategic Advertising Management, Brand Managers, and for every customer on this earth. Because this book talks about you and me who are drowned in a sea of brands, where our mind and body(count how many brands you are WEARING now !) is covered by numerous brands.Then coming to the content part, the books covers various issues on brand, their launch in the customer's mind and how companies win the mind share of him. But most of the statistics given may be wrong at the present times, still qualitatively the fact remains the same. Communication is the biggest problem that we face every second in our life. <BR>And the chapter on positioning yourself (career) is like a bible for every aspiring MBA student. The six factors for successful sale of yourself, 1.Company 2.Your Boss 3.Friend 4.Idea 5.Faith and 6.you... and the beautiful way of describing each factor is nice. What more can I say abot this book. Read it...
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I have a couple of young sons that are working their way through my CD collection.  I guess I was a little surprised to see them lock in to the Beatles, but then again, it was only revloutionary pop music in its day, huh?  Listening to all of those classic tunes and seeing them react has been very enjoyable, reminding me of the immense variety and depth of their recorded output.  Sure, much of this disc is just pop music, mostly love songs, yada, yada, but when you listen to it a few times, it really hits you upside the head, especially from the middle or so on, when their songwriting and studio expertise blossomed.  Having spent the last few months talking about troubling times, I find it refreshing to find music from my youth that speaks &quot;Come Together&quot; right at a time when it is meaningful to my kids.<br />This is a great starting point for people that do not have the individual albums.  Essential stuff!
B00000637V|5.0|This is the most beautiful and  compelling of Lou Reeds solo records, it always makes me cry, the sheer sadness contained in songs like &quot;the bed&quot; and &quot;the kids&quot; you really get drawn into the characters that are drawn in this little rock n roll play... the cover is just gorgeous too... the tired sad title track is just simple magic, you are in a smokey cafe in Berlin, you can feel all the people there, here the music playing as two doomed lovers meet and spiral into tragedy...
B000002JA8|1.0|Although I have very high expectations of the Pet Shop Boys -being a fan of them- Bilingual isn't even a half-way good album on its OWN merits, much less when compared to OTHER PSB releases.<br />After PSB released Bilingual, I thought that they should retire immediately.  There's only one solid song on the CD (&quot;Metamorphosis&quot;) and the rest are not even mediocre -they simply suck beyond belief.  If it weren't for &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; I would have to give this album 0 stars.  Every song lacks any imagination whatsoever, and is completely talentless and substance-less.  To say that the Pet Shop Boys sound bored and uninterested on this CD would be a gargantuan understatement of collossal proportions.  How other reviewers (who I'm sure are ALSO avid PSB fans) can rate this album even two stars -much less five- is way beyond me; apparently they have no discernment between talent, originality, and a lack of both.  Or perhaps they're so biased in favor of the bands they worship that they think anything their bands produce is quality music.  I, on the other hand, am the first one to criticize and notice MY favorite bands' shortcomings but I'm never unfair or TOO critical in my analyses of their music, either.
B00003CX5P|4.0|3.5 Stars<br />I've seen quite a range of opinion in the amazon reviews and my opinion falls somewhere in the middle.  I find the movie to be entertaining, if somewhat predictable, but very well produced.  But if the movie is less than expected from hard core fans, at least a continuity of sorts is established by seeing Anakin as a young boy and Obi Wan as a young man.  The video, audio and special effects are excellent, as expected for any Star Wars film.
1558216847|5.0|I found this book at a thrift shop a few years ago and once I started reading it,could NOT put it down.It is one of the most amazing stories I have ever read.I was sad,happy,mad and at times downright scared.It is a keeper.I was so happy to learn it was back in print.
6302824729|3.0|Although not as good as part I, Karate Kid II is still a worthy sequel which is almost as good as the original.<br />The movie starts off where part I ended right after the tournament.  Miyagi has some issues he needs to resolve in Japan -the homeland of Karate- and allows Daniel-sahn to go with him.  The entire movie, in fact, transpires in Japan, where both Miyagi and Daniel-sahn encounter personal problems of their own, namely from bullies, and are forced to resort to karate to solve them.  While the movie has interesting Japanese cultural elements throughout, the final fight scene wasn't exactly spectacularly-choreographed and turned cheesy when Daniel-sahn uses clasped open palms to slap the crap out of his enemy, his inspiration being a chorus of wooden paddles being sounded simultaneously.  Still, not a bad flic.
B00005QDW5|1.0|The concept of Pink Floyd's greatest hits is encumbered with two key flaws. 1) Pink Floyd never had any hits. They were an albums band. This endeavour is therefore a bit like trying to release Mahler - 20 Golden Greats or the Brian Eno - the Ultimate Collection. I suppose the good thing is that this release might help turn younger people on to the band, but this purpose would best be served by re-releasing the best albums in a cut-price  version. 2) The selection is dodgy. In my opinion they should have skipped EVERYTHING after the Wall, as artistically there is nothing that even comes close to the band's 60s and 70s output.<br />What's more I believe that some of these songs can only really be appreciated in the context of their albums. Money, for example, relies on the rest of Dark Side for its impact, so does Wish You Were Here. And...ah what the hell. I could go on until the cows come home. I would heartily recommend you getting Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and Piper at the Gates of Dawn.
630179513X|3.0|Although, not as original and flawless as part 1, Back to the Future 3 is a worthy sequel to part II, if only because it was impossible to make a sequel as atrocious as part II.<br />The story is similar to part I in that Michael J. Fox goes back in time and that most of part 3 ALSO takes place in the past, but THIS time it's a much older era that he travels back to (the 1800's) and the setting is in the old West.<br />The story and plot aren't as original or as fresh as the first Back To The Future, but part 3, nonetheless does provide a fairly entertaining combination of action and comedy that throughout, and the movie only becomes more interesting, suspenseful, and exciting as it progresses.  All in all, a better than average movie, but not spectacular or excellent.
B00004Y6NK|5.0|AUGUST isn't the typical Clapton CD--and by typical I mean it doesn't SOUND like a Clapton CD.  It sounds like a Phil Collins' CD, which isn't surprising, seeing as how Collins co-produced this album.  There're no blues riffs or grinding guitars on AUGUST and the shock might throw you, but just listen to it, give it a chance, and the beauty of the songs will become clear to you.  Why only one song, &quot;The Way That You Use It&quot;, was invited to be on Clapton's Best Of CD, CHRONICLES, bothers me.  Several of AUGUST's tunes should've been included.  &quot;Holy Mother&quot; and &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; are just a couple of my favorites.  But (sigh) I don't make music, I just listen to it.
B00000490M|4.0|Although, it's nearly 20 years old now, I only recently watched The Karate Kid for the first time just a month ago.  Although, for obvious reasons it's probably a flic meant more for teenagers than anyone else, it's still pretty decent and has a great story.<br />The scoop is an Italian-America (Macchio) who moves to California and has typical teenage problems finding acceptance -especially with certain groups- in his new school.  Being bullied around all the time, he finally resorts to being trained by a simple Japanese man who knows karate, to defend himself.  The approach in which he was trained in karate was more interesting than anything else.  Movements with the wrists, hands, and arms which are employed in painting and cleaning were the exact karate movements of self defense.<br />From an authentic standpoint, I don't know how much of the movie uses real karate forms that are existent and are taught or if some of it is either improvised or made up, but the story is still pretty unique and interesting, nonetheless.  And while I, myself, (I have no martial art OR fighting skills for that matter, whatsoever) could probably take on Ralph Macchio and beat the living snot out of him easily -just by improvising- the movie, still, has a decent message and was enjoyable.

0385505833|4.0|I don't know if I'd call this book a Christmas classic any more than I'd call &quot;National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation&quot; a classic Christmas movie, but, just as I enjoy seeing the antics of the Griswolds every December, I'm sure I will be returning to this book for some light holiday entertainment. And what's wrong with that? By now you know the story: a middle-aged couple faced with celebrating Christmas without their daughter who joined the Peace Corps and was shipped off to South America decide to sign up for a Christmas cruise and skip all the hustle and bustle of the holiday season. Of course, that's easier said than done, as pressure from friends, neighbors, merchants, and civic charity groups threatens to wear down their resolve. They certainly can't get away with skipping Christmas....can they? This is certain to become a movie showing at a theater near you for the Christmas of 2003 or 4.
B00005RJ1U|1.0|With such a promising beginning and a story that could easily have written itself, one has to ask...How could you blow it in such a big way. I sat in horror indeed, grasping my head firmly in my hands, rocking back and forth violently crying, &quot;Why did he ever get out of the truck and show himself?&quot;  So many great ideas crashed through my head during the first part of the movie as to what our friendly neighborhood killer could be, and what he was attempting to accomplish. I more than once found myself muttering repeatedly &quot;What the Hell!&quot;.  In short, this movie found new ways to violate me...don't let it happen to you.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|After a couple of decades of lackluster efforts, the legendary Bob Dylan has proven that you can't keep a good man down, with the superb one-two punch of &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; and &quot;Love and Theft&quot;. While &quot;Time&quot; was more brooding and solemn, &quot;Love and Theft&quot; shows a playful, even delightful side of Dylan that still exists within that complex psyche. The music is of a timeless quality, and some of the stylings displayed here predate rock-n-roll. The rootsy feel makes this album the most &quot;southern&quot; sounding in the Dylan canon since &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;. Bob can still deliver clever lines and rhymes, which, although more gounded and accessible than his &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; days, are no less expert and poetic. In an age dominated by boy bands and foul-mouthed rappers, this offering from Dylan is like a gift from heaven.
B00003CX95|5.0|I find it fascinating that people find a hard time telling the difference between a MOVIE and reality(see next review). However, if you CAN seperate the two, then Braveheart is a great escape. With good performaces and a beautiful backdrop to a great STORY.
0451191153|5.0|Before I started reading the book, I had watched the movie version.  Since I have taken both in account, I really can appreciate Rand's philosophical views.  This book is not for people who are used to a quick pace and thoughtless plots.  This book is for people who are interested in philosophy or thought-provoking reading and doesn't mind 727 pages. I know a few readers went into detail about the basis of the book so I won't bore you with the details; but if you want someone who appreciates good, classic writing, this book is for you.
B000002UDD|5.0|Hook in Mouth - Liar - Mary Jane - some of the best metal songs ever. I never liked Megadeth that much until 1988, when this gem came out.<br />KILLER!
B00005O892|3.0|Pearl Harbor is just asking for it by promoting itself as an accurate depiction of historical events. Instead it reveals Hollywood at its cynical worst. The laziness of the filmmaking is mind boggling. Utter falsehoods abound.<br /><BR>  For example Affleck utters the line &quot;P-40s can't outrun Zeros so don't try&quot;. Instead we see close in dogfighting scenes. In truth P-40s COULD and DID outrun Zeros. They could not turn with Zeros which makes the flying scenes utterly bogus.  The Japanese did not bomb hospitals and strafe civilian cars on the roads of Hawaii. Jimmy Doolittle never swore. No P-40 pilots were transferred to B-25's to fly to Tokyo with Doolittle. (Note to Buckheimer: Transferring from fighters to bombers is not like changing from driving Chevies to Lexuses.)<br /><BR>   We see scenes of Cuba Gooding, Jr. firing at enemy planes flying low so that his bullets that miss the planes actually would have hit the men on other ships and in the water. This didn't happen either.<br />And then there's other stupid stuff that's simply an example of more laziness. At the end of the flick we are supposed to believe that Rafe has taken his son for a flight in his crop duster, yet it is very obvious that there is only one person in the cockpit of the plane. <br /><BR>These things may seem niggling to some, but they reveal a movie-maker who is lazy and worse of all has nothing but contempt for his audience.<BR>Still, like Armageddon, if you suspend disbelief then the movie is entertaining. If you can't then you're in trouble. The sad things is that all the problems with the movie's accuracy could have easily been handled provided that the people in charge were not so arrogant and lazy.
0812550757|5.0|It is difficult to conceive of this book as a sequel to Ender's Game, simply because the two books are so totally dissimilar in style.  Ender's Game was a straight-forward linear yarn, whereas Speaker for the Dead is much more nuanced.  In fact, the two books relate to each other in much the same way as Ender's Game's Ender Wiggin does to Speaker for the Dead's Andrew Wiggin.  They are the same person, but Ender is a child and Andrew is an adult, just as Ender's Game is ultimately a children's book and Speaker for the Dead is a book for adults.<br />The greatest teaching of this book is that the Prime Directive as represented by Star Trek, that being the principle of non-interference, is actually just a particularly insidious form of cultural supremacy.  True, we don't artificially contaminate the culture, but in this case humanity refuses to allow the Piggies to grow, in fact forcing them to stagnate.  The book also forces us to challenge all of our assumptions about acceptable cultural practices.  This is particularly brought home when Ender chastises Ouanda and Ela for discussing methods of altering the Piggies' reproductive process to something that we would consider more humane.  Ultimately, while Ender's Game may have been a better story in and of itself, this is by far the more significant work.<br />As with Ender's Game, there is significant flaw in the book's logic, but it is essentially of a nitpicking nature and does not detract from the book's purpose.  I can't describe it without introducing a spoiler, so I'll only say that there is an inherent but unbelievable assumption that the character who leaves Lusitania in the last chapter is the first person to ever do so.
6305161879|5.0|What can I say this is a very funny film.  Don't waste time reading about it.  Buy or rent it and watch it.  You will not be disappointed.
B000002ADT|5.0|This disc is probably the most accessible of all of Davis' work. It remains the quintessential late night jazz piece .... seducing it's listener(s) into an all encompassing laid-back groove ....<BR>encouraging one to completely abandon worldly concerns in favour of a embrassing a fantasic voyage into another demension. A dimension where 'I'm ready' is the password ...... and total bliss is the outcome. A must for anyone who desires the best that an auarl experience can offer.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I must admit at first I did not like this film at all. The camera views were extremely bizare! I was thinking oh my gosh I hope this gets better and thankfully it did! It really did! The love story is absoulutlely beautiful!It's passionate and touching. You can feel all of the emotion in the songs whether it makes you wanna dance(Sparkling Dimonds), sing along(Elephant Love Medley), or cry(Come What May). After watching this movie you feel like true love really does exist! But in order to enjoy it you just have to leave your brain at the door and just enjoy! This is a spectacular mix of romance, music, and passion! It should definately win the Oscar for BEST PICTURE!
0385505833|2.0|Looking to Grisham to provide scintillating holiday reading, I was disappointed in SKIPPING CHRISTMAS. The plot was plastic, the characters were shallow, and the usual satisfaction that comes from reading one of his titles was absent. I had to check that it was the same John Grisham who wrote this.

0385247125|5.0|I've always wanted to just sit down and speak with Michael Jackson to find out what kind of person he is.  What makes him tick?  What does he think of the media who's always riding him about his personal life?  What about the rumors and myths such as him buying the elephant man's bones and sleeping in an machine.  <BR>This book gives clear insight on the life of Michael Jackson through the eyes of Michael Jackson (not the press or the National Inquirer or any other media outlet).  If you find this book, treasure it - I absolutely love autobiographies because you'll never here a story told from the view of that individual unless you hear it directly from him or her.  I've read it once and I will read &quot;Moonwalk&quot; again!  <BR>ERIC
B00005RDAE|2.0|BRITNEY: THE VIDEOS is misleading. There are exactly 3.. yes 3 music videos TOTAL on here. They are: &quot;don't let me be the last to know&quot;, &quot;I'm a slave 4 u&quot;, and an alternate &quot;I'm not a girl, not yet a woman.&quot; The rest of it consists of a photo shoot?! That's right, Britney taking cute photo's while &quot;anticipating&quot; plays in the background. Was that necessary?! Even worse, it also includes her pepsi commerical. To me, this was a complete waste. The record company could've put together  a real video collection with all of Britney's videos. BRITNEY: THE VIDEOS also includes a sneak peak at her new movie CROSSROADS and also the MTV performance of &quot;I'm a slave 4 u&quot;.
B0000065O1|5.0|Being a newbie at personal fitness, I decided the best route was to start with a video. I got this one and boy, did Cindy whip my butt! The first part is stretching and then goes into lower body/cardio. I fit this in when I can (college wreaks havoc on fitness schedules) and it took me over 4 months to be able to complete the whole session!(AKA-it's challenging!) Cindy leads you thru countless lunges and squats but varies this with kickboxing moves, running in place and plies. The second part is toning. Abs/chest workout requires wieghts, as does the arm section. Abs and back are worked and a good cooldown follows. Cindy isn't too chatty and explains things well with reminders of posture just when I'm committing that very &quot;posture sin.&quot; Well made with lots of variety and neat music.They also suggest modifications for those with problems like balance and back problems. It's not boring and is a great investment, no matter what the price!
B0000046KX|5.0|six stars is how i rate this disc, i have heard most of Patricia's albums and enjoy &quot;a distortion of love&quot; the most, this album represents my ideal in jazz.  i am not a conisseur of traditional jazz, however, this disc, not being traditional, i consider it to be the best in my collection. i wish everyone could enjoy it as much as i do.  the tracks are very dynamic, not repetitive in style at all.  i have listened to this album reapeatedly by putting it on shuffle play, it just doesn't get old.  Patricia has an amazing voice, as one will quickly notice at the end of track 3 &quot;you stepped out of a dream&quot;.  also track 9 &quot;my girl&quot; done as improv- is simple and powerful,- and quite simply amazing.  The performers fall together so well, you will immediately &quot;feel&quot; the talent that was brought together in this album.  I have had the privelege on more than one occasion,to listen to this album as well as others on a very high end, audiophile system,(LINN) and this is certainly an audiophile quality recording. I can't say enough about it, i'll soon have all of Patricia's albums, i wish her well and i hope for new releases.
B000003BEM|5.0|The Stones return to their own version of rock that they had started on Between the Buttons, and stopped on their Satanic Majesties album.   And thank god they came back to it!!!!!    This album solidified the stones place in rock legend, and marked the beginning of a stream of albums that all influenced rock in some way.  It also was the last album that Brian Jones can be heard on in any real way, (his meager contributions on Let It Bleed being the exeption)  his slide guitar is a huge part of this album, on songs like no expectation and jigsaw puzzle, and his sitar playing shows up one last time on the classic Street Fighting Man.   And of course the milestone Sympathy for the Devil, which is simply stunning.
B00000DHRX|5.0|okay, listen up and listen good. i'm in year 9 and me and some of my mates love this cd it's the most played disc in my collection. word of advice to you George skeptics out there-BUY IT! you won't be dissapointed. George rocks!

B00005RYP9|5.0|I only planned to wach half this movie one day and the other the next as i had to work but ended up watching the whole thing on acount that this film blows me away. The acting is super from the whole cast down to epps. The blend of the diffrent familys puts you in the world of organizerd crime giving validity to the film (making it believable instead of some knockoff yakuza/mafia film,)Also very welcomed in this film is the humor generated between Denny and ANKI. If you like &quot;mob films&quot; but want more (good story, humor, acting, purpose) then watch this movie
0452282152|5.0|Tracy Chevalier does an extraordinary job in bringing to life the girl pictured in one of Jan Vermeer's famous paintings. She mixes real history and pure fiction to create a beautifully detailed and evocative tale. <BR>This unknown, girl is given a name (Griet), and an interesting personality that makes up the colors of the novel. Vermeer, an artist whose life is known little about, is also given a completely made-up personality, yet deep and thorough, and with the colors Griet offers him, he paints the rest of the story. <BR>Griet is Vermeer's maid and she is responsible to clean the studio in which he paints.  She is the only one allowed to enter his studio and there is an air of jealousy from Vermeer's wife and daughters.  This special permission immediately causes a<BR>intimate relationship between Griet and her master. She learns the techniques to painting a picture and even gives Vermeer some advise upon making a perfect scene to a portrait. Though the two never physically touch, they develop an intense and sensual relationship that is shown only through subtle movements such as a quick jerk of a hand or a glance from an eye. <BR>Griet's launguage is simple but her expressions are complex. Her attraction to Vermeer is due to his charisma and talent. Chevalier creates a story told by Griet that is seductive and is a portrait of radiance and canniness. If you are not an artist, you will finish this book with a sense of what it is like to paint and mix colors through Griet's eyes and experience. If you are an artist, you will experience the beauty of painting through Chevalier's words and imagination. It's a quick read and delightfully entertaining.
B000000WA4|5.0|Smashing Pumpkins were one of the best bands of the 90's right up there with Nirvana, Pearl Jam, etc. This is the best SP album. There is so much different variety of music on this, not to mention, 2 discs, over 2 hours of music with no filler at all. The first title track is a pretty piano intro to this wonderful piece of art, and is the same theme found at the end of &quot;Through the Eyes of Ruby&quot;. I'm sure you're veard the 5 singles, &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot;, Probably their most well known song, &quot;Zero&quot;, &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;, &quot;1979&quot;, and &quot;Thirty-Three&quot; These songs are all excellent, but there's definately a lot more to this album. There are some heavy songs and some slow, emotional songs. Many people dislike Billy Corgan's voice, but I really don't mind it, and he is a awesome songwriter. My favorite ones besides the 5 singles are &quot;Thru the Eyes of Ruby&quot; (Which SHOULD have been a single), &quot;Galapogos&quot;, &quot;Jellybelly&quot;, &quot;Where Boys Fear To Tread&quot;, &quot;Bodies&quot;, &quot;In the Arms of Sleep&quot;, and, the rest. If you don't already have this, pick it up as soon as possible.

B00004Z459|5.0|This is the best CD I've heard in a while. Every track is awesome and you don't have to skip through any, like you usually have to do on other CDs. This being their first CD, and being so great... I can't wait to see what's ahead for them. One of my favorite parts about this CD would have to be the fact that they didn't cuss once and the music sounded great anyway. Most people who sing rock or rap music usually cuss repeatedly, but Linkin Park didn't cuss once and it sounded 10 times better. It made me respect them a lot more. They have a unique sound that I haven't heard with any other band. This is hands down the best CD and band that's ever entered the music world. If you think I'm wrong, bite me.
B00000JTB2|5.0|If you like the Blues then go out and buy this album.<br /> Albert King never got the mass recognition he deserved, he always seemed to be in the shadow of B.B. King. But Blues guitarists especially those who discovered electric blues in the sixties idolized him, to them he was the master. Eric Clapton freely admits to being heavily influenced by Albert King, recording Kings \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" with Cream, and still playing it live today.<br /> The Innovative television program In Session was recorded in Canada and allowed a pairing of two musicians who although simililer in style never had the chance to actually play together.<br /> Albert King wasn't sure who it was he'd been booked to jam with, although his manager had persuaded him to turn up as he assured him that he did in fact know this hotshot guitar slinger. On arrival Albert recognized the 29 year old Texan immediately, not as the young guitar star Stevie Ray Vaughan (Stevie had just played on David Bowies \\"Lets Dance\\" album). But as \\"Little Stevie\\" the skinny kid who'd been coming around, - and eventually sitting in - every time Albert passed through Austin Texas.<br /> Stevie idolised Albert. Even before he was in his teens, Stevie had been captivated by the Mississippi born guitar mashes uniqueness, the torrid tone, incisive phrasing, even the rocket like shape of Albert's instrument. The boy had other musical hero's most notably older brother Jimmie Vaughan, as well as Lonnie Mack and Jimi Hendrix. But it was Albert's influence that would remain the most pervasive through out Stevie's career.<br /> So this In Session jam was a true meeting of two guitar greats, it is the only known recording of Albert King, and Stevie Ray Vaughan performing together.<br /> It's long over due commercial release stands as a fitting tribute to the genius of two of the greatest musicians ever to have played the electric guitar.<br /> Of the seven songs they belt out six are staple Albert King live shows regulars, starting out with a savage version of \\"Call It Stormy Monday\\", and reaching spectacular heights when both guitarists go into orbit during the fifteen minute blues work out of \\"Blues At Sunrise\\" it fair makes the hair on the back of your next stand up.<br /> The 60 - year old Albert ruled over the proceedings like a benevolent father retaining control while allowing his quest loads of solo space in which to display his awesome power over the electric guitar.<br /> The interplay between the too blues master is uncannily empathetic, and Albert's fans will find special pleasure in hearing him play rhythm parts at such length, while allowing Stevie to go supersonic all over the songs.<br /> The only non Albert King song is when Albert teases Stevie Ray Vaughan into playing \\"Pride And Joy\\" where the master lays down a barnstorming solo on his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s song.<br /> Sensibly the Fantasy record label who have released this great work have left it whole and included the banter between songs where Albert often lays pearls of Wisdom to Stevie, I won't ruin it by spilling the beans, get hold of this album and find out yourself.<br /> Albert was in a sense passing the torch to Stevie, as he was only to ever record one more album \\"I'm In a Phone Booth Baby\\" although he stayed out on the road until his death from a massive heart attack in Memphis on December 21, 1992 Albert was 69 and had enjoyed a full life in the Blues.<br /> Stevie wasn't as fortunate, at the height of his career on August 27, 1990 he was killed in a helicopter crash at Alpine Valley Wisconsin.

B000056QE5|5.0|I was given &quot;Mary Poppins: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack&quot; when I was four, in 1970. I still hum most of the songs. You will too. Though it was released several decades before, it is a classic, entertaining and completely delightful CD.<br />These songs are silly, deliciously without any message. &quot;A Spoonful Sugar&quot; (helps the medicine go dow-own!) is as meaningless as it is catchy. Don't be embarrassed after a few listens, that you, an adult, are caught up in public whistling &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee.&quot;<br />The music seems a million miles away from the canned pop tunes Disney cranks out now. Don't get me wrong, I love &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; but there is a point at which today's Disney seems to be written to meet a market need than for the pure love of music.<br />Among my prouder moments in grade school was being able to spell 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,' and that I could say it without stumbling over each syllable.<br />I fully recommend &quot;Mary Poppins: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack.&quot;<br />Anthony Trendl
0783116934|5.0|Jeffrey DeMunn, a very recognizable character actor whom we have all seen  countless times and have admired  for a long time, gives the performance of his career in this most frightening and gut-wrenching film made for HBO. That it is a true story makes it all the more horrific. And DeMunn, as the bland and innocuous Russian serial killer ( mostly of children) scares you half to death with his understated performance..if this seemingly hen-pecked nobody is capable of such ungodly crimes, who might be living next door to us???<br />Highly recommended to anyone not only interested in true-crime movies, but for anyone who admires top-notch acting. The entire crew is excellent, but DeMunn's portrayal of Chikatilo will stick with you for a long time.
630575067X|2.0|'The Phantom Mence' was one of the few movies I fell asleep to in the theaters.  The character development is sloppy and the story is not really interesting.  No doubt, it is for children.  If you think otherwise, maybe you should have your head examined.  ZZZ....ZZZZ
006092988X|4.0|One of the only books I've read twice! I read this book in the ninth grade and again in my 30's. It's a book I've always cherished. The characters are lovable and believable. An excellent story of growing up with too little. The apple of her charismatic drunken father's eye, pitied by her mother, Francie is an every day hero. Her parents try their dreadful best to give their children more than they had. You want to hate them but you can't. She is a piece of everyone we know. A young girl who is alone and loves to read to escape the life & circumstances she has little control over. So many who read this book feel that the book was written about them. I mentor an inner-city student who I will definately pass this book onto. It offers hope that no matter how we start out in life we can all survive and achieve. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger! A great book for teens.
B00005RHGK|5.0|JEEPERS CREEPERS is a perfect example of how a horror movie should be: simple, scary, and entertaining! Victor Salva has devised a devilishly clever screenplay that wisely strays away from cliches. Justin Long (TV's &quot;Ed&quot;) and Gina Philips (TV's &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;) are fantastic and realistic in the lead roles of Darius 'Darry' Jenner and Patricia 'Trish' Jenner. Bennett Salvay's score is perfect in every way, shape, and form! Jonathan Breck (who plays the film's villain), Patricia Belcher (the hotel maid from 'HeartBreakers'), and legendary actress Eileen Brennan make up the film's strong supporting cast!<br />Congrats to the cast, Victor Salva, Francis Ford Coppola, and the rest of the productive/creative staff for making an original, witty, and shocking horror movie!
0790731509|5.0|I was flipping through the channels one day, and I came to AMC and saw Paul Newman cutting the tops off of parking meters, and I thought, &quot;What the hell is he doing?&quot;  Because, after all, that is a rather odd thing.  I became entranced with the movie, even though I hadn't a clue what it was except that Paul Newman was in it and it was cool.  By the time it got to the &quot;failure to communicate&quot; speech and I realized &quot;Hey, that's from the Guns and Roses song&quot; I had figured out what the movie was.  When it was over, I sat there watching the credits role up the screen, thinking about what I had just experienced (yes, not WATCHED, but EXPERIENCED).<br />This is one hell of a great movie.  It has so many great parts in it.  The infamous egg scene.  You actually can see that Luke's stomach looks ready to burst from all those eggs!  I wonder how they got it to look like that?  Also, the part where Luke is &quot;broken&quot; by the prison bosses. His fellow inmates try to help him while he is digging and filling the ditch again and again by playing music, but, after they see him break, they don't even talk to him.  They don't so much as look at him.  After all he did for them, they just let him collapse of exhaustion in the aisle between the beds.  They were with him when he was riding high, when he didn't need them, but when he hit his lowest point and needed them they were nowhere to be found (well, they were right there in the room with him of course, but you know what I mean).  You are really feeling for Luke in that scene.<BR>There are a few things in this movie that confuse me.  First of all, why is Luke sentenced to a chain gang for so long just for cutting the tops off of parking meters?  And, I think it is the second time he escapes, when he's shaking the bush, the one guard (the man with no eyes) starts trying to shoot at him almost immediately.  Wouldn't he wait at least a couple seconds?  What if he really was just taking a leak?  Anyway, those are just a few things I found confusing.<BR>This is really one the best movies around.  It also ranks extremely high on what I call the Rewatchability Scale.  I have only seen this three times, all on TV, but whenever it's on, no matter what else I had been planning on watching, it just pulls me in everytime, and I can't take my eyes off until the credits roll.  Everytime is like the first time.  It is that great.  Also, if you like this, get The Shawshank Redemption.  Another great prison movie, a little different than this maybe, but stil it's in the same vain.<BR>And now I'm going to go check my TV guide, because my copy of this movie still hasn't arrived yet, and after writing this review I really feel like watching it.

0380789019|3.0|I read this book while on maternity driven bed rest so my hormones may have tainted my view of the book. I loved GOOD OMENS and was taken aback by the shallow characters and gruesome descriptions found in NEVERWHERE. <BR>Richard Mayhew finds himself sucked into an alternate world below London where magic and monsters are very very real. This is no fairy tale world of good knights and evil wizards. No one is what they appear to be. In fact after meeting Door, a beautiful girl on the run from the bad guys, Richard isn't what he appears to be anymore either. His identity starts to fade and people don't seem to remember him at all. Including his girlfriend! Richard correctly assumes that his problems are a direct result of his meeting the curious runaway who has now disappeared. In his search for the girl he is drawn into a dark, nasty world of evil and deception. <BR>Although the plot was cleverly conceived I found the characters a bit flat. You wanted more. You wanted to know more and feel more about these people trapped in this hellish alternate reality, but you were denied. The visual descriptions of the underworld were quite vivid but they didn't make up for the shallow people walking around in it. (some of the vivid descriptions would have been better not quite so vivid...yuck) <br /> Over all I found the storyline made the read worthwhile but it's not something I'd recommend to anyone but hardcore fans of Gaiman or those who don't find characterization that important to their fiction.
B00005RJ1U|1.0|With such a promising beginning and a story that could easily have written itself, one has to ask...How could you blow it in such a big way. I sat in horror indeed, grasping my head firmly in my hands, rocking back and forth violently crying, &quot;Why did he ever get out of the truck and show himself?&quot;  So many great ideas crashed through my head during the first part of the movie as to what our friendly neighborhood killer could be, and what he was attempting to accomplish. I more than once found myself muttering repeatedly &quot;What the Hell!&quot;.  In short, this movie found new ways to violate me...don't let it happen to you.
B00005RHGK|4.0|All the fun of an old classic horror movie without the 'teen' appeal of the modern day suspense films.  Victor got it right, this is just like the horrors of old.  Shadows, the right score, lighting, camera angles all add to the supense.  This proves that a great suspense movie can still be produced in Hollywood.
B000005JAK|5.0|I think it was 1987, not sure.  I saw Husker Du's (final?) performance at the Blue Note in Columbia, Missouri.  Through most of my undergraduate years, Husker Du was my favorite band.  Total wall of sound from the beginning of the performance to the end...almost had to grab a table to keep from getting blown away.  Sadly, they got onstage late and only played for about 45 minutes.  <br />Candy Apple Grey is perhaps the Huskers most refined album, although my personal favorite is Zen Arcade.  I highly recommend both albums.
B00005U2LM|5.0|Yo, this is another classic with great production and things seeming like it use to be like the &quot;36 Chamber&quot;.  Off the chain songs like &quot;one of these Dayz&quot;, &quot;Ya'll been warned,&quot; 4, 8, and Definately # 1.  Yea new wu headz and old wu-headz or people who never heard of wu-tang, but like rap should put up the latest classic piece.
0060926317|5.0|There is a lot of controversy over this book. I can understand why. It is a book that promotes love and unity, a book that asks us to take care of ourselves and the planet, a book that us not to live life in search of more money and more things but to accept and use what we are given in life, concepts that us mutants (westerners)don't fully understand. This book is beautiful. It is the tale of a journey that one woman was invited to undertake. What amazed us about the book, was not just the journey, but that this aboriginal tribe practiced and believed in truths that are found in ancient texts of other cultures as well. This tribe does not just love the world, but is a pure embodiment of love. This book teaches us to value the important things in life...to take care of ourselves, our health, to take care of the planet, to see the divine in everything. Some of the things that this tribe can do may seem like fiction and fantasy or just plain new agey, but these are techniques that are found in other parts of the world as well where people live their lives as love. Unfortunatly there is a lot of controversy over this book by other aboriginal organizations stating that this book represents misinformation about the aborigines. The author only portayed these people as beautiful misunderstood and wrongfully persecuted people. Further more, in the book, it is clearly stated that not all aboriginal tribes are like this one she encounters.  This book is about one tribe...NOT ALL Aboriginies.  There is a lot of controversy because some people feel that this book is hurting aboriginal australians because they are trying to establish their identity.  They are afraid that people will read this book and judge all aborigines in this way so they feel it is necessary to discredit the book.  Aboriginal people will suffer from maintaining an identity with or without this book...that is part of life.  Each ethnic group, each race, each nation, each religion, each tribe, each village, each family, each individual person struggles to maintain an identity throughout life.  To discredit an author and prevent her from telling her side and her beliefs is not going to solve the problem. Not only that, but she wrote it as fiction, so if you don't want to believe that it is true, so be it, no one is forcing you to believe that this encounter was real, not even the author. what saddens us most about this controversy is that they missed the whole point of the book...petty little differences don't matter. look at the bigger pictures in life. Love eachother, we are all one. It is unfortunate that we need to create controversy over a fictious book that promotes nothing but love and being good to one another. The book is written as fiction so take it as fiction if you would like and don't believe that the author had these experiences and is mispresenting THIS tribe (NOT ALL ABORIGINIES). That is fine. Just learn from what this book is telling us: that we are all one and that if we as a race and as a world are going to survive, we need to wake up. We need to realize that what we do to eachother and what we do to the earth affects us all because we are all connected. Instead of fighting and feeding into controversy and worrying over whether the statements in a fictious book are true or not (seems like an unnecessary argument), learn to live your life in peace, love and in consideration of the earth and eachother.
1586212567|1.0|I read Rich Dad Poor Dad and loved it.  This book however is a lot of fluff.  He regurgitates the same ideas and words 5-10 times throught the book.  A lot of self-praise for himself (and Kim).  Not enough original work to justify a whole new book.  Looks like the &quot;Rich Dad&quot; product name is getting extended a little too much.<br />Do yourself a favor and just stick to the original book.  For the first time ever, when I finished this book I immediately threw it into the trash.
B00005U11Z|5.0|I have been waiting to see Journey for 23 years - seeing as I live in England and, sadly, the band's tours never reach Europe . <BR>Well, at last the wait is over, even though I've now only seen them on DVD rather than in the flesh. But what a DVD!<BR>The sharpest picture I have seen on any DVD, a superb sound (I'm talking the stereo version, I haven't got surround) and a totally stunning performance.<BR>Steve Augeri is every bit as good at singing &quot;Perry's songs&quot; as his performance on the Arrival CD suggests and Neal Schon's guitar playing in particular is inspirational.  The band really look like their enjoying their performance and it's contagious.<BR>If, like me, you are considering ordering this Region 1 disc from outside the States I say &quot;Do It Now!&quot; My copy from Amazon arrived in England in 11 days, as promised.<BR>I have only a few minor quibbles, which in no way detract from the 5-star status:<BR>1. The cameras concentrate a little too much on the audience at times.<BR>2. It would have been nice to have had either an interview with the band or a documentary on the tour and how the 'new Journey' came about, the disc is a little light on extra features.<BR>But that's it. This disc rocks!
B00005A46T|5.0|big fan of death metal? slayer? megadeth? mudvayne? static-x? this album is the fastest, hardest, sickest album ive ever heard. corey has the best voice in the world - i dont know how he screams like this - and theyre 9 piece band works perfectly. sick, low guitar riffs with brutal lyrics makes this the best death metal album since REIGN IN BLOOD
0446677450|2.0|Oh he's very good... very good at proposing very convincing and seemingly true ideas.  After you read his book, you may start questioning why you bought your house.  Why did I diversify my portfolio?  Why did I spend all that time in school?  I love it!  There are two reasons that his ideas are so believable.<br />First, they are simple - too simple.  This is why the book is written from the  perspective of an adult talking to a child (Be prepared to suffer condescension  with every page).  He describes the world so a child can understand.  This may be useful for a young child to begin to think about finances, but the  understanding must grow and the model of the world must evolve to make smart financial decisions as an adult.  I can see why this book is so appealing to  the masses.<br />The second reason his ideas are believable is that he starts with a kernel of  truth for every idea.  Ultimately the kernel of truth that he uses in every  argument is perverted.<br />If this is the start of your search for truth and are building a plan for the future, be sure to look at the other side of the argument.  &quot;Ordinary People, Extraordinary Wealth&quot; by Edelman will give you that and for a bonus he will talk to you as if you are an adult.<br />It's worth a read to if you are out to understand the psychology of best-selling books, and to see why easy answers are so appealing.  If you are looking for sound and proven financial advice, don't bother.
6303168507|5.0|The usual words you use to praise a great piece of work don't seem to do justice with this film. &quot;It's Great&quot;, or &quot;It's Brilliant&quot;, just don't seem strong enough. There are no words to describe such a landmark film. Steven Spielberg proves once again why he is one of the best filmmakers of all time. If not THE best. If you disagree, you are a sad person in a very small group. Filmed in beautiful black and white, the film was based on the book by author Thomas Keneally. It deals, as if you didn't know, about the holocaust during World War II. A man who seemed to be an unlikely hero tried to help. That man was Oskar Schindler, who was a war profiteer. He put his life on the line to save as many jews from concentration camps as he could. The role was superbly played by Liam Neeson. He delivers a wonderful and Oscar nominated performance. The most amazing job comes from Ralp Fiennes, who plays an evil nazi. A man so vicious that he shoots jews from his balcony as practice. An astonishing and unforgettable character and performance. Ben Kingsley rounds out the cast. The movie is raw and brutal. Nothing is glammed up or &quot;Hollywoodized&quot; at all. Thank god for that. The movie is very frank and up front about what happened. I can only imagine what the film would've been like if it was in color. Thankfully, it's not. The black and white fits better. Spielberg is a brilliant visionary of unprecedented talent. He knows hwo to give us thrilling summer movies, and then he turns right around and gives us jaw dropping films on real life like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, &quot;Empire Of The Sun&quot;, and &quot;Amistad&quot;. This film is his greatest achievement. &quot;Ryan&quot; might tie with it. This is a film that everyone needs to see. No matter what. This is important and educational. You'll be a better person for it. One of the best movies ever made. No question about it.
B00005JKOV|5.0|Finally!  A movie that is as thought provoking and disturbing as it is original.  I've never seen anything quite like this, and I doubt I ever will again.  I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Certainly I approached this album with plenty of cynicism.  I've never been a fan of Macca's post-Beatles work, although over the years I've bought occasional albums just to see if he could still  do it.  Initially this album seemed pleasant but uninspired but very quickly I began to hear the songs in my head and to want to hear them again.  After a few listens, the album's charms do appear, and increase.  The musicianship is excellent throughout (this has always been true of his albums, although overproduction and excessively cuteness of previous records has rendered musicianship hard to appreciate) and Paul's voice is really as good as ever.  It's good!
0452273331|3.0|He is the hero of The Fountainhead, the acclaimed and largely original 1943 novel of Ayn Rand, and the manifestation and representative of Rand's objectivist manifesto.<br />At one level, The Fountainhead is a brilliant ode to mankind. The unbounded and limitless demigod can do no wrong when he is he. The ego (fountainhead) is the source of all that is right, righteous and just (and unjustified) and rises above. Those who create, face and dominate nature; others are mere parasites. The skyscraper implies achievement; the &quot;housing project&quot; the prelude to the cave.<br />It is given this context that I salute and abhor The Fountainhead - an unnecessarily long book whose most virtuous characters have no kin, friends or family and abhor love of all except a subjective material creation.<br />I salute her conviction: it drips from every page. I cherish her writing: it is fluid as only that of a single-minded and honest artisan can be.<br />Yet I abhor the world she models. The paradigm that convinces that charity is evil and altruism hatred bears no real resemblance to the paradigms of the planet third from the sun. The notion that man serves by solely serving himself is too simplistic for this ball in the sky. Not surprising from a writer who condemns Nietzsche for diluted philosophy; and whose ideology pretends the earth as the perfect conveyor belt of production and product.<br />This reader's enchantment with Rand's conviction and literary prowess (despite the uneven characters) was not able to drown the flawed cruelty of objectivist good (ill?) will.
0375507507|5.0|If you like stories (and who doesn't?) then the reader will find this to be a fascinating story about life at its fullest.  Life sometimes good, life sometimes not so good, life sometimes downright mean, but taken as it comes:  life in all its richness, life in all its thinness, life however it happens to be.  With a refreshingly fluid style and a wry humorous tone that underlies all but the most serious moments of the story, it could well be the best story about life ever written, the best story about life any of us will ever read.  Alexandra Fuller's story takes place in Africa, her childhood home, a hash of people and places and politics and plants and animals all shaken together with surprising if not often astonishing results.  First Rhodesia come Zimbabwe, then off to Malawi, onward to Zambia.  It is her story, and she shares it with us as though we were right there sipping a beer under the veranda with her and her family and all the characters in the story, many who go out as quickly as they come in.  There are no apologies in her story, and perhaps it's just as well.  The story simply unfolds as it happens from her viewpoint as a kid.  She shows us the past is quite unable to be changed as it moves from moment to moment but, as her father once said, \\"everything has a future.\\"  <br />Though this book is relatively brief on word count, I definitely don't recommend whizzing through it, even though those voracious readers out there may be tempted to do so.  Instead, pour yourself a nice cup of tea, and take the time to savor every word, every thought, every scene.  It's worth every second to enjoy her once-in-a-lifetime experience in Africa.  Alexandra herself flatly declares \\"I am normal\\", but fergodsake she is not.  She is exceptional in every way, and that, my friends, is very, very good for those of us who enjoy a great story.  Zikomo Bobo.

B00003CXXP|4.0|After reading about a zillion reviews of this movie, most of them negative on the whole, I will risk a minority opinion. I saw this film when it was first released and I thought (and still believe) that it is vastly underrated. Yes, I was perplexed by the ending, since it is somewhat ambivalent, and the film could have been shortened by 20 minutes or so, by way of some judicious editing on the part of Mr. Speilberg. But overall, I found the film to be visually stunning, the characters entirely believable and the plot somewhat complex (hint: one must reflect on the film, in order to truly appreciate its major themes, that playing God is a risky endeavor and that to love does not mean that one's love will be returned, even by a &quot;parent&quot;. Obviously, some people prefer not to think, reflect or otherwise be challenged by art.) I cannot remember when a &quot;sci-fi&quot; film so moved my emotions, and I'm not a terribly emotional person. The last 30 minutes of the film are the key to understanding its messages, especially the precious state of being human and how extraordinary we humans really are.....the robots of the future (in the film's ending) understand this, but do we? By the way, this film should win an award for special effects, the robots and the technology really are incredible. I can't wait to see the &quot;bonus materials&quot; on the DVD; I will probably buy the DVD for that reason alone.  Do yourself a favor, buy or rent this DVD and watch the entire film again........it demands repeated viewings.
0800177177|5.0|Coppola's &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&quot; is definately the most sumptuous vampire tale to date.  This is, of course, the classic story of Count Dracula, a Transylvanian nobleman turned vampire in the 15th century who travels to London to find his reincarnated lost love in the form of young Mina Murray and must do battle with her vampire hunting friends, led by the brilliant eccentric Dr. Abraham Van Helsing,  who are sworn to protect her from his dark machinations. The film boasts wonderful performances by Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman (in a role that I always picture him).  Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves, Bill Campbell, and the rest also do their bit to make the movie a success.<br />As noted below, it doesn't always closely follow the book, but then what film does?  After all, books don't always translate well literally from page to screen which is why they are often embellished and effects laden, so as to make them even much visually enjoyable.  They do often take liberties with the story, but that is unavoidable.<br />The most enjoyable aspect of this film, besides the incredible costumes, beautiful sets, and fabulous art direction, is the sense we get of Dracula not simply as an undead killing machine, but a tortured soul, a true villian with a history and with his own wants and desires that make him not a little sympathetic.  But we never forget that he is evil and that he will stop at nothing to get what he wants, your soul.  This is defiantely one of the movies that I have watched over and over again and absolutely love.
6305428557|4.0|If you have been searching for a film with a heavy dose of Welsh spirit, search no more. My father began researching our Welsh roots a couple of years ago and I have since been caught up with all things Welsh. So imagine my delight to find this film set in the period that our first family member made his way across the sea to America. Hugh Grant does a marvelous job in this film, as does his traveling companion. However, it is the charm (and antics) of the Welsh village that carry the film. The film, based on a true story, focuses on two mapmakers sent to measure the &quot;mountain&quot; in a small Welsh village. Imagine the horror of the pride filled townsfolk when they hear that their beloved mountain is but a hill! In response, the determined Welsh concoct a &quot;plan&quot; that has a life changing effect on the character of Hugh Grant.<br />The film is a glorious tribute to the spirit of the people of Wales, the land of song. Hugh Grant's character is a spectator whose facial expressions will often mirror your own as the &quot;plan&quot; unfolds before your eyes. The Welsh scenery is delicious, and the cast is superb. The occasional use of the Welsh language throughout is, in my opinion, tantalizing. The greatest treat comes at the end of the film when we are taken to the actual spot where these events took place and are introduced to the descendants of those whom this story commemorates. It is very touching and humorous.<br />A beautiful story in a beautiful setting. In the language of a true Welshman, &quot;there is wonderful it is!&quot;
B00005LC1H|4.0|Unless you're a die hard Cleese fan I'd skip the interviews which are a tad boring and go straight to the good stuff. The firt couple of shows are a little slow but it gets better as it goes along and will soon have you laughing merrily.
0790729733|5.0|Oliver Stone's JFK is a brilliant piece of gritty analytical cinematography. It's much, much more than a film though. It would be a mortal sin to dismiss it as such.<br />This is the story of Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) and his search for the truth within a system riddled with lies and treachery. His research, following the death of John Kennedy, uncovers a shocking conspiracy manifested deep within the most elite realms of the US Government. The deeper Garrison digs, the more dangerous it becomes and the greater amount of compelling evidence comes into focus; revealing how, in true Shakespearean style, one of the world's greatest leaders was rubbed out by his own. <br />Even though his marriage was to suffer, his life thrown into the most unimaginable turbulence, Garrison never gave up his quest for justice and truth until his death in 1995. This is a film that any one who rejects the status quo should watch. Garrison's closing speech to the court is tear-jerking, articulate and above all, logical. <br />This film is a classic regardless of whether it proves to be true or not. It represents something that is very rare in Hollywood today - that is, disputation over the axiom. Sadly, made in 1991, it doesn't seem to have set a trend.<BR>Maybe the true meaning of this film shall be realised when the innumerable amount of classified documents currently held by the likes of the NSA are released for public consumption sometime this century. Maybe...
B00004SWBD|5.0|Ever since I heard them durring the summer of '99, yes before the album evern came out. This band incorporates everything that it takes to make a great album. Great music, awe inspiering drums and riffs, [great] vocals and lyrics, great altogether song arrangement, and finally, the sampling is exceptional (this includes both Sid and Craig). Songs like Eyeless, Purity (only on the orginal release, real Maggots know what I'm talking about), and Surfacing just send the album over the edge. Why can't more albums now-a-days be more like this. Imaginative, creative, and hard...
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Extraordinarily clever film. Somewhat ambiguous in that working through the possible conclusions and explanations raises some potential inconsistencies. I don't believe a completely rational explanation is intended. I've watched it twice and will certainly watch it again. This is a disc to buy! I only wish there was a director's commentary as his intentions are a bit difficult to extrapolate.
B00005JKHP|3.0|Well, as for a Director's or Special Edition DVD release, this one is not bad.  Good video transfer as well as audio.  This Director's Edition has some reworked visual sequences and redone background paintings.  The scene on Vulcan has been enhanced with some new backdrop matte paintings that give a better view of what the volcanic Vulcan is supposed to look like.  Also the approach to V'Ger has been reworked.  It has some additional shots of an approaching Enterprise to the V'Ger &quot;platform&quot; because instead of the platform already preformed, we get a new CGI rendered &quot;building&quot; of a &quot;plank&quot; that reaches out to touch the Enterprise.<br />Now even though this version is entitled &quot;The Director's Edition&quot; it doesn't mean a Full Director's Cut as in several scenes have been cut from the film while others have been added.  In other words, it's a re-edited version so-to-speak.  For example I have had 2 versions of the VHS version.  One was the &quot;Special Longer&quot; P&amp;S version which pretty much had all of the footage in there.  Then I had a Widescreen version which was pretty much the standard Theatrical version.  This Director's Edition DVD is somewhere in between.  It has scenes that were in the Special Longer Version that weren't in the Widescreen version and vice versa.<br />The Bonus Features occupy the second disc and although numerous, none of them are all that explanatory.  At least the ones that I have viewed.  However the Menu Navigation on this disc is cool as it's centered around V'Ger's shrine.<br />But as to my review title, let's hope Paramount gets their act together and starts putting out Special Editions of the other Star Trek films.  I'm hoping that they update the viewport graphics with some new CGI.  There were some atrocious &quot;fillers&quot; for some of the window and viewers in ST:II and III.  Such as fake-looking &quot;star fields&quot;.  But anyway, grab this Director's Edition and wait for the remaining films to get this Special treatment.maining films to get this Special treatment.
B00005LB9O|5.0|Travis is one of the greatest Brit-Rock bands I've ever heard, if not one of the greatest Rock bands I've ever heard. Travis has the right sound for their CD, and the songs just kind of seem to flow. It has quality to it, and I believe Travis is not done with their work.<BR>The CD begins with &quot;Sing (for Nora)&quot; which is a completely beautiful song. It flows into many special tracks and goes into &quot;Side&quot;. This is one of the singles from the album. It's a very spacy track. Other notable tracks on this album is &quot;Flowers in the Window&quot; and &quot;Safe&quot;.
B00005N5S5|4.0|Well I doubt I need to paraphrase the plot, so I won't.  But what i will do is discuss the DVD, which most of the time the only info I really want to know.<br />OK, first of all the picture quality is EXCELLENT.  In fact, it's so good that it looks as if it were filmed just yesterday.  (Except for the occasional Gremlin you see in the film, LOL!)  But anyway, the DVD case states that it was transfered from a HD master and it shows.<br />However the new 5.1 soundtrack is not bad, but you can tell that it's all new as to everything hasn't been &quot;stereo-ized&quot;.  For example, in the police station scene where Arnold is walking through and shooting everybody he sees his guns, there are instances when the gun sounds are in stereo in one shot and then not in another while in both instances they should be as they fire to the left or right.  Also the sound is really bad during the film's numerous car chases where the most dominant sound is the music while the car sounds are barely audible and then all of a sudden you get a sound in the left or right channel when the car hits something or makes a powerslide around a corner.  But...what can you expect from a soundtrack that was originally just Monoaral.<br />One note though, since I don't have a true surround sound system, that above complaint may not be as bad as I made it out to be.  (I have a TV with simulated surround and a 2 speaker stereo that has SRS sound)<br />But as for the Bonus Features, that's where you get your money's worth.  First of all it has several deleted scenes w/ or w/o commentary, all of which are in as good as shape visually as the Feature.  Second of all it comes with 2 really great documentaries.  &quot;The Terminator: A Retrospective&quot; that was shot in '92 (a year after T2) that's OK, but not too indepth, and &quot;Other Voices&quot; that is brand new that really goes into the making of the film that mirrors in quality the documentary that's on the T2: Ultimate Edition.<br />The Menu Navigation is also very cool which sort of takes you through several &quot;Cyberdyne&quot; animations.<br />So if you're looking to complete your Terminator DVD collection as I did after already owning T2, grab this one as it's the best version we'll have for a while, or forever.<br />Oh, one more thing about the sound.  They have changed the sound of the Flying HKs.  They no longer have that strange screaming robotic sound.  They now have a jetliner sound, which may or maynot sound more realistic to you.  In fact all of the Future War sequences have been totally revamped sonically.igation is also very cool which sort of takes you through several &quot;Cyberdyne&quot; animations.<br />So if you're looking to complete your Terminator DVD collection as I did after already owning T2, grab this one as it's the best version we'll have for a while, or forever.<br />Oh, one more thing about the sound.

0452282152|1.0|There is no journey worth sticking around to learn about.  This narrator is so wise, and just keeps moving on, knowing everyone's motives at the start. She isn't interesting, this is a very placcid, superficial read.  Her ability leave her family so easily wasn't real and fit right into another world.  Very disappointing read.
6304100507|5.0|I really adore this movie. It's been one of my favorites for a while. The songs are really good and I've memorized them all. My favorite song is definitley \\"Once Upon a Time in New York City\\". It matches my voice perfectly which is odd because it's also my favorite song.
B00005V9IL|2.0|Nice movie, great sound effects it was one of the first movies to succesfully use Dobly Digital. Sadly enough this NOT &quot;the directors cut&quot;, and is missing some crucial parts of the movie. Because of this the movie is kinda boring.<BR>If you want to buy this movie, then skip this one and go straight to the directors cut. It also include's a nice documentary about movie which gives an nice inside view of the history of modern movie making.
6305907145|1.0|Ok, maybe its just me, but I have this funny idea that when you write a screenplay based on a novel, I think that you ought to actually base the story on the novel!<br />I will admit that there were some funny scenes in this version.  Likewise, I'll admit that the novel is a little slow.  However the few inventive scenes and the need to speed the story up for the screen don't excuse totally abandoning Jane Austen's novel.<br />Its hard for me to judge, but maybe, standing on its own and apart from Jane Austen's excellent book, this might be a good movie. However, it clearly was not designed to stand on its own.  It was designed to capitalize on Austen's popularity and reputation.<br />As for my specific problems.  After watching this version, I reread the book.  There is exactly 1 explicit reference to slavery.  Its not mentioned as a good thing or a bad thing.  We're simply told that Fanny asked her uncle a question about the slave trade.  That's it.  From that, the movie extrapolates an entire subplot.  Let me go on record now as saying that slavery was a horrible institution and a blight on the history of man.  It was not, however, an important part of Jane Austen's novels.  If you want to make an historical romance with a subplot condemning slavery, fine.  But don't pretend its the same story as an excellent Jane Austen novel that was unconcerned with slavery.<br />In the book, one of the defining elements of Fanny's character was her relationship with her brother William.  In this version, No William.  To be honest, this didn't bother me as much when I first watched the movie.  I then reread the book (twice) and realized just how much his absence costs the story.<br />Jane Austen's Fanny was a sweet, mild tempered girl with a strong sense of right and wrong.  However, she was also terribly shy and completely unaware of her own worth.  In this version, Fanny is a strong-willed, confident young woman unafraid to speak her mind.  As a heroine in a movie thats fine.  As Fanny Price, its terribly wrong.  In fact, after reading Jane Austen's brief history of england(by a partial, prejuciced, and ignorant historian) [sound familiar-if not, early in this movie Fanny writes a book by the same title] I got the distinct impression that the purpose of this movie was not to portray Fanny.  Instead, this story seems to be an attempt to take someone' idea of what Jane Austen was like and insert Jane, as a character, into one of her own stories.  I've heard of worse ideas for a movie then inserting an author into her own story, but again, that is not how this movie was portrayed, nor was it ever explicitly stated.<br />Many of the other characters also strayed from Jane Austen's form.  Perhaps, most notable, Sir Thomas.  Jane Austen's Sir Thomas, while somewhat cold and reserved, nonetheless was a kind man at heart who clearly cared for his children and Fanny. (And William as well.)  In this version, he is none of that.<br />I could go on, but I've probably said enough.
0446677450|3.0|I'm glad that I choose to read Rich Dad Poor Dad, because as I was not aware of a lot of the money issues he brings up in the book.  It's not your usual economy book it's easy to read and the messages it sends out to the reader are very straight forward.  He spells them out to you.  I feel that I have a better sence of what I need to do with my money now and especially after college!  Don't become a part of the &quot;rat race&quot;.  <BR> As much as I felt I gained from the book if you are at all educated in this field, the book may seem extremely repeditive and dull.  The stories he tells are the most interesting parts of the book, because it put real people in real situations.  However when he goes on and on about they way things worked I got a bit board.  If he had stuck to teaching us through the stories it would have been perfect, but after a while I began to loose interest.  On the most part I enjoyed the book because my literacy on the subject was slim to none and I would recomend that if you are in the same boat as me read the book to further you financial education, but if you are already economically literate this book may be boring to you.

0525946284|4.0|I have been a Ken Follett reader since Eye of the Needle and The Key to Rebecca.  In my mind nothing equals his novel, The Pillars of the Earth.  With his latest effort, Jackdaws, he returns to the dark days of World War II.<br />It is May, 1944; the Allies are preparing for the invasion of Europe.  In the occupied town of Sainte-Cecile, the French Resistance is preparing to blow up the chateau that now houses the crucial telephone switch connecting France with Germany.  Bombers have been unable to inflict to disrupt communications for more than a few hours at a time.  The Allies want to disrupt communications for as long as possible so to delay warning of the pending invasion.<br />Felicity Clariet, known as Flick, a British Special Operations Executive secret agent, leads audacious, quickly-assembled team of female spies posing as cleaners, who hope to destroy the switch and Germany's ability to spread the word of the pending assualt on the beaches of Normandy.<br /> The plot, unique characters and detail of his latest effort will keep you turing pages.  Follett tells us that Jackdaws is based on a true story.  The Special Operations Executive sent 50 women into France as secret agents, 36 survived.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|kind of like a train wreck, you can't help but watch. If you take it in small increments it is incredible, piece by piece it is really good... trying to watch the entire movie is a bit overwhelming, but all in all is one incredible movie!
B000050XEI|3.0|Enya has a blow-you-away voice and I really think the direction (electronic) she is going with her music could be powerfully moving- if she could find the right producer and keep her lyrics from sounding like a self-help motivational guide.  This is just too cheesy, like a Massingill commercial- trying way too hard to acheive that summer fresh feeling.  If you want to feel uplifted by Enya, stick to her older stuff.
B00002E224|4.0|Before Sunrise, stars Ethan Hawke as a goatied 20-something on his way to Vienna. He meets Julie Delpy and they strike up a conversation that basically lasts for 100 minutes. Thats the plot, and that is what makes it brilliant. The dialogue feels genuine, Linklater is a good director, and he certainly has the ability to purvey a realistic feel to his movies. Like his other films, Before Sunrise takes place in 24 hours. It is a dialogue-driven film rather than a plot-driven one. Hawke, who has been typecast as the cynical, poetic literate youth since Reality Bites is a likeable character, and so is the lovely Delpy.
0767840135|5.0|This was the most wonderful show I've seen in a long time.  I was mesmerized by each and every act.  The whole performance was just magnificant.  You have to see this to believe it and appreciate it.  I'm looking forward to seeing more.
B000003TA4|5.0|Awesome stuff.  For an old-time Sabbath, Deep Purple &amp; Zeppelin fan, an album like this is a wonderful find.  So many of the songs are truly mesmerizing.  The lyrics and the rhythms are simply killer.  Timeless music.
B00005NWM3|4.0|i'm a 42 yr old stockbroker who grew up listening to steppenwolf, ted nugent, 38 special, lynrd skynrd,AC/DC ---- basically, hard, strong, rock and roll.  haven't bought a rock album in YEARS  . . . . but got hooked on this one.  the hard rock is good and solid, not the heavy metal crap that's been out for the last 10 years.  the lead's voice is superb, and although it definately has  traditional rock basics, the alternative overtone is most certainly there.  if i were to offer constructive criticism, most of the lyrics and themes are on subjects that are downers: domestic violence,depression over rotted relationships, etc  . . .  my personal preference is for my rock to motivate me ----but the high caliber of style, voice, and overall tone overrode the theme issue ..... if you like meat and potatoes rock w/ the alternative twist , it's a buy.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|I can see why people love this movie with its stunning visuals and usage of many famous songs. Its basically a musical made by taking the most famous songs of the past 50 years and linking them with a story. Or did they make the story first and then think of songs? <br />And I can see why people hate this movie too. The pace is so frentic, and the camera angle constantly shifting... It reminded me of the Doors film of a few years back! It made me dizzy at time.<br />This film is a decent modern musical made for the MTV generation. Is this a good idea? Well, you will probably either like it or hate it.
B00005NGAK|3.0|I had purchased this DVD for my daughter who is very much the dancer.  Unfortuntely, WE ALL were forced into snore-mode after just 10 minutes of this film.  I only have one word to describe it:  MUNDANE.  Sure, there were SOME sparkling numbers, but we had to search through the film in order to find them...<br />Although Michael Flatley is obviously talented, FEET OF FLAMES is better titled ME, ME, WONDERFUL ME BY MICHAEL FLATLEY.  Get ready to encounter major Flatley ego as you watch!  I haven't seen such a performance - maybe I'm just not as &quot;worldly&quot; as some.  Rather, I would have enjoyed more of the pure Irish &amp; Celtic Dancing I was hoping for and not so much self-agrandized infatuation with oneself.  Or maybe the problem is the performance was taped in England where they live, eat, and breathe Flatley.  After all, anyone's head would swell to the size of Texas with all that adoration!  So I guess it is inevitable that his love for himself comes through in this production...<br />If you are interested in more of the Celtic experience of dancing, I would suggest you purchase copies of his earlier works, before he was &quot;loved by millions.&quot;  That way, you won't have to put on your ego waders and go in up to your eyeballs...
0684852756|1.0|I have just read the novel \\"Intimacy\\" and the \\"Midnight All Day\\" stories by Kureishi.  Kureishi follows the \\"write about what you know\\" addige too literally.  Every monotonous story is virtually identical; about a neurotic artist who's either separated, divorced or cheating.  The only thing I got from this work is a more clear impression of the strange Kureishi himself. <BR> <BR>If you like reading depressing stories with no climax that go absolutely nowhere and leave you wondering if you've bent the cover too much to return the book...you'll love Kureishi's work.
B00005RHGK|1.0|This is a horrible, horrible boring non scary movie. Some of the rewiews have said that there are orginoal things in this movie. Huh?! There was nothing orginal! Nothing! It has elements that have been done to death in every horror movie. &quot;The Car that won't start&quot;, the &quot;there's a dead body down there....let's look around or let's see if he's just hurt&quot;, the &quot;let's go to the police and maybe they'll help us&quot; routine. Give me a break.<br />The story is pretty simple. A brother and sister are coming home from college. A &quot;mad man&quot; tries to run them off the road. They soon see the madman's truck and him dumping a body in a pipe. Then these two genuis' decide they want to look down the hole. Soon the Madman is after them.<br />I will admit that the start is pretty good, and what they find in the hole is pretty creepy, but that's done in the first 20 minutes and the rest is pure garbage.  The ending was so incredibly stupid, I actually felt ripped off by the rental price. There is nothing orginal or scary in this movie. What's scary is that the studio actually made this. *shivers* <br />I had real high hopes for this movie. I read a lot of good reviews, people at work told me it was good, and I like horror movies...but this was sooooo bad. I wish I could give it zero stars. It's that bad trust me.<br />If you want to see some classic horror movies, I suggest the Scream movies, Halloween, or The Fog.  I can't say this enough....don't rent or see this movie.
0131103628|5.0|This is the second edition of the original Kernighan &amp; Ritchie (K&amp;R) text. This book is commonly referred to as the New Testament as it includes the modifications incorporated by the ANSI standard, while retaining the nature of the 1st edition. This book assumes that the reader has some basic programming knowledge. So if you're just starting to program and C is the first language, this might not be the ideal book. This is one of THE BEST books on C and a must have, especially if you're starting your own little programming library.
B00005OCMR|5.0|I just have a few things to say:<br />#1. Amazon, you need to split the Tron DVD reviews up. The Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition) (1982) is WAY better than the other DVD.<br />#2. Wow! This Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition) (1982) <BR>is absolutely incredible. If you love movies about computers, and/or loved Tron you MUST get this. It's fantastic. It has two dvd's - one with the movie, and the other packed with features. <br />#3. This is in reponse to the person who mentioned glitches. These glitches don't exist on my copy. And the movie is in Dolby Digital 5.1. When Saark gives his speech it pans from not only left to right but also to the rear - this may be why you felt it was muffled - if you don't have 4 speakers. You need a dolby decoder and set it to 2 speaker mix if you don't have the additional speakers. What's really cool is the Dolby Digital re-mix (?) from this DVD sounds better than most recent movies.<br />#4. Again, Buy this DVD! You will not regret it. I don't know if a person can 'fall in love' with a DVD, but if it's possible, this is one the one for me! Tron is a timeless film and this Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition) (1982) DVD makes it seem brand new. The graphics really aren't dated at all since it's all conceptualized in a computer world. The second DVD is worth the price alone with all the interesting Tron information and the complete making of.
B000003S5H|5.0|I first heard this album in the background of a wakeboarding video and was hooked immediately. It's amazing how easily it melted with the slow motion acrobatics of the video. Now that I've heard it away from the TV screen, it's amazing how easily it melts with just about everything else. It definitely takes your mind/soul on a safari..
0156012197|5.0|Really fantastic! First time I read this book when I was a kid and I liked it. It looked strange to me that time but I loved this very special, very St. Exupery way of telling. Kind of poetry written as novel, really rare kind of describing and bringing things up. I read it again recently and now I'm 30. It was like good wine, it aged with me and I like the taste of the book again. It is more important than ever, I can appreciate other sides of the book which I missed as a kid. Nice and serious reading. I recommend other books by the author as well.

B000000HRP|5.0|Brand X truly marked the spot on \\"Unorthodox Behaviour\\", their first album. This group showed they could meld their unique style of intricate jazz with an over the top, baroquesque flavor of progressive rock, which, when these two genres meet head on, make for an interesting listen. After having already spent a few years with Genesis, Phil Collins most likely felt his drumming style within that particular group was lacking the type of creativity he demanded (although you have to admit his drumming on the Gabriel-era Genesis albums is nothing short of spectacular, either). With Brand X, he could now show off his creativity in a unique style all his own, and it definitely shows in Collins' first outing with the band. His fast-paced drum rolls, present in such tracks as \\"Nuclear Burn\\" and \\"Smacks Of Euphoric Hysteria\\" are a real treat to the ears (ear candy, if you will), and shouldn't be taken at \\"face value\\", if you'll pardon the expression. \\"Born Ugly\\" is anything but (ugly), and has a rather charming and mysterious quality to it, nonetheless. Percy Jones's bass playing is also mind-blowing. One listen to the CD's title track, and you'll see (and hear) what I mean. The title track features a unique and different side to Brand X, in that they can really funk out with great timing and precision. What's more, guitarist John Goodsall brings some of his Average White Band influences to \\"Unorthodox Behaviour\\" as well, which adds yet another multi-dimensional side to this band. This AWB-influenced sound can be found in a fair number of the tracks here, including \\"Nuclear Burn\\" and \\"Born Ugly\\". Robin Lumley's keyboard and piano playing carries with it such depth and magical stardust wizardry, and is the perfect crowning touch to Collins', Goodsall's and Jones's \\"unorthodox\\" jams - the cherry on top of the tasty, proverbial sundae, if you will. Phil Collins' exquisite drumming intricacies, as featured on \\"UB\\", can also be felt on his next two releases with Genesis: \\"A Trick Of The Tail\\" and \\"Wind And Wuthering\\" - moreso on the former than the latter (although \\"UB\\" came out immediately after \\"ATTOT\\", but \\"UB\\" was recorded just before \\"...Trick...\\", as the dates in both the \\"UB\\" and (UK edition) \\"ATTOT\\" CD booklets will attest to that fact). Brand X's next effort, \\"Moroccan Roll\\", would prove to be a weaker effort compared to \\"Unorthodox Behaviour\\", most likely as a result of the band's \\"incoherent noodling\\" on that particular release. As far as \\"UB\\" is concerned, not only does \\"X\\" unanimously mark the spot, but is guaranteed to come out in the wash stain-free as well, even after repeated spins!Of The Tail\\" and \\"Wind And Wuthering\\" - moreso on the former than the latter (although \\"UB\\" came out immediately after \\"ATTOT\\", but \\"UB\\" was recorded just before \\"...Trick...\\", as the dates in both the \\"UB\\" and (UK edition) \\"ATTOT\\" CD booklets will attest to that fact).

B0000035E7|2.0|Originally, I bought this CD in 1992, and it was stolen from me the next year by my college roommate. Now, ten years later, I bought it again. Mind you, I love Nirvana as much as I did ten years ago, but after I listened to \\"Bleach\\" again, I felt like I wasted $15. I still enjoy all of their albums to an extent, but in all honesty, \\"Bleach\\" isn't the greatest.  In fact, it's grunge at its... BLANDEST.  Ha!  If you get that... well, good for you, because that one outtake is more exciting than anything actually included on \\"Bleach,\\" (oh, the irony!).  Anyway, many songs on the album have absolutely no tonal range (\\"School\\" and \\"Negative Creep\\" are the worst contenders for 'most atonal'), while others (see \\"Scoff,\\" \\"Swap Meet\\" and \\"Sifting\\") are plodding and mindnumbingly repetitive.  Even though the instrumentation is nearly mediocre at best, the lyricism on most of the songs is surprisingly good. I'm not saying I like the lyrics to most of the \\"Bleach\\" songs, because I don't, but they are well-written. \\"Paper Cuts\\" is the best example. I finally found out what the story behind the lyrics was, and let me tell you, it'll make your stomach turn. To this day, it's hard to listen to the whole song all the way through without turning it off in disgust (it's THAT terrifyingly atmospheric). In a way, that IS a good thing, though; it shows that Kurt had the ability to write concise yet powerful lyrics without being overly explicit.  Kurt's lyrics pretty much set the basic scene and then let the listener's imagination run wild with what it must've felt like to be those kids. And although I don't like \\"Paper Cuts,\\" the lyrics are very effective, and I do admire the song for that. The nasty, sludgy guitars suit it perfectly. Too bad Nirvana churned out the rest of their debut like that.  Should you buy it?  Well, can you can handle rock music stripped down to its most primal and rawest?  If you're a brave soul and answered 'yes', then go for it!  Buy it from Amazon now!   <br />My favorite tracks: \\"Love Buzz\\", \\"Floyd the Barber\\", and \\"Downer\\".<br />Nirvana song most likely to give me nightmares for many moons to come:  \\"Paper Cuts\\"
B00003CXXJ|1.0|Like many others, I was drawn to this film by the hype and star-studded cast. However, after actually seeing the movie, I was extremely disappointed. Some people found Shrek to be descriminatory and prejudiced.  Personally, I didn't. However, the bottom line is IT JUST WAS NOT FUNNY. The humor, despite acclaim from adults and children alike, was repetitive, stale and un-intelligent. No person over the age of 10, would find this remotely funny. It literally brings me to the point of nausea to hear this called &quot;the best movie of all time.&quot; Unless you find an hour and a half of bathroom humor hilarious, don't buy Shrek.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt has made the first truly classic album of the 2000's with &quot;Rock Steady&quot;.  Not only are they unashamed (and why should they be?) of their obvious 80's influences, they wear them like great big badges of honor.  <br />Kicking things off after a short introduction is &quot;Hella Good&quot;.  The song doesn't try to be anything other than what it is: a big pulsating slice of sonic disco fun.  You can't ask for more from a song.  It's got a good beat, and yes, you can dance to it.  Hella good, indeed.  The song will be stuck in your head for weeks before it's even over.  <br />Hot, hot hit &quot;Hey Baby&quot; continues the jam followed by future hit &quot;Making Out&quot;.  A few of No Doubt's patented Madness/ska influences remain on a few tracks but, first and foremost, this is a power pop dance record that's not for the faint at heart.  This record is EXACTLY what this world needs right now to take its mind off of the depressing state of things.  <br />Ric Ocasek comes out of his Cars' retirement garage to produce a few tracks. The results are exactly what you think No Doubt would sound like by way of The Cars.  Prince proves that he is still somewhat capable of creating something worthwhile (that is, when he's got someone worthwhile to create with!)  William Orbit (of Madonna &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; fame) lends his hand on a tune (the dazzling &quot;Making Out&quot;), but it's Nellee Hooper (who has produced Bjork, among others) that helps make this album rock, shine, and glow.  <br />I can't help but think that No Doubt has been listening to, smartly, all of their Duran Duran records.  The inside packaging of &quot;Rock Steady&quot; even recalls some of the inside packaging for Duran Duran's &quot;The Wedding Album&quot;.  Nick Rhodes (of Duran Duran) should produce some tracks for the next No Doubt album.  The fabulosity of that pairing would be absolute genius.  <br />My only complaint with &quot;Rock Steady&quot; is the somewhat uninspired cover art (especially after the grandeur of the David LaChapelle photo that graced &quot;Return To Saturn&quot;.)  It's almost as if they were left with no creativity at the end of the recording process.  It's okay... Gwen, Adrian, Tony, and Tom can be forgiven.  The cover art is okay.  <br />The enhanced portion of the cd features the &quot;Hey Baby&quot; video, a &quot;Rock Steady&quot; screensaver, and some behind-the-scenes footage of the making of this album.  <br />No Doubt's &quot;Rock Steady&quot;: It's as if the 80's never ended!  And that's a great, great thing!
B00005RJ1U|2.0|I was excited to sit down, and finally have the time to see a movie.  I love horror films, so this one I thought would be a good one.  Through out the whole movie, I was entertained.  Good acting, and good suspense, I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next.  I was really impressed with the movie until a couple minutes before the film was going to end, I realized the story was not being wrapped up.  I was astonished to find out that the movie left us with no good ending at all -- evil prevails over good. So I give this 2 stars...I have to give it some credit for everything besides the ending.
B00005MG2Y|5.0|I first heard &quot;High Voltage&quot; in a MTV2 concert, and I liked it a lot and I wondered where I could get it.  About two months later I heard &quot;My December&quot; on the radio, and I decided that I really needed to get those two songs.  When I found it here, I was phsyced about it and I bought it right away.  Let me tell you This is the best CD I've ever had!!  &quot;High Voltage&quot; is not how I remebered it from the concert, but it's still really great song.  &quot;My December&quot; is my absolute favorite song, it's so meaningful and I'm glad I have this CD.  It's definitly worth the money, and plus I found this little insert that has all of the lyrics and everything in Japennese (well duh, it's a Japan inport) but I still thought it was cool. If you are wary about it, I say go for it and buy it!!
6305909326|4.0|Without being active into the World of Evil (I'll take God anytime, thank you) I was very gladly impressed by this movie. This is the story of a rare book specialist who becomes both entangled and fascinated in his search of the Devil. Johnny Depp stars as Dean Corso. He is subcontracted by publisher mogul Boris Balkan - played here by none other than terrorific Frank Langella. Balkan sends Corso off to Europe with an unusual task: to compare his own copy of &quot;The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows&quot; (a manuscript that has the particular quality of summoning the Devil) with the only two others in existence. And so the game begins.<br />I never even considered Johnny Depp as a good actor, but I was obviously mistaken, to the point where he's much improved. From the very first scenes Depp shows us just how much in command of his acting he is - as much as any good actor can possibly be. Frank Langella is nothing short of genial in his role of the calculating magnate. Lena Olin plays the part of a consumate &quot;dishy&quot; - as Corso puts it -, rich widow who desperately wants to get her own hands on Corso's copy of the sacrosanct book, a copy that used to belong to her husband, who hanged himself not too long ago.<br />So glad this is not a typical Hollywood movie. Johnny Depp aside, it is a Franco-Spanish production with local actors and sites, filmed totally in Europe. I loved the idea of the world of antique books as background for the story. Since I have a passion for book collecting, it was mother's milk to me. Just for that, the film will appeal to collectors worldwide. The leather bindings, the paper, the fantastic engravings... it makes one's mouth water. Moreover, there is superb acting from Depp and Langella; but every single role is extremely well personified, so kudos in numbers go to the casting director. The erotic scene of the castle in flames has to be one of the most impressive ones I've seen in cinema lately, and it will stay in your mind for a while, not because of what is shown but because of what is not. Typical of Polanski, his actual wife (Emannuelle Seigner) has a significant part too, but I won't tell, so you'll have to watch the movie.

B00000DCHI|5.0|Disk 1 is a great summary of his early work to his breakthru album &quot;The Stranger&quot;.  What other track could open this collection but his signature song &quot;Piano Man&quot;.  Some of my othe favorites include &quot;New York State Of Mind&quot;, &quot;Scenes From An Italian Restaurant&quot;, &quot;The Stranger&quot;, &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot;, and &quot;Only The Good Die Young&quot;.  It is a bit heavy on &quot;Stranger&quot; material but there were so many classics on that album that it would be hard to leave any of these out.  It's a shame when they came out with the remastered version that they didn't stick a few bonus tracks on it, like &quot;You're My Home&quot;, &quot;Prelude/Angry Young Man&quot; and &quot;Miami 2017 (Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway)&quot;.<br />Disk 2 contains the highlights of his most successful chart period and contains some of my personal favorites, including &quot;My Life&quot;, &quot;Big Shot&quot;, &quot;It's Still Rock And Roll To Me&quot;, &quot;Allentown&quot;, &quot;Pressure&quot;, and &quot;Tell Her About It&quot;.  Again, when the remastered version came out it would have been nice for them to add a few bonus tracks like &quot;Honesty&quot;, &quot;Sometimes A Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Leave A Tender Moment Alone&quot; (since they left it off of Greatest Hits 3).  The two &quot;new&quot; tracks at the end of this disk are pretty good too.<br />Overall a terrific collection but I do wish those bonus tracks had been added to the remastered versions.  What they did do right with those was to get rid of the horrible single edits of &quot;My Life&quot;, &quot;Pressure&quot; and &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot;.
B00003CXXP|5.0|&quot;A.I.&quot; is very, very underrated in ways -- oh, what the heck. Nearly every movie I like is underrated; but why for this film? Watching this in the theater was like a two and a half hour dream... everything was perfect. Now we get a glimpse of the DVD, and the packaging is perfect! And so are the extras. But I've read of nothing to do with any commentary yet.<br />I was very glad I saw this film. So was the friends I went with. We all aggreed it was an amazing experience. And it is.<br />Buy this DVD when it comes out... it'll most probably be worth it.
B00005QW4K|5.0|This DVD is the &quot;Official 'Bootleg' Edition&quot; of the third film in the Evil Dead series. The reason it is &quot;Bootleg&quot; is because it features the closest version intended by the creators of the film. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell have replaced the ending with the original and many scenes are shorter, while many scenes are much longer. The transfer is the &quot;best it's going to get&quot; as stated by Bruce himself in the commentary. Due to the fact that they had to find the footage that had been cut for the video version. The producers had tossed a lot of this aside to cut the film shorter.<br />The character of Ash is more prominent and what he goes through is more intense in this cut of the film and any fan of this series and even those who have seen the &quot;producer's cut&quot; as it was released originally will probably find this both entertaining and enlightening.<br />I feel that this version of the film does as both Raimi and Campbell mention in the commentary: it SETS IT UP FOR THE NEXT ONE! We can only hope that after Raimi finishes SpiderMan that he will have some good stuff for Evil Dead 4. Who wants some?
0525946284|4.0|Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors and I always enjoy his books.  This latest one was no exception.  It is about a team of female British operatives who try to disrupt Nazi communication in France so as to aid the Allies in the rapidly approaching D-Day.  <br />The book pits the leader of the resistance against a smart and determined Nazi.  The plot is tightly woven and the book is a quick and enjoyable read.
0440416027|1.0|It's simply astonishing that this &quot;book&quot; was in the &quot;children's books&quot; section, when it should be in the trash.  This book is garbage, and that is a compliment.  This goes for the rest of his work, too.  I met this &quot;author&quot; in April, and his arrogance was overwhelming, considering his work is akin to stepping in a pile of dung.  It's not even worth wiping dung off your a** with.  If it was possible, I would have given it a rating that it deserves: -13.  All in all, David Almond is a great writer.  Yeah, and the bubonic plague was just a rash!
0783229526|5.0|I'd heard much hoo-rah about Fear and Loathing, but, having never experienced it myself, I rented it one night that I had nothing to do, and watched it alone. It was ok. But, because I'd heard so much about it, another night, when I had plans to take a trip with some friends, I made a request for Fear and Loathing. Well, the only thing I can really say, that sums it all up, is that it is a completely different movie when you take a different view. Our drive was 20 times better because we watched the movie on the way, and, with no distractions, we were able to read more into the movie and appreciate small details we wouldn't have if we'd been just sitting on the couch watching it. Take it from a fellow traveler: watch it the next time you go somewhere, and you will NOT regret it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Well I certaintly think that whoever this guy is that wrote the Editorial Review is absolutely CRAZY!!  John Mayers album, &quot;Room for Squares&quot; is definitely one of the freshest albums out there.  Mayers is NOT whining!<BR>Now that I've made my disgust with the reviewer apparent, let me say that everyone should buy this cd.  It is brillantly honest: Mayers lyrics are moving and felt deeply.  Each song is so unique and different from the last.  I love Mayers voice: somewhere between David Gray and Dave Matthews.<BR>This CD is a must have...trust me that it is amazing and different.  (And if you are as sick of teeny-boppers as I am, this album will be a delight!)

All these books are masterpieces, but Siddharta is, for me, the best. Hesse is a wonderful writer and all his books are filled with profound spirituality and excellent character descriptions.<br />I highly reccomend all his books.
B00005QXDD|4.0|This CD is utterly hilarious.  Though they do not include some of the acts on their HBO show and live show, (I can't believe they didn't have Jesus Ranch!) this CD shows you not only how to become the next D, (It's tough going, picking T-shirts, gaining fourty pounds, and waking up at the crack of noon every single day) it also tells you how non-stop rocking is possible!  I now use their method, Inward Singing, often, but people laugh.  I have no idea why... I guess it's because I'm following the masters of rock.  City Hall, the last song of the CD is an epic tale of the Two Kings JB and KG in their rule and decrees.  Overall, Tenacious D's debut is one of the greatest comedy albums of the moment.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Well, I'd have to admit... It was very intense, dipressing, and made me notice who bad it would be if I had been their. I just can't beleive SOME people survived.

0792846443|4.0|Based on the horrifying novel by Stephen King, &quot;Misery&quot; is a disturbing and frightening thriller that will leave you feeling numb and breathless by the time that the end credits start to roll.  Filmed very similar to Hitchcock films, the movie starts slow and seems innocent, until you start to realize that you're in for a very rough ride.<br />The story is this:  Paul is a very successful writer of the &quot;Misery&quot; novels.  After finishing writing a novel that was solely for himself, he gets caught up in a terrible snowstorm and gets into a serious car accident.  He surely would've died if it had not been for his number one fan, Annie, rescuing him from his car and nursing him back to health while his fractured legs heal.  Just when he thinks he's the luckiest guy in the world, he slowly starts to learn that Annie just might not be that much of a wonderful person, especially when it comes to a point where she's literally holding him hostage in her house in the middle of nowhere.  Paul used to write for a living... now, he must write to save his life!<br />The directing and screenplay of this film was very well done.  I have not read the book, so I can't really comment if the movie stays true to the book.  I also really liked the music in it, which reminded me of &quot;Psycho.&quot;  Kathy Bates is truly remarkable at playing a psychotic fan with nothing to lose.  As you see her more and more in the movie, you feel her slowly slipping into insanity that will scare the hell out of you.  Although this movie is not gratuitously violent, when the violent scenes do happen they are very intense and almost hard to watch, so be warned.  Be prepared to see something very gruesome and painful... I won't give away the part, but chances are you already know what happens from some of the parodies of this movie.<br />All in all, this was a great thriller that kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time.  Since this is sort of a old movie, there are no &quot;eye-popping&quot; or &quot;jaw-dropping&quot; extras on the DVD.  There are some, like the trailer and teaser, but not much else, so keep that in mind.  If you're a Stephen King fan, or you just like a good thriller that never lets go, &quot;Misery&quot; will do just the job for you.opping&quot; or &quot;jaw-dropping&quot; extras on the DVD.

6302787122|5.0|Jodie foster and Richard Gere have the most surprising and amazing chemistry in this movie. The scene, post civil war, depicts life as we could only imagine after the south was defeated. This is an amazing love story based on honor,respect and pride.I have owned this movie for 8 years have watched it over a dozen times and still cry at the end.

B00005R87Q|4.0|This action-loaded rocker puts the pedal to the metal and rules the screen with incredible stunts, adventure, and very fast cars.<br />Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is the king of the Los Angeles street racing jungle. After a new guy by the name of Brian Spielman (Paul Walker) comes in wanting to race and take all for the win, Toretto agrees. Realizing that this toad has actually got the right foot to put on the high powered gas, Dominic lets him join his band of racing brothers and tries to get him racing some more. But what he fails to realize is that Spielman is actually an undercover cop sent in to nail them for robbing trucks carrying stolen electronics merchandise. With fully loaded tanks of NOS, the race begins.<br />What is so interesting about this adventure is that over the course of time, you forget that Paul Walker is actually a cop. You feel as though he's on Toretto's side. But reality breaks in when Brian must complete his mission in a last chance effort.<br />First off, the action is a rocket. The feel of traveling at 150 MPH actually sets in when watching the races. The dramatic aspect of the culture is really a bold tone that sends a shivering adrenaline rush through your spine. This film is mature enough to handle itself, while it seems as if one slip could send this film overboard. The stunts are incredible, and the plot (while simple and average seeming) is genious. The action delivers. I was impressed throughout it all. A sequel isn't demanded, but seemingly and most likely inevitable. <br />QUOTE: \\"Everything works. Everything sizzles. Everything makes it a great action picture. This film really gives a new meaning to the new-age \\"cool\\". The action is on overload, so be prepared for a thunderstorm of a distinct blend of pulse pounding adventure and brilliantly constructed plot that packs the fun. THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is a fire blazing tatomic action prodigy!\\"
1577312082|4.0|The book, &quot;The Power of Now&quot; is one of the most important books I have read (see my review of it) and I purchased these CDs to allow me to listen to it in the car.<br />This recording is true to the book (read by the author, word-for-word), but his accent or the digital mastering make the first listen of it difficult.  In time, one becomes used to it and it works well.<br />Personally I prefer the reading the book, but I have lent the CDs to friends who have already read the book, and they have enjoyed the CDs more.<br />If you've read the book and like the idea of having it in audio format, buy the CDs.  If you haven't read the book and are wondering which version to get, get the book.  If you won't read the book...but might listen to the CDs, then consider buying the CDs.
B0000024SD|5.0|I know... I have heard people gush over Highway 61 and Blonde on Blonde, but for me this is the best product Dylan ever put out. Mr. Tamborine Man alone is worth the price of admission, but add to it &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot;, &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, and &quot;It's All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot; and you have a classic.<br />If you are looking for a place to start as far as Dylan goes, I would take this over any of the many compilations. And go forward or backward from there depending on what strikes your fancy.
B00005OWEG|2.0|I'm not going to talk about the virtues of the added footage, or complain about lack of extras like commentary. That doesn't interest me. What did interest me was seeing this film again in its rich color glory. That's where this DVD fails. The source material here is definitely not what it was. Yes, it was stunningly shot. So good in fact that obviously most people don't notice that this version mostly uses fading stock. There is more orange than originally. It doesn't affect the blacks and blues too much, but the yellows and the red have more of an orange tinge. This is a classic sign the film is in need of restoration. I suspect this is because Coppola had to use footage kept himself so that there wouldn't be a contrast between the original and new footage. Still the images are fairly crisp, and there's no specks that I noticed. It's like watching the film with the color slightly drained. Trust me, the original was even more vibrant and rich.<br />I also wasn't too crazy about the new sound mix. For example, too much added Wagner during the Ride of the Valkyries sequence. It drowns out the dialogue, and becomes redundant.
B00005MAM2|5.0|All I've been reading lately in these reviews is about how people dislike the new dubbing. Well i have something to interject. Who cares about dubbing, the whole reason i wanted to get this DVD is that the original japanese dialogue was included. If you have that, then who needs dubbing. I mean the original dub for Akira was campy at best. Dubbing was created for a weak minded culture such as ares. People who say they can't watch a subtitled movie are the same people who say they can't watch a black and while movie. So to appease these dim witted cretins, dubbing and colonization was born. so, come on people, grow a brain and watch it subbed ;)
B00000DQSZ|5.0|Kraftwerk was totally unknown to me, before I bought this record. I'd read reviews and I heard samples on some CD-stores' websites, but still, I didn't get it. When I bought it, I felt like....wow!<br />When Trans-Europe Express was released in 1977 by Kraftwerk, that band had no idea of what that record would change on contemporary music. With its seven or eight numbers, it makes a deep journey in other parts of Europe, that we haven't heard of before - an endless journey, into the music of one of the bands that influenced the world, by changing the standards of alternative music.<br />The third record from Kraftwerk, Trans-Europe Express, had laid on the early albums of Kraftwerk (1974's Autobahn, the record that most Kraftwerk fans consider the greatest work, and 1975's Radio Activity), but still, it returns a melodic and harmonic sound of truly electronic work.<br />The albums starts off with &quot;Europe Endless&quot;, a part of the journey into Europe, that makes people imagine, how they travel into the beautiful and harmonic world of Europe, within 9 and a half minutes listening of pure electronic work. It turns into &quot;The Hall of Mirrors&quot;, the reflecting part of being in a hall with no end with the repeated lyric &quot;Even the greatest stars live their lives in the looking glass&quot;. &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot; kicks off with the revolutionary sound of the sound, we most hear in disco, and alternative pop, and moves on with vocals by Ralf Hutter along with the beats.<br />&quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;, the head-track on the record, takes it away with the sound of a train, the TEE, and is given the metallic beats in a flash of imagination and travelling. It walks further with &quot;Metal on Metal&quot; (which in German is splitted into two parts, with &quot;Abzug&quot;) as one of the good tracks on the record, where Hutter also kicks it off with the synthesizer. As it moves on to &quot;Franz Schubert&quot;, probably a tribute to the german componist, we hear the enjoyment of playing classic music again and again, where the main sample continues to the last track on the record &quot;Endless Endless&quot;, which is given the &quot;endless&quot; vocals, as it had on &quot;Europe Endless&quot;.<br />Ralf Hutter and Florian Schneider had with no idea produced a part of electronic work, which is the godfather to other types of techno, we know today. Trans-Europe Express is the best Kraftwerk-record in my opinion. All the tracks are essentials, and make me happy by buying it, you won't regret.
0451191153|5.0|Russian-born atheist Ayn Rand became an influential Western philosopher by a most unusual means:  writing novels.  It's incredible to think that this woman, writing in a language other than her native tongue, wrote two books that consistently rank in the top ten \\"most influential\\" books by well-read Americans!<br />THE FOUNTAINHEAD is the story of Howard Roark, Rand's idealization of the \\"perfect\\" individual.  Whereas most characters in novels are in conflict with society, Roark simply exists in the same space as society, striving to follow out his passion of creating architecture - a field that typically caters to the desires of civilization - oblivious to civilization's approval or disapproval of his work.  Yes, Roark comes across as rude, and yes, Roark probably isn't someone with whom I'd hang out on a regular basis, but by golly, Roark is a man of principles:  he stands up for what he believes, even if it means financial hardship or career suicide.  So what if those principles are not the same as mine?<br />Rand challenges our perception of individuality.  From our first view of Roark, poised on top of a cliff, to our last glimpse of him, standing atop a skyscraper, he is triumphant, confident, and completely self-sufficient.  Can any of us - especially those of us who consider ourselves independent of and unswayed by society's opinion - truly, consistently live that kind of lifestyle?
B00003CXZ4|1.0|The flash backs drove my wife and I crazy. All we wanted was to watch a movie and be entertained; not to test our patience on a friday night at the end of a long working week. One would have to be a movie critic to see the value or get the message from this one. If you are like us, &quot;we just want to be entertained&quot; don't torture yourself watching this movie. Unfortunately we got fed-up and quit watching before we could get any appreciation of its entertainment value.

B00005JKQX|5.0|Way ta go Opie!!  My husband and I saw this movie last night and really liked it.  It definitely is one of the best pictures we've seen this year.  Russell Crowe did a terrific job.  Ron Howard brought us an engaging movie based on a true life story. It is proof we don't need obscenities and nudity to have a great movie.
B000021YQV|5.0|Even though SPIN and Rolling Stone are the two most incoherent pieces of garbage to be available on news stands, they at least know when to praise a great band (although rarely). System of a Down's Toxicity recently nabbed album of the year from almost every music publication out there.<br />Not only is this album incredibly good, but it marks an advancement past the sound of their first album. While the sound on the first album was indeed just as amazing as this one, I found myself immediately drawn into this release. Daron Malakian definitely knows how to play a guitar, and has some great riffs that really make this album shine. It's just all around heavy. John Dolmayan definitely has a bigger role with his drum work on this album, although he still can't compete with some of the more exciting drummers out there (read: Joey Jordison). Shavo is just awesome on this record. He almost makes me want to pick up a bass guitar and join a metal band. Of course, Serj is the one who give the band it's character. His vocals are just as amazing on this record as he was on the first. I can't even think of anyone to compare him to. He goes from an operatic vibrato, to a scream, and to some good old melodic singing.<br />The songs on this album are fantastic. All of them just groove. From \\"Prison Song\\" (a fantastic song about our nation's prison system) to \\"Forest\\" (a beautiful song that is easily my favorite song on the album), to \\"Chop Suey!,\\" this album rocks.<br />Of course, don't let the hype of publications like SPIN coerce you to buy this record. I strongly suggest purchasing their first record to get a taste of what System of a Down has to offer. If that album strikes you, then go out and purchase this one.
B00003CX8V|5.0|A lovable and quite unforgettable comedy about why you cannot be a partner in other people's evils. Jack Lemmon is JUST RIGHT as the lead, a man who climbs the corporate ladder by renting out his apartment to his bosses for their extra-marital activities. He learns his lesson when he falls in love with the unfortunate mistress of his department head, realizing at the same time that she is unwittingly a victim of false promises &amp; lies. Shirley MacLaine stars as an elevator girl who must be \\"the martyr\\" because she fell for a married man.<br />One of the joys of this film is watching Jack Lemmon perform; and the film's whacky premise is a perfect compliment for him. \\"Young, cute and vulnerable\\" Miss MacLaine (complete with a suicidal tendency) is wonderful as well in one of her most memorable performance. This film is truly an Oscar winner.

Her father cannot fight, so instead of dishonoring the family name, Mulan takes her father's armor and sword.  This is the best Disney movie that I have ever seen.  The story is good and it has Eddie Murphy as a tiny dragon so there is a bit of humor in it.  This is a 5 star movie for everyone in the family.  A must have in your movie collection.

He gives a great amount of information about the voice actors and animators. I recommend this DVD for Disney fans.
B000002LEE|5.0|Jane's Addiction delivers a great album.  They are my favorite band.  The music is really explosive and getts you pumped.  However, tracks such as Jane Says are slower and not as aggresive.  The music is easy to relate to and yet it gets you think about overlooked simple things.  Its extremly fun and creative.  In addition the guitar rifts and improves are great.  This album was a little hard to get into at first but eventually you'll find yourself singing along to all of it.

Most of my friends know that I am into books, you wouldnt know it by my personality, because Im outgoing, but I love good books, and often review them.  This book was one of the best thatIve read.  This book has to do with a young man, who knows this girl for basically his life, and never really saw her.  <BR>      When he finally realizes that shes not just the girl he used to know, but much more, sparks begin to fly.. but will the love stand through what the girl has to tell him?  I suggest that you try the book, its a tearjerker, but its a good one.

B00005U11Z|4.0|Neal, Ross, Jonathan... I miss the 2 Steves. However, Deen and the new Steve are no slouches. The mix is strong, and the picture is brilliant. this is probably one of the best looking and sounding dvds i own.<br />As for the performance, it's stunning. Deen Castronovo slams pretty hard, maybe a little too hard for Journey (he was perfect in Bad English and Hardline, though). Steve Augeri hits the notes with what seems like true respect for Mr. Perry, even if he had to do some overdubs here and there (?).<br />But let's get to the meat of the show: Neal Schon's playing.<br />Never better. the guy just improves with every album/tour/gig!<br />It's good to see Ross Valory groovin so hard; and Jonathan Cain doing everything else to make each song sound as good as, or better than, the original recordings.<br />It's been a long time since we've had a Journey home video, and even though it's the non-Perry Journey, it's still quite good. Sure I'd love to see the old stuff reissued on dvd, but til then, this will get played on my tv alot.<br />buy it, you'll be glad you did!
B00005TT77|4.0|I bought this CD based on the good reviews I read here.  I needed something new to listen to at work and thought this would be different.  I am not disappointed but I don't Love it as much as some people seem to.<br />I am old enough to remember when every single one of the tunes on this CD was new!  I loved the Beatles - sat in front of the TV and screamed and cried.  As I grew up, I really started listening to the music and still rever them as artists.  My favorite album is the \\"White\\" album and there are several from that album on this CD.  So, that made me happy.<br />I think that it will grow on me.  I really like \\"Blackbird\\" (one of my favorite Beatle songs)  Nowhere Man, Mother Nature's Son and Let it Be.  Two of us is Cool and Golden Slumbers is okay too.  My problem comes with Revolution (sounds like the Monkees), Strawberry Fields, Lucy in the Sky, and Help.  These songs are done so well by the Beatles and are so closely identified with them, I don't think anyone else should even try.  They just don't come off right on this CD.<br />What amazes me most about this CD is how fresh some of these songs still sound today 30-35 years later.  If you had just landed from Mars and never heard of the Beatles, these songs would still work.  Sheryl Crow is super and her Mother Nature's Son is the best track on the CD, in my opinion.  Even Julia is totally fresh with a different spin on it.<br />The Beatles made GREAT music and that it can be recorded by such a diverse group of musicians and, for the most part, still work, is the greatest tribute to them yet.  I guess I will just skip the tunes I don't feel are well done and enjoy the rest of the CD!!!
B00005OLY5|5.0|This movie is better than Lord of the Rings, and shorter too.  Willow is a little fellow who unwittingly stumbles upon THE baby destined to save the world.  Not for kids under 7, there are some scary scenes, but a movie you will definitely watch over and over.  Very exciting and full of adventure.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I've always admired Pink Floyd cause i think It's the best Rock band ever. I've gotten this alblum last christmas and i was happy, it's got some of their best songs such as &quot; Money&quot;<br />and &quot; Brick in the Wall&quot;.<br />If you enjoy Pink Floyd's music get this 2-Disc experience, you won't be disappointed.
B00005Q45W|5.0|This album is profound.  From &quot;In My Secret Life&quot; to &quot;The Land of Plenty&quot; this repertoire touches the soul.  Listen to the words, feel the music.  The careful choice of words and delicate sensibility of the accompanying music and vocals create a beauty and resonance that is truly profound.  Truly beautiful!  The artist has achieved peace and tranquilty within himself that is communicated without reservation to the careful listener.
0446608955|5.0|I have to say this is probably one of the best books have a read! I had a book report to do for my English class and I had a completly different book picked out... I was ready to leave until I came across this book.. I read the back of the book and I knew this was going to be a good one. There has never been a time when I couldn't put a book down, but this one was different... by the time I got to Chapter 9 I read until the end in one sitting and I do have to agree when he says &quot;first you will smile, then you will cry&quot; That is true! This was a touching book.. I loved every bit of it.. I even gave it to my freind to read and she ended up buying it for her sister to read! We can't wait to go see the movie this coming Friday! This is definatly a must read book!
B00005R87Q|5.0|I loved this movie.I was the best movie I ever saw.Shur they made a few mistaks but who dosn't.I wanted to rate this movie 100 stars but I couldn't.This move is totley awsome
B00005R87Q|3.0|'The Fast and the Furious' was one of the better racing movies I've ever seen. 'Driven' was terrible but when I saw this film at the budget I knew I'd have to have it on DVD when it arrived. Yeah, let me get it all straight: there is no plot, no script and no acting. Vin Diesel, who was much better in 'Saving Private Ryan' or even 'Pitch Black', did a poor job here, but we continue to watch Stallone and Schwarzenegger, right? Case closed. <br />But back to the film itself: 'The Fast and the Furious' is not supposed to be nominated for Best Picture this year. Everyone in this world is always wanting the next big hit. Haven't you noticed that great movies are just about extinct due to the fact that producers are trying TOO hard? (Look at Pearl Harbor.) 'The Fast and the Furious' was made for teens and those who love cars. I'm 16 years old and thought this movie was average. My friends loved it. I can't stand movies with a plot as thin as paper and a script that is non-existent, (not to mention terrible acting, which this movie has), but when I went to see 'The Fast and the Furious', I knew I'd get fast cars and fast action. That's what I got and I left satisfied.<br />If you want the next 'Shindler's List', 'Forrest Gump' or 'Titanic', avoid this film at all costs. If you're willing to look at who it was made for and why it was made, go right ahead. <br />(Note: The DVD is great, too. The picture and sound quality is outstanding and the extras are plentiful. (I've yet to get through them all.))<br />Thanks for reading. Remember: everything isn't made for the academy, but for the people who really count: the viewers.
0767802470|5.0|This is a great CD. I watched it last night and again this morning. As one audio option, there is the director's comments all through the picture. Turn on the sub-titles and enjoy both.<br />This is a long movie, so make sure you have plenty of popcorn. And don't expect it to be one of those war movies. This is a drama about the lives of the men in a U-boat during WWII. Surprisingly, there is not much violence. It deals more with their thoughts, emotions, and frustration with the German high command. There is action, but mostly in trying to survive depth charge attacks and equipment failures.  Special effects are somewhat lacking, so don't look too closely, but I found the story line more than interesting enough to allow me to ignore any flaws.
B000050XEI|1.0|Do you like the sound of a ticking clock? Do you eschew the stairs in favor of elevators because of the great music on them? Did you wear out your copy of the &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; soundtrack? Do you worry that Kathy Lee may never record again? Do you dream about what a John Tesh/Yanni collaboration would sound like?<br />If you answered yes to these questions you will love Enya. I disliked this CD so strongly I listened to it a second time recently just to see if I had been too harsh, too quick to condemm. I wasn't. It's horrible music that has strange sound effects on several tracks that sounded similar to turning the Dolby on and off when playing a cassette tape. How creative.
0780020685|5.0|Akira Kurosawa made \\"Seven Samurai\\" because he wanted to make a real \\"jidai-geki,\\" a real period-film that would present the past as meaningful, while also being an entertaining film.  Kurosawa considered \\"Rashomon,\\" the film rightfully credited with making the West aware of the Japanese cinema, with being neither.  But in his attempt to make a truly \\"realistic\\" film, Kurosawa redefined the conflict at the heart of Japanese films.  Before \\"Seven Samurai\\" this conflict was that of love versus duty, where the central character is compelled by fate to sacrifice what he loves in the name of duty.  In \\"Seven Samurai\\" the focus remains on duty, yet the conflict is now between the real and the pretended.  Calling yourself a samurai does not make you one, something proven time and time again in the film, from the test of skill turned deadly between Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi) and the tall samurai to the first appearance of Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune), with his stolen pedigree.  Like Katshushiro (Ko Kimura), the youngster who wants to learn from the master, Kambei (Takashi Shimura), the audience is educated as to the true nature of the samurai.<br /><br />For me this film deals with the heroic, albeit in realistic terms.  I have shown the film in World Literature classes, after students have read Homer's \\"Iliad\\" and as they begin reading Cervantes' \\"Don Quixote.\\"  Within that context, compared to the brutal arrogance of Achilles and the gentle insanity of Quixote, the heroic qualities of the seven samurai become clear.  Their inspiration extends to some of the villagers.  Manzo (Kamatari Fujiwara) is crazed with fear over the virtue of his daughter, Shino (Keiko Tsushima), and Rikichi (Yoshio Tsuchiya) fights to avenge the disgrace of his wife and his precipitating the death of Heihachi (Minoru Chiaki), but it is the comic Yohei (Bokuzen Hidari), who finds within himself the ability to fight, a die a tragic death, who is the true barometer for what the samurai mean to the village.  But the greatest tragedy is that despite this most noble effort and the bodies buried in honor at the top of the village cemetery, this has been but a temporary union between the villagers and the samurai.  When Kambei declares, \\"We have lost again,\\" he redefines the battles: it was not to kill all the bandits, it was to find a true place in the world.  Yet we should have already known this, for the painful truth was driven home when Kyuzo, the master swordsman, is gunned down from behind.  No better proof is needed in this film of the bitter truth that the world is not fair.<br /><br />Mifune is the maniacal spirit of this film, as the faux-samurai Kikuchiyo, the dancing whirlwind whose emotions overwhelm everything including himself.  But it is Shimura as Kambei, who embodies the mentor mentality with a minimum of effort, evoking more by rubbing his hand over his shaved head or giving a single piercing look than by any spoken dialogue.  Even in a strong ensemble these performances stand out, for clearly different reasons.  To fully appreciate Kurosawa's mastery in \\"Seven Samurai\\" you need to watch the film several times to better appreciate the way he constructs scenes, using contrasting images, evocative music and varying the length of cuts to affect tempo.  For example, look carefully at how the early scene of the farmers searching the streets for samurai and the later sequence where Katsushiro watches Kyuzo and Kikuchiyo waiting for the bandit scouts to return to their horses.  Both of these scenes are superb primers to Kurosawa's style.<br /><br />For years we had to put with the 160-minute version of the film that was made for export, which was actually called \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" until John Strugis's Western remake.  Fortunately, \\"Seven Samurai\\" has been restored to full 208-minute glory, saved from being a lamentable cinematic tragedy on a par with \\"Greed,\\" \\"The Magnificent Ambersons,\\" and \\"Ivan the Terrible.\\"  There is a sense in which \\"Seven Samurai\\" is truly my favorite film, because it was the one that instilled in me a love of cinema, of the craft and art of movie making, of compelling me to understand intellectually how Kurosawa was skillfully manipulating my emotions.  The final battle sequences, fought and filmed in a torrent of rain, exhausting characters and audience alike with its increasingly relentless tempo, is given its potency because of the human elements that have been established in all that has taken place before hand.  \\"Seven Samurai\\" is a magnificent film against which the vast majority of epics pale in comparison.  Not even Kurosawa scaled these heights ever again.te film, because it was the one that instilled in me a love of cinema, of the craft and art of movie making, of compelling me to understand intellectually how Kurosawa was skillfully manipulating my emotions.

B00002E224|5.0|When I heard the story line for Before Sunrise, a slacker American played by Ethan Hawke falls in love in Europe with Julie Delpy, I rolled my eyes. But this is a thoughftul and compelling movie that broke down my skeptical and cynical wall. First, the movie takes us through the awkward stages of two people going from being perfect strangers to removing their own walls and falling in love in a way that is never sappy. Using this falling-in-love motif, the director/writer Richard Linklater addresses several profound themes: the nature of time, the conflict between cynicism and romance, the obsession with death, the shortcomings of &quot;adulthood.&quot; The dialogue between Hawke and Delpy is philosophical but never too abstract; it seems to stem from their well-drawn characters. I suppose there's a parallel between the breaking down of my own cynicism and the characters'. They have been hurt by life, have put up their walls, and, through their discussions, they have gradually removed those walls so that by the movie's end you think it's a crime if they don't fall in love and live happily ever after. But the movie is more complex than a happy ending. The movie forces you to ask if their love would survive if removed from the brief ecstasy of their single day (and night) together. Is the brevity the cause of their ecstasy? Would a life of marriage disintigrate into the mundane? The characters struggle with these questions in what is my favorite romantic movie.
B00003CXA2|4.0|Forrest Gump is one of those movies everyone knows. You don't have to see it to know many of the lines that have become cliches since its release in 1994. My theory is that if you're searching for a movie here on Amazon.com, you most-likely have heard about it or no the basic plot, so I'm here to share with you my take on this DVD:<br />First, this is the collector's edition DVD of Forrest Gump, which consists of 2 discs, a very nice feature. There are many documentaries and interviews, but this film also comes with two trailers, screen tests, several making-of features that include make-up design and how they made the special effects. The picture quality is almost-perfect, a little grainy in a few places, but that could just be my player. (4.5 stars out of 5 for that.) The sound quality is good as well, also earning top marks. My only complaint with this film is that the trailers aren't on the first disc with the movie itself. I love watching trailers and don't like switching discs to watch it just to pop the first back in to see the movie, but other than that minor detriment, this is a great DVD. <br />Forrest Gump is one of the few movies deserving of all the praise and Academy Awards it received and is also one of my all-time favorite movies.
B00003CXXS|3.0|Decent, but not great story line. The original was by far the best.  The dinosaurs in this one, however, are much better, and more realistic. I've watched it a couple of times and find it enough entertainment for my satisfaction.<br />The DVD itself has plenty of information on the making of the film and how they did the special effects. There aren't many special effects on the DVD, however.  There was one dead spot for sound towards the end of the movie.
B00005JKHP|3.0|I cried tears of joy when I first saw this movie in the theater. Thats how big a ST fan I am. But this DVD has serious problems. I can't understand why they did not clean up the film better. The noise during the darker scenes made me think I was watching the film at a theater that had already played it 200 times. I found this to be a major distraction, especially since the noise stopped during the new CG scenes. Several scenes have been deleted, supposedly to tighten up the story. But this version of the movie will still be boring to any one, except Star Trek fans like me, who would have appreciated the deleted scenes. Only for tue fans.
B00003CXXS|3.0|While this film contains technological advancements over the first two and presents the return of Sam Neill, the franchise seems to have run out of ideas and resorts to one big game of dodge the dinosaur.  I guess they figured that it is better to have no story than a stupid story (see JPII).  Dr. Allen Grant (Neill) is tricked into returning to dinoland by a couple trying to find their son, who was lost on the island in an inane parasailing accident in the opening scene.  Once there, it is the movie version of \\"Survivor\\" where the creatures carnivorously vote the cast off the island.  The chase begins very early in the film, pre-empting any hope of a meaningful storyline.<br />Director Joe Johnston started his career as an art director, doing visual effects for \\"Star Wars\\", so it is no surprise that this film emphasizes visual effects.  In this respect it is superlative.  The integration of computer generated images and animaltronics is state of the art and brings us a realism that could barely be surpassed by being amidst the dinosaurs in real life.  They have improved the look and movement of the dinosaurs and have integrated them more realistically with the actors.  Despite having a lower entertainment value from a screenplay perspective, this film is pure genius as regards visual effects and uses vanguard techniques that will surely become commonplace in sci-fi films of the future.<br />There is not much to be said about the acting.  There isn't much meaningful dialogue.  All the actors are effective at looking terrified and then looking relieved only to be terrified again five minutes later.<br />The only way I can rate this film is to average two components.  The story is a 2/10 and the technical component is a 10/10.  So I'd have to give it a 6/10.  It is worth seeing just for the visuals, but don't waste your time if a strong screenplay is your primary consideration in selecting a film.
0060934700|5.0|Smoke and Mirrors collects 30+ Neil Gaiman stories and poems from the past decade. Gaiman's work is usually categorized as fantasy, and most of these pieces have appeared previously in genre publications, yet the best of them, in their combination of wit, ferocity, and wisdom, seem timeless, transcending not only genre but period.<br />A few pieces are merely funny, the Lovecraft riffs and more self-consciously post-modern bits, yet these are good enough to beg comparison with Kim Newman, the master of the post-modern genre cuisinart tale.<br />Most cut deeper: has there been a better evocation of Los Angeles and its relation to creativy than 'The Goldfish Pool and Other Tales'? A more poignant literary appreciation than 'One Life, Furnished in Early Moorcock'? 'Troll Bridge' casts an old fairy tale into the modern world with haunting results, while 'Snow, Glass, Apples' vividly and viciously upends Snow White in period, putting most such pastiches to shame. The shimmering 'Murder Mysteries' is undoubtedly the finest celestial noir whodunit of the past decade.<br />Yet I think my favorite tale here is 'The Wedding Present,' hidden within the book's introduction. Funny, disturbing, and deeply moving, it is itself a perfect introduction to Gaiman's gorgeous short fiction.
0385505833|1.0|Trite, predictable characters.  Predictable plot.  Sugar-sweet ending.  Just a waste of time and money.<br /><br />I should add that I really like Grisham as a writer, despite the sometimes formulaic approach.  He's readable and entertaining.  This one stinks, though.  He should be embarrassed to publish this under his own name.
157492589X|5.0|Lonesome Dove is a cinematic masterpiece based on Larry Mcmurtry's timeless classic of Western Literature by the same title. More than just a movie, Lonesome Dove presents insights into many aspects of life. It contains an underlying meaning going far beyond plot. It is one of the best examples of interpretive cinema to be found. Lonesome Dove presents to the viewer, moral lessons while it entertains. More than this though, Lonesome Dove just makes you feel good. It is an escape from everyday life through simple dialogue and lovable believable charachters that carry the reader away from his world and place him in Lonesome Dove, Texas, a place where life is slower and the hustle and bustle of modern life cannot be found. It's all-star cast led by Danny Glover, Tommy Lee Jones, and Robert Duvall present the charachters as Mcmurtry would have portrayed them. In my opinion, it is impossible to watch the entire six hour classic without tearing up or at least being thoroughly moved, not by its sadness but by its superb portrayal of the stirring emotion that brings with it a real, and lasting sense of joy and contentment. The best one word description of this classic of cinema is &quot;beautiful&quot;.Just thinking about this wonderful movie brings a sigh of joy and a lasting feeling of contentment. If you have not seen this excellent work of cinema, then you have not yet arrived.
B00005K3OT|5.0|A work of art that motivates and inspires the mind to look beyond one's day to day routine.  Very entertaining, with a delightfully discrete manner of opening your eyes to the reality of love and aging.
B00005O5CM|4.0|\\"Legally Blonde\\" is a showcase for Reese Witherspoon that continues to highlight her talents.  The film draws comparisons with \\"Clueless\\" since the theme is essentially identical.  Elle (Witherspoon) progresses from a culturally challenged blonde bubblehead to a high achieving Harvard law student for all the wrong reasons.   All the while she has to endure mockery for her valley girl attitudes. Of course, she triumphs over east coast bigotry and over own limitations, but for all the wrong reasons.<br />The story is cute, but lacks the insight and nuance of \\"Clueless\\".  However, Witherspoon outdoes Alicia Silverstone's performance with her sheer energy and determination.  Both were excellent, but Witherspoon is the more dynamic.<br />The acting by the ensemble of supporting actors is very good and helps Witherspoon look that much better.  The cast is rich in aspiring actors with strong talent and little name recognition.  Of particular note are the performances of Selma Blair and Luke Wilson.  Blair plays the uppity girlfriend of Elle's former boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis).  Blair is wonderfully condescending and catty throughout most of the film, but shows the ability to move into a softer, more likeable portrayal by the end.  Wilson's soft spoken demeanor is perfect for his nurturing role in this film.  His support is the catalyst that makes Elle's transition work.<br />Reese Witherspoon has been gradually moving to progressively larger parts for the last ten years, and at age 25 she made the leap to the lead with this film.  She definitely makes the most of the opportunity.  She simply dominates the entire film with a high energy performance that has as much steel as perfume.  She makes Elle as lovable as she is ridiculous, while instilling her with qualities that you can't help but admire as the film progresses.  If this is representative of the wattage she will bring to films, then her future is likely to be very bright.<br />This is not a great film, but itis very charming and watchable.  I rated it a 7/10.  We may look back on this film as the one that launched a prominent career.
B0000035E7|5.0|This CD is so awesome. The entire CD is so raw, this is unadulterated Nirvana. You can hear microphones squeak and guitars being tuned; it's like it was never edited. If you're just a &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; fan, this might be a little much for you, but if you love Nirvana, you need this CD. My favorite track is Paper Cuts, although it's hard to pick since every track rocks.
B000002J3W|4.0|First things first:  this is a HEAVY album. <br />It's really too bad that this album was so overlooked upon its release.  Public interest in &quot;Subhuman Race&quot; faded quickly after its release due to two, and only two, factors:<BR><br />1. The &quot;Eighteen and Life&quot; Skid Row crowd was hoping that the Skidders would return to their hair-metal phase after the hot-coal guitars of &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot;.  They didn't, and the kiddies went elsewhere for their anthems.<BR><br />2. The fan base that actually liked the heaviness of &quot;Slave&quot; got caught up in the grunge movement and thought Skid was trying to go grunge, too.  They felt betrayed, and called Skid Row &quot;sellouts&quot;.<BR><br />Like me, a small amount of true fans of heavy music appreciated this album as a bracing effort that continued Skid Row's move to dark side of rock.  The guitars are as heavy as any in rock, and Snake's playing had never been better, but the crowd wanted another sexy MTV video.  Ironically, another metal band by the name of Metallica released their &quot;Load&quot; album shortly thereafter and was equally chastised for going...soft.  Go figure.<BR><br />I still shake the house with this hammering album from time to time.  &quot;Subhuman Race&quot; had the power to bridge the gap between grunge and the boy-band fluff that still infiltrates music in the early 00's.  Unfortunately, nobody listened.
B00005RYKU|5.0|I love this movie. So much that I want to buy it now, it's really good. At least rent it!!
1577311760|5.0|Let me start by saying that I struggled with the vast majority of the information in this book, or at least the way it was presented. It was well written, don't get me wrong, but I'm not very interested in fuzzy, mystical concepts.<br />So why did I give it 5 stars? Aside from being well organized and written (and read, since I got the audio version), this book saved my marriage. It was actually this book as well as Pema Chodron's excellent 'When Things Fall Apart'... but I digress. I've been mean and driven and judgemental for a long time now, and about 2 weeks ago I just decided it needed to stop. This book helped me stop. The affect was almost immediate certainly dramatic, as my wife started asking me what happened. Why was I suddenly so happy? I told her I just made a decision. She told me that she wants to have sex with me all the time now. Thanks Eckhart!<br />I can't argue with results, but let me comment on some things that people like me may struggle with.<br />1) The first chapter is titled 'You Are Not Your Mind.' His point is that you shouldn't identify with your thoughts. The conflict with some people is that, if you take it too literally, you may develop a distrust for your mind and your thinking ability. This may not be good if you are a 'knowledge worker' who depends on reason and problem solving to earn your living.<br />2) Like much of eastern philosphy, he places blame for human suffering on 'The EGO'. I find it interesting that eastern traditions use this Latin word for 'self' so frequently to refer to the opposite of your true self... your false self. Perhaps a better term for the false self would be 'super ego', which is the image we project to the outside world... if I remember my Freud at all.<br />3) Some sections get a little murky and even, to my tastes, silly. For instance, he says that some of his greatest teachers have been cats and ducks. I can appreciate a good zen-like metaphor, but he goes on to say something like 'To watch a duck swimming in a pond you can observe the pure presence that only a mindless creature can have.' I don't have the text in front of me, but that was the jist. So I should strive to be mindless like a DUCK? That metaphor goes a little far for me. <br />4) The introduction reads like a 'spiritual get rich quick' scheme. He was totally depressed and suicidal when all of the sudden he realizes that he is not his mind, has a swirling hallucination, and wakes up the next morning completely enlightened. (But if he can do it, you can too! But wait there's more. If you order now...) That's not how enlightenment happens for the vast majority of us, including the Buddha. <br />But overall it's a great book. The other reviews praise it enough so that I can save the space here. If you can just get a partial grasp of the most important point, which is being completely present and accepting unconditionally the reality of the present moment, it's well worth the price.<br />And maybe you'll become sexually irresistable like me ;)
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is another grand triumph for director Ron Howard on the level of his big hit of the eighties, &quot;Cocoon,&quot; and another Oscar caliber performance by Russell Crowe, who dug within himself for the last ounce of intensity and feeling.  &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; provides the trials and tribulations of a man who is exceedingly gifted on the one hand, while riddled with problems on the other.  Crowe does a superb job of balancing the highs and the lows of Nobel economics laureate John Forbes Nash, whose gifts in mathematics coincide with his schizophrenia.<br />Jennifer Connelly blends into the story mix with her highly supportive role of Crowe's wife.  When his long, hard struggle with adversity culminates in the Nobel Prize the emotional highlight of the film arises when Crowe looks into the audience and exclaims, while staring directly at Connelly, that he never could have realized his achievement without love.  He was paying his wife the highest tribute for her unflagging cooperation in the wake of adversity.<br />In dealing with a subject such as schizophrenia, Howard was confronted with the decision of just how to approach it.  He decided on a communicative vehicle that was highly cinematic and enriching in terms of understanding the man and his difficulties.  Howard presents dramatic sequences which Crowe as Nash was convinced actually occurred, even though they were imagined and were an integral part of his schizophrenia.  Ed Harris assumes the role of a master handler leading his subject to clandestine activities, the goal preventing the Soviets from unleashing their powerful nuclear arsenal against America.  Crowe also encounters a happy go lucky roommate who ultimately teaches literature at Harvard, a boozy, &quot;let's enjoy life&quot; intellectual with a reverence for D.H. Lawrence.  His irreverence and &quot;What's the difference?&quot; insouciance is a welcome contrast for Crowe to his own often tragic formality.  Crowe then meets the former roommate's young niece, for whom he quickly develops an affinity.  We then find out from Crowe's psychiatrist, played with just the proper note of empathic sensitivity by Christopher Plummer, that Crowe had no roommate while at Princeton!<br />Another interesting aspect of the film is the recognition by Crowe as Nash that he is truly different from other people.  &quot;We're a couple of odd ducks,&quot; he tells Connelly his student, girlfriend, and ultimately loyal wife.  We see how he copes with social awkwardness in his quest to become the best mathematician he can be.
B000003TSP|5.0|I know that it might sound sacrilegious but it's true. Portishead's 1997 sophomore is in my opinion a much greater experience than the debut Dummy. Whereas Dummy was a delicate, subtle &amp; stable effort with all of the tracks pretty much sounding in the same vein (Not that it's a bad thing) Portishead is more industrial &amp; heavy, id est much more fascinating to listen to. The lyrics are far superior to the debut lyrics (On several occasions @ least, like in the social grievance that is &quot;Half Day Closing&quot;) &amp; Beth Gibbons' vocals sound much more sinister &amp; spiteful- In point of fact she sounds like an entirely different singer which is a great achievement a very selected few artists could achieve. Some songs are too strident for their own good (Like the grating opener &quot;Cowboys&quot;) but that's one of the things that make the album far more interesting to listen to than Dummy, along with the more vast usage of &quot;live&quot; instruments such as guitars, pianos &amp; organs. Favourite songs so far- &quot;All Mine&quot; (Very much reminiscent of &quot;Glory Box&quot;), &quot;Undenied&quot; (Beautiful, simple piano), &quot;Over&quot; (Ah, the acoustic guitar!) &amp; of course, the song that made me buy both Portishead's studioalbums, &quot;Only You&quot; (Topnotch video also). You'll be surprised to hear the male vocals in the end of &quot;Western Eyes&quot;!
B00005ONMJ|5.0|The DVD of Furtwangler's 1954 Salzburg Festival production of Mozart's Don Giovanni is a document of an extraordinary performance, the only filmed version of an opera conducted by the legendary maestro, Wilhelm Furtwangler. The production is wonderfully conducted, beautifully sung by an all-star cast of the era, photographed in excellent color and recorded in very good monophonic sound.  Especially outstanding among the cast is Cesare Siepi as the Don, perhaps the most lauded Don of the 20th century.  His renditions of the Champagne Aria and the Serenade are masterful.  And Lisa Della Casa's Donna Elvira is extremely moving and well-sung.  The rest of the cast also is very good. The production by Herbert Graf is a bit clunky and dated in places although the sets and costumes are very lavish. The banquet scene at the end of Act II is very dramatically staged. For Furtwangler fans, the shots of F conducting the overture are especially rewarding. Overall, a treat not to be missed by opera lovers and those devoted to Furtwangler's extraordinary conducting.
B00005J6T1|5.0|This album sounds fantastic almost twenty years after it was first released.  I played the remastered version side by side with the original CD and the difference in sound quality is remarkable.  It now sounds cleaner and fuller.<br />Aside from sound quality this CD is great for the music itself, Of the ten tracks there are only two sub-par songs, &quot;I Know It&quot; and &quot;Think Of Me&quot; but even these aren't terrible, just not brilliant like the rest of the album.<br />There's not many pop albums from 1983 that sound this good today.
0380817683|5.0|I am not a big reader but I recieved this book as a gift for Christmas.  I started reading it one day and I never put it down.  This book is unbelievable...it is great and I would definately recommend this book to anyone and everyone.  It really made me think about myself at times, yet it was also quite humorous.  Read it, you'll love it...guaranteed.
0792844890|5.0|This movie is hilarious. Rick Moranis, Mel Brooks and George Wyner (as Colonel Sandurz) just steal the show as the hilarious Spaceballs. Bill Pullman (Lone Starr) and Daphne Zagna (Princess Vespa) are not very good and John Candy (Barf) is decent. I don't know why people say that Blazing Saddles is a really good movie and say this movie is really dumb. This just spoofs sci-fi movies instead of westerns.
0440180295|4.0|The first time I read this book (as a high school student), I found it tremendously liberating, primarily because of Vonnegut's style of writing, which was unlike that of other books we had to read at the time.  This second time, however, I was surprised to find that Vonnegut's writing seemed almost clumsy.  And I wondered about my voracious desire in high school to read all of his books.  There may be an optimum adolescent time frame when Vonnegut speaks most influentially to his readers.<br />Still, it carries the weight I felt in the first reading, and his voice is perfect for pointing out the absurdities of tragedy.  Though Vonnegut's topic is the firebombing of Dresden, his book concerns all war and massacre.  It is about the fringes of rationality, and the attempt to find something beautiful and optimistic in a world where the darkest things can occur.  But in the end, it seems that this hopeful humanism shares the stage with another philosophy.  The Tralfamadorians set a pessimistic tone:  Time is a mere dimension, observable in an instant, the things that happen must happen, and no event is good, or bad, or sad-they are just inevitable.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Yes, true love's kiss still breaks the spell.  But just when I was disgusted and about to get up from the movie theatre seat, it surprised me.  I LOVED this movie and so does my husband, mother, and 4 and 2 year olds.  I never get tired of having it on when they want to watch it.  This movie will make you feel better about who you are than anything I have ever seen.  A must-see.  <BR>There are about three or four very mild curse words that offended a few of our more strict friends, but it is less than what you hear on one TV show.  The message the movie gives, time and again, far outweighs anything else.  Every child cant be a princess or marry a prince or have a fairy godmother, but they can be loved for who they are.
B00005T343|3.0|Hannibal is not as good as it's preddesessor The Silence Of The Lambs, but is still a very worthy sequal and very deacent deacent film. When I saw it the first time I wasn't very impressed. I didn't think it had a very strong plot. After veiwing it a second time though, had different feelings I payed a little bit more attention and by the end was pleased. You have to realize the plot is in the title &quot;HANNIBAL&quot; and that is exactly what it is about just Hannibal Lecter. This is a film for those who are interested in Hannibal Lecter and wanted to see more of him after &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs.&quot;They threw in the plot to keep it interesting this might not have been the novelists goal but it was the sense of the movie. Their are memorable lines like in The silence Of the Lambs. So for those of you who are interested in hannibal ,which I am, should enjoy this film. I warn you though  If you got sick during the first film or thought it was to gory do not see this film. It has a few degrees more gore than silence of the lambs and can be bad for those of you who have weak stomachs. Besides that it is a good movie andI advise you to see it.
B00005LANG|5.0|Aside from Legend, a great compilation and a recommended introduction to the music of Bob Marley, this is one of Bob Marley's finest accomplishments.  Every song is strong and topics range from party songs to social commentary.  With Exodus, Jamming, Waiting in Vain, Three Little Birds (every thing is gonna be all right) and One Love, this is a greatest hits album in its own right.  And, if you are looking for the sexiest reggae song of all time - Turn Your Lights Down Low simply smokes.  I also strongly recommend Kaya, a beatiful set of love songs.  <BR>~~~_/)~~~ Sail On ~~~
B00005Q45W|4.0|This is a very quiet album as compared to Leonard Cohen's recent(?) work. I was a bit disappointed at first, but after several more listenings I am really enjoying most of the 10 songs, both lyrics and music. &quot;Alexandra Leaving&quot; has become a favorite; what a poetic way to say, &quot;I was dumped&quot;. Sharon Robinson's voice nicely complements LC's monotone, especially on &quot;Back on Boogie Street&quot;, and her arrangements are mostly excellent. However, I would prefer that they had taken the final step and replaced the synthesizer tracks with a live band.
B000002HRE|5.0|This is the best Metallica album ever.It's hard,fast,slow and soft.An amazing range of different kinds of songs.It's also the album that got me into Metallica.Low Mans Lyric is the best song on here.One of the slowest and most beautiful songs on here.It's about a depressed man seeking the one thing that we all want.Forgivness.Then there was Fuel.Hard,fast and great.The second best under Low Man.Last but in no way at all least.Fixxxer.Creative and amazing intro.Wonderful lyrics and music.There is a lot more on this album to hear.None are bad.Some are better than others.This album makes me proud to be able to call myself a Metallica fan.<br /> If I hear one more person talk about how Metallica sold out.I'm gonna puke.Those of you that call them sellouts are NOT Metallica fans.So SHUT UP.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I think the problem with this film is that it tried to appeal to a mass audience -- and it went way over its head. If you are an SF reader, or just like to think about what is not in the realm of commonly accepted wisdom, you will find it one of the most intelligent and touching movies ever.<br />The acting is nothing short of superb. Haley Joel Osment walks perfectly the tightrope between playing a boy and playing a robot that has a very sophisticated program to make him pretend to be a boy. He remains a robot throughout, but only if you are careful -- otherwise his program can easily seduce you in forgetting who he is. Jude Law has what must have been one of the most fun parts ever, and his robot gigolo with a heart of gold is every bit as memorable as any Oz character. Other supporting roles are very ably handled.<br />The imagery is also breathtaking, with sunken New York and the town of the robot witch-hunt being poignantly rendered. The emphasis is on strangeness but the effect is beauty as well.<br />But the best part is the central search for meaning by a character to whom meaning is just a definition. In watching the un-human way that the little robot pursues his dream, you get to wonder how much of our own thinking is just even better programming by mother nature. Where does free will come in?<br />I only gave the movie four stars because the last 10 minutes or so (set centuries after the rest of the movie) comprise a deus-ex-machina 'solution' that is quite pointless and should have been cut. The movie really should have ended with the boy endlessly -- and contentedly -- waiting for the answers that will never come. Spielberg perhaps felt that this would have been too frustrating, but his attempt at a 'solution' diminishes what could have been an all-time masterpiece.

B00005QZ7U|4.0|Wow! This ain't no remake of &quot;Grease&quot; that's for sure! If you ask me personally, I enjoyed this film because of the wonderfully costuming and music.  The set design is unbelievable.  Yeah sure, some of the siging and dances is corny, but so what? It's made to be that way.  Man, can Nicole Kidman sing or what? Her voice is like an angel.  This musical is filling with a bit of drama and comedy mixed in.  I believe Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor really brightened the screen with their enchanting voices.  The most funniest dance numbers in this musical, I think, would be &quot;Like a Virgin.&quot; It's hilarious! The reason I was interested in this film, was because I heard Nicole Kidman was in it, and I knew she was a great actress.  And when I saw it for the first time, I feel in love it.  For it's charm and funny comic moments.  The wonderful costumes and make-up effects are superb.  Baz Luhrmann directed such a spectacular musical for anyone who enjoys musicals.  And this dvd is packed with extras! I'd highly recommend Moulin Rouge!
6300182282|5.0|Poignant and powerful, this incredible bittersweet love story will bring tears to the eyes of anyone who has an understanding of what life is really about. It is virtually flawless and shows what can be done with a good story premise, good acting, and a simple set. No special effects or computerized videographics are needed.The subject of adultry is treated in a way that is bound to raise conflict in those who are morally sensitive.  At the end one can only sympathise with the couple who, in their own way, were soulmates for 26 years, yet also in their own way remained loyal and devoted to their spouses and families. Impossible? See this film before drawing any conclusions. I am not an Alda fan, but for this one I make a strong exception. He is very convincing. And Ellen Burstyn is the girl next door that any man who breathes would fall in love with. Their chemistry in the film is electric.This story is about morality that transcends the tawdry urges of the flesh. In this respect it is both a love story and a morality play.  I am sure that variations of the plot have actually occurred in real life but have been taken to the grave to avoid hurting loved ones. This is about average people caught up in a situation they could neither resist, understand, or control.Don't pass this one up.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I'm not a fan of sci-fi, but when a masterpiece comes along, in any genre, I'll check it out.  I'm glad I decided to gamble and see A.I. when it was in the theatres.  This film, which shares the talents of both Stanley Kubrick and Steven Speilberg, is bold and intense.  The effects are breathtaking, but its such a small aspect to this powerful movie.  It tugs at the heartstrings, energizes with unique action sequences, and offers a different philosophy about what the future might hold.  On so many different levels, A.I. is a masterpiece that was made years before its time - and in my opinion, will remain as one of the most under-appreciated films in motion picture history.
B000001ESN|4.0|This album was when I first abandoned these guys. I heard THE<br />SPIRIT OF RADIO on the radio and I thought it was a silly song,<br />especially when GEDDY LEE sings that line about the SALESMEN!<br />I really think(and I know other RUSH fans will hate me for this)<br />that SPIRIT is one of their most overrrated songs. A few years<br />later when I got back into RUSH, I finally bought the album and<br />was very, VERY impressed with the other songs on the album, with<br />the exception of NATURAL SCIENCE. A FAREWELL TO KINGS and HEMI-<br />SPHERES are my two favorite RUSH albums, but PERMANENT WAVES<br />and MOVING PICTURES were their two best SOUNDING albums, in terms<br />of the production. When RUSH first started using synthesizers, it<br />opened up their sound and made the music sound more colorful.<br />RUSH were still a very powerful progressive hard rock band on<br />PERMANENT and this album contains some great, classic songs.<br />My two favorite are on side two or for you cd buyers, on the<br />second half of the album. ENTRE NOUS is one of RUSH's more upbeat<br />and happier songs, with a wonderful vocal from GEDDY. DIFFERENT<br />STRINGS is a nice mellow love song, with some very NICE lyrics<br />from MR. LEE. TIS MELLOW, YA!FREEWILL and JACOB's LADDER are, of<br />course, both terrific hard rockers, with some nice crunchy guitar<br />riffs from ALEX LIFESON, that don't get soggy when you dunk them<br />in your KOOLAID.<br />A NICE ALBUM!!!
B00005QHPQ|4.0|I love Enrique's emotional singing style.  I bought this CD because I loved the song &quot;Hero&quot; but I was pleasantly surprised by other quality songs; my favorites are the first two songs, &quot;Escape&quot; and &quot;Don't Turn Off the Lights&quot; as well as their Spanish versions.  Enrique is clearly a very talented singer - and he made it not because his dad's reputation.
B00005N83O|5.0|Igot both the original CD, and the new cd with the extra track featuring Ja Rule. This cd is off th hook.
0792156684|5.0|The thing that makes this movie so great, besides the dashingly handsome leading man and the thrilling romance story, is that it is real.  maybe not the exact romance story, but one probably close to it.  The thing that gets me to watch it again and again, is the fact that this is a real ship that sank and killed so many lives. It is a movie that makes you think.  you think well, if only they had had more lifeboats, or if only those people didn't wait so long to come back and help.  if only the rich stuck up first class people had used their heads, instead of being convinced nothing bad could ever happen to them just because they had lots of money. it is a thrilling story and they kept it even more interesting in the way that they tied the whole old lady remembering it thing into it. because i'm sure somewhere there was a person who did remember the things that happened to them and never told anyone the whole story.  the movie is the absolute best.  it is funny, sad, romantic, scary, and moving.  it shows how one minute you could be the happiest in the world, fearing nothing and then BAM! you're fearing for everything.  and us as the veiwer, are right there along with the characters - laughing, crying, and ultimatley more aware of things when the movie is over.
B00005RHGK|1.0|Okay, This movie did have a few (and I stress few) good scares but in the whole it was a huge waste of time.  Two really stupid kids driving back and forth down an empty back road.  That is the whole story!  Come on, this was basically- The girl is running away, oh no she fell, she takes her sweet time getting up so it is no wonder she gets caught!  I was so angry with this movie on grounds of stupidity: 1)at the director's and producer's think we are this dumb and 2)at myself for sitting through it.
B00005NNT1|4.0|This, the first full length animated feature, is undeniably a classic in its own right.  It's still one of the few Disney films that truly manages to capture the horror of its original source.  Grimm fairytales are notorious for their morose tone, and several of the more menacing scenes from the book are brought to life here.<br />In the movie Snow White is draped in rough garments to hide her beauty from the jealous Queen, but when her magical mirror informs her that she is no longer the 'fairest one of all', she sends a huntsman to kill Snow White.  When our heroine manages to escape, her trip through the horrifying woods, with branches and hollows looming out at her from the shadows is stunningly realised.  When she is rescued by the seven dwarves, that movie becomes a little more comic.  Thankfully the dwarves are never overbearingly cute, but remain ultimately winning, especially the mute Dopey and stuck-in-his-ways Grumpy.<br />The most important thing about this movie is though that it never veers too far in one direction.  It mixes light humour with inobtrusive songs and colourful scares.  In particular the Queen's transformation into a hag is just so well done that it would rival even some of Disney's later and more polished films.  There's even a little play with the subtext of the sexual feelings that Snow White evokes in her hosts.  This is a Disney movie to treasure.

6302994063|5.0|This film is as much about ballroom dancing as Gladiator is about gladiating. Dancing is the device that drives the film, but the story is about nonconformity, something Baz Luhrmann should know a lot about, and boy is it driven well. I thoroughly enjoyed this film mainly because its so much fun and ingeniously crafted with a very witty and richly detailed script. <br />Its not visually veracious like Moulin Rouge or even Romeo + Juliet, but its just as stimulating. The plot revolves around Scott, who is a very talented dancer who is currently training to go to the PanPacific Nationals (or something like that, I forget) which is the biggest dancing tournament in the area. To be in that torunament he has to dance like everyone else, but he wants to dance his way because he finds dancing in a manner of strictly ballroom dull, but to dance &quot;his way&quot; would be going against the wishes of his hyper controlling mother and instructor. He can find no partner to dance his way and eventually finds a completely untrained partner, Fran, who is willing to throw away standards and go wild. It escalates from there.<BR>Luhrmann doesn't expect us to know anything about ballroom dancing restrictions, regulations, standards. He tells us what we need to know to make an incredibly liberating film.<br />The last time a story was told like this, that I can remember, was the Gary Cooper film &quot;Fountainhead&quot; which is a very dark and expressionistic film. This film tells the same story of fighting a system (inobscure, other than and small than legal, medical, social etc.). Here it's ballroom dancing, there it's the architecture circles. This film is fun, it's silly, and it's fresh. It's NOT a teenybopper film, it's high quality.<br />Some of the actors play ridiculous characters and do it with ease and grace and great comic agility. Like in Moulin Rouge, the cinematography utilizes odd angles to help us in forming our opinions of people. The choreography is fantastic, and it tells stories. The dance steps of everyone else seem silly and forced, yet Scot and Fran's makes sense and are exhilarating, they seem correct. Funny, considering most of us shouldn't really have an opinion on the correct function of ballroom steps. Yet that is where Luhrmann and Pearce (his co-writer) and the cast succeed. They, the creators and actors, make us care about characters and what they want to achieve. And this is done very unconvetionally. Most of all this film makes you feel like you can break free from whatever you are doing and just go...dance.
B00005RFQ5|2.0|...and prince is definitely a nut!  he scurred the hellouttame by startin this off on that smooth-jazz-vibe...(gave me chills, not the 'impressed' kind, the 'nightmare' kind!)...so after two songs i did the mature thing: i hit stop on my cd player, took a deep breath, prayed, loosened up and then i started this over with an open mind! (that's why i increased my original rating from one star to two!)  <BR>i said, \\"okay, prince is on another level now...i gotta approach it a lil' differently now.\\"<BR>then i lissened to the whole thing from front to back...then i did it again...........that 'open minded'... is over-rated!!!<BR>i didnt really mind the lyrics, i thought that was the best part, the synth-voice got to grating my nerves tho!  but the thing that got to me the most was that the music itself was so unoriginal!!! this would have made an excellent boney james cd, boney is cool, but come on now:  prince?  doin smooth jazz!?!?<BR> yes, he is a nut!!  but maybe this is what some of yall been waitin on cause some of yall are truly ecclectic fans, more so than me...(still, it's better than olu, tho!)...
B000002KDO|4.0|Ozzy and company score some major points here, especially on the pro-marijuana anthem &quot;Sweet Leaf,&quot; and also on &quot;Children of the Grave,&quot; which sounds like the title of a zombie flick, but seems to be about Sabbath's young, socially disrespected fans. These iconic 70s rockers, without whom grunge, as well as many of today's heaviest rockers, would have been unthinkable, are in great form on this, one of their definitive records.
B000002U82|5.0|What could I say about this classic of classics that hasn't already been said? Nothing really, becuause I can't find an acceptable description of it. It blew me away the first time I listened to it and it still wows me upon 50 plus listens. The tracks included are some of Floyd's finest, namely Time, Great Gig in the Sky, Money, and Brain Damage. The sound and productions of Dark Side has yet to be duplicated. Did I mention it spent over 14 years on the billboard charts in England? It is one of those rare albums that becomes more beloved as it ages, and for good reason. It's Pink Floyd's greatest hour, if not the greatest hour of rock music. No album collection is complete without Dark Side of the Moon. (Wizard of Oz movie optional)
B000002JSR|3.0|This is it. The final bang of Led Zeppelin. Sadly, time has not aged well on this album. All of it is leftovers that don't really have the power of the old stuff. And that's ok. Wearing And Tearing was the only thing that blew me away. Not much, though. Very simple, and yes, there's a great outtake of &quot;I Can't Quit You Baby.&quot; That alone is worth the price. Ok stuff.

0316776963|5.0|&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is a compliation of short stories, and memories written by David Sedaris. Beginning at the age of 5, the book follow's his life up until the present. Written with sarcastically dry humor and wit, every chapter is more riduclous and hilarious than the last. I had been imatiantly awaiting a follow-up on &quot;Naked,&quot; which consisits of the same ideas and memories as this book. I didn't think anything could top &quot;Naked,&quot; but this one is way up there.<BR>  The first chapter is about Sedaris' speach impetiments when he was a child, and his first cruel, cruel, speech therapist, who, in his own words &quot; Would be much happier giving random root canals to the school girls in Africa than actually doing her job.&quot; Such topics are the basis of every chapter; they range from his crazy parents and siblings to the midget guitar teacher his father hired for him when he was 12.<BR> Though there are several reasons why I enjoyed this book, the main one would have to be Sedaris' &quot;real life&quot; writing style. His childhood growing up sounded like hell; his mother was an alchoholic, he didn't have any friends and what not, but somhow, his writing style and techniques make it all hilarious. I think if anyone else wrote about this life, it would have sounded depressing and scary.<BR> So, if you're feeling sorry for yourself, dealing with a mid-life crisis, or just bored, you should definatly read this book.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I remember watching this Hitchcock masterpiece the first time.  I was mesmerized.  It was and still remains my favorite movie of all time.  This version takes the classic I first watched on a 25&quot; TV and says &quot;you ain't see nothin yet.&quot;  Yes, the details of the story are the same, but the visual and audio details almost make this a different movie.  Watching it now on a proper widescreen TV, I can imagine what it would have been like to see it in a 1954 theater.  The restoration is not just window dressing.  If you taped this or even bought a pre-restoration VHS, you owe it to yourself to see it in this lovingly restored version.
1586210661|4.0|There's something to be said for mindless novels now and then.  'Me Talk Pretty One Day' will not be a contendor for the next Pulitzer Prize due to it's ground breaking literary contention, but it will make you laugh for a little while.  The novel and it's author display an amazingly eccentric ability for not ALWAYS taking life so seriously.<br />      Through this collection of short essays, David Sedaris (often heard on NPR) takes us through his malfunctioned childhood in North Carolina, his drug induced and somewhat irresponsible twenties to his days of living in New York and Paris in his early and late thirties.  Tons of quaint anecdotes throughout his life are comprised to make this quirky (and sometimes humurously perverse) story, it is an excellent and refreshing break from the more serious novles, and most certainly deserves it's place on the NY Times Best seller list.<br />  Although not my normal stlye of reading, I would certainly reccomend this novel to anyone.  It's short, quick, easy to read, plus you get the bonus of a non-fiction reading choice that reads like a soap opera.  Some may find it a little idiotic, but the truth is that Sedaris thinks the same zany many of us do, we just don't admit it as openly.  It's quite a refreshing change of pace during such serious times and will cause the reader to remember how much fun it is to laugh at your self once in a while.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I  absolutely love this album! This is the first time I ever bought a Shakira CD. I was drawn to it by the single &quot;Whenever, Wherever.&quot; When I first heard Shakira on like Rosie or something, (when Donde Estan Los Ladrones? came out) I couldn't stand her. Eventually, her voice grew on me, and her vocal skills are nothing short of amazing. She is able to sing dance songs, ballads, and latin songs. I especially love the large Columbian and other latin-type rhythms. My favourite songs would have to be &quot;Whenever, Wherever/Suerte,&quot; &quot;Eyes Like Yours,&quot; &quot;The One&quot;, &quot;Fool,&quot; and &quot;Ready for The Good Times.&quot; If you like latin music, this is a good CD for you! :-)
0393320928|5.0|A lot of books written by scientific people claim to be &quot;down-to-earth&quot; and for the &quot;layman&quot; but end up creeping into the obscure. Not so here. Feynman starts with his feet planted firmly on the ground and never strays. <br />The first few stories range from the serious to the light-hearted. From the pain of losing his wife to being invited to speak at a funeral for a man whom he can't remember. These accounts give you a good look at the ability of Feynman to convey a story and make it interesting. The majority of the book however is given to the time he spent on the committee that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Using no nonsense, straight-forward writing he takes you through the process of how he and the others, despite a lot of bureaucratic red tape, managed to find out what went wrong on that fateful day. What could very well be a dry and uninspiring subject becomes quite informative and engaging through his telling.<br />This is my first book by Feynman, but having absorbed the whole thing in one sitting it surely won't be my last.
0452270073|4.0|Regeneration, The Eye in the Door and Ghost Road make up Pat Barker's remarkable trilogy about England during the \\"Great War.\\"  The three books center around the character of Dr. William Rivers, a well known psychiatrist who served in Scotland and England during the war treating officers suffering from war-related neuroses - and restoring their sanity enough for them to return to the insanity of the front.  Two of Rivers' patients play a central role in the trilogy - poet and decorated war hero Siegfried Sassoon, who was sent to Dr. Rivers after taking a public stand against the war, and Billy Prior, a working class boy who managed to work his way into the ranks of officer and whose psychological and personal conflicts drive a lot of the plot in The Eye in the Door.<br />The trilogy is so multi-faceted it can be difficult to say what it's really about.  It's first and foremost a story of England during the war - how the war challenged traditional views of \\"maleness\\" (and enhanced the role of women in society), the scapegoating of homosexuals, leftists, and others as a political tool, etc.  Barker draws on historical material and characters to depict the times - I don't know the history so I can't comment on the accuracy.  But it's more than a historical novel.  It deals with the universal role of war in human culture and contrasts the WW1 orgy of death and destruction with the war culture of the headhunters of Melanesia (where Rivers spent some time doing anthropological research).  It's also a psychological study of Rivers, Sassoon and Prior (the former two historical, the latter fictional) who all seem to encapsulate multiple personalities - in Prior's case these are true multiple personalities, but in the cases of Rivers and Sassoon they are more subtle differences between their empathetic, sensitive, selves and the automatons they become when faced with professional responsibilities or when they otherwise operate from deeper instincts.  There are many other threads in the story that I can't possibly mention here.<br />Parts of the book(s) are brilliant - great language and images, stories and sub plots at times harrowing and at times funny, great character development, witty dialogue.  This is not a book that will be easily forgotten.  It's also for the most part a great read.<br />My major criticism is that it should not have been published as three separate books.  I read Ghost Road - the Booker winner - first and was disappointed, but loved it the second time around after I read Regeneration and (my favorite) The Eye in the Door.  Related to this is the fact that while the books don't stand on their own, the trilogy doesn't really hold together as one novel either.  Regeneration takes place mostly in the Craiglockhart War Hospital in Scotland and focuses on Rivers and his patients (especially Sassoon).  Prior is there but not as central a figure as he becomes later.  The Eye in the Door takes place mostly in London and centers around Prior, his sexual escapades, his personality disorders, and his attempt to free an old friend and neighbor from prison where she has been charged with plotting to kill the Prime Minister.  The Ghost Road returns the focus to Rivers, his patients (but now in a hospital in England), and flashbacks to his research in Melanesia but also weaves into it the experience of Prior now back at the front in France through a journal Prior keeps.  All a little confusing for those like me that prefer more of a clear roadmap.<br />One confusing thing is the focus on homosexuality (or bisexuality in Prior's case).  Prior's appetite for sex was impressive and seemed to be very non-distinguishing (except for the fact that he \\"doesn't pay\\").  What I couldn't tell for sure was whether Rivers and Sassoon were homosexuals; I think they were but either they had repressed this aspect of their personalities (given the times probably understandable) or what I wasn't clear.  I got the impression at points that every man in the story was homosexual or at least potentially so, and I'm not sure if Barker is saying something about the times, the WW1 environment, or just happened to pick out these characters for study.  There are also references to nerve regeneration experiments that seemed important - I'm assuming the name of the book is related to this - but I wasn't sure how they tied into everything else.  OK, nerve regeneration, psychological regeneration, etc...but so what?<br />In any case, these books give the reader a lot to think about and while the Ghost Road by itself does not in my opinion deserve a Booker I would say that the trilogy as a whole probably does.
0761536434|5.0|&quot;Ultimate&quot; is an apt word for the title of this book. Kent covers everything from the beginnings of pinball to the modern day consumer wars between XBox, Playstaion 2, and Nintendo's Game Cube. <br />Whether your an avid gamer, someone interested in the business, or just want to take a stroll down the video game memory lane this book will more than please. Having dropped my fair share of quarters in the arcades and owning numerous video game systems this book had my curiosity peaked. Sure it's mammoth, but once you start it, stopping will be hard. Using non-technical writing with a lot of paraphrases from different industry leaders thrown in, the reading just glides along. The chronology of the piece at times gets ahead of itself but quickly falls back into place without losing its pace. Also, keeping up with the industry personnel can get a bit confusing as CEO's, programmers, and salespeople move from company to company. Kent however does a fine job in explaining who everyone is and what they've done.<br />Besides a better understanding of the business, the biggest thing I got out of this book was a good old case of video game nostalgia. Hearing some of the names of the older, and sometimes forgotten systems (Commodore 64, Jaguar, Colecovision) and their arcade counterparts (Missle Command, Lunar Lander, Sea Wolf) brought back endearing memories of dumping quarters in the &quot;latest&quot; games down at the arcade and sitting up all night trying to figure out the newest game on the Atari 2600. Sure the games today are faster and definately better looking than the ones of yesterday but I'd be lying if, after reading this book, I didn't catch myself on ebay seeing if any of these older games were available.
B00003XACV|2.0|I was VERY upset when I realized that the song during the scene when Kevin Spacey kisses his daughter's friend was missing from the soundtrack. It took me FOREVER to find the song. I even own the DVD and it was not even listed.  I finally found it. It is called &quot;Don't let it bring you down&quot; by Annie Lennox (I think she re-did it). The Album name is &quot;Medusa&quot; and it is actually an AWESOME album that I would rate 5 stars!  I have heard that they put out a 2nd soundtrack that HAS it, but I have not even looked yet. I hope this helps you out!
B00005N53P|5.0|DO NOT buy this CD.........without NYC Cops! So buy the Import.<BR>This band lives up to the hype, and hopefully wont fade away due to it. strong power pop reminiscent of velvet underground with some tom petty riffs. great harmonies round out a strong effort.<BR>NYC cops sends a signal to certain brain centers that I thought died out a long time ago. <BR>dont be afraid.....you were right way back then. this is music worth seeking out. long live rock.
B00003CXS4|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I really didnt know what to expect. After I saw it the first time, I had to see it again because it was so damn good and hilarious. Every character in the movie was wonderful. From Turkish to Doug The Head to Mickey to Boris The Blade, each one was amusing with Bullet-Tooth Tony being my favorite. The movie revolves around an 84kt diamond and underground, unlicensed boxing. Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham all do wonderful jobs in portraying these charaters. Fans of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Pulp Fiction will absolutely love this film.
B00005R2M3|3.0|My first Shakira album was &quot;Pies Descalzos.&quot; I loved the blend of folksy rock, the intelligent, occasionally quirky lyrics, and the wailing passion of Shakira's unusual voice. It was an original, soulful blend. When her next Spanish-language album &quot;Donde Est&aacute;n Los Ladrones&quot; came out, I rushed to buy it. It was more of the same, except with more of a produced sound, more electric guitars and effects. One of my favourite songs was &quot;Ojos Asi,&quot; which was translated as &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; on &quot;Laundry Service.&quot;<br />But after being a Shakira fan for six years, I somehow expected something more from Laundry Service. Some of the magic was lost for me. As the first song &quot;Objection&quot; came on I was somewhat horrified--Argentine tango with Dick Dale surf guitar? Some of the lyrics were odd, but understandable considering that Shakira wrote and translated the songs herself. Her English has really come along since the earlier days, but something got lost in the translation for me.<br />That's not to say that this album does not have some great songs that sound like the &quot;old&quot; Shakira. &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; and the Spanish version &quot;Suerte&quot; are great songs, probably my favourites on the album and possibly my favourite Shakira song of all time. Andean panpipes, Middle Eastern percussion and a catchy beat blend together to make a mysterious portrait. The music video is perfect for the song: a dream sequence of diving off mountains, soaring with eagles, running with wild horses, accompanied by Shakira's singing and near-constant bellydancing.<br />Perhaps predictably, then, I immediately played the Spanish tracks first. I like &quot;Te dejo Madrid&quot; for its &quot;old&quot; Shakira &quot;Donde Est&aacute;n Los Ladrones&quot; feel, &quot;Que me quedes tu&quot; for its gentle, rocking rhythm and the soulful guitar. I guess that personally, I prefer Shakira's Spanish-language formula. I'm not saying that I don't think she should change her style, it's just that on the English songs like &quot;Objection&quot; I feel like something is missing. I did like &quot;I'm Ready for the Good Times&quot; which had an almost disco feel. The English version of &quot;Ojos asi&quot; (&quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;) was a good move as it is a great Middle Eastern song with an Arabic chorus. (This is the song that Shakira performed live at the Latin Grammy Awards two years ago when she debuted her new blond look.)<br />The English songs quickly ran together, and somehow seemed to lack individual personalities, more like a collection of &quot;angsty-female-singer-songwriter wails about lost love,&quot; unlike her earlier Spanish songs, which were easily memorable (I can think of at least eight songs I remember from her earlier Spanish albums...I can't say the same for this one even though I've had it over a month). And Shakira's voice is definitely somewhere between a yodel and a wail, which does lend a unique sound, especially in English. I look forward to her next English album to see how her skills and talents in English songwriting have matured.don't think she should change her style, it's just that on the English songs like &quot;Objection&quot; I feel like something is missing.

B00005QDW1|1.0|I want Gwen back. They have gotten progressivly worse since Return of Saturn. Even more so since that moby song and that rap song. The CD is very repetetive and almost embarasing to listen too. Why Gwen? Why?
B00005QZWI|5.0|This music is, for the most part, unequivocally beautiful. &quot;Aniron (theme for Aragorn and Arwen),&quot; found within track 10, is undeniably breathtaking. On the flip side, however, track 13, which is found in the motion picture within the Mines of Moria, is exhilirating, and really gets your blood running.<br />One of the most amazing soundtracks I've ever heard. Well worth picking up. Praise to Howard Shore for this amazing piece score.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Upon hearing the first part of the first song, I thought that perhaps this would be a mildly happy album.  Hey, &quot;I'm back to save the universe' sounds pretty upbeat, right?  Ha.  It's the perfect album to accompany a suicide.  Some of the songs on this album actually hurt to listen to.  But the pain feels so GOOD!  'Exit Music (For A Film)' makes me cry.  'Electioneering' makes me mad.  'Subterranean Homesick Alien' is the perfect song; I would buy the entire album for the part where Thom Yorke sings, &quot;I'd show them the stars, and the meaning of lifel; they'd push me away.  But I'd be all right.&quot;  That line kills me every time I hear it.  'Fitter Happier' makes me physically ill.  At about the 'smiling baby in backseat' part, I feel as if I'm going to throw up, but I can't because than I'd have to stop the song.  Like I said before, the pain is so GOOD!
0812550706|5.0|I've read Ender's Game three times in the past fifteen years and consider this one of my favorite books overall, let alone in the science fiction genre. I had never heard of Orson Scott Card the first time I read it and a third of the way into the book I felt like I was truly in another world. The distinct personalities of the characters and the prophetic concepts of video games and the internet which he developed through this whole series still amaze me. The idea of training children to fight wars and their reaction to the conflict was interesting to me in a very different way fifteen years ago, but I enjoy reading it just as much now.<br />The other books in the series (and most other Orson Scott Card books) are all way above average, but this one holds a special place in my library. I've read that a movie is in the works, but haven't seen anything concrete. With the availability of special effects, it would be much easier to make now than ten years ago, but finding child actors good enough for the roles might be a problem.<br />If you haven't read Ender's Game, do it now.
6301694074|5.0|&quot;yun-chai kang from seoul&quot; must have mistaken this tape with another performance.<br />This is a performance at Bavaria State Opera in Munich, Germany, conducted by then the Music Director Wolfgang Sawallisch who now is the Music Director of Philadelphia Orchestra. This is not Met's performance led by Levine.<br />I actually like this performance better than the Met's with Levine that yun-chai kang may have been mistaken for. A Great and enjoyable performance. Excellent stage directing, Sawallisch's leading this very fine opera house, and the singers are all nothing short of my expectation. Highly recommended.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie is so great! It has an adorable love story, which is a little unrealistic but still fun to watch. It is mostly about the war though, so it's history and romance! I definitely recommend seeing this. It shows that there is hope in everything. The movie is pretty graphic though, and it was a little disturbing for me seeing all the dead soldiers. Buy this movie!

6302038324|5.0|while many have called this film wildly imaginative or perhaps ken russell's most outrageous film, i still say it's his greatest work since the rock opera tommy or his take on the d.h. lawrence adaptations which came before and after this masterpiece. this film is very creepy and extremely moody so naturally it is not for all tastes. in this overloooked film, we see ken russell's demented vision in all it's sinister glory as he unravels his take on how mary shelley came to write of her great monster. there are many horrific scenes in this film which may cause one to blink or to shudder with delight but few are excessive in the gore department which may actually work in this film's favor. ken russell's dialogue is often ironically witty and ofcourse philosophical which works well given the atmosphere and time period in which our film is set but may not be every horror maven's true delight. in fact, you might find it rather boring if you have never read mary shelley, cornelius agrippa, or any works in the occult department. ken russell manages to take the most hideous of images and fears which play on all our minds and then dares to call them to life if only for the duration of this film. in doing this, i believe he is asking us not to run from our worst fears here and to understand that overcoming these fears may lead to a creative enlightenment which we all should hope to attain. kudos to ken russell !!! wish there were more films like this one out there somewhere. ...

B00004Z459|5.0|When i first heard the CD at my friends house i really loved it. But, for some reason, i was worried i wouldnt like it. But over christmas break i finally decided to buy it. IT IS GREAT!The CD is really Hard Rock. My person favorite song is Paper Cut (although the clip above doesnt play the best parts of the song.) For anyone wondering about buying this CD, go head and buy it. YOU'LL LOVE IT! (I wouldnt recomend buying it from amazon though, you can get it cheaper at a nearby Media Play)

B000002H92|5.0|&quot;The Doors In Concert&quot; is a great taste of The Doors sound live. It is exhilarating, hypnotic, poetic and filled with timeless music. Disc 1 is basically the previously released &quot;Absolutely Live&quot; (except for a few changes in the cutting and editing) and has some great moments. The opening is a rare, rich Doors cover of &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; and features some great slide guitar by Robby Krieger. This is followed by a medley composed of &quot;Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar),&quot; a roaring &quot;Backdoor Man&quot; where legendary frontman Jim Morrison lets out some of his primitive side, &quot;Love Hides&quot; which could've been left out, it is a bore, and the edgy, revolutionary and in-your face &quot;Five To One&quot; (with the famous lyric, &quot;No one here gets out alive&quot;). Among the other great moments are &quot;When The Music's Over,&quot; a lively version of &quot;Break On Through&quot; and the ending, a fun version of &quot;Soul Kitchen.&quot; One thing Doors fans must value about this CD is that it contains the complete piece, &quot;The Celebration Of The Lizard,&quot; a long poetic work composed of different &quot;songs.&quot; It includes the &quot;Waiting For The Sun&quot; cut, the hypnotic &quot;Not To Touch The Earth.&quot; Disc 2 is slightly better, it has some of the more popular songs in fact, some better playing. &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; is a great blues classic while &quot;Gloria&quot; is a surprisingly good tune. The performance of &quot;Light My Fire&quot; is hypnotic, poetic and has some great instrumentals (Ray Manzarek's organ-playing is especially captivating). The live version of &quot;You Make Me Real&quot; is fun and never bores while &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot; comes out as one of The Doors' best songs, a true classic. I was surprised how good &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot; came out. The slide guitar is dreamy and edgy and the whole song surpasses the album version. The track is poetic and dreamy. One treat here is that we get to hear Ray Manzarek go solo on vocals with &quot;Close To You.&quot; &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; is okay, but there has been better. Ah yes, now we come to The Doors' masterpiece, Jim Morrison's great epic, dark ballad, &quot;The End.&quot; It is the version performed at the Hollywood Bowl. There have been better versions, but this one works. It can turn into a hypnotic trip with an Eastern taste and moments of true poetry, it is also macabre when Morrison takes into a violent ending of Oedipal sex. All in all, this is the best Doors live collection out there. It is an example of what they were on stage and how Jim Morrison and his music have influenced some many other artists. It is rare to have such original groups come along, here is one of the best.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Lady Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie), adventurer and heiress, finds a mysterious clock in Croft Manor when it starts ticking on the night of the first stage of the alignment of all nine planets. Lara discovers that this clock will lead her to two triangle pieces that when put together at the exact moment of the alignment of the planets, the possessor will have the power to control time. But she Manfred Powell (Ian Glen), a member of a group called the Illuminati who want to use the power of the All-Seeing Eye, steals that clock from her. It's now up to her with the help of her friend Bryce (Noah Taylor) and later on another 'tomb raider' Alex West (Daniel Craig), to find the two pieces of the triangle before the Illuminati use the power for their own diabolical plot. But Lara herself be tested when she starts having thoughts of using 'time' to be able to be with her long dead father, Lord Richard Croft (John Voight). Will she able to resist the temptation? <br />I was totally impressed by Angelina Jolie with her doing most of her own stunts. I thought that action scenes using the bungee cord was pretty neat. Angelina sort of reminds me of Sophia Loren, you know the big lips parted a little. As for the plot, it was pretty cheesy but still it was entertainment. <br />But the best part of the whole movie is of course the cool action scenes! The four main action scenes are 1) the beginning where Lara is head-to-head against Bryce's robot, 2) where the bad guys are trying to steal the clock from Croft Manor (with Lara giving them a pretty hard time), 3) when Lara 'raids' the Tomb of the Dancing Light, and 4) the finale with Lara and bad guys going into the Tomb of Ten Thousand Shadows. The computer graphics were actually good.<br />As for the DVD itself, it's a pretty good special edition DVD. Plenty of special features, my favorites are the cast and crew interviews, a featurette on Angelina Jolie's physical training for the role, about the stunts, explains about the visualeffects that were used in the movie, deleted scenes, and the U2 music video &quot;Elevation&quot;. Of the four deleted scenes, three of them I was happy they had deleted. The one scene in which Powell killed Lara's friend was pretty grotesque. The one they shouldn't have deleted was the one where Lara takes the one part of the triangle from Alex's room. There are also some DVD-rom features.<BR> <BR>All in all, it was a pretty fantastic movie to watch, enjoyable by people who want to spend two hours at home watching a film which you won't have to think too much but still have fun watching the action. Can't wait till &quot;Tomb Raider 2&quot; comes out!

B000000W6R|5.0|Ok if your planning on purchasing this, DO IT! This is a great release from one of the most influential bands of this era. It features great songs that a lot of people don't know about unless they have purchased it. It even features a ... song from James Iha that is spectacular. The rest of the album is a wonderful mix of the complete smashing pumpkins sound , though not really any technoish songs like on adore but ohh well. But it has the cool cover of Fletwood Mac's \\"Landslide\\" which rules.<BR>Anyhow...go ahead and buy it and judge it for yourself but i still say its awsome.<BR>Trust me you'll agree with me.
B00000DRA9|5.0|It is an excellent song just to get away from everyday routines of life. This song is for Dreamers who have visions.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I am glad I am not the only person who feels the omission of the<BR>score (especially the song being played with the ending credits), is a glaring error on this cd! <BR>Moulin Rouge is a mutli-media spectacular! This soundtrack compilation, unfortunately, doesn't quite catch the same magic that is evident in the film. Not only is the score missing, the most visually dazzling scene, when Christian & friends first enter the Moulin Rouge, boasts a rousing melody of modern tunes, including \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit. This is not represented on the cd, probably because Courtney Love won't grant the rights for it to be released, just like she has done with the Nirvana box set. <BR>Despite the two disappointments, \\"Hindi Sad Diamonds\\" and a gritty rendition of \\"Roxanne\\" are well worth the price of this cd. Nicole Kidman's voice isn't too bad and Ewen McGregor sounds great for the most part. <BR>If you adore this film, if the songs and performances made the hair stand up on the back of your neck the way it did mine, you NEED this soundtrack (and the dvd)!
B00002E23E|4.0|Wow. It really is fantastic to finally see my favorite band in the world performing live.  I wasn't even born when they were still together, so when I went to buy this DVD I was extremely excited.  I got home, popped it in, and immediately said, &quot;What the hell?!&quot;  Then, I fast forwarded past all the scenes of the band members with their family members and other crap and then got to the actual performance.  It opens with Rock and Roll, of course, a great opener.  I sat there, mesmerized by seeing the musicians who I worship as gods performing.  A little while later, I again was forced to say, &quot;What the HELL!!!?&quot; Because they had spliced in weird scenes such as Robert Plant walking some grassy plains or something with a sword and then rescuing this chick from a couple of guards during the song No Quarter.  The music is still playing, but it's annoying if you really were in the mood to see them band perform.  Some of the scenes were short, inobtrusive, and cool, though.  Like the one where an old cloaked guy morphes slowly into Jimmy Page and back again during Dazed and Confused.  I was glad that they didn't show this through the whole bow solo, though, because I really wanted to see just how Jimmy did that.  You do get to see plenty of it, too.<BR>My favorite parts:<BR>Stairway to Heaven.  All of it.  They smartly show it uninterrupted by those stupid short movie clips.  It is fantastic, what can I say?<BR>Dazed and Confused.  This whole song is great to see performed live, but I really like that part near the beginning (around the &quot;If you're going to San Francisco&quot; part) when the camera stays on Jonesy and Bonham.  You can see them talking and interacting while Jimmy's playing, and it's just good to see all that ininterrupted Bonham.<BR>Whole Lotta Love.  For the part with that antenna thing that makes the weird noises (I know what it's called but it just slipped my mind for the moment - I hate when that friggin happens!), and the fireworks and the gong on fire.<BR>Now, when are they going to start releasing more concerts?!  I know that they must have them in some vault somewhere, or they could take the many, many bootlegs out there and fix them up for official release.  The Jimmy Page/Black Crowes concert would be cool, but I'd rather have old concerts with the real band (preferably with some of their blues covers! this had none and I love those songs!).
B00005OM4Q|5.0|But we're also seeing &quot;Director's cut&quot; movies released all the time, and a lot of them end up being real disappointments (The &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot; comes to mind), filled with schlock that does nothing to advance the storytelling and probably should've stayed on the cutting room floor or in the &quot;bonus materials&quot; section.  (Kevin Smith was wise enough to not provide a longer cut when he released &quot;Dogma&quot; last year.  Bravo!)<br />So, it was with some trepidation that I sat down to watch the &quot;Untitled&quot; cut of Cameron Crowe's masterpiece &quot;Almost Famous.&quot;  I thought I would end up bored and dissatisfied with this new version:  It's one of my favorite films anyway, how can it be better.  However, this DVD is a pleasant surprise.  All of the extra footage is very good, and it truly adds to the plot of the film, rather than just being there for the sake of being included.  Some of the stuff is totally new, including a very funny radio station interview scene.  Other things cut back into the film are subtle changes to familiar scenes that clear up some of the things about both the characters and the plot (particualarly, they cement the relationships between Penny, Russell and William).  <br />When I saw the &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; sequence in the theatre, I felt like I should be at least misting around my eyes.  Last night, I outright cried at it.  Crowe has done a great job making a DVD that tugs at you just a little more than the theatrical version of the film.  It's a whole new (and much better) movie.
B00005QDW5|5.0|As one of Pink Floyd's biggest fans, I must say that I am torn between whether I should tell you to buy this album or not.  On the one hand, if you are looking to buy a CD to introduce you to the band, this is probably good for you because it provides the best overview of the groups many albums that you can find.  On the other hand, if you already own all their albums, and are a big fan, you probably shouldn't get this.  You already have all the songs already, plus some of the songs on here have been edited to fit on the CD(like Echoes-it has 7 full minutes missing!), so they are inferior versions to what you already own.  Then again (and these are the reasons that I bought it) there is the never before released song \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" which was in The Wall movie, also, a fan might be interested in seeing how well Gilmour made the songs flow together, and it also might be nice to have a nice cross section of the Floyd catalogue on 2 CD's to take with you on a trip or something as opposed to taking 12 different disks.  Also, a truly obsessed fan might want it for the cool box and liner notes with great new artwork.<BR>Well, I guess that I WILL recommend this.  After all, the true fan will end up buying it anyway, and it is the best choice for the new fan.  All discussions of what songs should or should not have been included aside,(personally, I think the post-Waters stuff should have been left off to free up space for such great songs as Carefull with that Axe, Eugene and Atom Heart Mother if there is room-but can you really fit all of Floyd's great songs on just 2 disks? you'd need 20!) this is a good, interesting collection of Pink Floyd in a cool box with new retrospective artwork by the great Storm Thorgerson.  Buy it....
B00005OM4Q|5.0|We're seeing &quot;Director's cut&quot; movies released all the time, and a lot of them end up being real disappointments (The &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot; comes to mind), filled with schlock that does nothing to advance the storytelling and probably should've stayed on the cutting room floor or in the &quot;bonus materials&quot; section.  (Kevin Smith was wise enough to not provide a longer cut when he released &quot;Dogma&quot; last year.  Bravo!)<br />So, it was with some trepidation that I sat down to watch the &quot;Untitled&quot; cut of Cameron Crowe's masterpiece &quot;Almost Famous.&quot;  I thought I would end up bored and dissatisfied with this new version:  It's one of my favorite films anyway, how can it be better.  However, this DVD is a pleasant surprise.  All of the extra footage is very good, and it truly adds to the plot of the film, rather than just being there for the sake of being included.  Some of the stuff is totally new, including a very funny radio station interview scene.  Other things cut back into the film are subtle changes to familiar scenes that clear up some of the things about both the characters and the plot (particualarly, they cement the relationships between Penny, Russell and William).  <br />When I saw the &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; sequence in the theatre, I felt like I should be at least misting around my eyes.  Last night, I outright cried at it.  Crowe has done a great job making a DVD that tugs at you just a little more than the theatrical version of the film.  It's a whole new (and much better) movie.
B000002UA5|5.0|Picture this: It's around midnight.  You're lying in bed, listening to the live half of this CD for the first time.  You've already had your mind blowed out by Astronomy Domine, and now a song called Careful With that Axe, Eugene comes on.  You've never heard this song before, but have heard it's a great one.  It's kind of soft, so you reach over and turn the Volume knob up a little.  A couple minutes pass, and you're really digging it.  Suddenly you hear Roger Waters speaking softly.  You lean your head a little closer to the speakers to hear him say &quot;Careful with that Axe, Eugene&quot; and next thing you know, you jump seven feet into the air, because all of a sudden Roger Waters has started screaming at the top of his lungs and the music has gone absolutely crazy.  You get up off the floor, turn the volume down a little so the whole house doesn't wake up, and then listen, mesmerized, to the rest of the track.  &quot;Holy S##t,&quot; you say to your self, and that was only one of the songs.<BR>That was my first experience listening to this CD.  It is absolutely someone-hit-a-line-drive-and-knocked-all-of-Charlie-Browns-clothes-off fantastic!  You may NEVER stop listening to this after you hear it for the first time.  Astronomy Domine is mind-blowing and way better than the original.  Set the Controls and Saucerful of Secrets (my favorite songs from PF's second album) both sound fantastic, especially Saucerful's climax.  It leaves you positively yearning for more.  For instance a live Interstellar Overdrive would be great.<BR>And let's not forget the studio half! Granted, it can be a little out of the ordinary, most of it is good.  I like Sysyphus and the Narrow Way the best.  Several Species is kind of quirky and funny and not really a song, though.  I don't know why everyone's knocking the studio half.  Most of it is just fine, especially if you've been OD'ing on the rest of Floyd's stuff for a long time and need something new.
B00005TT77|2.0|I grew up on the Beatles and own just about every recording that has been released.  Thus I was intrigued when I heard about this series of covers.  Though the songs selected are excellent, the performances are, for the most part, deeply disappointing.  With few exceptions the artists failed to capture any of the emotion, spirit or uniqueness of the originals.  Without a doubt the best rendition is Eddie Vedder's version of &quot;You've Got to Hide YOur Love Away&quot;.  Vedder evokes the pain of Lennon's vocal as well as displaying a great appreciation for Lennon's unparalled phrasing.  Aimee Mann and Michael Penn's rendition of &quot;Two of Us&quot; do credit to McCartney's catchy little ditty.  McLachlan's, &quot;Blackbird&quot; is about a sweet as one would expect from her.  The Vines do a decent job on &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot;.  The rest of this collection ranges from bad to awful.  Singled out for particularly poor rendtions are Rufus Wainwright's &quot;Across the Universe (hear his sister, The Sloan Wainwright Band's version for a vastly superior version), Sheryl Crow's &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot; is simply horrible.  I wonder if Chocolate Genius ever listened to &quot;Julia&quot;.  If so, they certainly missed the point. Grandaddy's &quot;Revolution&quot; and Nick Cave's &quot;Let It Be&quot; rank right up there with the worst renditions of Beatles songs of all time.  The remaining cuts are all lousy to varying degrees.  My advice, save your money and listen to the originals.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I originally bought this fantastic DVD collection to watch over my friends house over Thanksgiving Break, because I had been meaning to get the Godfather for the longest time and when this collection came out, I just couldn't resist!  Of course, I didn't have a DVD player, so I called up my friend and made plans for the weekend to watch it.  Well, the plans fell through.  I waited another week, but I just couldn't take it any longer.  I had to see this!  So, I bought the bullet and went down to Radioshack and picked up a DVD player.  I got home, immediately hooked it up, and wow! what was I waiting for?  The Godfather has NEVER looked or sounded so good!  I began seeing intricacies that I had never noticed before!  Even III looked like a masterpiece! (well... let's not get too excited...).  So, I asked myself, &quot;Self?&quot; &quot;Yes?&quot; &quot;What in the world did you DO before DVD'S?!!&quot;  Well, I don't know, but I'm sure not going to do it anymore!<BR>This DVD Collection is easily the best ever!  I won't go into the movie plots because anyone willing to shell out 75 bucks for this knows and loves the films already.  The Bonus DVD is great, though!  It has around 20 deleted scenes (alot more than the token two or three on regular releases) and they actually are good scenes!  You finally get to see Michael give Fabrizzio what he deserves.  The second best thing about the Bonus disk is the (I believe) 90 minute documentary.  It is basically Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo and some other guy I can't remember who it was sitting around a table reminiscing about making these movies.  Spliced into this are scenes from when they were shooting the movies, and, best of all I think, lots of screen tests by various actors for various roles.  You get to see Robert De Niro test for the part of Sonny, James Caan test for Michael, Martin Sheen test for Michael, Al Pacino test for Micheal, and many more.  The documentary is almost as good as the movies!  What other DVD can you think of that has a documentary that's worth viewing more than once? (well, Taxi Driver did have a good one).  The extras don't stop there though, you also get to see the Oscar exceptance speeches, about 9 more mini-documentaries (on the music, Francis Ford Coppola's Notebook, etc...), a photo gallery, Commentary by FFC for all three movies (the commentary is good, and incitefull), and of course trailers for all three films.<BR>So, what are you waiting for?  Go click on BUY NOW or run to the nearest video store or do whatever you need to do to buy this set!!  It is mind-blowing!!!
0060920084|2.0|blah, blah, blah...funny remark...blah, blah, blah...complaining about something...blah, blah, blah...funny remark...blah, blah, blah...complaining about something...<br />This is the way the whole book goes.  So, if the redundant humor/satire and bashes against the US will keep you entertained then go ahead and pick it up.  Otherwise, it really wasn't worth it for me.  I am glad he has decided to stay in England.
B000002U9W|5.0|I first got this CD at a music store on the way to my friends house.  I got there, and after a while I asked him to let me borrow his CD player for a second to listen to the new CD that I bought.  So, I put the CD in, slipped on the headphones, and prepared to listen.  Man, was I blown away! I started listening to the first track, and for the first 30 seconds I really didn't know where they were going with this, but then the drums kicked in with the horns and I was pulled into the song and really grooving to it.  I think my friend got a little annoyed that I was sitting there just listening to this song for almost a half hour, but there was no way in hell that I was gonna stop listening in the middle of it!  I was totally sucked into the music.  After that I think I listened to the title track at least twice a day for a couple of months (no exaggeration).  I knew the whole friggin thing by heart, for instance, I could tell you the exact second that the subway effects would start, or the horse noises.  That's how obssessed with this song I became.  After listening to it for so long, my obssession died down a little, but the way those drums kick in in the beginning never fails to get me nodding my head to the beat.<BR>Of course, let's not forget the other great songs on the album!  I didn't like If that much at first (I wasn't into the slow acoustic sound then), but it really has grown on me.  Summer '68 is a great song, again I love the trumpets towards the end, it's kind of a mild freak out.  My second favorite song on the album, and one of the best Gilmour songs around is Fat Old Sun.  There's just something about it that makes you love it.  It's not slow not fast, it's somehow in between. I just can't describe it, you'll have to listen to it yourself.  Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast is a good song that's ruined by too many sound effects.  It's a great tune wrapped around sounds of one of the Floyd's roadies making and eating breakfast.  Once you get over the noveltyof hearing him eat his cereal almost frantically and the funny way he says \\"Marmalade, I like marmalade\\" you probably won't listen to it that much.  All in all, this is one of Floyd's best albums and the title track is undoubtedly the prelude to the other side-long track Echoes (also a masterpiece) from Meddle.  Go out and buy this if you're into Floyd. It won't let you down.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|As the title of this review suggests, I wasn't overly impressed by the movie - it's cute, but unsophisticated (as in the plot, not the special effects). The animation effects are outstanding though! The DVD as a whole is brilliant with all kinds of cool features. I think I enjoyed them more than the movie!
B0000072KY|5.0|In Utero is a different album from Never Mind but equally beautiful. The two standout tracks are All Apologies and Heart Shaped Box followed by Rape Me, Pennyroyal Tea,Francis Farmer and Dumb. Kurt Cobain is one of the greatest singer song writers of this generation and Nirvana hold a place alongside other great bands such as The Beatles, Stones, Who, Led Zeppelin etc. This album does have some weak tracks and that is just my opinion. The album is one of the best of all time even if All Apologies was the only great song on the album. It's a shame there could not have been more.
0060920432|1.0|I've not read a library worth of books, but I've read enough to know that books are supposed to move forward. They have beginnings and endings, and while the ideas at these two places should certainly be related, reading would be a terribly disappointing experience if the beginning and ending are the same exact idea. That is the case with the terribly disappointing book &quot;Flow.&quot; <BR>The author repeats his theory on the happiness found in a mediocre life as if he's trying to convince himself of the worth of having published his less-than mediocre book. The idea he has is actually good, but the delivery is one of the worst experiences I've ever had. Want to know what it's all about? Set a goal, work towards it, and that will be a rewarding experience. Even if your goal is to stuff 129 TV's into boxes during your regular 8-hour shift at the Zenith factory, if you work towards that goal, &quot;Flow&quot; can be yours, and you don't even have to read 900 pages of dribble.
B0000026TD|2.0|If you're a Vollenweider fan, I guess you'll get more out of `Dancing with the Lion' than I did. Some of the tracks are all right, but some are almost cliched new age pieces (one track, `Still Life,' has these atrocious Kenny G.-like saxophone solos). To me, this is just a rather unoriginal follow-up to `Down to the Moon' - althogether a stronger album and a much more tolerable new age release.
B000002UAR|5.0|Over time, this album has become to me like a close friend.  It is a thinking, breathing being with whom I've had countless one-sided conversations, and whose company has gotten me through many lonely nights.  It is not perfect; but then, neither are most of my friends.  It is, however, brilliant: by turns beautiful, depressing, even haunting--and always surprising.<BR>Being nineteen, I can only guess at the influence the Beatles had on 1960s culture.  I have no treasured memories associated with these songs; and I am not a Beatlemaniac.  I am a free-minded listener who first encountered Revolver last summer, and, as such, I'll tell you what I think about it.<BR>Perhaps Revolver's greatest strength is its cohesiveness.  As a collection of songs the album is as diverse as any, yet the Beatles manage to sew it together almost unnoticeably.  In the midst of \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", for instance, we see Lennon adding Eastern elements, making the song flow seamlessly into Harrison's \\"Love You To.\\"  And Harrison's \\"I Want to Tell You\\" closely echoes Lennon's \\"She Said, She Said.\\"  Lyrically, too, the album shows unity.  Harrison matches Lennon's wit with \\"Taxman,\\" while McCartney adds equally meaningful words to \\"Eleanor Rigby\\".  Lennon, who initially 'floats upstream,' 'floats downstream' by the album's end.  Thus we see the three Beatles reaching out to one another, compensating for their differences in style by borrowing aspects of each other's songs.<BR>Still, the contributions of each are distinctive.  Most impressive are McCartney's songs.  They are not, as ... tells you, traditional.  The Gothic \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", with its choppy string harmonies and gorgeous layered vocals, was unlike anything in rock at the time.  And \\"Got to Get You into My Life,\\" perhaps a precursor to Motown, seems to have come out of nowhere.  The melodic \\"Good Day, Sunshine\\" and \\"For No One\\" are as impressive, and seem an apt before-and-after look at a relationship.<BR>But Lennon, too, comes through strong here.  The hard-edged, metallic \\"She Said, She Said\\" certainly leaves an impression, while the magical mantra that is \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" provides a scary finale to the collection.  And Harrison's caustic \\"Taxman\\", with its crisp vocals and labyrinthine guitar riff, opens the album boldly.<BR>Nevertheless, the album is flawed.  It sags at times, most noteably toward the end, with the corny \\"Doctor Robert\\" and the awkward, clunky \\"I Want to Tell You\\".  Harrison appears three times on Revolver, and, while he has matured since Rubber Soul, he still seems timid; he hasn't yet found himself, and, in my opinion, will not until The White Album.  Only McCartney is consistently brilliant here.<BR>Partly because of these weaknesses, Revolver should not function as an introduction to the Beatles.  It is not that approachable; its rewards are subtle; and it contains few of the band's trademark songs.  Abbey Road, an even better album, should serve this purpose.<BR>Revolver's influence alone secures it five stars.  But it is so much more than an outworn artifact of rock history: it's a work of art, a set of lovely songs that have aged well, and that capture a wide spectrum of emotions.  Listen to it long and hard, sing with it, take it everywhere, and it will reward you handsomely.

B00005QDW1|2.0|No Doubt's newest album, Rock Steady, was a big change from some of No Doubt's earlier albums like Tragic Kingdom. The style of this album is more centered on techno and electronic beats, instead of their usual ska-punk-pop sound. Gwen's voice on some of the tracks sounds like Pink, while on others it sounds like Nelly Furtado. A fair amount of the tracks were very tedious and repetitive, often having the same verses over and over again, with no change in the beat or the backround music. Their music seems to be aimed more at the mainstream pop market than any other markets. I found this album dissapointing and not refelctive of No Doubt's many talents they have shown through their earlier music.
B00003CXTG|4.0|After viewing a trailer for Pearl Harbor 10 months before its release, I couldn't wait for this film to become a reality. Having been a Tora, Tora, Tora fan for many years, I was ready for a newer edition using modern computer generated special effects. I must be honest in that I was disapointed on my first viewing of this movie. I guess I was expecting a re-hash of Tora, Tora, Tora where the main theme was from more of a military perspective. I felt the romantic plot was overemphasized and took precedence over the heart of the story, which was the attack. However, this film grows on the viewer. After purchasing the DVD, my view began to change. I discovered that the romantic plot actually sets up the attack sequence in giving it more impact upon the viewer. I'm applaud producer Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay for expressing the foresight not to make an updated version of the earlier Tora film. Using the perspective from a people point of view makes this film watchable. Without people, there is no story, and the main characters could have been any one of a thousand who had similar experiences while stationed at Pearl and who were there on that historical day.<BR>The special effects during the attack were stunning, and the sound on the DVD brings home to those who have a digital decoder, and compatible surround sound, the same impact as was experienced at the theaters. The DTS option is the only way to experience this film to its fullest....Dolby Digital eat your heart out!!<BR>Also, Hans Zimmer's electrifying musical score adds not only a sense of beauty to such a horrific event, but successfully adds impact in shaping the mood of the complete story.<BR>I know many disagree with me on this one as I have read countless reviews of those who were very disapointed in the film as I was at first.  But in my opinion, this DVD should be part of any video collection. It is definitely worth the price.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie,itself indeed,is a brand new idea that against other regular movies.it uses a very interesting method for organize the play and even not comfortable for first viewing. but, what it makes different,weird, is seducing you to watch it again for the whole satisfaction.Get the movie!
B00005QDW1|3.0|Sorry No Doubt...<br />Well, this album is not so great as i thought it would be. i mean, it's not bad, but, i don't know... maybe there's too much pop? <BR>however the songs are pretty nice and they grow on you (on me, they did...)<BR>i appreciate that No Doubt change their style of music but i hope there next album will be diffrent from that!<BR>the lyrics- they are nice, but can be quite stupid sometimes...<BR>the singing- Gwen sings nicely, but her crazysexycool voice is missing! <BR>the music- too much elec. but still nice.<br />the songs- 1. intro- o.k, i guess.<BR>2. hella good- it's a fun track but quite repetitive. <BR>3.

B00002E23E|3.0|Granted this is probably the only live performance Zepplin will ever release.  I found the performance to be good but the cinamatography to be, at best, poor.  Like one reviewer mentioned, the band members are wearing different clothes in the same song, check out &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; for instance.  It looks like the music and the video aren't insinc in places.  Regarding the &quot;dream sequences&quot;, I think they were added so the viewer would not get bored with the length of some of the songs.<br />I wish this performance would be remastered and re-edited for the fans sake.  If you surf Zeppelin web sites you can find what the set list was for a given night.  The nights that Zeppelin was in New York filming, &quot;The Ocean&quot;, &quot;Over The Hills...&quot;, &quot;Going To California&quot;, and several others were omitted due to time constraints.  These forgotten performances should be added plus give the fans a complete version of &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; minus the Zep hiest business.<br />All in all, this one is for the fan who really likes Zeppelin and wants to see the Gods at work.  3 1/2 stars I give it.
6304602979|5.0|The title, 'True Romance', threw me at first. So I didn't actually catch it in the theatre (it only lasted 2 weeks at our local cinema). I watched it as soon as it came out on video and loved it so much i imported the unrated Laser Disk, then last year grabbed the DVD.<BR>No other movie since has had such effect on me, this is the BEST movie iv'e ever seen and it holds up now as well as it did in '94.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a wonderful arrangement of a fantastic novel.  After viewing the DVD, I was immediately intrigued, and read the book. It took me only 4 nights and after finishing, my regard for both the DVD and book remained extremely high.  I can't say enough good things about it.  Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle portray the personalities of Mr.Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett beautifully. Now, I can't wait to read more of Jane Austen's work!
B00005QG9J|4.0|Well what can I say?This one was pretty decent.I'm pretty versatile when it comes to music...I'm split between metal,rock and punk and this album has just about all those generes on it.so go pick it up!
B00005R87Q|5.0|This Film is fantastic! Right from the start we are led into a fantastic car-chase. ... I have never wanted a honda so badly!! The story is very similar to a certain playstation game. If i were to say the game i would spoil the twist. This film is action through and through. the film has several twists and you begin to doubt who the baddy is. Very well thought out and the visuals are great. These film is intended to keep you on the edge of your seat and it achieves this with bangin tunes, slammed motors and cars so maxed that the family saloon just will not do! Explosions gunfire and tyres screeching really test your sound set up. The Atmosphere at the first race fills your ears and really makes you feel like you are there. All in all this DVD is a sound purchase, and you will watch this one over and over again. top film!
B000006TRV|5.0|The decision for which album to base my first Amazon review on....took awhile.  There are literally close to 500 albums that I would like to say something good or bad about.  After a little consideration, I figured I'd start at the Top and work my way Down. //Pink Floyd's monstrous epic, The Wall, is THE BEST album ever recorded in any genre, anywhere, EVER.  There are many GREAT albums....this happens to be THE BEST one.  There are too many 'close second' finalists to even begin mentioning, so don't get miffed over my &quot;Overtly Pretentious Conclusion&quot;. <br />If right now your saying something like &quot;Dylan's Blonde on Blonde is better&quot; or &quot;The first Ramones album blows it away&quot; or even worse &quot;Linkin Park rocks, man&quot;, you should pull the plug on all Audio Devices at your disposal and take up Calligraphy as a hobby instead. (Music just ain't workin' out for ya.)  This is the most ambitious, elaborate and emotional undertaking by any group of musicians since the Classical and Romantic periods. (They, didn't have the benefit of electricity.  Doesn't it rule?) // 'The Wall' is the brainchild of ROGER WATERS, one of our planet's most distinctive weavers of melody and lyric.  With the creative accompaniment of distinguished guitarist, DAVID GILMOUR,  he melds theme, narrative and structure in a way never attempted before - and never since.  The result is the most dynamic musical experience known to man.<br />The album's Protagonist and Antagonist comes to us in the body of one central character - - the infamous 'Pink'.  He's not doing so well and he'd be better off if he stayed back at the hotel.  But he opted to guide us again, into his bleak world of madness and emotional decay.  'Pink' is a composite of  Waters' own life experiences and....more poignantly - - those of former, co-founding bandmate, SYD BARRETT.  The unbelievable writing, arrangement and production of the album fluently guides Pink's character arc, as it unfolds and plummets like a fighter pilot.  The story follows a semi-linear structure, with flashback sequences interspersed; giving us backstory on Pink's earliest traumatic experiences - - the loss of his father in WWII,  an overbearing mother and childhood illness.  It achieves all of this masterfully while also exploring themes of Fascism, Racism, Rejection and Social Disenfranchisement.<br />Novelists have 300 + pages to achieve what Waters conveys to us within the limited narrative structure of music.  His chord progressions and lyrics Evoke Imagery and are Heavily Laden with Metaphor. The sound effects and overdubs found throughout the piece, help to create unparalleled Atmosphere and Tone.  The lyrics are delivered to us by the dueling pipes of Waters and Gilmour.  The two voices accomplish an incredible contrast between opposite, yet harmonious textures.  Waters' voice representing the emotionally loaded ego of 'Pink', tinkering on the brink of insanity - - and Gilmour's representing the peace and comfort outside The Wall.  <br />The album is a 26 track, Re-Master-Piece whose smallest achievement is the fact that it has spawned 6 Classic-Rock Radio gems.  (When these songs are taken out of the context of the whole symphony, they lose a little something.)  I bought this album recently after only hearing it once over the last decade. (It was ridiculously played out in my single-digit and teen years.)  It has re-awakened me to the complexity in art that man is capable of realizing.  The album's classic status is so legendary that it's almost comical.  Yet it's reputation is well deserved.  My only grievance with the Remastered edition is that It does not include bonus tracks for &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot; and the superior version of &quot;Empty Spaces&quot; which are both featured in the film version.  28 tracks would not have been overkill - - in this case.
B00005OCMR|5.0|In every sense of the word. I saw this movie when I was young and it always left an impression on me and I think is the reason I became so excited about Computers. Disney really outdoes themselves with this fantastic DVD set. Even though Disney is one of the &quot;Late&quot; developers in the DVD market, once they kicked in development they are top notch. Disney DVD's have been incredibly well packed with extras and this is just another example. <BR>A great movie deserves a great DVD and Tron is defenitely both.
0066620694|4.0|In The Innovator's dilemma, Clayton Christensen describes the dynamics by which some of the largest, most successful companies in America fail due to &quot;good&quot; management. In his analysis, firms that dedicate themselves to listening to and serving their customers the best, place themselves most at risk for future failures as they are overtaken by smaller upstart competitors with innovative technologies.<br />The Innovator's Dilemma makes a compelling argument based on the author's study of the computer disk drive industry.  Disk drive manufacturing was chosen for its frequent turnover of technology and competitors in a relatively short timespan.<br />Cristensen places technological innovations in two categories: sustaining and disruptive. Sustaining innovations are those that help sustain an organization's existing customer base by improving the performance, capacity, reliability, or value of an existing product technology. Disruptive innovations produce products that are technologically inferior from the perspective of a firm's existing customer base. Disruptive products, however, may include improvements that, while unimportant to the existing market, hold potential for new and emerging markets.  Christensen uses the example of the introduction of small 50cc Honda motorcycles in the late 1950's.  From the perspective of the existing motorcycle market at the time, the Honda was inferior compared to larger, more powerful motorcycles such as Harley Davidson and BMW.  Honda found a niche, however, as a dirt bike - an emerging market that had not been explored by other manufacturers but was ideally suited for a small, inexpensive motorcycle.<br />Once a market is established for a disruptive technology, it can then evolve into the mainstream and become technologically improved to the point of competing with and eventually overtaking existing mainstream technologies. In the case of Honda, once a market was established, small motorcycles were technologically improved to the point of appealing to a mass market rather than just dirt bike enthusiasts.<br />Organizations overlook disruptive technologies for a variety of reasons.  Often, larger organizations listen to their existing customers and what is important to them, overlooking small, emerging markets. The innovator's dilemma is that at the time disruptive technologies are introduced, mainstream companies are often wildly successful marketing their sustaining technology to existing customers.

B00005N9CV|5.0|I am not a jazz purist.  But I ( and my wife!) know what we really like.  Diana's latest CD fits the bill to a T. We bought &quot;The Look of Love&quot; in Nov. 01 and now have all her CD's!   I have not been a fan of, been excited by or purchased any music at all by any one artist for over 20 years.  Diana changed all that!  Her sultry, smokey voice is one in a generation.  The fact that she also plays the piano is an added talent bonus.  Her soft, calm, mature, natural, girl next door looks and style also give her great appeal for us.  We have read many reviews and believe Diana has qualities in voice and visual appeal of the late Julie London (she had the 1955 hit &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; and 32 albums.  Julie didn't think she had such a great voice either ).  We are looking so forward to seeing her in Milwaukee, WI on March 21, 02. Diana Krall deserves all the great success she is receiving.
B000056K04|2.0|I can't believe that I'm going to write a bad review on the Dave Matthews Band.  As a harcore DMB fan, I bought this album the day it came out, listened to it a ton of times to try and find something to like, and I have found very little.  The problem with this album is simple:  they lyrics are unbelievably watered-down (see &quot;If I Were King&quot;) and the band takes a back seat to Dave's horrible lyrics.  And any real DMB fan knows that the band is as much a part as Dave himself.  There are no jam sessions like &quot;Lie in Our Graves&quot;, only 3-4 minute pop songs that I have a hard time believing Matthews even wrote!<br />The reason this album gets 2 stars, and not 1 are a few and far between highlights.  I know a lot of DMB fans who don't like &quot;The Space Between&quot;, but I love the song.  &quot;So Right&quot; is a good song, but not on the level of anything on the previous DMB albums.  And &quot;Everyday&quot; is a the final plus on this album.<br />I guess every band has to have one album where they try something new.  Sometimes it works, and sometimes if fails monumentally.  Unfortunately, this one falls into the latter.
0783225881|5.0|Forget &quot;Dances with Wolves.&quot;  Kevin Costner outdoes himself as an actor in this superb Capra-esque movie that is filled with magic rarely seen onscreen.  Stereotyped as a sports film, &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; is much much more than that.  In fact, I'd classify it as a movie about the human spirit, as much about family and faith as it is about baseball, and more than anything, as a metaphoric, lyrical answer to the eternal question we as human beings ask every day - what is life all about?  Cinematic fables come in all forms and shapes, from the great &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; to the crowd pleasing &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; and the home-as-heaven &quot;ET&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;  &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; challenges one of our cultures' greatest missteps - the emphasis we place on the separation of the sexes...the sad, but true, reality of what is means to be a &quot;man&quot; or a &quot;woman&quot; to be masculine vs feminine.  In a culture that holds dear the idea that &quot;real men don't eat quiche,&quot; &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; tells us that that perhaps salvation awaits in men eating quiche every so often, and women running companies or even the country as leaders one day.  The movie forces is to look at our own mores and values, to suspend for a few hours our earthbound logic, most of which no longer serves us as citizens of a brave new world.  In doing so, it also makes us wonder what and who we ourselves would be IF our dreams really did take flight, if we &quot;built it&quot; would they actually come?  In my opinion, thi sis a movie that ought to be required viewing in order to graduate high school - in fact, perhaps even sooner - so as to create within future generations not just a sense that hope does exist, but more than that - that it's up to each individual to persue and realize their dreams for the betterment of our common earth.  Costner shines, as does Amy Madigan, and especially unforgettably Ray Liotta - one of the best actors out there, and rarely better than he is here.  Shoeless Joe Jackson exists in our dreams, but our dreams cannot exist without his real, present existence.  This is classic storytelling at its finest hour.  And men ... bring a hankerchief, and allow yourselves a tear or two.  You'll feel better, more alive than ever before, and you'll quickly realize that life canot be taken for granted.  A stunning masterpiece, destined to become one of Hollywood's greatest achievements.  SEE IT, think about it, BUILD IT, and guess what - &quot;they will come.&quot;
B00005R23S|5.0|The first time I saw Springsteen, I was no fan.  I was invited to a concert by a lady friend whose judgment I respected and who had the connections to nab two good tickets at the LA Coliseum.  We arrived late, and as we walked toward the stadium, I was disappointed by the sound I heard in the open night air, and not knowing his shows were entirely solo, told her &quot;I hope that's the warm up band.&quot;  She just smiled sweetly and said, &quot;we'll see.&quot;  When we got inside and seated we were close enough to see clearly the body language of each of the performers but far enough away to rely upon the screens for close ups.  As we were locating our seats, this subtle transformation began to occur.  As if by magic, I found myself being drawn into the magnetism of the performance. Here, there was no sense of someone acting on stage, just someone expressing in sound who he was and his perceptions of the world about him from the bottom of his gut and revealing his heart like an open book in searing lyrics.  This he managed to convey without an ounce of idiosyncratic sentimentality but instead through finding in the particulars of his lyrics, a universal dimension of the human experience conveyed at once in word and through the timbre in his voice.  When this man who I would learn in the course of this evening to call The Boss, played his music, it was abundantly clear that he and the band felt this music in their bones, and that feeling penetrated each expression of the Boss' face and his entire body language, and the depth of this feeling simply became contagious, catching the entire coliseum on fire.  By something over the halfway mark, we could no longer confine our enjoyment to our seats.  We got up and skipped to the edge of the crowd where we found enough open space to dance our way through the rest of the concert.  To appreciate a Springsteen concert, requires then as now, all five senses in play. And you'll benefit if you bring your sixth sense to bear aswell.  This DVD is the closest thing to being there that is commercially available today.  It's imperfect just like the rest of life.  But at least until they release a DVD concert composite of Springsteen, 1975-2000, you'll never witness a better rock concert on DVD and this one on DVD beats out most you'll ever see live.  This DVD is not recommended for the optional list.  This is a no-brainer slam dunk.  This one won't sit gathering dust on your library shelf.  Anyone with a heart and soul will be drawn magically, to pull this one out and play it again and again and again...
B00005A1PR|4.0|I thought Alicia Keyes was the only neo-soul passion player to emerge in 2001.  Was I wrong!  I resisted even dabbling in India.Arie's album thinking no one could come close to Keyes' depth and emotion, AND do it with a melody.  India.Arie eliminated any doubts I had from the opening track and throughout this important, one-of-a-kind innovation!  Much more than a bunch of well crafted songs, &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; IS music for the masses and deserves to be hailed as a landmark album, and as a testament to the pure power of music!  Don't wait - this is a CLASSIC and will be remembered as the debut of one of tomorrow's great stylists.  A MUST OWN, and easily one of the best albums of 2001.  BRAVA!
B00005QIPH|5.0|Most of the cynicism here seems to fall under the category of backlash against the advance media hype.  I suppose that's unavoidable, but it's wrong to dismiss this album.  <BR>   First off, I challenge anyone to specify which Velvet Underground record does 'Is This It?' even remotely resemble.  While the old joke about every person who bought the Velvet's first album formed a band may be true, they never put out anything that could be considered a &quot;pop&quot; record except 'Loaded' (which sounds nothing like the Strokes).  If you want to say the Strokes are a poppier version of Television, so be it, but please bag the VU nonsense.  <BR>   Second, anyone who was looking for the Strokes to reinvent the wheel had unrealistic expectations.  The basis of the New Wave, of which the Strokes can be considered a modern extension, was to strip away and dispose of all the awful excess and pretense that was strangling rock music, not to add to it.  It was about finding the long lost purity and energy that made rock vital in the first place.<BR>   As to those who complain of the Strokes' instrumental abilities, if musicianship and technical proficiency are your cup of tea, there are plenty of Tool and Rush albums to choose from.  But if you want (key word being &quot;want&quot;) to rediscover a little bit of what first excited you about rock music as a kid, This Is It.
6304712936|3.0|This is not really a film about Mozart at all. Peter Shaffer the English playwright read some of Mozart's letters which suggested that his sense of humour was rather focused on fart jokes and chamber pots. He wrote a play which was basically about the composer Antonio Saleiri who was older but a contempory of Mozart. Saleiri was a person who was succesfull in material terms and was also a person who had considerable skills and became a court favourite in Vienna. As a musician however he was not that talented and although his music was alright it has not ever been seen as the work of a genious and is played only occasionally as a curiosity. <br />Schaffers play was about Saleiri and his jealously over Mozarts talent. Through the play he is tormented by the fact that whilst Mozart writes music as beautiful as that heard in heaven Saleri's music is at best pedesterian. Further that this is all so undserved as Mozart was so crass. It of course is a further irony that although Saleri hated Mozart he was one of the few who could appreciate the genius of his work. Otherwise Mozart was not that popular and many thought his music overly complex. <br />Now what has happened is that this play has been sort of adapted for film. Instead of Mozart cracking fart jokes at every spare opportunity he is made to appear vulgar. His music in played through the film in short bits and his father is made to appear a tyranical character. <br />The reality of Mozart's life is of course different than this. He very much reflected the time with his sense of humour and the way he expressed himself. The notion of him being a vulgarian is simply a creation of Schaffer's play. The film thus presents a rather unrealistic portrait of his life and it also paints others of the period in the same way. The Emperor Joseph is played as a clown despite the fact that he could sight read music play the piano well and was a person of considerable interlect. <br />If one knows a bit about Mozart the film is thus a bit irritating. It is also unfortunate that a perception has grown up that this is an authentic biography. Still its not the worst film of all time.
0688062334|5.0|There was only one thing about this book that I thought could improve. It took a little while until the story got tremendously suspenseful. Bul it was never the slightes bit boring. I highly disagree about the age group of this book. This book is the kind of book that can be highly interesting to both kids and adults. I would recomend this book to everyone. Diana's books are so much better than \\"Harry Potter\\". This was probbably the most suspensful book I'v ever read! I hope she makes another sequel besides \\"Castle in the air\\".

Well done!<br />Diamond is not a historian; he explores human prehistory from a scientific standpoint. His theory is that the development of civilization and technology came essentially as a result to four factors; 1) the availability of animals and plants to be domesticated (tough luck if the seeds you had were adapted to a different altitude or longitude that you were on, or if the only animals around were dangerous or not economically feasible to domesticate such as hippopotamus or the koala bear), 2) the ease with which the domestication can be relocated (again, the adaptability of the animals or seeds, going east to west was obviously easier than to go from north to south due to similar climates/altitudes at the same longitude), 3) isolation (transfer of knowledge between countries and continents), and 4) the size of the population (more people, more brains, higher chance of someone coming up with something smart).<br />Diamond's basic thesis does have some validity, although I was often left with the feeling that we were only presented with the information that proved the authors point. By building his arguments backwards from the outcome, Diamond could easily defend his theory. I feel that Diamond ignores too many important issues that really need to be considered, in order to make his theory complete. For instance, the absence of any form of acknowledgment for that *pure luck* ought to have played a significant role in where we ended up, and second, that the author completely eliminates the human factor. For example China chose to isolate itself, thereby loosing the technological advantage it had acquired. That had absolutely nothing to do with geography. By ignoring factors such as the human variables, I believe Diamond has significantly twisted the history of human progress.<br />Having dashed out a fair bit of criticism, I must admit that I enjoyed very much reading this book. Diamond knows a whole lot about a whole lot of things, and while reading this book I had many \\"Aha! So that's why!!\\" or \\"Really? Interesting!!\\" - moments.. I learned a lot from this book, and I will for sure cite this book in the future!<br />I do recommend it to any reader whom wants to better understand the world we have inherited.

B00005QZWI|5.0|Three points:<br />1) It's one of Shore's more mature, and coherent, scores. Definitely a 'two-parter', with a horrific beginning following the nine horsemen charging about and Saruman's deception, and a more somber, sorrowful second half, post Gandalf's demise and the breaking of the Fellowship. Happily, the score is split by a third, smaller section regarding Rivendell and the battle in Moria.<br />2) Don't expect anything so spectacular as an action-epic something-or-other soundtrack, it's not that kind of movie. It fits the terrifying/romantic/tear jerking mood a bit better, even in the action cues, a la \\"The Bridge of Khazad-Dum's\\" soloist elegy at the end, leading into \\"Lothlorien\\".<br />3) It's better than that awful Leonard Rosenman ... that accompanied the animated \\"Lord of the Rings\\". A lot better.
0385335482|5.0|I was so pleasantly surprised when I picked up this book last year and starting reading it. I thought it was just a silly beach read, and figured I would read a few pages just to say that I had given it a try, and then give it back to my sister to return to her friend. I loved it! The character is just so outrageous in parts of it! Sure it might not be the most realistic book in the world, but look at the title - does it say War and Peace??<br />I felt that, considering the subject matter, it was VERY well done. I was so excited to find out that a sequel to it just came out - that one went right on my wishlist. If you shop, and as some other reviewers put it, sometimes feel guilty about overdoing it, this is absolutely the book for you! It's a little fluffy, but if I owned a copy, it would never be on the shelf - I would constantly be passing it around to people. Not your typical 'British bachelorette drinks and shops' book - I liked this one SO much more than Bridget Jones.
0783232039|3.0|Who can beat Ms. Tilly... She is just great in this hilarious Chucky sequal.<BR>I think the teenage subplot detracted from the picture though.  John Ritter, in my opinion, was not up to par here.
B00005MP58|5.0|I was ecstatic to find that this Miniseries was put on DVD. Although, quite a lengthy tale, it is one that is most sufferable. Some people find English movies and tales a linguistic obstacle. Words carry great depth and there is a forte for which the English have when carrying out their feelings and convictions.<br />I love the mystery found in English period pieces. The word-play can literally send you into a frenzy to figure out the next tidbit.<br />Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth play the title characters - Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth is frank, sweet, intelligent, playful, free-spirited, witty, and loving. Mr. Darcy is brooding, interferring, cold, sarcastic, and blunt.<br />Firth really makes you hate Mr. Darcy. He is as friendly as jack frost.<br />These two seem born to play these roles. They reverbate off one another. When the pair are in the scene together, you can feel the intensity.<br />You'll find that Mr. Darcy isn't all bad, but he has been conditioned much by his station in life. Elizabeth teaches him a lesson or two. He gets a huge reality check from her heart!<br />Firth and Ehle are supported by a wonderful cast of characters. Some of these include an overemotional self-centered mother, a complacent and witty father, an bungling cousin, an earnest and loving sister, and 4 other sisters wild in character and temperment... plus many other entertaining supporting characters.<br />It is a Romance to rival all others as well as drama and comedy of words. A masterpiece. I dare to say that another remake would fail to surpass the eloquence of this production.
0446608955|4.0|Landon Carter's life changes forever when he's only 17. Though he's 57 now he can remember those days as if it were only yesterday. Because when he was 17 he fell in love with the girl he never thought he would even like. When he signs up for the drama class in school, he sees it only as a way to have an easy class and a good nap. Jamie, the girl that everyone makes fun of for her sweet attitude and numerous charity works, is also in this class. When Landon is in need for a date to the school dance, he finds that Jamie is the only one he can ask. Jamie accepts but she makes him promise one thing, not to fall in love with her. Landon laughs it off and accepts this promise but he soon finds himself breaking it. Over the next few months, as Jamie brings out the best in him and helps him grow up. For the first time in his life he's in love and wants nothing more than to be with her. But when something threatens that love, will they be able to stay together?<br />Though I'm not usually into the romance genre I found this book to be an exception. This book was well written with an almost simplistic style that will make you want to read it in one sitting. It was hard to put down. I only wish it were longer. Jamie and Landon are wonderful characters that will make you laugh and cry. My only complaint is parts of it were... a bit unrealistic. I won't say which to spoil the ending. Though the ending is sad this will be a book that you'll love. I recommend this to people who are fans of a sad but moving book.
038533348X|5.0|The story is about a man who starts out trying to write a book about what the scientists that created the atomic bomb were doing on the day the A-bomb as dropped on Hiroshima.  That project leads him to a fantasy country in the Caribean sea. The story is very well done; it is quite witty, is full of humor, and is easy to read.  The story reminded me a lot of the movie Dr. Strangelove.  The book makes the nuke arms race seem so trivial and crazy, which it certainly seems to have turned out to be.  It was the first book by Vonnegut I read and certainly will not be the last.
B00005K3OT|4.0|It's been a long time since I've seen a movie with this caliber of talent. Binoche does a wonderful job and Dench does an usual role for her, but it works spectacularly! This film's sub-stories of spouse abuse, mother-daughter relationships, and learning to really live life make this film the masterpiece that it is. Did I mention the yummy chocolates?? I had a major craving for chocolate myself after seeing this one. <BR> If you're in the mood for comedy, subtle seriousness, and talented actors...well then check out this film!
0345413377|5.0|the amber spyglass is without a doubt my favorite book. it was not merely a fantasy adventure story, there were plots and meanings weaved into it... a great deal can be learned from this book, no matter what your age is. Pullman illustrates true love with the pure innocence of will and lyra. he simplifies the ongoing fight of good and evil, showing that there are no forces, only actions...people are too complex to have simple labels. he illustrates pure kindness and harmony and everything the human race should hope to be with the muelfa. they are not near as advanced as we are, but they are clearly better  and above us; for they are not jealous or selfish or spoiled. and i hope his views on god help people to be openminded as opposed to the shallow and scared idiots they are. im not saying what he portrays is correct, im saying there are possibilities beyond the christian standpoint that should be recognized. anyways, the amber spyglass was a beautiful conclusion to the trilogy. it was magnificently composed as the first two, but then it exceeded them because of all the meanings within...pullman is a genius; everybody should read this book, it will leave you with something to think about.
B00003CWNR|5.0|1.) It's interesting to note that some of the people who rated this film with 1-2 stars are pro-life, when this film is not entirely about abortion. The storyline presents us with romance, abortion, incest, and a boy on his journey to finding himself. It's a classic American story that touches on some issues, and yes, it does have a pro-choice theme. But, it does place a good argument on the table. Women who receive unsafe abortions will likely die, and many children are dumped into orphanages because they were not wanted. So, to those who are pro-life, I encourage you to give the film a chance. The best way to support your viewpoint is to know the argument of the opposition.<BR>2.) So this film presents some questionable situations.....that's entertainment! Life isn't peachy, fair, or the way you want it to be...why not have films represent this?? <BR>3.) This movie is in my top ten favorite, if not #1! Just give it a chance....if you dare to have an open mind!
0064430227|5.0|I was surprised when this book arrived with a cache of other colorful books I ordered for bedtime reading to my 2-year-old.  Buying it on the basis of online recommendations, I hadn't recognized it as the story that had captivated me as a child.  On sight, I hastily judged it too advanced for my daughter and stowed it away. (No color illustrations! So many pages!) Some bedtimes are more exasperating then others, and when I finally reached for Harold, my daughter lapsed into total absorption and delight. Needless to say, Harold has joined the family.  Kids are never too young to cultivate imagination.
B0000399WI|5.0|The moving life of Andy Dufrane entered my life two years ago. When I saw this film, I instantly fell in love with it. Tim Robbins went beyond an actor and truly transformed into the quiet, well-mannered Andy Dufrane. Andy is hardly another prisoner at Shawshank, he is a genius with a dream of freedom in tropical paradise. This movie touches the heart, especially when Andy is roughed up by the 'sisters' and when he befriends 'Red'. The perfection of this movie, I'm afraid, cannot be described by words. How can one describe perfection?
0465011012|2.0|This is a very poorly written book. <br />To be fair, it could be that the book suffers from a double translation: from Korean to French, then from French to English. It could also be that the book seems to have been dictated (during meetings with the original French translator), then put into narrative form. Nevertheless, the prose itself is rambling, unfocused, and full of interludes, both long and short, that lead nowhere.<br />The information about the North Korean \\"gulag\\" system (if one can appropriate this term for hard-labor camps outside the USSR) is really nothing new. It certainly nothing that isn't publicly available on one of the many, excellent on-line journals documenting human rights abuses in North Korea (i.e. nkhumanrights.or.kr). Really , this presents very few insights.<br />What is interesting, however, is the author's description of his nostalgic, childhood views of life in Pyongyang, and the efficacy with which children are brainwashed to worship Kim Il-sung and his son. It is also informative to read about the rampant corruption in North Korea, which the author learns to manipulate after his release from the \\"gulag,\\" as well as the mundane, everyday violence born of the ennui of North Korean life. Apart from that, there ain't much to recommend it.<br />Since these passages represent maybe 10% of the book's 200-plus pages, the reader would be much better served by skiming the book at the library, rather than adding this title to his library.
6303327982|3.0|Ever since it came out in August 1994, Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS has been the subject of much invective, particularly when it comes to the question of whether or not it encourages savagely violent behavior--a charge that has been levelled by society against the media more times than people can remember. It certainly provoked the ire of its original screenwriter Quentin Tarantino, who went to every length imaginable to disown the film because of what Stone did to it.<br />Stone, perhaps our most powerful cinematic maestro in exposing the dark side of America (witness PLATOON and JFK), has set himself up a significant problem in making this ultra-violent film about mass murderers Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis) killing dozens along U.S. Highway 666 and becoming media celebrities. He has frequently gone on record as stating that this is a savage satire on violence and the media. Stone's material and his method of presenting it, however, are so extreme that the satire is often swamped. This raises the question: Is NATURAL BORN KILLERS really a pointed satire (in the manner of DOCTOR STRANGELOVE and NETWORK) or rather just a pointlessly violent movie?<br />Stone, like Stanley Kubrick, has historically made it a habit of making movies that people talk about years after they are first released. But NATURAL BORN KILLERS, unlike his other achievements, is so over the top that whatever satirical intentions he might have had are buried under a migraine-inducing avalanche of montage sequences, bizarre camera angles, weird camera filters, blood, and bone-crushing alternative and heavy metal rock music. The acting is also so outrageous, especially by Tommy Lee Jones (as Dwight \\"Welcome To Hell\\" McClusky) and Robert Downey Jr. (as Wayne Gale, a bizarre caricature of Geraldo with an Australian accent), and the dialogue so extreme and profanity-ridden that the film becomes heavy-handed long before the halfway point is reached.<br />Although I haveto give credit to Stone for making the points he does about violence and the media, I don't think he's really telling us anything that a film like NETWORK didn't forsee back in the 1970s--that we would become obsessed by media-glamorized mad dogs. The rapid-fire montage sequences that worked so well in JFK, and which were perhaps inspired by Sam Peckinpah's similar use of them in THE WILD BUNCH, don't always impress this time around.<br />Thus, the verdict here is that NATURAL BORN KILLERS is a film that rests in a vacuum--one where it is easy to admire the technique, but much harder to admire the story
B000000W5L|5.0|Mick Jagger and Keith Richards form two halves of an amazing musical whole - Richards has the mental prowess needed to create a series of not only rock, but also blues, country and gospel numbers; while Jagger's \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" voice is credited with the emotional scarring of nearly all hard rock and even metal vocals. Their flaws (Richards's high-pitched voice built for harmony and Jagger's soft-hearted over-produced 'Dark McCartney' writing style) for once balance each other out on Exile On Main St., leaving behind a rock band and album that is still one of the most influential for almost all modern recording artists.<br />Strange stories accompany the album, written and recorded(pretty much entirely) by Richards while the Stones lived together in Paris, dodging the huge British taxes placed upon them, but they are inconsequential when placed next to the songs themselves. The album kicks off with the testosterone-laced \\"Rocks Off\\", runs through a series of fairly interesting but mostly forgettable little numbers that add to it (Many people like \\"Tumbling Dice\\". I personally don't see anything in it, but it does seem to be a popular number) until it reaches the quiet country ballad \\"Sweet Virginia\\", an amazing raw bluesy number coupled with a more stable, produced song \\"Torn And Frayed\\". These alone with \\"Rocks Off\\" make the album worth every cent, yet the remaining 11 songs create the classic status that it has achieved. \\"Loving Cup\\" is a blues with a classic piano part(their best apart from Hopkins's philandering on \\"She's A Rainbow\\"), \\"Happy\\" is Keith Richard's classic rock anthem, one that he now plays every tour, to varying degrees of success. \\"Turd On The Run\\" (ignore the name, please) is a funny little fast-paced country rambler with a Stones-spin, leading into the spinal-cracker \\"Ventilator Blues\\", a dark but musically powerful number with Mick Taylor (the other guitarist in the group) snagging a piece of the authorship. The album moves into gospelwith \\"I Just Want To See His Face\\" and \\"Let It Loose\\", two underrated classics (although \\"I Just Want...\\" betrays its basement origin), and closes the album after a moment with \\"Shine A Light\\", another gospel piece and a nice guitar piece \\"Soul Survivor\\". All this put together make this one of the best Stones albums out there, and certainly one of the best double-albums ever (losing out to perhaps only to the Beatles's self-titled 1968 phenomenon commonly known as \\"The White Album\\").<br />The only complaint some may have is the sound quality, while usually providing a raw and interesting tone, sometimes gets in the way of the music (citing the two worst offenders, the vocals on \\"Turd On The Run\\" and \\"I Just Want To See His Face\\" are inaudible). Also, a warning to parents thinking the Stones are a harder version of the Beatles - This album is not one for children. Sex, drugs, and profanity abound in this album that, due to its release date, is not requried to carry a parental advisory. Don't be surprised to get some *tough* questions from your kids if they've led sheltered lives and listen to this album!<br />Overall, the album, though lacking a cohesive flow, is strong and one of the best the Stones have produced in their nearly forty-year history. If you like rock, country, blues, gospel, even heavy metal, you will find this album one of the staples of your collection.
B00005QG9J|3.0|I must confess I am not an Incubus enthusiast, and Morning View is the only Incubus album I have heard in it's entirety.  My first taste of Incubus came a couple of years ago when Make Yourself was released.  The singles annoyed me.  I thought \\"Pardon Me\\" could have been done a lot better- I think the melody on that song speaks for itself and the over-the-top guitars are entirely unnecessary.  Perhaps an acoustic (or at least somewhat mellower) version would have captured my attention.  Despite my initial dislike of Incubus, the hit \\"Drive\\" changed my mind about the Los Angeles five piece.  I really, really like that song- even though I am tired out it now (too much radio play will do that to any song).  <BR>Enough about \\"Drive\\" and how much I like it- let's talk about Morning View.  I must say that Incubus frontman Brandon Boyd has an excellent voice- one of the best I've heard from rock music in a while.  His voice is pure and natural.  He doesn't try to change the style of his voice for each individual song.  Instead, he stays with his great (and very recognizable) natural sound- and it comes out great.  One of the problems with bands that play \\"edgy\\" music (definition: loud distortion, hard-poundin' drums, angry lyrics) is that often times the vocalist will try to match his/her style with the genre of music, instead of singing naturally.  Some bands can pull it off.  Many others cannot- it usually sounds forced, and the music suffers.  This is definitely not the case with Incubus.  Boyd sounds natural, and the music benefits.  <BR>Lyrically, this album is fairly good- certainly stronger than previous releases.  At times introspective, at times angry.  The album is not an emotionally roller coaster by any means, but the lyrics cover a lot of ground that most modern bands fail miserably at attempting to write.  I am not saying this is a lyrical masterpiece, of course.  There are some clichs, but a few clichs are hardly grounds for dismissing a band's lyrical ability.  <BR>Next comes the music of Morning View, which I believe to be the weakest part of the album.  The band is not inadequate in their abilities to play their instruments, by any means (although I wish they would turn up the bass guitar at times- seems to buried in the mix).  Simply put: the songs failed to grasp my attention, even after several listens.  Sometime the melody seems forced, or maybe it is the music that is forced.  I cannot really tell.  This is my only beef with this album.  Unfortunately, lyrics and the vocalist's ability to do make great songs, or even good songs.  There are three main aspects to a song: Lyrics, music, and the vocalist.  If a song excels in all three areas, then it is more than likely a great song.  Good songs do not always need good lyrics or a good vocalist.  They always need good music, however.  By music, I mean the combination of the instruments and the actual melody.  Incubus fails to capture the music portion on the majority of Morning View, unfortunately.  Some songs, like \\"Blood on the Ground\\" and \\"Mexico\\" are good songs, and others, such as \\"Circles\\" and \\"Echo\\" are also very good. <BR>While there are some songs on the album that I enjoy, I would not buy this album.  However, if you are an Incubus fan, I would definitely say to go for it- Incubus has really matured in their sound.  Perhaps they are sick of being compared to the \\"n-metal\\" ...bands like Limp Bizkit and Korn, and have decided to take a softer approach to their sound.  Either way, there is something for *almost* everyone on Morning View, something which not many bands can claim.  There are some things I would have liked to see the band do differently, but I'm not decided what the band should be doing, am I?  I personally like the direction Incubus has started to go in, and I look forward to hearing their music in the future.
B000002BPS|5.0|This album is awesome!  Just like all their CD's it is definately worth your hard earned money.  Trust me.  Well, I'll organize this to talk about each song.<br />'The Meaning of Life': A great song that's very easy to relate to.  It talks about how others will try to get you to follow in their footsteps and believe their beliefs, but how you don't want to, and just because you did it that way doesn't mean it's the right way kinda lyrics.  <br />'Mota':  This is a funny song about how drugs are bad for you.  It opens up with the \\"Tequila\\" tune, and tells you Dexter's view on drugs.  Good song.<br />'Me and My Old Lady':  About Dexter's relationship with his wife (though I don't know how true it is).  It's my least favorite on the CD and a tad too perverse for my tastes, but whatever...<br />'Cool to Hate':  A very sarcastic song about how hating things makes you cool.  Dexter is very sarcastic in his lyrical workings, and this song is about how it is popular today to dislike everything.  Great song!<br />'Leave It Behind':  Good song to help you change your life and leave all your bad habits, jobs, friends, etc. behind if they aren't doing you right.<br />'Gone Away':  All I can say is \\"Wow!\\"  This song shows true emotion.  You can hear it in Dexter's voice how it feels.  This track is wonderful, and very touching.<br />'I Choose':  Talks about how life can be hard or fun, and that it's your choice.  Dexter shows true genious lyrically here by talking about bananafish (a JD Salinger reference) and other such things.  I love this song too!<br />'All I Want':  A song many teenagers can probably relate to.  It's about just trying to get people off your back and how it's hard to live with so many rules, but in order to stay alive, you must, though you don't want to.  I know I can relate.<br />'Way Down the Line':  As people said before, it's about not wanting to end up like your parents and encouraging you to try to break the chain.<br />'Don't Pick It Up':  This one'sabout how you should be cautious of things you try if you can't quit.  Cool song!<br />'Amazed':  Easy to relate to, because many people have been in a similar situation where you'd be surprised if you made it out because the pressure is breaking you.  Another one many teenagers probably relate to easily.<br />'Change the World':  About how people say they want to change the way things are done, but really don't care and only do things for self betterment.  The lyrics are very true, but you'd never think someone would turn something like this into a song.<br />All in all, this is a wonderful CD, and like all other Offspring CDs, it's worth your money.
B0000508U6|4.0|When I first heard Coldplay's \\"Yellow\\" on MTV2, I noticed a couple things.  First, I thought the song was great, and according to the airplay the song received, so did a lot of people.  Second, I thought that Coldplay seemed to be taking off where Radiohead left off before Thom Yorke went completely nuts- the Radiohead of '95.  I was right about the first.  Actually, I was also right about the second.  Despite sounding similar to Radiohead in a few different aspects, Coldplay remains a highly original band.  It may be true that Radiohead fans of old were looking for a replacement, and therefore turned to Coldplay, but regardless of comparisons, Parachutes remains an unbelievable showing of artistic ability for a debut album.  \\"Shiver\\", the disc's second track (after the short but catchy \\"Don't Panic\\") is definitely one of the highlights on an album full of good, and sometimes great, songs.  I am not a big fan of track 3, \\"Spies\\", but \\"Sparks\\" makes up for any bitter taste I get from skipping \\"Spies\\".  \\"Sparks\\" showcases Coldplay's ability to take a simple acoustic pop song and make it an instant classic.  Other highlights on the album include the previously mentioned \\"Yellow\\", \\"Shiver\\", \\"Trouble\\", and \\"High Speed\\".  \\"High Speed\\" solidifies the back end of an already marvelous debut album with its subdued guitar textures and hook-laden vocal melodies.  If you enjoyed \\"Yellow\\" you should certainly invest in this album.  If you didn't really like \\"Yellow\\", you should still consider picking up a copy- it will surprise you more than you think.  Finally, if you are the one person who absolutely hated \\"Yellow\\", and you despise British bands, and hate Radiohead, and like ... bands like Papa Roach and Linkin Park, you should at least burn a copy of this CD to add to your collection of ... music.  Then maybe it will influence you to sacrificially burn your Crazy Town, Limp Bizkit, and Slipknot CD's (you can keep your System of a Down CD, because \\"Chop Suey\\" is interesting).
B000001IPL|5.0|As I always vote for Offspring (since they're my favorite band because their music is great!) I give it 5 stars.  Dexter has an amazing talent for writing intelligent lyrics (not much of a surprise knowing the genious he is) and the rest of the band (Noodles's guitar, Greg's bass and Ron's drums) back up the Dex's vocals very well.  I love every song on this CD, which is amazing, because there's normally one on every CD I don't care for, but could you expect less from such a great band?  It's very hard to choose, but if I had to, I'd say the best 3 songs on the CD are 'Gotta Get Away', 'Smash' and 'Nitro'.  If you like Offspring only in the least, you should still buy this CD.  It may turn you into a bigger fan, and show you why so many others like myself love them so much.  This CD is worth your money, even if you've only heard a few of their songs (granted, you liked those songs you heard).  I love this CD and I tell you, it is definately worth your money, like all their other CDs.
B0000029DD|5.0|May 29th, 1997.  Jeff Buckley reported missing in the Mississippi.  6 days later, his body was found.  Jeff was only 31 years old.  His band mates were flying out to meet Jeff when the tragedy occurred- they were to begin the recording process for My Sweetheart the Drunk, the follow up to the phenomenal Grace.  Unfortunately, the album was never completed, and Grace stands alone as Jeff Buckley's only complete work- but what a work of art.  <BR>Grace exudes near perfection throughout its fifty-one minutes and forty-four seconds of playing time.  The tracks, while musically and melodically diverse from one another, are all united by Jeff's soulful vocals and perfectly executed musicianship.  From the opening track, \\"Mojo Pin\\" to the dark and disturbing album closer \\"Dream Brother\\", Jeff Buckley proves his musical prowess, amazing lyrical ability, and of course, his instantly recognizable vocals.  This album may stir up emotions you have worked hard to bury.  One listen will not impart the true essence of what lies within.  Multiple listens are required for an understanding of the lyrical insinuations alone, let alone grasp the emotional charge and beautiful power this album presents to the listener.  You may never listen to another album again.  <BR>Musically, Grace is a collection of awe-inspiring songs that are, at times, unparalleled.  At times the musicianship comes off as simple, although it could make even the most experienced of guitarists' frustrated. The complexity of the rhythms and leads is easily overlooked, due to the absence of traditional solos.  Jeff Buckley was an understated, technically great guitarist, combining gyrating blues licks, jazz voicings, folk strums, and beautiful, unusual chord progressions to shape an incredible form of art.<BR>\\"Mojo Pin\\" starts the album in a hushed, dreamy fashion and erupts into an intense and emotionally passionate epic.  The title track, \\"Grace\\", is certain to move any listener to sing along with Jeff's soaring vocals and brazen screaming (of the melodic type).  \\"Grace\\" exemplifies the wonderful textures and subtle nuances one expects from a great studio recording.  \\"Last Goodbye\\", which was voted to be college student's favorite song in 1995, blends acoustic rock with a killer bass line and vocal melody to produce one of the most fantastic radio singles of it's time- a definite \\"must listen\\".  \\"Eternal Life\\", the ninth track, would probably fall between the lines of rock and hard rock.  Shockingly enough, \\"Eternal Life\\" comes immediately after the quietest track on the entire album, \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\".  Jeff's strong command of his voice is re-affirmed after several listens to \\"Eternal Life\\".  That is taking live versions into consideration, in which he absolutely poured out his heart and soul.  If the opportunity ever arises where there is an opportunity to hear a live version of this song, be sure to listen closely.  \\"Eternal Life\\" was performed in a different way every time Jeff played the song live.<BR>While the upbeat songs initially attract the listener to this album, the softer songs are the heart and soul.  \\"Hallelujah\\" captures Jeff in the perfect setting: alone with his guitar, with no other arrangements necessary.  If only one song were to stick with you out of all the songs on Grace, this might as well be the one- an all around riveting song.  Initially, I was not impressed with \\"Lilac Wine\\".  The song seemed quiet and dreary, but it has grown on me to the point where I find myself frequently singing along with Jeff's breathtaking falsetto.  Next to \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\", \\"Lilac Wine\\" is the weakest song on the album, although it is superior to 95% of the music bounced around in the airwaves these days. <BR> \\"Lover, You Should Have Come Over\\" is the undeniable centerpiece of Grace, and displays Jeff Buckley's uncommon knack for the perfectly placed song.  From the funeral organ intro, to the stunning final chorus, this song delivers the embodiment of heaven in just a shade under seven minutes.  <BR> \\"Dream Brother\\", the cryptic closing track, retrospectively sounds hauntingly prophetic, as are other songs on the album, such as \\"Grace\\" (with lyrics like \\"I'm not afraid, afraid to die\\" and \\"I believe my time has come\\") and \\"So Real\\" (\\"as my shoes fill up with water\\").  The last line of \\"Dream Brother\\", the final track on Grace, leaves behind an unforgettable statement:<br />\\"asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over\\"
B00005QATY|5.0|Good acting and generally funny. Great story basing and graphics are wonderful, especially if you have dvd and get to see how it was made. Garanteed laughs every time. A must see for every family.
B00005R2M3|5.0|After I heard the first song, I was totally in love. With the cd of course! It's beautiful, Shakira has a nice Spanish accent and the cd is full of good dance songs.<BR>I think everybody should buy this cd because it's great.
B00005RHGK|3.0|Jeepers Creepers is just another film that follows every idea and thought that all the films in its genre have ever done.  It's your typical horror movie that has a script any 8-year-old could follow, and mediocre acting.  <br />When I rented Jeepers Creepers, I had in mind that I was going to get exactly the opposite of that.  I was let on to believe that it was going to be terrifying.  It wasn't.  <br />The first 30 minutes gave me some hope though.  The Creep, as I like to call the monster, played a crazed maniac in an old, unexpectedly powerful vehicle that tries and run the main characters off the road.  It was fresh and very entertaining.  But, after all that was done, and the Creep made his first appearance in costume, the film spiraled down hill.<br />The one problem I have with most horror films these days is that they are overloaded with cliches.  And Jeepers Creepers was beyond overloaded with them.  There were your typical stupid main characters that do their stupid things and say those stupid lines.  Nobody in their right mind would even consider doing some of things they did.<br />And the believability of some parts was stretching it a bit.  Would a county in the middle of no where have a police force the size of Manhattan?  I don't think so.  Things like that just really took its toll on the movie.<br />Jeepers Creepers really wasn't a terrible film, but it took on all the features that it was expected to in a horror movie.[...].  3 Stars
B000000H5J|5.0|This is FF's second CD, and it came out around '95. This CD introduced new bassist Christian Walbers. Although I loved the old bassist on &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot;, Christian's work is incredibly good. Anyway, to the music. FF if you dont know already are an intense blend of thrash, death metal, and techno. Dino (guitar) is  very fast, and really makes FF stand out from other bands. Burton (vocals) sings both in melodic and death metal tones, which turns out to sound very nice. Raymond (drums) blasts thousands of beats beat minute through your headphones. He uses the double bass drums so fast it'll blow your mind, and when coupled with Dino's guitar and Christian's bass, it creates the unique sound that is named Fear Factory. Now to Christian. His bass can be heard loud and clear on Demanufacture, and it's always nice to be able to hear the bass. He's very talented, and he even has some short solos in some of the songs. I love every track on this album, but if I was to pick a few, I would pick 1-5 and H-K. Pick this up and give Fear Factory a try. I think you'll like it. But, warning: Do not buy this album if youre just beginning to listen to FF. I recommend Obsolete or Digimortal for newbies. Enjoy!
B00004ZELJ|5.0|I got the german version of this DVD and I have to say it's awesome. This concert is a great show that also proves how talented and how professional the guys are. My favorites are 'That's the way I like it (great choreography)', 'Quit playing games' and  'As long as you love me'. If you have a 5.1 surround system -&gt; turn it up!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Amazing war scenes. My jaw dropped when I saw the dogfights and the Japs attacks! I found myself holding on my seats when those two guys were able to grab their planes and smoked some Japs. I just can't imagine how they depicted those scenes, especially the sinking of those big boats! My home theater was pushed to it's limits. Guns and explosions can be heard everywhere in my home theater. Wow! Like Saving Private Ryan, the fight sequences are soooo realistic!!!

6301969294|4.0|Since David O. Selznick (producer of \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and \\"Rebecca\\") didn't produce this as a faithful adaptation of the novel, but Henry Blanke (\\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"Casablanca\\") DID, I recommend seeing the movie first. When you read the novel first, you cast it, design sets and play it out in your mind, and in my mind, Howard Roark is played by Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman is Dominique, and Orson Welles plays a thinly-veiled Charles Foster Kane, aka Gail Wynand. Screenplay by Charles Brackett and Ben Hecht, directed by Howard Hawks, Technicolor, music by Bernard Herrmann.<br />Anyways, since that's all in my mind's eye, let us deal with what's really there:<br />This film is the greatest example of post-German expressionism after World War II. Visually, it's overflowing with licht und schatten worthy of Lang and Murnau. This is the movie's greatest achievement, deftly accomplished by cinematographer Robert Burks, who confines Gary Cooper (the movie's martyred saint) in a shadow-world so oppressing, that it rivals Scorsese's \\"Taxi Driver\\" and Hitchcock's \\"I Confess\\" (for which Burks was also DP, as he was on all Hitch's films from the early 1950s through Marnie, in 1964, with the exception of \\"Psycho\\") for the sense of loneliness and psychological isolation which crowd in the hero.<br />Burks owes a lot to \\"Citizen Kane\\" in the use of low-camera-angles employed in projecting the movie's tragic hero, Gail Wynand, played by Raymond Massey. Massey brings a British-Canadian flair to the role that is completely outrageous and incongruous with the role's Hell's Kitchen origins. So what! As with Cary Grant, Massey succeeds in the \\"willing-suspension-of-disbelief\\" department when it comes to ignoring his British accent.<br />Burks' camera lingers longingly and tenderly on screen siren Patricia Neal, as Dominique. This is when REAL HOT WOMEN got Hollywood roles, and when the likes of Marilyn Monroe \\"replaced\\" Jane Russell and Kim Novak was groomed as the next Rita Hayworth. The scene in which Neal visits Coop's apartment with the none-too-subtle white fur bust ornament above her evening gown is priceless in the glamor department. A few reviewers call this movie \\"dated.\\" If by dated, they mean not having untalented, unalluring and underfed matchsticks like Gwyneth Paltrow and Calista Flockheart, then, yes, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is dated.<br />Britisher Robert Douglas plays Ellsworth Toohey, the rabble-rousing colmunist with over-the-top and villainous aplomb. Wielding his ever-present cigarette holder with blatant swishiness designed to circumvent the Hayes' office censors, Douglas gives the best flamboyant-homosexual-villian performance this side of Robert Walker, as the tortured Bruno in Hitchcock's \\"Strangers on a Train.\\"<br />Rounding out this bombastic Expressionist tour-de-force is Max Steiner's equally plush and bombastic Romantic score, which uses heavy brass and low strings to provide an aural sledgehammer that sets the action onscreen to the passionate sturm und drang of Tristan und Isolde. They don't make movie music like this anymore. Composer David Raksin (\\"Laura\\") once quipped that 1940s movie music overwhelmed the listener not only with foreboding, but with \\"fifthboding.\\" <br />Again, compare Steiner's \\"maximalism\\" (no pun intended) with the oat-bran sparseness of today's so-called composers such as Philip Glass (minimalist is too big a word to describe his simplistic, monotonous, scratchings) and Michael Nyman. <br />\\"The Fountainhead\\" is a movie made about giants, by giants. Reality be damned, this movie is worthy of \\"Citizen Kane,\\" \\"Metropolis\\" and \\"Double Indemnity.\\"<br />Now, once you've seen the movie, then read the book, which is even better! Do it the other way around, and you'll find yourself \\"what-if\\"ing the Fountainhead that could've been, rather than basking in this sterling example of 1940s cinema.
0446608955|5.0|This book will totally consume you while you're reading it!  My girlfriend borrowed mine and planned to casually read when she had the time.  She started reading one afternoon and did not stop until she was finished!  She too had laughed and cried throughout the book.  The ending has been debated by family and friends.  You'll have to read it to see what you think the outcome is.....   I love Nicholas Sparks!  I haven't read one that I didn't enjoy.
B00003CWTI|4.0|There's a good thirty to forty minute stretch of the three-hour Magnolia that is pure genius. But then the rest is either mediocre, confusing, and/or contemptible. The film is devoid of regular pacing. It drags on and then it ends abruptly just as things are picking up. It has odd captions of the Guy Ritchie order. It attempts to tell a story about characters related and unrelated, which creates an uneven mishmash of events. Is there a connection or isn't there? This film never attempts to aide the viewer on the solving of this mystery.  To organize a bit, everything that's bad and good about the film can be attributed to writer-director, Paul Thomas Anderson. He takes the credit and the fault, exemplary of his upstaging of the material.  But if someone is going to upstage a film, why not the brash brilliant Anderson? First the bad: there are some very rotten cliches in this film, from the rapping little black kid who speaks truths that bely his years to the black and white depiction of the insensitive father who lives his life through his kid.  There are other things with the film such as it is very slow and very long, but overall these are challenges not problems.  Magnolia follows interweaving storylines, the best, in my opinion, belonging to Tom Cruise as sex guru, Frank Mackey, a man quite tragic in the way he's deconstructed by a simple interview task, which explores his male aggression as a disguise for familial scarring due to his dying father, Earl Partridge (Jason Robards).  Cruise brings an excellence and star power to the film that was needed among all the character actors (John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall, Julianne Moore, Melinda Dillon, and Melora Walters--in a stunning, tender performance). Another great segment of the film belongs to Jeremy Blackman, a talented young actor capable of evoking sympathy without acting cute or mannered.  He plays game show contestant Stanley Spector, a boy genius pushed to unreasonable standardsby his father.  Spector is based upon PTA's precociously famous girlfriend, Fiona Apple, who he also wrote it for.  The game show event, in which Spector decides to take a stand against the adult establishment that has abused him, is one of the most powerful and gripping scenes in film history.  What makes Magnolia eventually a success, aside from the themes and the captions and the raining frogs, is that PTA instills all of his characters- some children, some women, some adulters and abusers (who a less capable director might see as strictly &quot;bad&quot; people) and all damaged souls with a humanness and decency, both sad and uplifting.  <br />note: the music in this film is fantastic.  aimee mann's songs and jon brion's (fiona apple's producer) score compliment and sometimes actually involve the action brilliantly.
B00005JKT8|5.0|For what this movie is supposed to be, one can overlook the inconsistencies in the plot.  This is a wonderful romance and fantasy, with lots of humor in it.  <br />After all, it is just not going to be possible for a time travel movie to be completely consistent!  <br />This is a clean (just a few instances of strong language) and fun movie.
B00005PJ8I|2.0|this movie is so boring and predictable i can't believe tom hanks would ever agree to this.   this movie has been done already.  it was called robinson crusoe, and that's a classic.    helen hunt and tom hanks have about as much chemistry as david hyde pierce and jane leeves on frasier.  who cares. the part with tom hanks on the island was boring, but i expected that anyway. then guess what?  he gets off the island.  i never saw that one coming.  he risks everything just to get home to helen hunt and she  is married. he  then the movie just kind of ends.  i think he was better off staying on the island.  maybe this movie should have only been shown on a deserted island so no one would have to be subjected to it.
0451167716|5.0|This novel will be the yardstick for measuring other offerings for years to come but I can't see anything else even coming close.<br />  Mario Puzo grants the reader intimacy with his characters, they become our personal friends. Don't be concerned that they live outside the law and they sometimes kill people. The hypnotic influence of this author makes you wish that Vito Corleone was your Godfather and protector.<br />  I seldom read a book more than once, but this one keeps coming back to me. I've read it three times and I know that there will be more.<br />  It's the story of a family more than a mob saga. It's about one mans personal view of the difference between right and wrong and his passion for enforcing those values. The Corleone family makes its money from the gambling business, a \\"victimless\\" crime. They refuse to enter the drug trade and that makes them righteous and noble. For his stand, the patriarch almost pays with his life and that justifies any retribution that he metes out.  This book is a masterpiece.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I would have given this album 3 stars if it weren't for the fact that she wrote and produced the entire album herself, something very rare indeed among other artists who are popular now.  I also had to give her credit for being so different from what's out on the radios these days.  The entire album is a musical masterpiece, despite the fact that the lyrics are somewhat lacking.  Even during the sagging moments when she's singing lyrics about buying thongs, the music itself makes up for it.  <br />There are few lyrically good songs too, such as \\"Objection (Tango)\\", \\"Fool\\", and \\"Poem To A Horse\\".<BR>I feel that the overall best songs on this album, besides the gleaming lead single, \\"Whenever, Wherever\\", are the ones sung in Spanish, the best of those being \\"Que Me Quedes Tu\\".<br />This album is really good, if you ignore the lyrics during a few songs.  However, no matter how shallow some of the lyrics are, it's a whole lot better than any thing Britney Spears or any of her clones could put out.
B00000258J|4.0|With the background talk between tracks and the fun blues recordings, this is a decent addition to any blues fan's collection.
B00005R87Q|3.0|The reason i gave it three stars is because it has some cool cars in it.  But honestly the acting is close to horrible in this movie.  Yet even with the horrible acting the suspense is still there.  So I suggest you rent this one before buying it because if you can get past the acting then its an alright movie but if you can't then i guarantee you will hate it.
B00005T33W|4.0|This film belongs to Thora Birch.  Expanding on her American Beauty character Birch demonstrates an uncanny knack of bouncing other characters off her own with no attempt at scene stealing or undercutting.  As Enid she plays a recent high school graduate who in contrast to her only friend Rebecca, played by Scarlett Johansson, finds herself living in a world given over to vacuous banality and pretense.<br />The increasing alienation scares Enid and she armors herself with heavy boots, a series of costumes & a sketch book   and defends her fragile hold on sanity with cutting sarcasm and put-downs.<br />Unlike Rebecca for whom this type of disdain is merely a convenience Enid is not popular & knows it, hence her gradual  rejection of 'cool' and increasing interest in the affairs of Seymour (Steve Buscemi) a collector of archaic 78RPM records and other nefarious vintage material.<br />The history of this film, unconventional director Terry Zwigoff (Crumb) and the semblance of plot are discussed elsewhere & in any case nothing more than an open mind is necessary to appreciate the scathing critique of American Pop. Phony is routed out and exposed in every possible way and co-opted victims wander like zombies through their assumed personifications.<br />The fact that these erstwhile comic book creations are now being played out by animate human beings lends a pathos difficult to define.  Enid's father, (Bob Baliban), his fiance 'The Maxine', (Teri Garr), Seymour's room-mate, the clown like employees at restaurants, movie houses, book shops, Enid's air-head art instructor (Illeana Douglas).  None are spared.<br />As Enid begins to realize that she has crossed a line with no hope of return her search becomes more frenetic and unpredictable.  Her relationship with Rebecca crumbles.  Seymour becomes a victim & Enid herself departs in a hauntingly allegorical final scene, beautifully filmed against a blueish background of telegraph poles, concrete, mindless grafitti and the emptiness of Americana. <br />There is comedy here, fortunately, but Birch with a mastery reminiscent of the young Jodi Foster plays her part  straight  to the very end & end it surely is.  Any other interpretation is as fanciful as the 'cool' now so blatantly issuing forth from every media source and advertiser nation wide.<br />If you liked  \\" You Can Count On Me\\" see this film.  It is a companion piece in every sense.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Finally, a talented rock band that really plays ROCK, and not the rap-rock no-talent garbage that has permeated our culture!  This is 'shoot from the hip' big fashion city rock that is raw, fresh, talented, and sorely needed today!  I am 40 years old, and have experienced and lived through rock in the late 60's, 70's, 80's, and 90's, and can tell you that 'The Strokes' are going places fast.  They have balls, talent, great hooks, and great looks!  What more could you want, really???
0786867973|2.0|Ok, I'll give this book a five star rating for pictures and style.  But the two star rating is for the recipes I've tried to date...the culmination being the &quot;Snickerdoodles.&quot;  I've made snickerdoodles for 25 years and thought it would be fun to try a different recipe.  These were the worst cookies I've ever made!  Wasted a sunday aftenoon.  I'll keep trying to come up with some favorites from the book, but so far, it's none too promising. Are these really her favorite recipes?
B00004Y87O|5.0|This is the one that gave Kurt Russell a jump start in his career. Fast paced action moves the story nicely. Snake Plisken (Kurt Russell) must rescue the president from NY city which is now a high security prison with the inmates governing themselves. Sci-fi/action fans should enjoy this movie. The DVD plays very well with a crisp,clear picture.
B00005RIKD|5.0|After seeing Sting in Central Park last summer I mentioned what a nice twist on some of his work. That little Jazz thing he's had going on was really cool. One nite after 9/11 at 3:00 am I happened upon the A&amp;E special ...All This Time. I not only bought the record (&amp; DVD) I have ended up buying one for every single person I know and love. The &quot;reinvention&quot; of all these songs is incredibly wonderful, easy to listen to and above all relaxing. I have especially found this version of Fragile to be unbelievably healing to my soul. On this record Sting shows us how he is reflecting on his life. I'm sure all these songs have new meanings for him than they originally did and now they have new meaning for me as well.<BR>If for no other reasons you sould get this record for Fragile. Although he originally wrote it for John Lennon, the fact that they were going to release this particular song as a single on that particular day........
B00005OCMR|5.0|I was thrilled with all the extras you get for your twenty-five bucks.  Six trailers, and 80-minute &quot;making-of&quot;, tons of other interviews, and then the movie.... When I would watch this classic film on videocassette, my big gripe was always that the soundtrack was fuzzy; it was hard to understand what people were saying sometimes.  Not here, though!  Here the speech is crystal clear, and the picture is beautiful.  If you're looking for a quality recording of this movie, this is it!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|My 21-year-old son watched this movie five times during Winter Break! He loved Ewan McGregor in \\"Trainspotting.\\" I loved Nichole Kidman, whose unbelievable talents are showcased in this movie! I've also seen Baz Luhrmann's \\"Strictly Ballroom,\\" which was another visual delight! I love his creativity, use of color, and ability to suck viewers into a story, even when they \\"know\\" the ending.
B00005QIPH|2.0|If you like this CD, check out Frisbee, a Chicago band that actually is musical, sings with harmonies, garage band +!  The Strokes are getting a lot of hype (just like Velvet Underground did in the 60's), probably becuase they're from new York, but Frisbee already has what The Strokes are striving for.
6302862949|1.0|A movie about ballet dancers - yawn! Not much for the guys here, plus it's questionable how attractive to ladies a leading man can be whose main interest is wearing stockings and prancing around on tip toe. Baryshnikov isn't even good-looking with his surly face. As for the tortured artist angle, we all know that ballet dancers were among the few classes spoilt by the corrupt Soviet system. The plots as thin as Bary's stockings. Anyway, that whole Cold War thing is pretty much outdated and passe nowadays.
6305508550|5.0|if you have ever felt frustrated in your job, order this DVD and you will immediately start feeling better!!<br />I have over 1100 DVD's and this has to be in the top 5<br />trivia:  even Jennifer Anniston was good in this movie (I never thought I would utter her name and good in the same sentence)
1573226521|5.0|&quot;The Beach&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the best books made in this past decade.  It is a real page-turner, as many people have described it.  Garland captures real excitment in this almost modern day &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot;<br />I would tell anyone to read this before seeing the movie, which has been changed from the book in many ways.  The movie is good, but the book is much better.
0345413377|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and the first two in the series. It combined action with emotion to create a really addictive storyline; I couldn't put it down.<BR>However, Northern Lights(book 1) is still my favorite out of the 3 as I loved the way it introduced all the characters and i think the plot is excellant. My only complaint with the Amber Spyglass is the ending, I wanted to know more about what was going to happen to Will!
B000002JR8|4.0|I don't get why people say this is one of the heaviest albums ever. Buy a Cannibal Corpse or Morbid Angel album if you think this is the heaviest ever. This is Pantera's heaviest, but it's almost nothing compared to death metal. The solos are getting worse, especially on &quot;Becoming&quot; and &quot;5 Minutes Alone&quot;, but it's not numetal. Some of the songs on this album are kind of weird (&quot;Good Friends&quot;, &quot;Throes Of Rejection&quot;) which is why it doesn't get 5 stars. &quot;I'm Broken&quot; is a classic and &quot;Use My Third Arm&quot; is one of their best, while underrated. This is Pantera's second worst, only to &quot;Trendkill&quot;, which only gets 3. If you like this, buy &quot;Vulgar&quot; for more straightforward Pantera or &quot;Trendkill&quot;.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Well, what can I say? Right from the opening of the red curtain introducing 20th Century Fox to the end credits, this movie had me glued to my seat. The bright colours of the costumes and set were dazzling. To quote Ewan McGregor: &quot;I think this movie really is a feast for the eyes, you know?&quot;<BR> I think the acting on the part of all the lead characters was excellent, particularly Ewan McGregor (Christian), Richard Roxburgh (the Duke), and Nicole Kidman (Satine). I would have liked the pace of the camera work to have been slightly slower, simply so I could take in the set, and also see more of the dance sequences. But the singing and music is great, and I think that Ewan and Nicole did remarkable jobs, both with  beautiful angelic voices. I thought the way they incorperated modern songs into the script was very clever, and I fell in love with 'Come What May', the only original song in the film. You have to approach this film with an open mind, and be prepared to witness a film like nothing you've seen before! I highly recommend it!
B000002KB8|5.0|How can you like metal and not like this album?! This is where it all began. Every metal band from Motley Crue to Iron Maiden to Sepultura to Dimmu Borgir has something to owe to this album in some way, shape, or form. A lot of people think &quot;Paranoid&quot; is the first because you hear more of those songs on rock radio stations. Nope, this is. This album is packed with classics such as &quot;N.I.B.&quot; and &quot;The Wizard&quot;, both of which are underrated and need to be heard more. Tony Iommi is a good guitar player and Ozzy's Sabbath-era vocal work is much better and less commercial than on his solo stuff. Bill Ward's chops are good and Geezer is a fine bassist. If you are a metalhead and don't own this album, where were you born, Saturn?? BUY IT!!
B00005U122|5.0|This is another Must-Have dvd to be one of the Floydians and a fan of Roger Waters. Otherwise, don't count yourself as one. Roger Waters and the band have created an amazing performance with wonderful audience. The sound and the picture quality are splendid. If you love PINK FLOYD and ROGER WATERS, once again you can realize how fast time passes with Jacky on the rocks. STANLEY KUBRICK's contribution to 'Perfect Sense' has made the song awesome. Hall's begging mercy to Dave on the background sound has put the put the bricks on the wall finally. 'What God Wants' could've added more flavors in the concert. I'm sure we all Roger Lovers meet in the Garden one day.
B000021YQV|3.0|I don't get what's so great about this album. I mean, it's a zillion times better than &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; by Linkin Park, but come on, A MASTERPIECE?? Masterpieces are &quot;Schizophrenia&quot; by Sepultura and &quot;Powerslave&quot; by Iron Maiden. The first album is slightly better than this, because none of the songs from that one get heavy airplay like &quot;Chop Suey&quot; from here does. Best songs are &quot;Prison Song&quot; and the title song, but &quot;Bounce&quot;, &quot;Needles&quot;, and &quot;Psycho&quot; are pretty bad. &quot;Aerials&quot; has a great intro but other than that, it's really not a great song. I feel this album is VERY overrated.
B00003CXXR|1.0|This has to be the most boring,poorly directed movie of all time. Here are a list of reasons why this movie is terrible.<BR>1.It lacked realism eg a child cannot survive eight weeks in a park of dinosaurs alive or atleast a clear mind and a strong will<BR>2.The characters are the most stupid people ever one of them tries to buy food from an abandoned vending machine machine on a desert island .<BR>3.Fake backrounds <BR>4.Lets down the series immensly<BR>5.The film is run by the simple basis of the characters running from dinosaurs.<BR>6.Bone crunchingly boring<BR>7. i have to save this particular scene for last sam neil is in a sandy area on jurassic island suddenly four raptors run up to him they surround him like they do in cartoons as if they were in the wild west all the while the backround and the raptors are extremly fake then a small child runs to the rescue with cannisters of tear gas which he throws that scares the dinosaurs away.... <br />this was a waste of time no one should see this movie.

6301967992|4.0|A refreshing take on the vampire horror movie.  Nicely counteracts the Hammer films of the same era.  Polanski adds his dark humor the subject.  Sharon Tate in a better role than Valley of the Dolls, plus the only Jewish vampire I can think of.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is my all time favorite movie! If you love musicals and are open to new experiences you'll be thrilled with this film. The majority of people who hated this movie are those who don't think that movies can be an interactive experience for the audience. The film urges you to sing along, dance in your seat (or out of it now that we can view it at home), and cry at the beautiful ending when the lovers get back together. I can see this one reaching the cult status of Rocky Horror and I'd love to participate in a showing with the same call-back format. The reason for the montage of love songs lies in the overall context of the story. Moulin Rouge is based on the myth of Orpheus; a poet who could create the most amazing songs. To convey this extroardinary gift to a modern audience, Christian is able to spout out the greatest lyrics of the greatest love songs of our time. When we hear &quot;I Will Always Love You,&quot; and the rest, we can bring all of the emotional baggage that we have in connection to these songs to our experience of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; and say, &quot;Wow! This Guy is Good!&quot;<BR>The more you see Moulin Rouge, the more you get out of it. I didn't understand the movie after the first movie and therefore wasn't too crazy about it. I'm so glad that I went with my friend to see it again, because after that, I was hooked! If you are ready to let go and have a great time, this one's for you. Otherwise, stay static and miss out on this creative and energizing experience.
B00005TT77|1.0|They made over a dozen albums in the 60s.  I would highly recommend purchasing any Beatle album instead of this collaboration.  John Lennon is surely rolling over in his grave after hearing the no-talent Ben Harper profiting off of one of his songs.  The true brilliance of the Beatles lies in the songs they made and in the era in which they made them.  This is the most blatant, and most pathtic, attempt to recapture that brilliance.  As John Lennon said &quot;The dream is over.&quot;  So for people who like the Beatles, get Abbey Road or Rubber Soul or Sgt. Pepper.  For those people who like Ben Harper and/or Stereophonics, i recommend you purchase something that was actually created by those bands respectively, instead of a 34 year-old cover.  Either way, no one should purchase this album.
6304907648|5.0|This is more like Manhunter/Red Dragon, but no way is a rip off. The creepy killer in the beginning, Daryl Lee Cullum is based off a serial killer named John Paul Knowles, who used the name Daryl sometimes. A lot of this is based off real serial killers. It is an excellent film, Sigourney Weaver beats William Petersen and Jodie Foster in every way.
6302994063|5.0|Strictly Ballroom is the story of a young ballroom dancer named Scott. He's from a well known family of dancers in Australia.  Scott's the upcoming star of the Pan Pacific World of Competition Dancing.  When the young man gets a little bored with the rules and regulations that are imposed on the dancers, he plans to try some new steps in his routines.  A shy and seemingly plain girl named Fran believes in Scott's dream and offers to be his dance partner.    Scott's family and their friends are scandalized that he willing to risk his chance of winning a major competition by not obeying the rules.  His choice of a partner doesn't help the situation because Fran is considered to be an amateur and a liability to their dance team.    The main characters are believable and the supporting characters bring in the wonderful comedy.  The exaggerated hairstyles and flashy costumes of many of the dancers are hilarious.  The dancing is a joy to watch and a little romance provides an added zest to the story.    This is a film that you won't forget.
B00005OCMR|1.0|The Anniversary edition of Tron seems to have many problems beyond mine...<br />When I put the first disc in my DVD, the menu is severely off center. You can hardly see the right hand options. It's a mess.<br />The film itself looks fine and there weren't any placement issues on the second disc.<br />I returned the disc to the retail store where I bought the disc and exchanged it for another copy and discovered the same menu mess. <br />I plan on returning it for my money now and will check Amazon instead of the retail store I chose for future pressings of this Disney essential. <br />Disney's DVD's sure are mixed bag of lousy and fantastic quality...
B00005JKMO|3.0|Michael Mann has got to be one of the best and also one of the most overlooked directors in Hollywood. I'm a big fan of his work and will see any film on the sole basis of seeing his name in the credits [as director], but when I mention to most people about my excitement of a new movie coming out by Michael Mann all I generally receive are puzzled looks.<br />Mann's last two films, Heat and The Insider, rank among my favorite films of all time so naturally I was more than excited to see his latest film, Ali. This film has all the magic of Mann's visionary directing as well his amazing ability to get the most out of any actor. Will Smith (who I think is a horrible actor) gives a surprising good performance and who would have thought Jon Voight and Howard Cosell were in fact the same person? Unfortunately there isn't much of a story to make all the pieces worth putting together.<br />As a biopic I don't expect to find the traditional set-up/conflict/climax method of storytelling, but neither do I expect to see the complete lack of cohesion this film seems to have. This film jumps to different points throughout many of the famous parts of Ali's life seemingly without rhyme or reason.<br />The film is an interesting look into the life of a very interesting individual, and Mann's directing along with wonderful performances from all the film's actor are enough to take away the pain of the poor screenplay. Ali is not a bad film at all, but you can't help thinking about how good this film should have been.
0783222955|5.0|Just one glance at Robert J. Mulligan's 1962 film and you will see why it (unlike many of today's contenders) is a true American masterpiece.<br />Based on Harper Lee's novel of the same name, this film narrates the realities of growing up in the south during the depression while watching her father defend a black man accused of raping a white woman.<br />The difficult subjects of racism and the legal system are addressed in a timeless response that does not fade despite comparatively more advanced filming techniques or altering legal realities.<br />As the Anglo protagonist Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck delivers one of the most excellent character performances of his film career. His task in the throes of segregation is a gloomy prospect (with judges and jurors predisposed to bias against your client from day one) but Finch trudges stoically on throughout the screenplay.<br />This imparts to his children the importance of standing up for what you believe in and being an open minded person that tries to treat everybody fairly. Certainly the family faces retribution from narrow-minded community members, but the children learn those attacks are a small price to pay for the greater good of a society without bias and injustice. It is better to place yourself on the line for your principles than to say/do nothing and let things continue as they had always occurred.<br />That in itself would be a powerful statement for a film produced during resurrection of the American civil rights movement, but it also tackles the biases surrounding people with disabilities in the character of Boo Radley.<br />As the town \\"idiot\\", he is an enigma to the local children--who spend a considerable amount of time in the film fascinated by the rumors surrounding this man---until he becomes the one who saves Scout from vicious attack related to her father's case.  Like Jim, he represents the \\"Mockingbird\\"-entities who do not harm anything else and therefore should be treated with kindness.<br />Finally, Scout's proto-feminism in wondering why she would be treated differently than her younger brother foreshadows the resurrection of the feminist movement in America. Despite Atticus's comparatively progressive stance on race issues, he unwittingly bought into sexist assumptions about gender roles.. <br />Finally, Scout's proto-feminism in wondering why she would be treated differently than her younger brother foreshadows the resurrection of the feminist movement in America.

6304712499|3.0|This film was well crafted from a collaboration of Todd McFarlane and director/visual effects wizard Mark Dippe. I'm not saying that this movie was exceptionally good nor all that bad, but it still could've used some work. Spawn(Comic book)is a very graphic and very detailed look at crime and mobsters, the movie however revolves around Jason Wynn(Martin Sheen)who has his mind set on world domination. The story was somewhat weak compared to the comic book considering that if the comic was put on screen, it would have an NC-17 rating slapped on it. The DVD however is a step up from the theatrical release because it is the director's cut. This has a very good amount of extras that I enjoyed watching as well. If you're a fan of visual effects you may want to take a look because this film is purely based upon effects rather than plot.

B00005R2IS|5.0|MGM jumped on the DVD bandwagon rather late in the game, and the studio has been struggling to keep up ever since.  Traditionally, MGM has released bare-bones, movie-only DVDs with bad transfers and horrid sound - but, thankfully, tradition seems to be losing out to what consumers want.  Mad Max: Special Edition is the latest offering from MGM's film vaults to make its way onto DVD in a restored, high-performance disc, and it's about time, too.<br />Mad Max will probably go down in history as the film that made Mel Gibson a star, but that would gloss over the film's many other virtues.  A post-apocalyptic tale of good vs. evil, Mad Max features the title character, Max Rockatansky, in his job as an \\"Interceptor,\\" a kind of cop struggling to maintain order in a world where the government has all but collapsed and ruthless biker thugs and warlords have made normal life impossible.  When Max kills a member of the gang, their leader, the Toecutter, turns around and butcher's Max's family.  As a result, Max gets very mad and goes straight to kick-ass mode.  The story is slick and well-told, with enough fast cars, gun battles, and extreme chases to keep you tied to your chair.  It's basically a Western set in a decaying Australia, and it's a welcome change of pace for action fans, too.<br />MGM presented us with a two-sided, dual-layer DVD that has two versions of the film: a gorgeous 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen transfer, and a full-screen copy on the same side for those who don't like to see the whole movie.  For the first time, American audiences get to watch the film with the original Australian dialogue (it was dubbed with American actors for the US and never released with the original accents before now), either in the old-school mono mix or a completely redone, deep and dynamic DD 5.1 remix.  On the other side you get two mini-documentaries, one about the Mad Max series and how the crews made the films (informative), and one about Mel Gibson's rise to stardom (blah).  Round that out with a pop-up video style \\"trivia track\\" (really just a subtitle option), and you've got a great disc.<br />The pop-up video track is one of the best and most innovative new features in a long time; I hope other DVD companies take note, because it's fun, informative, and you can watch it again and again, unlike most commentary tracks and other \\"extras.\\"  Overall, Mad Max is an excellent disc, and at its current price, it's worth adding to your shelves.  If you're an action fan or a post-apocalyptic-film fan, then this disc is a must.).

B00005MP58|5.0|The measure of how good this production is can be shown by the fact that despite having seen it three times previously, my wife and I stayed up until two in the morning to watch the entire film. Much better on DVD, without those artificial commercial breaks, and low-quality image on television, the film is superbly acted all around.<br />Jennifer Elhe walks walks away with the honors here; her Elizabeth Bennett is perfect.  Colin Firth's inarticulate Darcy is an excellent foil for her.  Simon Langton's direction is good, straightforward, letting the actors speak Austen's one paragraphers (as opposed to one-liners) with all the impetus required to deliver such well-constructed prose.<br />Even the divergances from the novel are welcome; there is nothing overly arty or disruptive to upset the narrative.  Too bad nobody has the guts to reshoot this film with this cast with Hollywood production standards.  Compare the lighting to &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; which is filmed in equisite light.  Still, this is a better film, despite the absence of any name stars.
B00000HZH7|5.0|FIRST OF ALL: get the Century Media Germany import version of this CD because the domestic version sounds awful. I have the import version and it sounds fantastic.<br />This is one of those CDs that parents have nightmares about because it screams about satan and death and is not sofisticated so much as to drive young people away. This CD represents the bridge between thrash and death metal. This CD predates Death by two years and made these boys \\"The new gods\\", according to an old 1985 speed metal compilation I own. And two of the band members WERE boys to; they were still in high school when they recorded this music.<br />You cannot go wrong with this CD! People into thrash, death, black, etc love this release. Best tracks: 1, 2, 3, 10.<br />If I want some to jam to without any putting up with music experiments or stupid preaching about how the world should be or whatever I throw this CD into my Walkman and go.<br />Rating: Classic, 10 stars, if-you-don't-have-this-CD-then-MAN, WHAT-are-you-DOIN'?

B00005R2IS|5.0|I must have seen this movie about a million times in my short life, on both video and dvd, but never have I seen this movie look and sound so fresh. <BR>The picture is the crispest I've ever seen for this movie, and is true testiment to the power of DVD, much in the same way as Terminator:Special Edition was. Print damage still appears in places, but given the fact that the movie is twenty three years old, that's expected. But what blew me away is the sound of the 5.1 Aussie English Audio track(that's right, the original soundtrack). Unlike the local video release, the audio is as clear as a bell. Low sounding dialogue is understandable, clear and crisp. The dispatchers voice isn't muffled, and Brian May's musical composition plays more powerfully, while mixing effortlessly and complimenting the action sequences more effectively than ever. <BR>This movie has always been a classic of Aussie cinema, if not, cinema in general. It's a shame that it took twenty two years for you guys in the US to finally experience this the way it was originally intended. Better late than never, but given the treatment it's been given on this disc, well worth it!
B00005B4GU|4.0|For all the criticism this album has gotten, they are right on a couple of things: 1. It's not the best stuff radiohead has put out and therefore 2. It's nowhere near as good as OK Computer. That said, this is still good music and not exactly a step backwards for Radiohead, more of a sidestep. The cd starts off with a brilliant piece of percussion and bass, &quot;Packd Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box&quot;. From then on you really have to listen to the album a few times to fully enjoy each song. This is not a cd you can skip around on. On a whole however, this album is worth your time and money.
0061008079|5.0|This is my first book by BTB and won't be my last. I chose this strictly because I had seen three other books that related to this one, two which were part of the trilogy. I figured I would give it a try, as I love epics. I was definitely not disappointed. The characters were so vivid and real to me, I couldn't put the book down. At over 700 pages hardback, it is quite a read, but I have done it in less than a week. I absolutely couldn't get anything done until I found out what happened. I love the way she set it up- she got you hooked, then let you dangle for oh, 699 pages!!!<br />If you are a fan of Sara Donati's &quot;Wilderness&quot; books, you will definitely love this. I can't wait until tomorrow to get the sequel.
B000000W3G|5.0|this collection is demonstrative of what the smashing pumpkins do best, their own thing!  if you think that your a fan of their music, you're truely not until you own this boxed set. it contains, in my opinion, some of the best works ever released by the greatest band of our generation! this is a must have for anyone how appreciates their music agt all, and will teach you to appreciate their genius even more!
B00004S367|4.0|Music Of My Mind is the album that showed what Steveland Morris (aka Stevie Wonder) was TRULY capable of doing once creative control was given to him by the Motown execs. Here is Stevie spotlighted as producer, composer, arranger, lyricist, singer, and musician, doing it in a way that might seem pedestrian in today's age of synthesized instrumentation and electronic studio wizardry, yet seemed like a revelation at the time this underrated gem was released. Every track offers some part of what Stevie's all about as an artist and the seminal work he does with the budding synthesizer technology he had access to back then alone is worth picking up this album for.<br />I would've given this a 5-star rating for what it spawned afterwards in terms of Stevie's phenomenal output during the 70's, but as it is I winded up docking a star only because his following albums, especially the next two that came immediately after MOMM were even better in terms of the focus and artistic vision that were showcased. Still, no serious music listener can trace the development of Stevie Wonder the self-contained artist without first checking up on this undoubtedly essential album.
B00005QIPH|2.0|Okay this is such an exciting group it's like Lou Reed 30 years ago shamelessly ripping off songs of the 70's.  Soma, is that the disco song from the movie slap shot? I keep humming &quot;Last night I said, lets rip off Tom Petty's American Girl.&quot; This why no one respects critics.  Some bands get nailed for being knock offs and some are just ignored.  Why the critics love the Strokes is beyond me.
B00003CXXS|3.0|This movie is ok. I mean since it is the third one it is kind of getting old. The first and second one's we're the best. But since you know that most likely they are going to get attacked by dinosaurs and they have to figure out away to survive.I own the first and second one and when I saw the third one in the theaters it seemed like it was really short.But alot of people liked it and see what you think.
0812550706|5.0|This book i would have to say is the best book i will ever read. I read it during my 6th grade year, and I loved it. The story was so moving i will read it again. Though I am only 13 years old, I have influenced my friends into reading this tremendous read, and they said it was good too. It makes me sick when people don't appreciate a good book like this. The book was so great, that at sometimes I tried to act as Ender the main character. That is how powerful Orson Scott Card's writing is to my mind. I hope that someday i will meet this great author.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I already have written a review on \\"Almost Famous,\\" after I saw it in the earlier part of 2001.  However, rumor of this \\"Bootleg Cut\\"  kept me from purchasing the original.  When mom used to say \\"patience is a virtue,\\" this was one of those reasons to take her on her word!<br />  Writer/Producer/Director Cameron Crowe presents \\"Almost Famous\\" in it's original incarnation titled: \\"Untitled!\\"  Yes, you heard right.  Crowe finally had the chance to insert the sequences that explained more of his characters, gave him a better piece of mind, and probably told things that wouldn't be understood by the audience (the film originally ran 2 hours long, and the 35 minutes that appear in \\"Untitiled\\" would probably make some squrim out of boredom in their seats).<br />  For those not sure of the film, here's the summary:  William Miller is a young man trapped in a family with an overbearing mother and her hope that one day, he will become a great lawyer.  But in actuality, William loves Rock and Roll, and he uses his love of music to write reviews and reports for several local and underground papers.  One day, Rolling Stone magazine gets ahold of his work, and asks William to do a story for them.  William then takes to the road with the up and coming band called \\"Stillwater,\\" where he meets the lead guitarist Russell Hammond(Billy Crudup), and even the infamous Penny Lane(Kate Hudson), a young girl who's the most enigmatic screen presence you may ever see.<br />  The extras that Crowe includes in this DVD set include audio commentary by himself and (possibly a first for an audio guest) his Mom!  She's very informative, and also helps keep the conversation lively.  There's also a longer cut of a scene featuring the band \\"Still Water,\\" as well as articles Crowe wrote for Rolling Stone in his youth (this film is actually a biopic of his life, with some fiction).  There is also a great interactive scene that requires you to have Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" on audio, CD, Vinyl or any form you can get your hands on it.  Trust me, get a copy of \\"Stairway\\" if you get this DVD set. What it's for is a great scene that was cut because they couldn't get the copyright for the song.<br />  As an added bonus, there is a 6-song CD featuring the music written for the band \\"Stillwater\\" in the film.  Every single song is Excellent!  Not a bad one in the bunch.<br />  The set contains the original cut of the film on Disc 2, which is a great way to compare the cut for the big screen, and the true director's vision.<br />  The film has been known to off-put some people ( almost all my family didn't like it), but for those that like music, nostalgia, and a film that is really unlike what most people create or experience, this is a great set to get.
0716703440|5.0|By size and content, this book ranks as one of the largest in physics . Not only does it give an excellent discussion of all of the concepts in gravitational physics, but it gives clear presentations of the relevant mathematics, not hesitating at all to employ useful diagrams and pictures. Truly a classic, it is a work that is sure to be read by future generations of students in gravitational physics. I can still remember the excitement I felt when picking the book up for the first time. The authors are giants in the field, and it is great that they chose to take the time to write such an excellent book. It is readily apparent that they care a great deal about what the reader will take away after reading such a large book, as the presentation is always crystal clear and a great joy to read.<br />Space prohibits a thorough review, so I will instead highlight the parts of the book that I found particularly exceptional: 1. The example of how coordinate singularities arise: the &quot;cells of the egg crate&quot; squashed to zero volume. 2. The beautiful illustration of the Roll-Krotkov-Dicke experiment. 3. The &quot;physics demo&quot; of a local inertial frame of reference (it is not very difficult to construct this demonstration for actual use in a classroom). 4. The presentation of a 2-form as a honeycomb of tubes with a sense of circulation. Such an explanation is lacking in the general mathematical literature. 5. The flying ring demonstration illustrating Faraday stresses. This demonstration is done very often in physics classes, and is simple to set up. 6. The excellent discussion (with illustrations) of the covariant derivative and the Schild ladder construction. 7. The presentation of parallel transport around a closed curve. 8. The treatment of Riemann normal coordinates. These are typically presented in a purely formal way in most texts on general relativity, ignoring their status as providing a local inertial frame in curved spacetime. 9. The (philosophical) discussion on the principal of general covariance in the context of Newtonian gravity in tensorial form. 10. The illustration, with accompanying discussion, on a situation where two events can be connected by more than one geodesic. The authors mention the relation of this example to the Morse theory of critical points. 11. The discussion of the Bianchi identities and the topological result on the boundary of a boundary being empty. 12. The discussion on the gravity gradiometer. 13. The exceptional discussion on six routes to the Einstein field equation. 14. The variational principle and the initial value problem in the Einstein equation. 15. The connection between the Gauss-Weingarten equations and extrinsic curvature. 16. The ADm formulation of the dynamics of geometry. 17. The discussion on Mach's principle. 18. The radial oscillations of a Newtonian star. 19. The Hamilton-Jacobi description of motion and its employment in analyzing the central force problem. 20. The effect of the value of the cosmological constant on cosmological models and evolution of the universe. 21. The cosmological redshift and its explanation via the expansion of the universe. 22. The mathematics of the Mixmaster cosmology. 23. The dynamics of the Schwarzschild geometry. 24. The discussion on the global properties of spacetime and singularity theorems. 25. The short biographies of Hawking and Penrose. 26. The quadrupole nature of gravitational radiation. 27. The experimental justification of general relativity, particularly the description of Pound-Rebka experiment on the gravitational redshift.discussion on the principal of general covariance in the context of Newtonian gravity in tensorial form. 10.

B000002C1V|5.0|Now that computer terminology has found its way into our daily vernacular, I think that the above metaphor is a quite fitting descriptive.  And when talking about ROGER WATERS, why not use metaphor?  He does....A lot.  The Final Cut is the sonic equivalent of the 'expansion pack', in terms of the fact that - - all foundation for its musical and lyrical themes have already been cemented on it's auspicious predecessor, 'The Wall'. (had to drop some more in, sorry)  This 'third album' of  The Wall, goes on to further probe these common themes, but from an entirely different perspective.  Gone is the character of 'Pink' and his drug-skewed reasoning.  The Teacher returns to us, but in a more amiable and sympathetic form.  The elusive female figure is retained, but absent is the domineering Mother.<br />\\"Would ya like to see - Britannia rule again?\\"  The album is dedicated to Roger's father, Eric Fletcher Waters,  who died during the British invasion of Anzio, Italy during WWII.  The Final Cut is sub-titled, 'A Requiem for the Post-War Dream', meaning that 1. it is a mass for the deceased (his father/the dream) 2.  it is the musical composition for such a mass.  The story is told partly in the first-person and partly from the perspective of a young serviceman returning home from the war.  The veteran hopes to return to a land of social, economic and political change, but his ideals are betrayed by future Prime Ministers and subsequently, by the Thatcher-led government.  (The Maggie that Waters calls out to throughout the piece is most certainly, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher)  The album gives us a brief overview of world affairs during the period of 1945-1983.  Reference or allusion is made to conflicts in the Falklands Islands, Grenada, Beirut and Afghanistan.  Fear of the rising powers of Japan and the U.S.S.R are evidenced in the lyrics, as well as the threat of nuclear proliferation.  <br />This is Waters at his most confident and complex and delivered during hismost prolific songwriting period (Wall through Hitchiking).  Lyrically, the album is brilliant and stands by itself beautifully as a long form poetry piece, even without the music  The vocal phrasing, ambient effects and progressive nature of the music all contribute to create an atmosphere and tone that is reminiscent of, yet distinctly set apart from \\"The Wall\\".  (I believe that some tracks were written during The Wall sessions and 'Your Possible Pasts' actually appears in the 'bathroom stall scene' in movie.)  DAVID GILMOUR'S emotionally gut-wrenching guitar work is still there but muted mostly on this effort.  His distinctive axe work is most evident on the tracks 'Your Possible Pasts', 'Fletcher Memorial' and 'Not Now John', the last one being the only track that he lays vocals on.  His diminished role opens up room for solo piano, hammond organ and some ballsy saxophone which are all integral in making the piece work. The whole album is enhanced further by the addition of the National Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted and arranged by Michael Kamen.<br />\\"Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings, Thought I oughta tear the curtain down.\\"  The Final Cut is one of my favo(u)rite albums of all-time. (and I am familiar with hundreds of 'em)  It's honest, heartfelt delivery strikes a chord with me that few other albums have.  I can still listen to this album regularly, whereas 'The Wall' can only be appreciated after long periods of abstinence.  I won't even touch upon the issue of whether this is really a Pink Floyd album or a Waters Solo effort, except to say, \\"Who Cares?\\"  If Britney Spears wrote this masterpiece, I would be singing her praises instead of Waters'.  The Final Cut is but one beautiful mosaic on the wall of the gallery known as Pink Floyd.
6303823351|5.0|C'mon! It's the Beatles! Never seen this movie? You should! This movie is pure fun - innocent, warm, silly fun. Oh those young men, they were young, rich , and talented. This movie shows them having fun with that in the heyday of their early popularity - playing music, living together, traveling around the world... \\"Help!\\" is a must have for Beatlemaniacs and newcomers. It's just a sweet, fluffy confection for all ages. Plus, John,Paul, George and Ringo were simply being themselves here.  You get a glimpse of what the real boys were like behind the smiles.
6305546789|1.0|Blood and nudity abound in this tasteless thriller, starring Jamie Lee Curtis as a good girl babysitter, whose scanty friends get slaughtered off one by one, by a killer in a mask.<br />All is well, until Miss Curtis' friends, who are babysitting at the neighbors, don't answer her phone calls and she notices all the lights next door are off.  So Miss Curtis heads across the street... From there, things fall apart until they reach an asinine conclusion.<br />The terrifyingly haunting music is the only thing that keeps this show from being a complete waste of time.<br />Despite other opinions, this film DOES deserve its `R' rating, due to its gruesome themes, let alone the violence, language, and semi-clad babysitters.<br />All in all, enjoy \\"Halloween\\" if you must, but PLEASE don't consider it to be a favorite.

B000002GBB|4.0|Pieces of Eight, is the hard rocking follow up to their 1977 heavy metal, prog rock cd, The Grand Illusion. And what a follow up it is, like their previous cd, their is not a bad song on this outing. Most bands, now a days,would crack under the pressure, of having to record a follow up, to a highly successfull cd, and have to do it with in about a year of their last release, and while still touring on their big cd.<BR> Pieces starts off rockin, with The Great White Hope, a song written and sung by JY. This song deals with the success that the band was going thru, and how one minute your on top of the world, and the pressure you under to stay on top.<BR> I'm Okay, is a brillant song by Dennis, with a great organ solo in the middle, love the way the song starts too. But every one of us at one time or another has felt the way this song is singing about, am I really different, is it okay to be this way?<BR> Sing For the Day, a Tommy Shaw song, is very good and is one of four songs of his on this cd. Even though this cd is named after a Dennis song, Tommy is the hero on this one, this is some of his best work, with Renegade, and Blue Collar Man, also on this cd, being two his greatest songs. Aku-Aku, is the ending song, and the weakest on this set.<BR> Queen of Spades, is a rocker, with a good beat. The title track is a haunting number, with a good piano part. The Message a keyboard insturmental, leads into the Lord of the Rings. JY handles vocals on Lords, this is a good song, with good guitar work in it, but JY's vocals are little too whinny in it.<BR> A great cd, from a great band, and one their last albums that seemed like a group effort, instead of indivual efforts. GRADE B+
B00003CXBK|5.0|In ancient times, young warrior Prince Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) fought a demon but got bitten only to get a deadly curse and he is in search to travel the land for a cure. A monk named Jigo (Billy Bob Thorton) travels along with him to a mill-industry driven town lead by Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver) for a new home until he finds out that Eboshi and other warriors are off trying to kill the forest of the ancient wolves, boars and other creatures including a brave female warrior named San a.k.a. Princess Mononoke (Claire Danes) who is one of the protectors of the forest that was raised by wolves. However Ashitaka falls in love with her as he decides to join on her crusade with the wolves and other forest spirits to protect the god of the forest from being destroyed as well as trying to find that cure.<br /><br />Co-starring the voices of Jada Pinkett Smith, Gillian Anderson, Keith David and John Dimaggio this is the ultimate 90's animated masterpiece. This fantasy adventure is from animation auteur Hayao Miyazaki and one of the most original movies ever! I love how it compels the viewer into the complex story with it's dazzling animation and great voice acting even in the dub version. It's PG-13 rated for violent images and some gore but it can still be viewed by the family for it teaches everyone a good message about nature and living in harmony with the world. The score by Joe Hisaishi is magnificent and the film is a unique, imaginative and brilliant work of art that i enjoyed it since it got a US release and saw it in theaters.<br /><br />This DVD contanis both Japanese Language in subtitles version which you can go to the audio selection feature even with the second subtitles as 2 extras like featurette and trailer.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Avatar\\", \\"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds\\", \\"Willow\\", \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\", \\"Ferngully The Last Rainforest\\",\\"Fire and Ice\\", \\"Beowulf\\", \\"The Dark Crystal\\", \\"Conan The Barbarian\\", \\"Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\", \\"Seven Samurai\\", \\"Ran\\", \\"Ninja Scroll\\", \\"Ponyo\\", \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\", and \\"Castle in The Sky\\".Scroll\\", \\"Ponyo\\", \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\", and \\"Castle in The Sky\\".

0553277472|5.0|You won't remember every word you read in this book.<br />I know this, because I tried. Pirsig's novel is an autobiographical musing on quality and a study of the reconciliation of technology and man. Every page is frustratingly thoughtful, and I've read it over and over again in order to gleam what I can from it.<br />I won't even begin to delve into the lessons this book provides. That would cheapen the narrator's physical and philosophical journey, and rob you the benefits of a thorough examination.<br />But please, follow the example that Phaedrus provides early on. Step back, and allow yourself to perceive the benefits of the book. While it is certainly complex and requires massive amounts of attention, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance provides excellent insight on both perspective and our personal search for understanding.
0061040967|3.0|Artwork is terrific, except Paul did not recall (as I do) that the Lady has GREEN eyes.  The story is too SHORT and feels very rushed. Carrot is wooden, the Patrician just isn't his ole slithery self. Rincewind is more than ever a self-effacing heroic worm, though.<br />After THE TRUTH, I thought Terry ought to take a break.

B00000ILDE|3.0|The DVD has 17 extra minutes you don't need to see, really. <br />The movie suffers from a explanatory sequence of what happened in the colony, that drains the tension and brakes the rythm of the story. In the original movie we cut from Ripley's deposition to her hand holding a burnt out cigarette at her apartment, then we are off to the colony without knowing what we will find, creating great suspense and a ghost town atmosphere when they arrive.<br />In the new version we are treated to a sequence that has so many flaws it looks like another movie altogether; bad acting, lousy explanatory dialogue, lame \\"modernized\\" costumes (like the ones used on Burke in the rest of the film) we get to know Newt's parents and her little brother, but they're so cartoony you're just glad they die, and then your ears encounter the first of Newt's annoying high-pitched screams, but with the added aggravation of no acting; she just opens her mouth and eyes very wide and howls like a test on your dolby system.<br />They should have kept this sequence as a \\"Deleted scene\\" on the side and not screw-up the movie for you. The rest of the new scenes are not as bad, but they just explain and explain and just cripple the story.<br />The DVD has little else to offer. Unlike the \\"Alien\\" DVD, which has a great commentary by Ridley Scott, \\"Aliens\\" has an old short interview with James Cameron and some home videos of the tests and making of models that are just barely interesting.
0060012331|4.0|Maybe I'm getting TP jaded, but his earlier works are funnier.  This was very good, but pretty much to the point.  Need to keep that blend of humor and drama.
0812548094|2.0|In some ways I found this book to be an improvement over the first in the series.  More time is devoted to character and emotional developement, and while much of it is heavy handed, at least there's an effort.  The plot flows better, and is slightly less predictible.  There are actually a couple subplots.  Unfortunately, Goodkind slipped up here too.  The root of the books problems is Richard.  Before I found him dull.  Now I find him far too perfect.  It's not just physical prowess, though he has that in spades (defeating thirty blademasters without a scratch, yeah right), but his &quot;wisdom&quot;.  When did Richard become Zedd?  And if he knows so much, how can he be so blind to what's happening with Kalahn?  It should have been painfully obvious to anyone, especially when Verna explicitly told him what had happened.  The plot also drags at times, and the second wizzard's rule is worse than the first.  He might as well have said &quot;The road to the underworld is paved with good intentions.&quot;  The ending is rushed, and wrapped up way too neatly and predictably.<br />Oh yeah, and Gratch really got on my nerves.
B0000060NF|5.0|You know there's something completely magical and celestial about the intro to What's Goin On. The voices at a club or neighborhood bar the Hey Man whats happenin- the everythings everythings-the hey man whats your name. If you're like me you wanna be there, not only that- you wanna stay there- God if I could transplant myself to that party hangin with Marvin. And after the voices comes the most magical,innovative horn wails I've ever heard in my life. The first 20 seconds of \\"What's Goin On\\" are totally mind blowing,totally classic. Perhaps I'm reading too much into that intro-the crowd-the wailing horn- Whenever I hear it it's always breathtaking and timeless-it never will become dated-You see for in those voices at the beginning and the wailing horn- I hear the way Black America and America was then and what was down the road-Theres pain also to be read in that intro and laughter and I also hear in that intro or I guess I sense it-that this man was looking over the horizon at a turbulent tragic life and a lot of sorrow to come but on another hand I hear a sexy swagger in those horns that's almost climatic. I tell you what- One night when your'e alone totally clear your mind of everything and kill all the lights or dim them-TAKE THE PHONE OFF THE HOOK- and play What's Goin On. Close your eyes and listen with a completely free mind and maybe-just maybe you'll see what I'm talking about. I wish there were such a party that the intro dictates-Oh how I wish I was there to be able just to say to Marvin \\"hey man what's happenin\\"-it would be one dream I would never want to end for I sense a certain security in that intro also a place where there are no hang ups or stigmas about who you are. I'm completely certain now as I've gotten older that we will-not in this lifetime-hear anything as magical as What's goin On.Also if you're ever lucky enough to be driving around Harlem on a Saturday night and have this song with you play it as you watch the sights of Harlem- The experience is one you will never forget as long as you live.

0553573403|5.0|There's not much to say that hasn't been said. This book, and the rest of the series, is excellently written, plotted and characterized. It's difficult to sumarize the plot, but, for the sake of er, something, I'll make the attempt. As the book begins Lord Jon Arryn, Hand of the King (similar to the royal Chanceller), and foster father to King Robert Baratheon and Lord Eddard Stark has died of a mysterious \\"sickness\\". Not surprisingly, Robert asks Eddard, his oldest friend to take the position. Eddard wants nothing to do with it, but Jon's widow, Eddard's sister-in-law, sends a letter saying that Jon was murdered by the Queen and her family. Eddard has long distrusted the Lannisters for refusing to take part in Robert's rebellion 14 years earlier until the ruling Targaryens were all but defeated. Eddard belives that the Lannisters hoped to take the throne before Robert could, and he deplores the treachorous methods they used to capture the capial city of King's Landing. After recieving the letter, Eddard realizes he has no choice but to accept Robert's offer, and uncover the plot. However, just before leaving, Eddard's young son Bran suffers a fall that leaves him comatose. Soon after an assassin is sent to Bran's tower, and though Bran is saved, his mother Catelyn realizes that his fall was no accident. Is it connected to Jon's death? Of course. But Eddard and his wife must piece together the evidence- a book, a brothel, a smithy and a dagger- and discover the truth Jon Arryn died for.<br />And that's barely even scratching the suface.  There are tons of subplotsand paralell storylines, told from eight different points of view.  With this structure, you'd expect the pacing to be choppy, but Martin eases you into it, starting with all the characters in one place (except for one) and slowly speading them out.  This book is actually the most even of the three that have been written, as most of it revolves around Eddard, even the story of Danaerys, which has it's own separate plot, is mainly there to show some of the events that affect the main plot.  She gets more in later books, though.  The aspect of this book that really distinguishes it, however, is it's chacters.  The multiple POV's allow for deep emotional development of many characters.  Some characters are developed more than others, and some are more likable than others, but they're all very well done.  In conclusion, unless you don't like political intruige, buy this book.eparate plot, is mainly there to show some of the events that affect the main plot.  She gets more in later books, though.

076790382X|5.0|I've never been much of a travel book reader, but I was drawn to this book after meeting my American wife. It's a truly entertaining read, both as a whole and in short burts.<BR>As a British person living in the US I can confirm that a lot of what is said in this book is very true. The chapters on the INS, the American sense of humour, and American television especially struck chords. You can also tell that as much as he critises the US, he also loves the place. In that respect it works as an excellent companion to his best book,&quot;Notes From A Small Island&quot;. A book where he points out the pros &amp; cons of modern day Britain, while clearly still being in love with the place.
B00005RHGK|2.0|okay???? I think this movie probably deserves 2 1/2 *'s if THAT many I mean the actors were really good! But their characters were the STUPIDEST people I ever seen I mean I never used the word stupidest but I think if any this is the best time to use it. The first few minutes the two kids are driving home and everything starts off pretty good. Their characters were pretty interesting y'know. But THEN this big ugly monster truck (with the license plate that says &quot;beatingu&quot;) tries to run them over. At this point Im kinda laughing at their reactions. So the truck finally leaves after driving them into a field. A little after they start to drive again. SO while their driving they spot the truck beside a creepy lookin house and see some weird guy in a big coat dumping bodies in a pipe. AFTER they intelligently pass, it is then that Darry starts suggesting that they go back. Now at this point Im thinking okay this guy has obviously developed some brain disorders after their little truck incident from earlier! I mean c'mon if you seen this guy in a coat STUFFING these bodies into a PIPE and these bodies are completely wrapped in sheets NOT to mention drenched with blood stains, would it ever cross your mind that they might still be alive???? I think not, NOT if you had some sense. BUT somehow this Darry person convinces his sister that their only going to take a look....Yea right. Well they go to this pipe thing ----fast forward----- Well he ends up in the dang pipe of course.Now Im thinking that the sister will now go get help BUT instead shes waiting out on the road in front of this crazy mans house to flag down a car. Well you know where Im going with this to make this long version short basically this monster guy shape thing chases them all through the night. This movie definately had me aggravated ALL the way through. I mean this movie definately had the typical stupid horror movie teens in it.But it deserves 2 1/2 stars.I give one star for the actors who did a great job although for the WRONG movie. I give one star for the old lady they come across in the middle of the movie. Now SHE definately had the most sense out of all. And when she grabbed that shotgun I laughed so hard I almost cried I mean it was hysterical. And finally I give 1/2 stars to the moviue itself because no matter how STUPID the characters came to be,this movie really had the feel of a HORROR movie. I mean it's the kind to give you nightmares for weeks...well more on the lines of days! But have you ever seen a movie that you just wanted to jump in kill the characters and save the villian some troube well this is definately one of those!
B00000IAU3|5.0|A friend told me about Dido. I am not all that much into this kind of music but each song was so smooth and relaxing. I liked it so much I went and bought it for myself! I truly enjoy this cd and recommend everyone to buy it for their collection; you won't be disappointed.
0446608955|5.0|Ok let me get straight to it! This book was AWESOME! I do not like to read books and when I started reading it I could not stop! Nicholas Sparks is a fantastic author and his books are fantastic too! You can learn so much from this book! It teaches you how not to judge people by the way they look, you really need to get to know them! Take Jamie Sullivan (i can't spell) noone would talk to her because she was uncool! All they needed to do was give her a chance! I think EVERYONE needs to read this book! It it awesome and you will learn alot from it:)
B000059POY|4.0|For those who appreciate commercial cinema at its worst, the is a 4-star keeper.  I was one of the few people who saw and enjoyed Candy in 1968, given its brief time in the theaters.  It was a strange movie then and now, with older eyes, it is simply a truly bad movie ... one of the many such bombs essential to a collection of that special genre: Plan 9 from Outer Space, Putney Swope, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, Rocky Horror - to name a few.  As a special twist, it is unmercifully long.
B00005R2M3|3.0|Laundry Service shows Shakira's incredible songwriting talent, and I was amazed at how quickly she has mastered English to the point of writing her own lyrics in English.  In my opinion, the best songs on the album are &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; and its Spanish equal &quot;Suerte&quot; along with &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; and &quot;The One&quot;.  I think the unique qualities of her voice and her singing are most evident on these songs.  But I wouldn't say this is Shakira's best album, which is made even more clear when you listen to previous successes like Dnde estn los ladrones.  However, Shakira has made a bold move into the English-language market and I think that Laundry Service is a great first step which shows off her personality, style, and her extraordinary skill.
B000006YMP|3.0|I'm a big fan of ABBA and the vocal harmonies of the two women, and also the big &quot;after-career&quot; that NYC DJ Susan Morabito has created for Agnetha with this particular sweet title song, but  none of these other tracks warrant listening to.  HOWEVER:  I encourage everyone to own the title song if they can get it as a single and please support all the ABBA remixes and variations available...I have dozens of albums, you should, too!
B000025RAU|5.0|\\"Chinatown\\" arguably represents Jack Nicholson at his very best in his most enduring role, despite not having received an Oscar for his effort.  Fortunately Robert Towne netted an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in what film experts consider one of the greatest scenarios ever written.  Screenwriting guru Syd Field has used the Towne script as a working model for a generation as a teaching guide.<br />The muted photography of cinematographer John A. Alonzo along with the neatly selected settings reveal Los Angeles in 1937.  Jack Gittes is a Los Angeles detective initially used as a fall guy in a battle for water rights.  The longer Nicholson as Gittes investigates, the more convinced he becomes that the man behind the skullduggery, which ultimately results in the murder of Horace Mulwray, the honest head of the Department of Water and Power who does not want to build a new dam and risk a tragedy such as the earlier described Van Lipp disaster, is super wealthy Noah Cross, played by John Huston.<br />Gittes is a man used to dealing with criminal minds less powerful and less ruthless than Cross.  As Robert Towne noted in an interview about the film, a major element of \\"Chinatown\\" is the shocking realization on the part of Nicholson, who had formerly worked as a police officer assigned to Chinatown, that John Huston as Noah Cross is a man who will do anything to get what he wants, and is more ruthless than anyone he ever encountered.  When an exasperated Gittes asks Cross at one point what he can possibly gain through a big land payoff predicated on accessibility to water, noting that he could buy anything he wanted presently, Cross answers, \\"The future, Mr. Gittes, the future.\\"<br />Towne shrewdly used a historical controversy from Los Angeles history, the career of William Mulholland and the tragedy of the Van Norman Dam.  History was juxtaposed and the controversy was moved from the first decade of the twentieth century to 1937.  It made good sense cinematically since the city was so much more developed by that time.<br />Another integral element of the film is Nicholson's developing romantic relationship with Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray, widow of the slain water chief and daughter of Noah Cross.  Gittes'  romantic progress is slowed by the manner in which he holds Evelyn, an erudite, sophisticated woman in awe, someone removed from his own rough and tumble middle class world.  He ultimately learns that the daughter toward whom Evelyn is so protective was sired by none other than Noah Cross.<br />In addition to adroitly directing the film, maintaining a consistently brisk pace, Roman Polanski also had a small but key acting role.  Playing one of Cross' thugs, he tells Gittes, \\"You've got a big nose, kitty cat.\\"  To prove his point, while another Cross hoodlum, a crooked ex-sheriff, holds Gittes, Polanski snips off part of the detective's nose with a knife.
0316776963|4.0|David Sedaris' Me Talk Pretty One Day is a very amusing collection of essays that I enjoyed, so long as I read them one or two at a time.  I personally found, after reading more than that, that Sedaris's narcissism started getting on my nerves.  That being said, these essays are very amusing, some more than others of course.  A good portion of them concern his move to France, although many focus on his family.  Sedaris story telling style relies heavily on the humorous exaggeration, and for the most part it works.  Again though, after too many essays, it may grate on your nerves.  This book is a fun read, definitely nontaxing (for instance, I was easily able to read these essays in a moving car (I wasn't driving)).  Enjoy.
006016848X|4.0|John Gray is a genius!  This is the ultimate handbook that reveals the secrets of how a man's and a woman's mind truly works. Gray clearly explains how men and woman's meathods of communication are so different. It is up to the reader to understand the differences and utilize the information Gray gives to improve thier relationships with the opposite sex. I personally enjoyed the illustration of men going into their caves to solve their problems.  It helped me to understand that men need to solve their problems on their own.
B000059MEK|4.0|Daft Punk deserves some props. They just walked out onto the club stage with leather jackets, pink shirts, skinny ties, painted-on jeans, and spiked hair. Five years ago, this would be music that could get the person who made it BEAT UP. The two Frenchmen have boldly left behind their fresh, smooth, quirky and very late-90's sound to try and singlehandedly start a prog-disco revolution. It takes guts. Yes, it takes some serious balls to go on that stage and sing a cheesy 80's love song through a vocoder totally sincerely. Maybe that's why they always wear disguises.<br />The first song loops a brass sample over and over again, and someone named Romanthony sings with his vocoded voice, &quot;One more time, we're gonna celebrate, oh yeah, alright, don't stop the dancing... Music's got me feelin' so free, we're gonna celebrate, celebrate and dance so free...&quot; This goes on for five minutes, save for a 'chill-out' section in the middle of the song. When you really look at this song, it's junk. Absolutely. But in the greater scheme of things, in the album and in culture in general, it makes much more sense. &quot;Aerodynamics&quot; starts without warning when a vocoded guitar plays something right out of the Les Rhythmes Digitales catalog. A Guns N' Roses guitar solo makes this song some of the most rocking cheese I've ever seen. Some amazing synthed clarinets round it out.<br />Then, of course, there's &quot;Digital Love.&quot; If you've seen the Gap commercial this was featured in, I bet you remember it. Juliette Lewis danced enticingly while two guys, dressed as a cross between astronauts and race car drivers, did their best robot dance. It turned out they were the real Daft Punkers. The main sample in this song comes from a after-school special video, to give you an idea of where these guys are coming from. The vocoded lyrics could not get cheesier: &quot;Last night I had a dream about you / In these dreams, I'm dancing up beside you / And it looked like everyonewas having fun / The kind of feeling, I waited so long.&quot; But it might as well be the voice of true love singing. How anyone could not like this song is beyond me.<br />Then there's &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,&quot; another song I first heard in a commercial, this time for a Palm Pilot or something. I didn't even know it was Daft Punk at the time, but being so concerned with sound, this commercial caught my ear more than any other. It gives the impression of quirky machines with personalities assembling Intel processors. Very fun. &quot;Crescendolls&quot; takes us right into the club with Daft Punk providing the beat and an always rising melody, while the crowd shouts tons of &quot;Hey! Everybody y'all&quot;s to give the song some lyrics. Pretty much free of irony, it harkens back to the Homework days.<br />Sadly, Daft Punk can't &quot;celebrate and dance so free&quot; forever, and the album has a problem with lull, although the entries are varied enough to keep it interesting. &quot;Nightvision&quot; is little more than a smooth ambient groove. &quot;High Life&quot; is a extremely repetitive, yet still enjoyable, disco sample. &quot;Voyager&quot; brings us back to present day with something that's so clearly rave-influenced, that it's a little refreshing. &quot;Short Circuit&quot; is another Les Rythmes Digitales rockout number. I think Daft Punk have found their brothers in quirky electronic new wave rock.<br />This is a record that grows on you. At first listen, many people were repelled by the gaudy sound. Elitists had even come to accept a lot previously dismissed genres from the past coming back, but this was just too much for them. But even the biggest elitists, I won't name them, but I know a few, eventually came around to this record. Heck, I only came to my sense once Daft Punk were dancing as robots with Juliette Lewis.
0688156819|5.0|I used Tim Burton's book to kick off a poetry unit in my 9th grade English class. The kids were so into it! Many of them thanked me for bringing it in. About a dozen of them bought the book that night. I still am waiting to see if parents are going to freak out about some of the content (Robot Boy). All I know is that it was a very positive experience for the students. Many of the kids were never into poetry before, and now they love it.
B00005OLY5|5.0|\\"Hello everybody, we have arrived!!\\"  It's about time they released this for us to buy!!  I have been looking for this for years in regular video shops & used bins, but haven't had any luck!!  I saw this soon after it was first released on video around 1989.  I wasn't much of a fantasy fan then, but then again as a pre-teen, I'm not sure what my favorite kind of movies were.  I was reluctant in seeing it, but my best-friend made me watch it....& I'm so glad she did!!  It immediately joined our list of movies to rotate & watch on the weekends, & shortly we had watched it so much we could quote many parts!!  Even if there had been spells of not watching it for months or even years, we could still quote it & laugh fondly on the parts we loved so much.<br />I particularly enjoyed it because of its mix of humor and fighting & fantasy.  It has a good mix of light & dark moments, funny to serious, sentimental to non-sentimental, the list goes on.  Many fantasy movies are great, but prefering comedy over most types of movies, this combination of moods & elements works best for me.  No doubt, the technology has certainly come along since this movie was made, especially after seeing 'Lord of the Rings' recently, but it served its purpose at the time.<br />I'll save you the plot summary [...].  The characters are memorable, & if you ask me, a little more realistic in ways than on many other adventure movies I've seen where the characters hardly say a word.  The bickering between Willow & Madmartigan & the Brownies & Razelle has a mix of humor (esp. with the hilarious brownies, \\"I stole the baby!!\\"), sarcasm (\\"You're a great sorcerer...& I'm the king of Kashmere\\"), & realism to remind you that they are human & not just blindly tugging along on the long journey.  The queen Bavmorda plays the typical bad guy out to destroy the baby, & a relative even remarked how similar she looks to the queen on Snow White.<br />[...].  Great to watch with kids because there are hardly any uncomfortable moments, esp. if they've been exposed to other types of movies with more of an SLV nature.  The swearing is pretty minimal, hardly sexually suggestive at all, & it just mostly has some violence, which isn't that gory either.  Do yourself a favor & get this movie to watch over & over!!omfortable moments, esp. if they've been exposed to other types of movies with more of an SLV nature.

6304696558|3.0|This 1980s feminist fable is about the pampered and weak JAP (Jewish-American Princess) Judy Benjamin, who wants nothing more than to be married to a rich and successful man and be able to spend lots of money.  She has been cared for by men for her entire life and has no skills, independence, or serious ambitions.  After she is widowed, she falls for a recruiter's sales pitch and joins the Army, believing that it will be like going to a spa and will help her recover from the emotional blow of her husband's death.  There is great comic potential here, but the movie lacks the sort of sharp writing that would have taken it to the next level.  Nonetheless, it obviously strikes a cord with many viewers.<br />The first half of this film is inoffensive, sitcom-grade material.  (In fact, a sitcom based on the film ran from 1981 to 1983.)  Goldie Hawn's alternately cutesy/whiny act during basic training gets tiring quickly -- she's like a child who keeps begging for our attention -- and the film rarely manages to capitalize on the comic potential of the situations.  Still, it does set up well how her parents' visit to the Army base reminds her of their degrading treatment of her, making her resolve to be the best soldier possible.  We cheer for her to succeed.  She does, of course, becoming a strong and independent woman in the Army.<br />The second, more serious half of the movie is somewhat more satisfying, as we watch Private Benjamin fight not to let her new French beau Henri bully her into reverting to her shallow, weak, pre-Army self.  Her romance with the despicable Henri is the most interesting part of the film, in part because Arman Assante plays his part so well: charming but condescending and unfaithful.<br />The picture quality on the DVD is average for a film from 1980.  The DVD includes the trailer and short biographies of the major actors.  The film is captioned in several languages and can be heard with French dubbing.  It does not include a widescreen version, just pan-and-scan.
6300270696|5.0|Unlike Lord of the Rings' tediously disjointed and noisy action sequences written solely for the sake of action, Ladyhawke tells a story that is both a captivating and poignant romance as well as an action adventure. The other reviews are excellent and accurate, except that I rather liked the music. I rarely like even a good movie well enough to want to see it twice, but Ladyhawke is is one of those exceptions. I ordered a DVD after viewing the VHS version to avoid the deterioration problem. I would advise viewing the movie with the brightness turned up because it is somewhat too dark in places. Also, I enjoyed it more with the written dialog, as I found the softer passages a bit difficult to hear.  The story is a creative and unique work of cinematic art and will hold your interest from beginning to end. I'm probably not as sophisticated as some of the more astute viewers because it is one of my favorite movies. To me the casting, filming, script, and acting are first rate.  The story is an adaptation of an actual old medieval legend. This movie is good when viewed alone, but it is even better when shared with a loved one. In spite of being a chick flick and a powerful love story, it is also loaded with action and you'll not be disappointed with the ending.
0784011796|4.0|This is an intense film with a superb visual and aural style.  The black and white photography, the music, the lighting and editing, and the claustrophobic cinemaphotography all are outstanding. And when the director wants to show you what it's like to have an epileptic fit (or something of that nature), you'll almost feel as bad as the movie character Max.<br />That said, I found the script to be engrossing but ultimately pretentious. It promises an intellectual reward that it can't deliver. The script owes more to numerology than mathematics, and the numeral hokum deflates the film's intellectual posturing. Still, Pi is an interesting portrait of a troubled soul.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie so I couldn't wait for the DVD version to come out.  And oh boy, I was in for a treat.<br />I couldn't help seeing the movie over and over again.  It's about this young poet who falls in love with a courtesan of the Moulin Rouge.  Ewan MacGregor, as the poet, really did a great job in portraying this character.  He has such a wonderful voice that even I fell in love with him, as did Nicole Kidman who played the courtesan.  Nicole Kidman also did a fantastic job.  I couldn't believe she had a great voice (go figure!).  The whole cast was perfect.  The direction, the cinematography, the choreography, the costumes were also all spectacular.  As Ewan MacGregor stated, \\"it's really a feast for the eyes!\\"  Bazz Luhrmann, the director, producer and co-writer, really did an amazing piece of work.  <br />The 2nd disc also had the dances that weren't fully featured in the film.  I really love the choreography and it was good that they were able to put it in.  In addition to the extended version, you are able to see it at different angles of the camera.  So you get to fully enjoy the twists and turns of the tango and the cancan.  <br />This is really a wonderful movie.  I know some people didn't think that it was any good but if they could just be open-minded I know they'll change their minds.
B00000ING2|5.0|Though certainly not the best Coen brothers movie, \\"Hudsucker\\"  is my personal favorite if only for the \\"aw shucks, ma'am\\" innocence of Robbins' character.  Terrific performances from everyone in the cast - Tim Robbins as the wide-eyed optimist with a dream (\\"You know...for kids!\\"), Paul Newman, as the irascible, single-minded corporate tiger, Jennifer Jason-Leigh as the fast-talking \\"career gal\\" reporter, John Mahoney as her even faster-talking editor (their scenes together, among others, bring to mind another great newsroom comedy, \\"His Girl Friday\\"), Jim True as the elevator boy straight out of a Bugs Bunny cartoon, and Bill Cobbs as the wise old seer who sees all but says little.  Even cameos delight in flash performances from Peter Gallagher as the Dean Martin-ish 'Vic Tenetta', crooning to adoring fans with drink in hand, to Anna Nicole Smith (yes, THAT Anna Nicole Smith) as sex kitten Za-Za.  \\"Evil Dead\\" Director Sam Raimi makes an appearance in the brainstorming scene, but you'll only see his silhouette and hear his voice, and ED star Bruce Campbell gets his share of beatings from Leigh as her charming, but sexist newspaper buddy Smitty.<br />Almost everything about this movie will make you smile or laugh, but the real star of the movie is the dialog, a throwback to the good old days of screwball comedies when smart and confident writing and delivery was a must.  The DVD is good quality, but doesn't have any of the extra stuff - the Coens are obviously movie lovers who've  been influenced by many different genres and styles, so an audio track from them would've been perfect - but you can't have everything.  All in all, a delightful, lyrical morality tale that will whet your appetite for more Coen fare - and with gems out there like \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\", \\"Fargo\\", \\"The Big Lebowski\\", \\"Raising Arizona\\" and \\"Blood Simple\\", you won't have far to look.
B00004RFFI|5.0|Great movie that will not lose it's viewing appeal with age. The terror of a tornado is felt as well as the human bonds of the researchers studying this monster of a storm.<BR>The emotions are also obvious of the young girl that witnessed the loss of her father to a catagory 5 twister, and these emotions follow her into adulthood.<BR>This movie is extremely entertaining, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and it's also very educational towards the understanding of the technology and formation of tornadoes.<BR>I highly recommend owning this movie or at least watching it.<BR>It's great.

B000002KDS|5.0|The original ALICE COOPER GROUP hit their peak on KILLER. Cut by<br />cut, this is their most solid and adventurous album! There's not<br />one bad cut and a number of great ones! The production is state<br />of the art; 30 years on the album still sounds great and not even<br />the tiniest bit dated!!!The album starts off with UNDER MY WHEELS<br />, a 50's-ish rock and roller and heads right into one of MICHAEL<br />BRUCE'S catchiest songs BE MY LOVER. It's a very likeable song,<br />with a very simple guitar riff that anyone could play.<br />  Next up is my all time favorite ALICE COOPER song, the pro-<br />gressive hard rocker HALO OF FLIES! Everything about this song is<br />great,from ALICE'S vocals(love the way he throws in the melody<br />from MY FAVORITE THINGS!), to the Moog synthesizer, to the guitar<br />playing, to the drums and bass guitar. This song also has the<br />best drum solo of all time; NEIL SMITH doesn't play very fast,<br />but what he plays is very interesting! It's like a song within a<br />song and may be the catchiest drum solo ever!DESPERADO, written<br />about JIM MORRISON has another great vocal by ALICE and also has<br />some very fitting string arrangements. It's probably the most<br />melodic and laid back song on the album( or the only one!)<br />  THE best of the rest is without a doubt the progressive rocker<br />DEAD BABIES, one of A.C'S best songs and their most misunderstood<br />song, no doubt helped by A.C'S on stage presentation of the song!<br />The opening bass line is very haunting and the middle of the<br />song has a very dangerous heavy metal guitar riff. Like HALO, the<br />song has alot of interesting parts to it, yet the song has a cer-<br />tain flow to it. The weakest song is probably YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,<br />even tho' it has a terrific instrumental break in it.<br /> A GREAT ALBUM and one of the best hard rock/heavy metal albums<br />of the 70's!!
B00002E224|4.0|I am just freshly back (last night) from watching this DVD so I have had a little time to think about what to say. First, I would definitely not recommend this film for everyone who likes good movies or even just good romantic movies; this will help to explain why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars like most people here. I'll do my best to keep this review &quot;spoiler-free&quot; but I make no promises. This film is extremely wordy, if the settings weren't quite so key it might make an excellent play. I think the director was aiming towards a sort of cinema verite here as we do get to spend an awful lot of time, sometimes with some rather mundane activities and dialogue, with this young couple. All in all it is an interesting and enjoyable experiment but I did find myself a little frustrated with the pacing in the last half of the film. Again, I think it was paced this way on purpose, to give you a sense of the strangeness, the lengthening (or for some, shortening) of time in situations like these. Linklater the director is no dummy and will always remain a cinema God in a way for me for his Slackers (see this one for sure) and he takes a bold idea and makes it work here where so many other directors would surely fail. I suppose I could end by saying that if you liked The English Patient you will like this film also as they both take a good amount of patience to enjoy fully. One thing that did bug me, and it is of course just a personal gripe, but Ethan Hawke has (had?) the most annoying habit of sneering, well, raising one side of his mouth when he smiled - drove me up the wall after a while. Nonetheless the acting was great, very believable.
B00000IPAX|3.0|Certainly not on the level of Dude Ranch (or Cheshire Cat, for that matter) but the songs are catchy and it's good for driving. If you only know Blink from the radio, you'll probably like this one. If you've been with them from the beginning, you'll probably think it's a little too pop and not enough punk. Blink has always been bubblegum punk, but they may be approaching the point of no return. All-in-all, I'd say it's worth buying used.
0679416781|4.0|A strange book, this novel. I read it twice in the space of a few years. On my first reading I was mesmerised by Ondaatje's beautifully suggestive prose and the ravishing exoticism of its characters and locations: the Lybian Desert, pre-war Cairo, war-torn Tuscany, ... But on my second reading I fell through the author's magical web of seduction into a great void. The magnificence of Count Almasy turned out to be a vapid pose of a would-be 'universal man'; Kip, the 'war saint', crumbled and became hardly more than a dexterous clown; Caravaggio, the thief, is a poor bugger rumaging the site for dope. And the nurse, well, she just kind of dissolved into thin air. Despite the frantic gesturing, there is nothing that ties these four characters to the earth. Their relationships are static, transitory, ephemeral and remain unexplained. The novel teems with fleeting simulacra: Herodotus' Histories (why not Coupland's Microserfs?), the Giotto frescos, the Tuscan landscape, and many more minutiae of Italian folklore. And of course there is the grand, magnificent desert, that primeval, mystical landscape that suddenly turns into a cardboard background for a cheap film. Think of it, at what point in the book does the desert really become more than a mantra of exotic names? It does, only once, at the very start of the book when the camels, smelling the esoteric aromas emanating from the mysterious healer's phials, are heard shrieking in the distance: a moment of great poetic tension and physical suggestiveness! But otherwise, nowhere we get into the thick of it, as we do in Bowles' Sheltering Sky or Patrick White's Voss. For my part, Ondaatje could have set his novel  in the Borneo jungle or amidst the glistening peaks of the Hindu Kush to similar effect. Finally, there is the war, this violent conflict which is most emphatically present when it is absent, as in the epic scene towards the end of the book where the city of Naples is turned into a ghost city for just a few hours. Ondaatje has written a great novel of our times. There is no depth in this book, only surface. But, God, is this surface beautiful!Ondaatje has written a great novel of our times.

B00005MP58|5.0|I can't remember ever enjoying a mini-series as much as I enjoyed this one. It is a flawless production with a brilliant cast that you will grow to love every time you watch it. Jennifer Ehle is marvelous as Lizzie as is the rest of the cast. I was excessively diverted.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|This was the cd that made Madonna famous!  It includes her first number one hit from November 1984, Like A Virgin...  However, some people get confused about Material Girl... Yes, it was a very good song, but it only hit #2 on the Billboard charts in February of 1985... Some people say it was #1, but it was not.<br />After Material girl was released she had another #1 single in March of 1985, which was Crazy For You... But that song first appeared on the Vision Quest soundtrack, not on the &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; cd.  Crazy For You also appears on the &quot;Something To Remember&quot; cd, and also the &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot; cd.<br />Then in May and August of 1985, the songs &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Dress You Up&quot; were released respectively... They both hit #5 on the Billboard charts.<br />With all these hits on one cd, everyone from now and in the future will enjoy this cd.
0553138758|2.0|Wow... where to begin. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of books I've started but not finished. It's just not something I do. However, I quit on this book about half-way through. Some of the reasons were the author's fault; no doubt some were mine. I don't know that I was fully prepared for what this book ultimately is... a deep, drenching immersion into philosophy, metaphysics, quality of life, and personal self-worth. Writing about those things is a fine and admirable endeavor, but for me reading Pirsig's tortuous and complex prose just didn't work a majority of the time. He would sporadically grab me with a particular line of thought, only to veer off and lose me (interest-wise) for pages on end. I was far more attentive to the cross-country motorcycle trip than I was to his meandering &quot;Chautauqua&quot;. In the end what made me put this book down was that I just wasn't interested enough in the subject matter. So, before you begin this book be sure of what you've undertaken.
B000003TBP|5.0|I happened to catch the show about Beck during VH1's Behind the Music Marathan A-Z (sometime around the end of Dec 2001). I was intrigued, so I bought this cd. It is now my favorite in my cd collection with track #2, Hotwax, as my very favorite. Now my best friend and my sister want to buy it. The man is extremely talented as an artist. I love eclectic (that's why I also like the cd, Play, by Moby. I also saw him on Behind the Music.).

More of the same low budget horror with great gory FX and some jokes added in for fun. Some great monster FX. Very original.  The DVD is great to watch with the actor's commentary. It sounds like they had a great time making the movie. If you like fun campy movies and are not an up-tight snob give this one a chance. Its good clean...well bloody fun. Oh and a bonus, it has that hot Italian girl from the first Austin Powers movie.
B00005QIPH|4.0|The Strokes are a mix of old Stereolab, old Wire, old VU, old Stooges, and (a bit of) old Television---combined quite well and with flair. It's not anything groundbreaking or brand-new, by any means. But if you love the above-mentioned bands, as I do, it'll be extremely hard to resist the charms of this CD. One can play spot-the-influence all day long, but the real question is: Does this stuff, well, rock? Yup, it sure does. Dig it.

B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams always was and forever will be my favorite composer!  His work in this movie was wonderful in many ways.  My favorite track would have to be the Quidditch Match, with it's fast paces excitement shown through the strings, woodwinds, and even at one point, the low brasses.  Throughout the piece, it kept the key themes playing here and there, which is what I love about Williams's music.  I also enjoyed Voldemort's Theme.  Through the 3 note theme, it sounds like an eerie voice whispering, &quot;Vol-De-Mort&quot; but, that's just me.  I like the low brass part of Voldemort's theme, also.  It shows that Voldemort is hated and disgusted by all magic folk.  Williams is, without a doubt, a genius in magical/fantasy movies, and he always will be.  The only fault I found was the theme first heard in the PROLOGUE.  It's VERY similar to that of HOOK, but it's not a very big fault.  It like to be able to say, &quot;That's a Williams theme.&quot;  He may not be here to compose the entire series of Harry Potter, but I'll enjoy every musical sequel he creates!
6302799066|5.0|This film is a work of comic genius released two years just after the Cuban missile crisis, the nearest thing the planet ever got to reaching man-made Armageddon. It has all the trappings of a serious political message and was not considered funny at all during its early years of release. If you are a serious movie watcher (and even if you're not) and you enjoy the best in comedy, drama, thought games and satire -- this is a film for you. There are so many moments that are a sheer pleasure to watch and remember. This film has all: excellent acting, directing, camerawork, editing, scriptwriting...you name it. This is a truly delightful film...<br />This is a scenario in which a US Air Force base commander goes off his rocker  and orders a squadron of B-52 bombers to attack the Soviet Union. After a series of accidents, it then becomes impossible for the Pentagon to recall one of the bombers. In a hilarious scene, the American President (played by Sellers as Prez. Muffley) telephones  the Soviet Premier on the \\"hot line\\". The premier then informs the president  that the \\"doomsday machine\\" will now auto-launch a massive retaliation against the United States, while General Buck Turgidson (played by Scott) reflects by saying, \\"Gee, I wish we had one of them Doomsday Machines\\".<br />Ideas of a Doomsday Machine had actually been raised by Rand Corporation theorist Hermann Kahn, where he said that it would be technicaly possible to link a giant computer to thousands of H-bombs. If the Soviets launched a surprise attack, he said,<br />the computer could go to war and fire off the bombs automatically. Kahn, a theoretical nuclear theorist thought that such a machine was an appalling idea but, theoretically a possibility.<br />Aside from the names that will have you in stitches, this film gives a sense of the insanity of nuclear war and the Cold War -- of MAD (Mutual Assured Destruction)-- and if we can somewhat disregard the artificial visual effects of flying B-52 bombers (Kubrick has no choice; the Air Force would not give him any support or cooperation, well, for obvious reasons), we may be able to see that in its final form this work harmonizes irony... jingoistic patriotism, subtlety, dark aggression... and above all, humor. In the final sequence, Dr Strangelove rises from his wheelchair in a sudden brainstorm and surprise saying, \\"I have a plan...Mein Fuehrer! I can walk!\\"...and the bombs explode, ending the planet as we know it, and Vera Lynn singing in her soft sultry voice, \\"We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when...\\"<br />Definitely the late Stanley Kubrick's best work, aside from \\"Clockwork Orange\\".rick has no choice; the Air Force would not give him any support or cooperation, well, for obvious reasons), we may be able to see that in its final form this work harmonizes irony... jingoistic patriotism, subtlety, dark aggression... and above all, humor.

B00004SZWB|5.0|At first ,i was fooled by this record,comparing it with his masterworks of the seventies.By listening to it over and over, i went deeper to it,and i really enjoyed it.At that particular time of his career,STEVIE WONDER had nothing to proove;he had already won many GRAMMIES(all deserved),and was a confirmed superstar.This record has STEVIE going back to his roots without disminished what he had already accomplished.When an artist of this stature has made it to the top,it is never easy to continue in the ever changing world of popular music.STEVIE has done so by remaining himself and by creating songs which shows that he cares about this world.All the songs here demonstrates the different sides of the artist in a true display of his melodic gifts.
0767836324|5.0|You must see this movie!  It is a spectacular wonder.  Robin Williams as the slightly neurotic Peter Banning (Pan) gives a fabulous performance.  Julia Roberts is adequate in the role of Tinkerbell.  However, there are two other stars in this movie that steal the show (which is hard to do when Robin Williams is in the movie).  Maggie Smith as Granny Wendy gives an endearing performance.  Even moreso, Dustin Hoffman is Captain James Hook.  There is no one who could have played this role except Dustin Hoffman.  His performance could make you believe that Captain Hook really exists. Under it all, John Williams' score is breathtaking.  Unbelievable movie, performances and score.  Five underrated stars!!!
B00003CXN4|4.0|Traffic is a movie about the reality od drugs, their trade, and other factors in between.  I think the director has done a remarkable job setting tone and mood throughout the three storylines.  he uses different colors and contrasts to depict a certain storyline and to help portray a particular feeling.  For instance, he uses dark blue contrast in i think \\"chicago\\" where mike Douglass daughter has develepoed her drug habit.  Overall, i thought great acting combined with very intelligent, direct filmaking, this movie is a real winner!!  buy the DVD today!
0792833260|5.0|This movie is great for restoring faith in human beings.  Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise each give the performance of a lifetime to generate a whale of a movie.  This is more than entertainment, this is art!!!!
0887307280|4.0|I first bought this book at about the end of 2000.  As I read it, the story of my eventual business failure unfolded.  Through his story-telling style, he pretty much described exactly where I was (at the nine-year point) and foresaw where I would end up.  He was right.  I had to close the doors of my business about eight months later, and it happened for reasons that Mr. Gerber detailed in the book.<br />If I had bought the book and implemented the systems approach to business he suggests about five years sooner, I can see it would have made the difference between failure and success.  I began to implement some of the techniques he writes about, and I could feel the improvement in our operations immediately.  Yes, the book is sort of a marketing tool for his company's business development programs.  And yes, the book is a little bit too wordy or warm and fuzzy for some.  But the author puts enough in this book to help change the basice attitudes about business and point people in the right direction, so that aimless wandering is eliminated, and for that I appreciate his efforts.<br />I would recommend this book for anyone who is thinking about starting a business or who has not hit the point of no return in an existing business.  Sadly, I got it too late for my first business effort.  But I'm sure that the next one will be much better off for having invested the small sum of the purchase price and time to read it.  It changed my thinking, and if you are willing, it will change yours.

039472903X|5.0|... I was VERY impressed with this book. Not only did it have plenty of pictures to base its point, but the author himself is somewhat of a character (that's a good thing!). It makes a very good and interesting read and is hard to put down! I am taking an advertising class this semester and it just so happens that one of our required textbooks is \\"Ogilvy in Advertising\\", so that tells you what a popular and highly-recommended book it is. I highly recommend it to all, especially those with an interest in advertising and/or is in the graphic design field.
0792842499|5.0|Surely, it deserves more than 5 stars. I just love this movie. When I was little, I watched this several times but because I was so young, it had been all mixed up with the 'A few dollars more'.  It's only recently that I got both and now I know which is which. The 'A few dollars more' is another great movie but I think the Good~ is a real masterpiece. It is one if my all time favorite 5 moves (This and 'chinese ghost story I' are always there, while the other three seats tend to be changed frequently).  What can i say more. A masterpiece
0060977493|3.0|Arundhati Roy's book is set in India, and is a family story. The book tells the story of the twins Rahel and Estha. They are two egged, but share mind, and their separation in their childhood is fatal for their lives. The book also tells the story of their divorced mother, their sad uncle, their grandmother and their dominant grand aunt. <BR>The story is a mixed tale of love and beautiy, and of loss and sadness. Roy's writing made me so angry I almost cried, but also some places I had to smile and laugh with the caracthers. Sometimes it was very hard to follow the story, as Roy jumps from past to present and back again without any pattern. Therefore I gave the book a three star, but I really had a hard time deciding if it should get only a two star, or may be a four or five.<BR>This is Roy's first book, and it got the Booker Prize of 1997. A writier we will hopefully hear more from.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland
0441003257|5.0|I had never read a book by Neil Gaiman before reading this one, but then again I *had* read most by Pratchett, whom I had mentally marked as the second-best writer ever, which encouraged me to try this one. I was not disappointed in any regard; Good Omens is as good as nearly any book written by Pratchett alone, with a slightly different style. (This leads to the conclusion that Gaiman must also be good.) If you insist on comparing it to Douglas Adams' books, then you could say it is similar, only better. It is quite amazing how someone could have described a world in which so much of the stuff in the Bible is true but which is still so unlike anything in the horrible Christian fundamentalism. Or it would be amazing if Pratchett was not involved. As it is, this book is entertaining, clever, and extremely funny, the last partially because it tells about the end of the world. (But I am not supposed to tell you about what is in it, rather about why it is good, right?)
0385505833|5.0|I read this book right before Christmas when my own family was caught up in the rush of Christmas. It was very comforting to have something that was humorous and enjoyable to read.  Luther and Nora Krank live in a typical Suburbia. When they decide to skip Christmas to go on a cruise, their neighbors have a fit. Their daughter just went off to Peru in the Peace Corps to help people in the Peruvian mountains, so they see no need of staying at home and spending $6,100 like they did last year at Christmas. But, their daughter calls to say she's coming home for Christmas and they have to get everything ready the day before Christmas. They even get some help from their cranky neighbors (no pun intended). This was my first Grisham book and I plan to read it every year before Christmas. It's a fresh and relaxing read when you need to take some stress off of the holiday season. Read it and I promise you'll enjoy it!
B000002UA0|5.0|\\"Piper At The Gates of Dawn\\" is an enigma to a lot of Pink Floyd fans. They can't understand what all the fuss is about this album. There aren't long, deliberated songs about War with echo drenched guitar solos. Most songs do not &quot;flow&quot; into each other. There aren't polished, glossy performances with pitch perfect vocals. For many, this record is far too ragged and imperfect to be the &quot;great album&quot; it is purported to be.<br />Yet the fans that find this to be one of the greatest, sweetest and well-written albums of all time (certainly of the \\"psychedelic\\" period), find much to love. Each song is a short vignette about Childlike wonder and amusement, whether it be a mediation on bed-time stories (the ridiculously good &quot;Matilda Mother&quot;) or wondrous, fantastical character pieces (more singer/songwriter exercises like &quot;The Gnome&quot; or &quot;The Scarecrow&quot;) Inside this album, especially on the first side, you'll find a more spacey, jam band feel; young, bright musicians working off each other, creating a unique blend of art-noise and proto-punk. <br />Some detractors long for David Gilmour's more polished, on-key solos that are both technically proficient and spacey. The key to Barrett's playing (and part of the album's uniqueness) is that Barrett, to make up for his lack of technical skill, came up with unbelievable sounds, some that were never heard before (or since) on any recording. Just listen to his chaotic fretting on &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; (quite possibly the strongest opening cut of all time), or his Punky freak out on &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;.<br />The album does have its problems. The sound, even with the wonderful remastering job, is a little less then perfect, sounding a tad dated. There is a terrible Roger Waters song, &quot;Take Up thy Stethoscope and Walk&quot;, which is only made passable by the band's crazed jam at the end, and the songs on side two are a little more simplistic then the rich, complex ones on side one (as they were written earlier, when Barrett was 16). They are still good, just not as revelatory as those preceding it. <br />People spoiled by grand, sweeping production values tend to underrate this album because of its roughness. Beneath the layers of dissonant noise lays simply great rock songs played by a band that would never again take the wild uninhibited chances that it did on this album. Waters-Era Pink Floyd fans will not necessarily like or hate this, and any Pink Floyd fan, or indeed any fan of great Rock-N-Roll will find much to love about Piper. <br />For many, Pink Floyd died when Syd became Roger, and for some it just began. However you feel, you should not overlook this masterpiece.
6301640659|2.0|I saw a profile of Al Pacino on the Biography channel recently and those who were close to him said that in the late 1970's Pacino was anxious to make a movie that was uncommercial and controversial. This he succeded in doing with \\"Cruising.\\" Unfortunately, it is not only uncommercial and controversial - it is bad. Somehow I can't get past the idea of Michael Corleone playing a leather daddy - and Pacino's near-afro hairstyle in this movie is but one more of the implausible twists. The gay community was outraged at their portrayal in this film - as well they should be. Gay men are seen as sick, demented, sex-crazed maniacs and Director William Freidkin gives us way too much information, including the hidden meanings of various colored bandana's (I've never wore one at the gym since) and a scene that depicts \\"fisting\\" (ouch!) Al Pacino's performance, given like he is under hypnosis, does'nt help the uninspiring script and I had trouble figuring out \\"who done it.\\" After watching this violent, homophobic mess, I felt dirty and disgusted.
B00005LB50|3.0|I waited with great anticipation for this release. I like much of the music that the Buffalo Sprinfield made. But this box <BR>set falls short. Mainly what you get are short guitar and vocal<BR>tracks only. That's great! But what made this band was<BR>the band playing together. There are no live tracks and so<BR>you don't get any magic that the band produced as a whole. Instead, you get individual tracks. A few from Neil, a few from Steven Stills. They sound great and I love them. But what made<BR>this band was their collective output as a band. And you don't<BR>get that at all from this box set. In short, what you get are<BR>outtakes from the individual composers but no outtakes from the band. <br />I don't think this box set does much to enshrine the Buffalo Sprinfield as the greatest folk/rock band of the mid sixties.
0790729644|1.0|This is probably my favourite movie in my collection, yet it is definitely the worst DVD.  Why?  Where do I start?  Firstly, the box clearly states that there are theatrical trailers - where are they?  There are numerous dark indoor scenes in the movie and there just isn't enough contrast to see the details, even if I turn the contrast all the way up (guess the details just aren't there on the DVD!).  The brighter outdoor scenes look grainy.  This DVD has absolutely no features worthy of mention.  It's just a bunch of text that contains a short bios on each of the 4 leading men, a 1 page production note, 4 movie suggestions (with not even a teaser or DVD cover shot of any of them) and a list of awards that it won.  It also has a pan-scan version on one side but honestly, who buys a DVD to watch in pan-scan???  No director's comments, outtakes, deleted scenes, documentary, photos, interviews, nuthin'.  Surely, a film as significant as this deserves a better treatment.  I am sure the quality of the original print is not like this so it must be the DVD transfer itself.  Could it be due to the DVD's age and the transfer process wasn't as developed back then?  Surely a re-release which amends these issues wouldn't hurt (on 2 discs and a nice leather case please).  Just hope we don't have to wait for the 25th anniversary of the film to see this.  ;)<br />Like I said, best movie in my collection, worst DVD I ever bought, very disappointing.<br />In short, if you love the flick, then you must buy it.  If you are a feature freak and/or an audio/video phile, you must steer (pun intended) clear.<br />Another thing worthy of mention which I don't see in many reviews is the theme music.  The haunting music as the &quot;intemperate disposition&quot; text scrolls up the screen at the end is one of the highlights of the movie for me.
0553712837|4.0|FROM READING PREVIOUS REVIEWS AND LISTENING TO A FRIEND'S RAVING ABOUT THIS BOOK, I THOUGHT I'D GIVE IT A TRY.  WHAT I FOUND TO BE AN INTERESTING PROPOSITION TURNED OUT TO BE A DISHEARTENING MISADVENTURE.  WHILE MR. GRISHAM HAS MOST DEFINITELY ADDRESSED THE MATERIALISTIC SOCIETY IN WHICH WE LIVE, HE HAS ALSO MADE SOME INTERESTING UNDERLYING POINTS, CHIEF OF WHICH, IS THE ESCAPISM THAT WE ALL WANT ON OCCASION, TO PURSUE A DREAM OF A DIFFERENT SORT.<br />I PERSONALLY WAS SADDENED THAT LUTHER'S DREAM DIDN'T GET REALIZED.  I ALSO THOUGHT IT QUITE TRAGIC THAT HIS WIFE COULD NOT SEE THE STATE OF DESPERATION THAT HE WAS IN.  I DIDN'T FIND MUCH HUMOR IN THIS BOOK.  BUT, I DO APPRECIATE THE SELFLESSNESS THAT LUTHER DISPLAYED IN THE END.<br />I CANNOT HELP BUT WONDER IF MR. GRISHAM HAS HIT THE NAIL PERFECTLY ON THE HEAD WITH ALL OF THE UNDERCURRING THEMES.  IT JUST SADDENS ME THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK THIS BOOK HUMOROUS.

0517123207|5.0|I use the book to teach principles of evolution along with SB 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox, both in compliment give the backbone of every aspect to our change and progress. I do recommend this to anyone who has any sort of wonder to our origins, as well as readers who wish a good book to pass the time. I myself do believe that this is one very important book to all humans, this is the icon of the argument of creation. You will find new discovery here that is proven, it does enlighten the novice. I mentioned SB 1 or God as that book takes a modern approach and is comprehensive on the subject of creation as well with evolution winning out. I recommend Karl Mark Maddox to anyone including other teachers.
B00005U122|5.0|This DVD is the missing historical Floydian link. The one that connects Waters tangibly to his understated role in his body of work as Mr Pink Floyd- classic period. Post Syd's cult Floyd and before Gilmour's tribute karoke pop band's successful financial live re-marketing of the classic Floyd back catalogue. Those who bought the audio version of this only get half the story. It is a different experience in this gendre altogether. The visuals are complimentary to the narrative being as it were Waters political concepts of the human condition. Waters work predicted a September 11th type event, Nosty style before the rest. Particularly on Amused To Death tracks featured. Amused To Death being the unloved but critically acclaimed classic cousin of The Wall and DSOM. The human condition surely is chilling as Waters work continually reminds us all- prophet like. Those who dislike hard realism, (with just a dash of fantasy here and there), should steer well clear.<br />However he is human! Meaning in this case that he is no singer! Vocal assistance are rendered by the star studded members of his band.<br />Turns out Shine on You Crazy Diamond is completely in context and here Waters makes it the BIG tribute to that tragic shooting star of early Floyd- Syd Barrett, as was his original inent his co-founding member of the Floyd.<br />Beware of imitations this DVD indicates that Mr Pink Floyd is up for it again, commercially, and one cannot wait for the European Tour and album releases promised this year by him. Now that Dave Gilmour has knocked on the head any future 'new' Floyd product his time for public rehabilation may have come
B000002BQK|1.0|This album was a different sound for Ms. Carey.  She sheds her sweet, innocent sound for a rougher sound.  Unfortunately, she changes too much.  Her album is TOO rough.  Yes, she may have needed a change, but adding too much roughness can be a little bit...well, too much.  Mariah has a wonderful voice, but on this album, she strains it too much.  The good songs are Butterfly, Honey, and My All.  Unfortunately, this album isn't worth the price I paid for it.
B00005MAM2|5.0|There isn't much you can say about Akira Special Edition that hasn't been said above. The animation is fantastic, the music is great and the plot is interesting and easy to follow (which is where most anime films fall down I think). I thoroughly enjoyed watching the re-mastered version of this classic with its crisp picture and crystal clear soundtrack. I would reccomend buying the special edition of Akira to anyone.

B00005KHJM|1.0|You might fall into the trap of thinking this is a great, must-have film by following various links and suggestions, etc., and that it belongs in your collection right with Alfred Hitchcock, Dario Argento, etc.  Hah!<br />The other reviewers are right:  it's not horror, it's not terror, it's really not even art.  This film is a bunch of nonsense with a &quot;hot&quot; ending.<br />IF YOU MUST HAVE IT, I'd buy the single disc because the double version only contains a few extra minutes embedded into the same film.  <br />This is a movie you will surely only watch ONCE.  I don't crave extras, but I do prefer to buy movies that will have a lasting entertainment value; films that I will want to watch again and again.
B00005MP58|5.0|I rented this movie after watching 'Bridget Jones' time upon time. After seeing Helen Fielding's comments on Mark Darcy being directly based upon Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy, I had to give it a viewing. While many of the period pieces I have watched over the years were dry and overacted, this one is a true gem. Upon renting it, I stayed up until 4 a.m. because I could not tear myself away. I have watched it five more times since and currently have the DVD on order so I can magically zap myself to my favorite scenes. Oustanding.<br />All of the characters are beautifully portrayed and the cinematography brilliant. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle take my breath away. I feel like one of the Bennet sisters now. You really MUST buy this movie. You will not be disappointed.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|If classic R`n R seemed like its roots had ultimately dried up, this man gave the term the support it needed through the 90's and onward. He didn't try to change or `progress` the meaning but only put right honor back into its name. Over 70% of the songs included here on disc are great example to what ultimately has kept rock categories from sadly building their own tombstones. With Lenny's accurate combination of both intrinsic guitar and flush verse amplitude, original rock and its authentic pop versions have remained intact. Because Rock And Roll Is Dead (Track #3) to Kravitz could only indicate one thing: the fact he's utilized his talent stronghold while sharing his humble heavenly composure(s) along the way...
B00005RHGL|4.0|(This review is of the Collector's Edition -- the image above may not represent the correct edition)<br />First off, the picture and color in this widescreen presentation is beautiful! And with the DTS sound, each gunshot rings your ears hollow. Director George P. Cosmatos provides a detailed commentary (in which he makes repeated assertions that this movie's depiction of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral is the most accurate one yet filmed) and you can feel his love for this movie and the actors in it.<br />Only drawback -- the extra features included are few and brief enough that they probably could have been included on the first disc. We've all seen 2-disc collector's sets that have hours and hours of bonus goodies, but this TOMBSTONE 2-disc set has a comparatively anemic second disc.<br />This is certainly a fun and exciting movie, but reign in your expectations about the volume of bonus goodies. But if you have a DTS sound system and a good sized TV for the widescreen presentation, you will enjoy it nonetheless.
6305508550|4.0|Good movie and I'm sure most people who work in an office can relate to it.  It is serious and funny at the same time, a rare combination.  Definitely not the average comedy like I thought it would be.  If you're friends with your co-workers, I suggest renting it and watching it with them.  You'll all get a kick out of it.
B00005RHGL|4.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies of all time and I have been waiting for a quality DVD Edition to come out, hopefully with some missing scenes.    The DVD looks and sounds absolutely great;  no complaints about the transfer.   A second disc loaded with extras, including about 30 minutes worth of behind the scenes interviews and the like, also adds to the overall value.   My biggest disappointment is with the so-called 'directors cut' edition of the film.   As far as I can tell, there is roughly four minutes worth of additional scenes added to the movie and off the top of my head, this amounts to four scenes of mixed quality in terms of moving the story along (in particular, a mercifully short scene with Doc Holiday's inebriated solo ranting on the night Morgan and Virgil are shot does absolutely nothing to move along the story and it is obvious why this was cut from the theatrical release).   There are a couple of good scenes added, both of which explain further the demise of the relationship between Wyatt and his wife as well as Doc and Kate the Prostitute.   Here is what really, really bugs me;  when you watch the trailers or commercials for this movie (and the second disk is loaded with them), you can see plain as day that there are at least three other scenes which were shot in some form that are of some interest that never ever made it to this director's cut!   Check it out on the trailers and note:   Kurt Russell and Dana Delaney getting passionate in the woods, Doc helping Wyatt up from the river following the gunfight with Curly Bill and his gang, and Jason Priestley nervously pulling a rifle on somebody.   Where were these scenes on this disk?   All in all, the movie is a must have on DVD and the quality of the transfer as well as the movie itself rates very, very highly.   I just feel somewhat 'had' over the lack of these scenes, which I myself was looking forward to finally seeing.
B000001GXI|4.0|This is a wonderful recording of this opera minus the fact that many of the female cast are well below par.  Evelyn Lear plays the Queen of the Night and in her famous aria in part 2, she sounds more like she is macheeting a parakeet than singing Mozart.  Most of the cast are wonderful, the chorus is wonderful, the orchestra first rate, and the conductor the best.
B00005B4GU|5.0|&quot;More acoustic and song-driven than Kid A?&quot; No, this is not. &quot;Kid B?&quot; No, wrong again. Amnesiac, originally planned to be the second half of Kid A as a double album, was released only 8 months after its predecessor, Kid A. Yorke &amp; Co. have put out another record dedicated to the cold alienation and sociopathy that technology has given society. <BR>     While not exactly the most accesible music available out there, Amnesiac is not as incoherent and esoteric as many claim (and neither was Kid A). Maybe the singles 'Knives Out' and 'Pyramid Song' aren't as catchy as 'Creep' or 'Paranoid Android' but there is definitely some great music going on here. 'I Might Be Wrong' with its blues-rock guitar riff is already on its way to being a Radiohead classic as is the &quot;anti-capitalist rant&quot; (described by the Amazon reviewer) 'Dollars &amp; Cents.' 'Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors' is a complete departure for Radiohead with its extremely heavy bass beat and near-industrial intensity. 'Life In A Glass House' is a definite departure, decked with a 5-piece jazz band in full New Orleans funeral march swing.<BR>     Amnesiac is a very worthy record for Radiohead, and while not worlds different than 'Kid A' has its own defining moments. Definitely  one of 2001's best albums and worthy of your Dollars &amp; Cents.
6305265666|5.0|Ever After has become one of my all time favorite movies.  It's an easy going and relaxing movie complete with beautiful landscapes and costumes. It is suitable for watching over and over again, although it is disapointing that the only special features the DVD has is a theatrical trailer.  Drew Barrymore is delightful and believable as the true cinderella.
6304806426|1.0|I will never see why this garbage is so highly rated. It was a total disappointment as far as I am concerned. It is just another film glorifying adultery. What a superb model for society to follow. The story was long, boring and did not get anywhere. I was thoroughly miserable watching this long, drawn-out indulgence on the part of some director or other. When people make a movie with a definite historical setting, they should aim to be true to the social attitudes and actions of the day - read my review of &quot;Titanic&quot; to see more about what I mean. I don't believe for one moment that the Sikh soldier and the Canadian women would have fallen so easily into a relationship in that era. It may be &quot;beautiful&quot; to some people, but you cannot impose present social conventions and attitudes on a different era and expect it to be believable. This is a sad testement to what the Academy Awards have become. Don't be fooled by the hype - you are in for a really boring film if you watch this.
B00004RF97|5.0|With a cast that includes megastars Cary Grant, James Stewart and Katharine Hepburn a movie can do little wrong.  But it isn't just using big names to draw, the film actually comes through with it's promise to be a delightful romantic/comedy.  Stewart plays a snoopy reporter (ala Rear Window) who is looking for a story.  Hepburn is one of Philadelphia's elite who is about to wed another of the upper-class.  Stewarts only problem is that he can't get near the closed ranks of Hepburns wedding.  This is where Grant comes in. Grant (playing that same ol sly, witty role he always plays but never gets tired) is Hepburns ex-husband who decides to help Stewart get into the clique.  The chemistry between the three potential huge egos couldn't be better.  This one is a perfect one to snuggle up and pop in for a romantic night.
B000001IPL|5.0|This album is honestly amazing. If you like offspring then this will blow you away! One of my favourite albums of all time!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Jimi Hendrix came and went in just a blink of an eye but in that blink he left us with a legacy of greatness.  This CD is as good of a summary of that very legacy as you can fit into 70+ minutes.  You start out with the blasting riffs of Purple haze.  You continue into softer songs like The Wind Cries Mary, crazier diddies like Crosstown Traffic.  You get romantic songs like Little Wing or blues tunes like Red House.  Finally, of course, you end up with the memorable playing of the National Anthem at Woodstock.  Start to finish, top to bottom and inside out this is one of the few CDs that you don't dare skip a song on.
B00005RFAI|1.0|I couldn't have been more disappointed.  Here's a classic case of there only being ONE good song on the entire CD, &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; which was released first.  I wish I would have bought the single instead.  Don't get me wrong... I LOVED her first CD.  I played it to death!  I was holding my breath for her second CD.  I've used 'Missundaztood' as a drink coaster instead.
B00003CXRM|5.0|It is always the first movie I recommend to friends.<br />Great story, theme, subtexts, very funny, wonderful actors (and acting) and most of all, characters you want to spend time watching.<br />Scared away when a movie is said to have \\"a message\\"?  Don't worry, it's so subtle you may not even notice.  It's not like most movies today that beat the audience over the head with it.  \\"O Brother\\" is funny, engaging, exciting, and even a little romantic.  (And, if you enjoy well-told tales, that DO have messages, you'll really enjoy this.  It has lots of foreshadowing, symbolism and depth of meaning.)  So, everybody, put in the DVD, sit back, relax, take your shoes off....
B00005Q66T|4.0|I've been in love with Madonna since 1980, so I'm certainly a huge fan and have seen her in concert (before it cost $5,000 a ticket)... but I was hoping for some new material.  This is a decent collection but one would be better off buying the Immaculate Collection.  At least you'd get 2 more songs, a video, poster, and some postcards... all in a nice box.
B000000W6X|4.0|But then- it's practically impossible to top a perfect release.  Protection is Massive Attack's &quot;texture&quot; album, with a flow that makes the record come together, and several stand-out tracks.  It has a cool, jazzy feel not unlike a dimly-lit nightclub with people dancing, drinking, laughing and crying.  However, it uses less melody and more texture, creating more soundscapes than tunes.<br />Always a welcome addition is Tracey Thorn of Everything But the Girl.  &quot;Protection&quot; and &quot;Better Things,&quot; which she contributes to, are two of the album's best.  Also Nicolette, although a little shrill on &quot;Sly,&quot; is beautiful on &quot;Three.&quot;  Also- Massive Attack has proved that they can do instrumental tracks!  Unfortunately, Horace Andy only has one studio song, and he doesn't shine like he did on Blue Lines.  And &quot;Light My Fire?&quot;  It's a little annoying, although I admit it has grown on me.<br />More than ever, Massive Attack creates moods that creep up on you with each repeated listen.  However, Protection, while it has some of Massive's best songs, it disappoints a little as a whoe album.  Definitely essential to any collection, but better if you can find it used.
B000002AVF|5.0|myself I think &quot;Daydream&quot; is Mariah at her best. I bought this CD used at Hastings (Not Online)!!!! At first when I listened to it, I only knew the songs &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot; and &quot;One Sweet Day!&quot; But now I know all of them (There are some I haven't listened, to yet).. <br />1. FANTASY - This one sounds like &quot;Dreamlover&quot; with it's catchy chorus! 10/10<br />2. UNDERNEATH THE STARS - This song is beautiful! 10/10<br />3. ONE SWEET DAY - This one is really good. She does a duet with &quot;Boyz II Men&quot; 10/10<br />4. OPEN ARMS - I Love this song! 10/10<br />5. ALWAYS BE MY BABY - This song ismy number 1 fav on this CD! 10/10<br />6. I AM FREE - I dont listen to this one much. But it's okay! 5/10 <br />7. WHEN I SAW YOU - Havent listened to it yet! <br />8. LONG AGO - This song is good! 10/10<br />9. MELT AWAY - Havent listened to it yet!<br />10. FOREVER - Havent listened to it yet! <br />11. DAYDREAM INTERLUDE (FANTASY SWEET DUB MX) - Havent listened to it yet!<br />12. LOOKING IN - An okay song! 5/10<br />So overall this CD is very good.Do urself a favor and buy this CD today. <br />OVERALLGRADE 99%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005BJMQ|5.0|I love this CD!! It's almost as good as the movie.Ewan Mcgregor ((we love him)) and the awesome Nichole Kidman actually sing in this. Also it includes Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Pink and Mya's  fabulous 'Lady Marmalade' plus some other stuff that's not really in the movie all that much. This is really an awesome cd~!!
B00003CXZ3|2.0|The idea of a movie running backwards is intriguing, and this one is well-edited. The different styles made the film a puzzle to figure out as it runs. The whole premise of having no short-term memory is fascinating. Memento has the dark, edginess of Fight Club. It is a very dark film. So if you like movies for the concept, and don't care about a happy ending or uplifting message, then you'll probably like this.
B00002EPJH|5.0|These three words definitely sum up this CD. An essential Jarrett recording - a culmination of his 90s solo piano excursions and a simply gorgeous album. What is so great about this session is its simplicity. He uses space. Understanding that notes not played are just as important as notes played, Jarrett seems to have reached a new peak in his career. Only track 2 he extends into melodic improvisations, still keeping it simple and rooted in his steady left hand. The reworkings of such standard Elligton and Gershwin gems had me hooked. Ungarnished is his version of &quot;Shenandoah&quot; - simply the best track on the CD in my opinion in its ability to make the mind wander. Cocktail piano at times, yes, but nonetheless Jarrett captures pure solo piano at its simplistic best. Above all, it is beautiful music.
B00004YW6I|5.0|As always, PJ Harvey stands out among the rest with her music and her choice of lyrics. I don't regret a thing about buying this remarkable album. I do regret not buying it sooner. That is because I waited a very long time since the release. What I heard when popping the disc into the cd, was excellent.<br />The more I play this cd, the more hidden parts of the songs come out. What that means is every time it plays, the songs teach me something more about PJ and her music. Every track is excellent.<br />What pleases me about \\"Stories...\\" is that with this album, PJ is more down to earth, realistic, a lot more dynamic with the range of songs, and the mood change. Sometimes I put on a CD with only one mood in all the songs. It can get much annoying and repetitive, but on \\"Stories...\\", you won't get much monotony.<br />Some of the lyrics leave a stamp in my memory. Especially \\"You said something, that I've never forgotten\\", or \\"baby baby, ain't it true? I'm immortal when I'm with you...I want a pistol in my hand, I wanna run to a different land\\". These songs talk to me a lot more than the music on PJ's last album, \\"Is this desire?\\".<br />The music on that cd went nowhere, and I think that Miss Harvey decided it was time for a change. And she was right.<br />The first time I heard track 1 and 2, I knew that this cd was a smart purchase. In \\"Good fortune\\", right away did I feel that she sounded very much like Chrissie Hynde of the band \\"The Pretenders\\".<br />Now, for the critique of the booklet. Well, at least we get to see a lot of what PJ goes through in the recording studio, and what she looks like in person. To tell you the truth, I never really had a good look at her. As a result of purchasing the cd, I realized that PJ looks quite good, and that she has come a long way in progress since \\"Dry\\".<br />The photos are cool, as well as the neatly laid out lyrics on all the pages. \\"Stories...\\" is definitely a must have for your collection.<br />The track list is:<br />1-Big exit  2-Good fortune  3-A place called home  4-One line  5-Beautiful feeling  6-The whores hustle and the hustlers whore<br />7-This mess we're in  8-You said something  9-Kamikaze  10-This is love  11-Horses in my dreams  12-We float<br />I hope my review has opened you up a bit on who PJ Harvey is as an artist, and buying this product is undoubtedly worth it.it  2-Good fortune  3-A place called home  4-One line    5-Beautiful feeling  6-The whores hustle and the hustlers whore<BR>7-This mess we're in  8-You said something  9-Kamikaze           10-This is love  11-Horses in my dreams  12-We float<br />I hope my review has opened you up a bit on who PJ Harvey is as an artist, and buying this product is undoubtedly worth it.
B00005QDW5|4.0|I rated it 4 stars because it is missing some of the greater older songs like &quot;The gnome&quot;, &quot;Lucifer Sam&quot;, Interstellar overdrive&quot; and &quot;Remember a day&quot;. These songs I just mentioned came out way before my time, and they have a great effect on me now. But that's not the point.<br />On Echoes, the songs are fine, and at least I now have the full version of &quot;Another brick in the wall&quot; and &quot;Hey you&quot;.<br />All of the songs bring back memories, because they were part of the soundtrack of my childhood. And, because the songs are timeless, they always get better and better everytime I play the cd. Like I read in another review, they should have included a third cd for the songs I mentioned in the first lines of this review. To be honest, I never bought any of my own Pink Floyd cds, because they just never meant anything to me until now. And that is after being around for 26 years.<br />The tracklist is as lengthy, so I will tell you a little about the songs I like and dislike.<br />Tracks 1,2,3,4,6,11,12 on cd 1 are my favorites, because I know them a lot, and because they are the remastered versions. I try to buy remastered versions of older music like this only.<br />On CD 2, tracks 1,8,9 and 12 are my favorites because I know them well too.<br />And now for why I like these songs so much. Well, the songs reach out and are without doubt the catchiest songs on the collection. Maybe had I been around earlier, I'd been able to enjoy the non mentioned songs in my review.<br />Dave Gilmour and Roger Waters' voices are great to listen to, and I love their accents. That is why I am happy &quot;Bike&quot; was included on the tracklist. Artists like this make music what it was then, as well as what it should be today.<br />I like the interior of the booklet. It is very artistic, and the chronology is in good order. The packaging is actually nicer than I thought it would be. The paper slip cover on my copy will probably not be able to survive too long, because it is too flimsy and it slips off way too easy from the actual cd case.<br />Like I mentioned, the collection could have used a third disc, as well as something enhanced for your cd rom. That could have been a nice touch. What's convenient though, they included all the original lyrics in the booklet, on every page, and it seems that the booklet is divided into two different parts (Old &amp; New).<br />How neat!<br />Hope my review helped you.e to survive too long, because it is too flimsy and it slips off way too easy from the actual cd case.<br />Like I mentioned, the collection could have used a third disc, as well as something enhanced for your cd rom.

B00004TRD8|5.0|This was a great movie. This in my opinion was WAY better than the first. Plus in this one Arnold was acting better. If you think oh its the same plot, your wrong. Arnold Schwarzenegger play the good guy this time and he talks more. Robert Patric plays the bad guy. The plot is the movie starts out 2029.The voice of Linda Hamelton explains whats going on. Her son was born and stuff. I do not want to go through it so I wont. Its good. Just buy it.
B000056K04|2.0|First off, let me tell you I have been an extreme DMB fan for a while now. Having got Under the Table and Dreaming quite a few years ago ive been hooked ever since. Hearing Satellite in 7th grade or so, totally opened new realms for me in the music world. DMB took me to different ways of thinking, and I totally fell in love with everything after...until now. The reason I love DMB is the same reason this record doesnt do it for me. I totally understand that they felt they were forced to come up with songs that were pretty mopey (lillywhite), but what was the hurry? why couldn't they have just waited until they felt ready? this cd seemed very rushed and just plain different. having anxiously awaited every album, this one included, my expectations lowered as I felt as though I was listening to a complete different band's record. i dont know why but i really gave it a chance and forced myself to listen to it, but i just cant like it. the lyrics are really the best thing about this record, having some interesting turns, but the music just doesnt match up. I just dont get those goose bumps like I did when listening to previous records released. Sorry, I just kinda hope that same old charm returns in the future!
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is the funniest movie that I have ever seen.  I have seen it 50 times and it has not gotten old and i it will never get old.  The special edition is great, i know more about monty python than i ever thought i would want to know.  i highly reccomend gettting this movie
B00003CXDZ|1.0|Oh this movie was horrible!  I 100% agree with Dr. Ravna (see review below)--this movie was awful, awful, awful.  Even though I was impressed with the vocal talent of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, I don't know how anybody liked it, and I do not understand how it possibly won the awards it has.  I only know one person who liked it (and more because she's a fan of Nicole Kidman and Christina Aguilera who sang the title track along with 3 others) but everyone else that I know, ranging from children to professionals detested this despicible waste of time, money, and effort.  In short, it's much to glitzy, fake, uncomfortable,  awkward, unwatchable, and unbearable.  I don't care if the whole world disagrees with me--I will never subject myself to this cinematic atrocity again!
B00005RDAF|1.0|From the DVD's title, \\"The Videos,\\" one might expect that it actually contains ALL of Britney's videos. In reality, it only contains three (four if you count the \\"Crossroads-Overprotected\\" video) and the rest of the DVD is simply a plug for her newest DVD, \\"Britney Live from Las Vegas\\" and her new movie \\"Crossroads.\\" There isn't any content on the DVD, merely Britney Strikes a Pose, (not interesting, and The Making of the Movie Crossroads (also not very interesting). There's little diaglogue, just her talking about her movie. If you enjoy watching commercials, that's all this DVD is. If you enjoy content and a DVD that's worth the time to watch it and the money to buy it, skip this one. I wish I would have.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|One word to sum this movie up:  Clever.  It was so well done, ingenius concept, direction, and acting.  Guy Pearce is just phenomenal and does a wonderful job portraying a man with amnesia.  In my opinion, undoubtably one of the best movies ever made.  It's that good!
6303433766|5.0|This movie was the best! Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey were excellent as two bestfriends who commit matricide so they can stay with one another. The script is brillant,as well as the visual effects. See this movie, you won't regret it!
B00005JKQX|5.0|Russell Crowe does a superb job depicting someone who is suffering from a dibilitating illness.  I knew the plot and I'd studied John Nash but I was still caught off guard when the severity of his illness was revealed half way through the movie.  While this movie lacks the edge-of-your-seat thrill that a film like Black Hawk Down delivers, it is an intelligent film nonetheless.  Crowe is one of the finest actors to appear on the silver screen (I rank him up there with the likes of Tom Hanks and Jimmy Stewart) and this film is without a doubt one of the best released in recent years.
B00005QFHG|4.0|I've read the reviews that say this was a light concoction not worthy of an Oscar nod. Perhaps such an old-fashioned, sweet tale of acceptance and roots is easily trampled under the boots of Roman gladiators. But if you want to know which movie I ran out to buy as soon as it was available, it's this one. I have watched it many times over and never tire of it. It is the details that matter here; the incredibly beautiful cinematography and haunting score, the sets that echo the chocolate theme everywhere you look (check out Alfred Molina's office--the paint on the walls is mahogany so rich you could eat it). The acting by the principles is fine-Depp and Binoche have great chemistry-but it's the secondary characters that stand out; the heartbreaking daughter with her imaginary kangaroo that is the only stable thing in her life, the luminous Lena Olin (who in my opinion should have been nominated for best supporting actress and perhaps even given the lead) who practically steals the show from Juliette Binoche, and the always regal Judi Denche. Alfred Molina gives a multilayered performance; for a person with such broad features that would so easily lend themselves to caricature, his sublety and range is brilliant; he draws a complete portrait of a person who has let his loneliness turn to bitterness and fanaticism. It is his grand dive into what he would have previously thought of as decadence but is actually an admittance of vulnerability that gives this movie its greatest poignance.
0780626494|4.0|This movie is great--anytime I am having a bad day I just pop this DVD in and by the end of the film I'm smiling and in better spirits.  It's just so much fun and not so darn serious like some other films.  I think Brendan Fraser is great and does a good job, and though Alicia Silverstone's acting left much to be desired, this movie is just a good time overall.  My favorite scene?  The 40's dance club -- wish we had one of those in Denver!
B00005RHGK|1.0|This is the most useless excuse for a scary movie I have ever seen. It's poorly written and the production quality is terrible. There is not one scare in the whole hapless mess, but there are several \\"gross\\" for the sake of gross scenes. Don't even bother renting this one. And certainly don't buy it.
0767836286|5.0|This is one of my favorite films of all time.  It is an exceptionally well-done thriller with so many twists and turns and a fabulous suprise ending.  You cannot go wrong with Arlington Road--a definite must see if you have not already.
B000002H97|5.0|This is a great Metallica album. Sure it is no Master Of Puppets or And Justice For All, but like someone else said it is Metallica maturing. Nothing ever stays the same and remember that. This album is one of my favorite Metallica albums and I feel the band did a great job on it. Sure it was the turn into main stream popularity but who cares. With the work they put out trhugh out the 80's I could careless what they do after that. They could get all the popularity in the world because they're work in the 80's is what really shined and made Metallica who they are. Enter Sandman is of course one of the most popular songs on the album and is famous for echoing through the ECW Arena upon the arrival of wrstler the Sandman. The album has it;s heavy points but is also relaxing which I like alot. The Unforgiven is my second favorite song on the album next to Enter Sandman. The album is solid the whole way through. I like each and every song on this album and don't have a problem with any of them. This is one of the greatest selling albums ever and I highly recommend any metal fan to buy it who yet hasn't. Keep the spirit of one of the greatest metal bands of all time alive. I do how ever recommend Kill Em All, Ride The Lightning, Master Of Puppets, and And Justice For All before this one, but this album is a must have in any collection.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Okay I admit it--I NEVER buy CDs anymore, I'm constantly downloading and burning my own CDs.  Why?  I hate spending $12-15 for a CD with one or two good songs and the rest just suck.  Not so with this CD.  I actually purchased this CD, a rare act in and of itself.  Even more rare and unusual--I do not regret the purchase.  All of the songs are quality, and of course just like everyone else I love \\"How You Remind Me\\"--but trust me, the rest of the songs are worth a listen as well.
B00003CXDG|4.0|In an effort to make up for the lags of the first Mission Impossible, MI:2 goes for the action.  The first one was cerebral and bizarre at times, succeeding at not making itself clear in some scenes, typical of Brian De Palma films that usually fall flat at the end.  It can be surmised that when Tom Cruise, who served as producer on the first and second film realized the lack of excitement in the first one, he wanted to make sure the action scenes in the sequel would be spectacular.      He succeeded by hiring John Woo as the director.  Woo's claim to fame is action movies, doing such adrenaline pumped hits as Face/Off, Broken Arrow and several high energy Hong Kong actions flicks.  Unfortunately, the story's IQ was shaved in order to counter the fear that people might this one confusing too.  The MI TV series was always like a bad dream, you never knew what could happen next or who you could trust.  Although the first MI followed that pattern, the second one throws it out the window.  The villain is made clear from the beginning...sort of.      The plot is typical Spy thriller stuff; Mega virus is stolen, secret government agents go after the man who has it, wackiness ensues in the form of killer actions scenes and the hero saves the day.  No one is called on to do any kind of stretch of their acting chops.  One main complaint I have is the forced romance between Ethan and Nyah (a prominent Jewel thief played by the smoldering Thandie Newton).  The two have no chemistry.  This is unfortunate because I like them as a couple, but there isn't much to like between them on screen.    The movie is simple and the action scenes are awesome if not bordering on absurd.  I give Cruise high praise and credit for beefing up and doing almost all of his own stunt work and fight scenes, it's quite convincing.  Especially the rock climbing scene at the beginning, the motorcycle chase and the climatic fight scene at the end.  The DVD is packed with extra stuff, so if you like John Woo actioners, this movie is worth buying on DVD.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I own every Sade album.  This album is great, but there are a LOT of great songs that didn't make it on (that is because Sade has a LOT of great songs!).  Actually most of my favorites are not on this.  But if you are looking just one Sade album or an intro album, then this is the one to get.  If you are looking for another, get \\"Promise\\" (my favorite)!!!  If you are looking for yet another get \\"Love Deluxe\\".
B00003CX8J|4.0|X-MEN    (USA - 2000)    Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)  Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital Surround EX / DTS / SDDS    In a brief interview with director Bryan Singer (THE USUAL SUSPECTS, APT PUPIL) included in the supplemental materials of the original US DVD edition of X-MEN, the alarmingly young-looking helmer explains that the film - originally intended for a Christmas 2000 release - was abruptly rescheduled for summer of that year, forcing the entire production to scramble desperately to realize its lofty ambitions. Against all the odds, the final product (based on a long-running Marvel comic series developed by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Chris Claremont and Len Wein) demonstrates a profound maturity that lifts it head and shoulders above the massed ranks of mechanical Hollywood blockbusters, whilst simultaneously delivering the kind of effects-heavy spectacle that audiences have come to expect from this particular sub-genre.    Whilst bigoted politicians are fomenting unreasoning hostility toward a new breed of superhuman 'mutants' - ordinary people with extraordinary powers including telepathy, pschokinesis and/or mind control, representing the next stage in human evolution - a benevolent psychic named Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has established a private school where he teaches particularly gifted mutants to channel their abilities safely. But some of his most powerful students - played with earnest conviction by a number of Hollywood's sexiest rising stars, including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and James Marsden - are called upon to challenge the wrath of Magneto (Ian McKellen), a mutant supervillain whose hatred of mankind was cultivated in a Nazi concentration camp (outlined in a harrowing opening sequence, where the film's sober intentions are signalled in no uncertain terms), and who is determined to launch a devastating assualt on the world's non-mutant population, igniting a war between the species that only the mutants can win.    The unusually clever scenario provides an almost entirely character-driven rationale for its flashy set-pieces, without skimping on either aspect of the production. That's due partly to David Hayter's concise script, Singer's ingenious ability to convey a wealth of relevant information at high speed without rushing or obscuring the details, and a strict adherence to the film's primary thematic concerns (tolerance, individuality, finding your own place in the world, etc.). The performances, too, are uniformly excellent: Stewart and McKellen may seem unlikely adversaries, but these immensely gifted actors elevate the proceedings beyond the confines of mere 'Good and Evil', adding real depth and nuance to their respective characters. The younger members of the X-Men team are somewhat underused, but they certainly LOOK spectacular and they make the most of their limited screen time, while Ray Park (Darth Maul himself!), model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and wrestler Tyler Mane also provide visual fireworks as Magneto's villainous henchmen.     Elsewhere, Anna Paquin (THE PIANO) provides the film's emotional core as a young girl targeted by Magneto because of her unique powers, while Jackman takes center-stage in a star-making role as the most reluctant recruit to Stewart's team of superheroes (his verbal conflicts with rival Marsden are often joyously funny). Production values are predictably solid, betraying little or no evidence of a rushed production schedule: Newton Thomas Sigel's Panavision photography conspires with John Myhre's astute production design to render a silver-blue color scheme that subtly emphasizes the movie's comic-book origins, reflected in the DVD's similarly-styled packaging.     While Singer insists the movie's subtext is critical of all forms of intolerance, closer scrutiny suggests more specific concerns about homophobia, the only form of prejudice which remains openly condoned throughout society. Bruce Davison (LONGTIME COMPANION) plays a rabble-rousing politician who frightens Congress with exaggerated 'scare-stories' about a sub-culture they don't understand, while hate-filled protestors gather on the steps outside to wave placards that condemn the 'infiltration' of mutants into schools, churches and society at large. Sound familiar? These themes are further underlined in a Fox TV special included on the original DVD release, constructed as a series of news reports surrounding Congressional hearings on a proposed Mutant Registration Act, wherein Davison holds court with almost religious fervor, spitefully twisting the evidence to suit his own rhetoric, only to be laid low by an amusing final twist that mirrors the downfall of many a similar real-life politician. This particular interpretation may not have been the central focus of the original comic strip, but Singer's intentions are so conspicuous, and so heartfelt, it's a miracle (and, frankly, a blessing) that he was able to get away with it at all. Is this the world's first $70 million dollar 'gay' movie? Not quite, but it certainly provides plenty of food for thought...    Followed by X2 (2003).
0440219078|4.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry combines aspects of fantasy, science fiction, and mystery genres.  While clearly a dystopian novel after the pattern of 1984 (and, I would assume, A Brave New World, but I haven't read that yet), this book also incorporates such fantasy/philosophical concepts as collective memory. <BR>Although much of what is happening is clearly explained later on, readers who like a little ambiguity will enjoy trying to interpret what Jonas means when he describes things from a worldview very different from our own.<BR>The ending leaves the reader confused and deflated, belonging more to the fantasy/philosophical parts of the book than the science fiction parts.  While Jonas seems happy in the end, one cannot figure out where he is, what will happen to him, or even if he's still alive.  Personally, I wanted something more concrete.  <BR>However, it is a beautiful, enthralling, and tasteful tale for the fairly mature reader willing to contemplate the nature of love, sexuality (this part is mild), infanticide, suicide, history, paternalistic government, etc., without the &quot;resistance is futile&quot; hopelessness of adult dystopian novels.<BR>I loved it at 12.  I love it at 18.  <BR>Can anyone tell me if the legend of the sanitation worker told by the children of Jonas' community is an allusion to Anthem by Ayn Rand?

0811833887|3.0|Being a longtime fan of Disney &amp; Pixar films I found myself particularly touched by Monsters, Inc and was eagerly looking forward to learning more about the how this film came about.  Previous &quot;Art of&quot; books from Disney and Pixar were rich sources of information on how the story and characters developed from initial inspiration to big screen.   As such I was dissapointed to find this book contains primarily concept art.  Rich and vivid imagery but very little commentary.

B00000J7JO|5.0|Hearing Californication is like looking deep into the album's cover art. The album gives 15 tracks; all with a different story or feeling to tell. Whether it be the melancholy &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; or the bouncy sexual rythms on &quot;I Like Dirt&quot; that make the Chili Pepper's signature sound. To some extent, 'One Hot Minute'is a weak effort from the then 'incomplete' Peppers and they shell out all their creative energies on this.  Most definitevly, I feel this album surpases all of the other albums in terms of maturity and depth, not to say that the other albums didn't have it. Not only that, but the poetry that Anthony Kiedis bestows upon in Californication is the best I have ever heard.<BR>The album itself is a mix of bitter and sweet and the ever energetic sound of the Peppers. Without a doubt, the highlight of the album is the title track, that builds you up to an amazing blend of piercing guitar riffs and some of the greatest lyrics of modern rock. I think that you can divide the album into two sincere pieces that can not be termed in any other way but 'Past' and 'Future'. There are a few songs that remind me of past Pepper songs with a few twists and ultimately the songs that define the 'new energy',if you will, that the Chili's have constructed.  Undoubtably, this is a much different band than the one who wrote &quot;Out in L.A.&quot;, and the change is great. <BR>I have heard Californication and a bit of the new material for the follow-up due in Spring, and it is a great thing to look forward to. If you were to buy an album that gave you words and sound to every emotion that you can ever feel, take Californication. Not only that, but buy it to admire and witness a metamorphosis that begun with &quot;Out in L.A.&quot; and hasn't ended yet. There is much to look forward to, and much more to pioneer for the already accomplished Chili Peppers. This is truly an exquisite album.
0782008372|5.0|Highlander is a grade B movie that qualifies as a guilty pleasure.  <br />This is a story of &quot;immortals&quot; that chase each other through the centuries.  In this universe, there will eventually only be one immortal left. The contest requires that they battle with swords ending with the winner decapitating the loser thus gaining his powers.<br />The story starts out in the 1500's with warring Scottish clans.  McLeod, Christopher Lambert, flashes back between our time and different periods of history with plenty of sword fights and special effects.  The movie has a video game feel to it; it's not a serious study of what it would be like to be immortal.  Still it triggers all sorts of fantasies about what it would be like to face danger on a regular basis, perhaps be fatally stabbed and yet never die.  It would also be fascinating to be an eyewitness to history for all times.<br />Another reviewer cited the poor quality of the audio portion, which admittedly was a little rough, however, with all the thick accents; the English subtitles were helpful anyway.<br />If you like movies like the old Conan The Barbarian series or   the more recent Laura Croft Tomb Raider, then you'll be right at home here.
B00005JKMO|3.0|I was really excited to hear that this movie was coming out. I have always been an Ali fan. Will Smith is great in the film. He is the reason that this movie gets three stars. John Voigt and Mario Van Peebles also do a great job!<br />Now for some cons. The cinematographer needs to find another profession. The camera shakes too much during the fights and blurs people out a lot. It is somewhat nauseating ... The Rocky movies had better fight photography. My eyes were beginning to hurt from the extremely bright white colors in the movie. Another thing, it brings out all the bad history of Ali. It shows him being a womanizer, a bad husband, and a traitor to his friends and country. At times, I was wondering if I liked the man or not. They picked a bad time of his life to portray. Finally, I didn't learn anything more about Ali from the movie. Everything in it was common knowledge. <br />Overall, not a bad movie, but not a good movie either. It is worth seeing if you don't know much about Ali and camera shaking doesn't bother you.
B00005LB50|3.0|Box sets take different approaches; at one extreme they are like the Beatles Anthology series, which take alternative, cuts from an artist's career, shedding insight as to how materials were developed.  You get to hear how the artist developed and matured and  you also get music that has never been heard before.  For a true fan, that is a delightful and amazing experience.  The other approach is to take the greatest hits and other mostly previously released material and put them in one central release (for convenience I guess).  This was the Eagles box set approach (it did include some never released concert material). Unfortunately, from my point of view, this set takes the latter approach.<br />I am not a record company marketer or retailer, however I suspect that most box sets are bought by true fans of an artist.  Who else but a true fan would pay $50.00 to $60.00 ($150.00 for a recently released Grateful Dead set) and listen to four CDs worth of material from one artist?<br />Chances are the true fan already most of this music.  Where is the alternative of \\"Blue Bird\\", the mistakes on \\"Mr. Soul\\", the false start on \\"Special Care\\" or the unreleased version of \\"For What It's Worth\\"?.  But before you start clicking on those \\"not helpful \\" buttons, please understand that I love this music.  Buffalo Springfield is one of the truly seminal and important bands of the sixties.  They blended rock, country, folk and soul into a unique and timeless sound. After waiting many years for a box set, this package was a let down. Additionally, several of the other reviewers pointed out that many previously songs were left out, so that you don't even get the satisfaction of knowing that you have a complete set!  My problem is with the packaging and marketing, not with the music!  Hopefully, there will be more stuff from the vaults later.<br />Still, if you have never replaced those vinyl records or you've heard a few songs on the classic rock stations and want to hear more, then this a pretty good set to own.  The rest of us will just have to be patient and hope that someone from the band or the record company is listening.  Please don't wait too long...were' getting old!en this a pretty good set to own.  The rest of us will just have to be patient and hope that someone from the band or the record company is listening.  Please don't wait too long...were' getting old!

B00005ATQI|5.0|Stanley Kubricks interpretation of Steven Kings novel is excellant. Even though Mr.King might now think so himself, this is a hauntingly scary movie. The first time i watched it, i was dumbfounded by the shear brilliance of the work. I was not yet convinced though of it's triumph over the large &quot;main-stream&quot; horror hurdle. When i was not able to get the movie out of my mind, it struck me that this movie created a new standard in the motion picture business.<BR>You will NEVER forget The Shining.
0930289234|3.0|...<br />I would not really call The Watchmen the \\"Citizen Kane of graphic novels.\\" It is more like Tarentino's movie, Pulp Fiction, multiple plot lines, hip references, and plenty of gory violence and power trip fantasies to satisfy a basically adolescent audience. But it is not as good as Pulp Fiction. For ambition,<br />for the acheivement of taking the form to a new level, for superficial complexity, for the effective blending of story telling and art work,  I give it an A. For content, for ideas, for genuine insight into the human condition, I give it a C minus.

B00004STPT|5.0|This is a must buy- it is the most amazing soundtrack to the most amazing movie. The music starts slow and soulful and then slowly works up, so you end up with very loud, drum-based lovely battle themes. Listenng to it, you can either imagine yourself in the middle of the movie, or you can imagine yourself flying or fighting a dragon, this piece of music can take you anywhere. I recommend this track to anybody who enjoys decent classic sort of music. If you're a rap or rock fanatic don't buy this, coz this is one..... majestic track, shall i say?
B000001ESP|5.0|This album is often referred to as Rush's classic album, and rightfully so.  It's true that it's not as progressive as their previous releases, and marked a move to a more pop oriented sound, but there is still tons of proggy goodness here.  Queensryche is considered progressive, but this album is still more progressive than any of their albums.  This album contains two of their most well-known songs, &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Limelight&quot; (the latter being one of my all-time favorite songs), but there are lots of other good songs here as well, such as &quot;Red Barchetta&quot;, &quot;Vital Signs&quot;, and the awesome instrumental &quot;YYZ&quot;.  In fact, there isn't a bad song on here.  All of the musicians play very well, especially Neil Peart.  He's not quite the fastest drummer (although he's pretty fast), but he just has this style that is very creative and unique.  They don't call him a god for nothing (but you've really gotta hear Mike Portnoy, if you think Neil's the best).  Geddy Lee is, I think, a very underrated vocalist.  He's often criticized for his, um, unique vocal style (I even saw a professional critic that referred to him as a &quot;whiny nerd&quot;), but I think he's pretty good.  In my opinion, he's a much better singer than Robert Plant, who's very overrated (don't get me wrong, I love Zeppelin, but the guy's a banshee, am I the only one who sees that?).  The first time I heard &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, I thought his voice was great, and I still do.  So there!  Anyway, this is a great album, classic prog. done right, and every fan of the genre should own it.  Also, if you like this, I would recommend Dream Theater's &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot; and Iron Maiden's &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;.
B00003CXTG|5.0|History comes alive in this unforgetable epic motion picture Pearl Harbor,the spectacular blockbuster brought to the screen by Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay. Astonishing visual and audio effects put you at the center of the event that changed the world - that early Sunday morning in paradise when warplanes screamed across the peaceful skies of Pearl Harbor and jolted America into World War II. This real-life tale of catostrophic defeat, heroic vistory and personal courage focuses on the war's devastating impact on two young daring pilots, Ben Affleck (Armageddom) and Josh Hartnett (The Virgin Suicides), and a beautiful dedicated nurse, Kate Beckinsale (Serendipity), Pearl Harbor is extraordinary moviemaking - a breathtaking reenactment of the &quot;date which will live in infamy,&quot; and a heartfelt tribute to the men and women who lived it.
6305897786|2.0|This movie blends two genres Roman Polanski has dabbled in before, horror movies (which he explored with Rosemary's Baby) and film noir detective flicks (which he handled in a breathtaking way with Chinatown). Normally the mating of these two genres produces some thrilling results, but not so here. I think the film is mainly crippled by Johnny Depp's character. Dean Corso is about as selfish as human beings come, so when his life is threatened I really didn't find myself on the edge of my seat. Corso is a rare book collector who is hired by a client to track down this weird text that supposedly will raise the devil. Seems there are 3 copies of this book in the world, only one of which is real. The client has one and Dean has to find the other two. ALthough some of the cinematography is quite beautiful, the movie just doesn't grab you. If Corso had been a more decent person, the movie would have been much more terrifying. Many horror films make the mistake of giving us main characters that we just don't care about. Filmmaker ought to realize it's more scary when the victims are LIKEABLE.
6305963444|5.0|A very good movie.  The music is absolutly terrific, and is a great movie for any age.  You do not have to be a fan of musicals to fall in love with the Trapp family.  This is a story of romance as well as action and suspense.  For those of you who do not know, this movie is based of a true story of Maria von Trapp.  The Sound of Music turns her story in a wonderful fairy tale.  I highly recommend watching this movie, it is worth it.
B000000WJZ|5.0|When this album came out, I had nothing going for me. I'd given up on guitar, I had no friends, my only true friend (grandfather) had died...and I felt like joining him on the other side at age 17. And then...I was watching 120 Minutes on MTV (anyone else remember when that show was actually GOOD?) and they announced a new Smashing Pumpkins video. I'd heard a couple songs from their debut GISH, actually heard 'em cos I saw their videos on the same program, and liked them but for whatever reason never picked the album up. Anyway that video was for &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; and man, I was hooked. I knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to pick up guitar again, I wanted to blend classic rock style riffs with disillusioned lyrics, I wanted to touch in others the same nerve Billy Corgan had touched in me. As time went on I read up on Billy and it seemed his childhood had been similar to mine. Also his suicidal feelings...just everything about the guy echoed moments in my life. And his songs helped me through lonely lonely times. That's why I was so mad, 'cos when they broke up some douche bag DJ was saying &quot;oh yeah the Pumpkins are breaking up, I've gone thru 2 boxes of Kleeenex and I need to call my therapist.&quot; Jak-off. Screw him. This was the band that kept me alive through some deep dark suicidal years, and if I met Billy I would never be able to thank him enough.
B00003CX9S|5.0|...there are no chapters on this disc! Beautiful transfer, quality supplemental material, but no chapters. Weird. I only noticed this when we had to stop watching mid-film and went back the next night to finish it. A minor inconvenience, and more puzzling than annoying. Despite this, &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; DVD presents this moving tale in all its sumptuous black-and-white beauty. If you've never seen it, don't think twice about picking it up for your permanent collection. You won't be disappointed.
B00005LMWI|3.0|I've said it before and apparently I have to say it again- Kahn does not have the voice for this style of music. Conception will haunt him until he dies! Kamelot is straight forward power metal. Kahn needs to be in something more creative.<BR>As for the album: a big disappointment. Eztremely mediocre and hard to get into. However, tracks 10-12 are extremely good! In fact, Mirror Mirror could possibly be my favorite Kamelot song of all time. My overall impression of the album was that they spent their creative energy writing tracks 10-12 and needed some more material so they just kind of threw the rest together.
B00005JKOV|5.0|This is a seriously funny, profound and animated inventory of our condition, one not to be missed.  With all its talk, all its characters' theorizing, it shocks but never panders.  Once in a while a really good movie comes along.  This is one.  Also, it's technically innovative.  The soundtrack is great, the insights amazingly acute.  Plus, it's a lot of fun.  I highly recommend it.

0140189378|5.0|In every life there are days of reckoning, and moments of supreme truth. When those days occur and we look back on everything that has happened in our lives, then what is to be seen and known? In &quot;Seize The Day&quot;, Tommy Wilhelm has such a day of reckoning, when everything in his life reaches a turning point of disintegration and despair. Everything seems to fall apart before his eyes, as old wounds from his past are laid completely bare. His deepest wish is for a measure of genuine love and respect, amid the ruins of a life that has never been fully lived. In many ways Tommy Wilhelm's story is the story of all of us, as we search for real meaning each day. Like Tommy Wilhelm we struggle to seize the day, and to find something of value in the ever passing moments of our lives.

0767830555|5.0|One of the great things about DVD is the opportunity to collect great films and watch them in widescreen format the way the filmmaker intended. The image in letterbox is the image that was shown on the theater screen. Why anyone would want a full screen of less movie is a mystery to me. Oh well, I digress.<br />In this Taxi Driver special edition DVD, we have one of the best films of the 70's on a great disc with one of the best documentaries out there.  Travis Bickle, our antihero, is a cabbie who suffers from insomnia and wants to &quot;work long hours&quot;. This is how he meets many of the strange characters he comes in contact with including Sport (a pimp played by Harvey Keitel) and a young prostitute named Iris played by Jodie Foster. Before that however, Travis becomes fixated by Betsy, who works in a campaign office. Travis, who is extremely lonely and shy, eventually works up the nerve to go into the office and tell Betsy that he'd like to volunteer. This is actually just a way for Travis to ask Betsy out on a date, which he does. However, that date turns out a disaster as Travis takes Betsy to a theater showing an X rated film and she is repelled by the entire experience. That causes her to avoid Travis and he eventually comes back to here office angry and looking for a confrontation. As to one viewer's criticism that this simply isn't believeable that he would take her to a porn film, I say to the contrary, he simply doesn't know any better. We're not dealing with a ladies' man here who knows what is and is not proper to do on dates. <br />It is after this that Travis begins to slip further and further into his depressed, isolated world and he eventually feels the need to take Iris under his wing and protect her (as he sees it) from Sport who he views as pure scum. The final act invloves a presidential assassination attempt and a famous violent scene involving Travis, Sport, Iris and several others (I'm trying not to get to involved in the third act here) that I won't go into. <br />More than anything, Taxi Driver is a character study of Travis Bickle and the isolation and loneliness that take their toll on him.  This is a different world that director Scorsese and writer Schrader invite you to experience, if not really enjoy. In addition, there is one of the best documentaries here that I've seen.

B00000IPAX|5.0|I hate this cd it is pop not punk  like all their old stuff.  Blink 182 was the best band in the world before this pop peice of junk they made. Buy all their old albums, not this! O yeah i gave it 5 stars because blink WAS a great band and i thought it would be only appropriate to give this cd although it doesnt deserve it.
B000002BPS|2.0|Sure, the musical stylings may be varied, but the variety on this album can never make up for the fact that the Offspring became soft on this release, and failed to regain their edge seen during their &quot;Smash&quot; days and before.<br />...Pity

B000001IPL|5.0|Although &quot;Smash&quot; isn't my favorite Offspring album, it still is excellent nonetheless.  And no, &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; isn't my favorite (nor is it as wonderful as its fans make it out to be); &quot;Ignition&quot; is.<br />My favorite tracks:<BR>&quot;Gotta Get Away&quot;, &quot;Not the One&quot;, and &quot;Smash&quot;
0064407667|5.0|\\"The Bad Beginning\\" is an excellent book for young people who want a story that's to the point and fun or for other people who just want a quick and enjoyable read.  The story moves quickly, there are no boring details, and the characters are likable or detestable.  Lemony Snicket isn't writing a story; the reader feels more like he's telling you a story.  He helps and challenges the reader with his style of writing.  Be glad it is one in a series of many!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|That would be more fun than watching this one. Get it over with quick so we can get on with our lives.<br />This film was awful. I endured about 30 minutes of it. If there was an actual story, I was unable to detect it. The first 10 minutes were so confusing, I was wondering what we were actually watching....<br />My wife didn't even like it. I was actually done with it at about 20 minutes. I endured an additional 10 minutes out of respect for her. She finally looked at me and said she was glad we didn't see it at the theatre. (Me Too)<br />If you have to spend the money, nearly any other movie would be a better buy.
B00005K3OT|5.0|A seemingly harmless plot folds into something scary in the sense that it reveals human nature when it comes to handling deviant behaviour in traditional, closed communities. A masterpiece from my fellow countryman.
B00005QZWI|5.0|While i was watching the movie LOTR...i realized that i was enthralled by the music.  Each time the brave central theme came on i was swept away and didn't even remember that it was a movie i was watching and not real life.  When i bought the soundtrack to this movie I was equally pleased.  The cd flows nicely and keeps with the plotline, unlike other soundtracks that jump from scene to scene throughout the movie.  The pieces with Enya are breathtaking, and i found myself singing along with her even though i didn't really know the words. The theme of the movie is there, but it isn't thrown in your face so many times that you could sing it in your sleep...the whole Cd was subtle and gentle, yet pulsed with life and beauty...What a perfect soundtrack...!
B000007489|4.0|I'm very surprised the current-day version of this band isn't mainstream. They may as well be with how much they say their name and brag about being in their band...but that's not the case here. The speed of songs like Suicide's An Alternative and Memories Of Tomorrow, the upbeat raw energy of I Saw Your Mommy, the doomy raw energy of I Shot The Devil, all one masterpiece after another. Although probably all fans will disagree with me, I actually think Institutionalized is the worst song on the CD, and especially in its place, since listening to a minute long song does not put me in listening mode for a four minute song. The lyrics also sound pretty forced, but then again, they are not great. But the music keeps me coming back, and you have to own this.
B00003CWTI|5.0|I liked Hard Eight, and while i was impressed with boogie nights, i did not think that it was as deserving of all the raves, although it was still a very good movie.  Magnolia however, i consider to be a nearly perfect film.  It is about the most important things in life, family, love, anger, forgiveness, lies, truth, sin and beauty, simultaneously sentimental and brutal, obvious and deceptive.   <BR>      The acting is inarguably superb, the most stunning facet of a film of much merit.  The notes are all perfectly played, not a beat is missed.   I consider this movie to be a masterpiece of plotting and editing; what could have been an overwritten mess seems intricately constructed and paced.  This film is considered by some to be too long, but after watching it several times i was unable to find one scene that could be removed or redone without damaging the film.<BR>      What i have come to realize that is most to the honor of this film is that it has really stayed with me as so few films do.   I find myself thinking of it often, and rethinking about its themes and characters.  I absolutely love magnolia.

0792833686|5.0|If you want to win someone over who thinks they hate musicals, you have two choices: show 'em something subversive, like &quot;Caberet&quot; (who knew musicals could have a bisexual love triangle!), or show them this: The single most joyful movie I've ever seen. I've never seen anyone not get caught up and charmed by this one. I'm sure I've watched this a dozen times, and it simply improves every time.  Even the &quot;Broadway Ballet&quot; that seems to derail the movie a bit the first time you see it instead becomes a little &quot;movie within a movie&quot;, and it repays repeated viewings.<br />The DVD package is a little disappointing. My VHS version has a deleted scene and an interview with the screenwriters - why not include these with the DVD? I was tempted to delete a star for this, but how could I give &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; anything less than 5 stars?

B00004X0ER|5.0|The Hives have been getting a lot of hype, along with the Strokes, White Stripes, etc. They deserve it, because the Hives are incredible. This cd is probably the best Epitaph have realeased, or will release. It's a feel good record. It sounds like a giant party. Songs like &quot;Die, All right&quot;, &quot;Main Offender&quot;, and &quot;Hate to Say I Told You So&quot; are garage punk at their best. If you want a cd you can pop in anytime and it gets you jumpin, get this cd. You won't regret it.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Wow eminems best album ever made. Eminem is my favorite rapper. I have almost all of his cds.  My favorite cd that he made was the Marshel Mathers LP. My most favorite songs on the Marshel Mathers LP are criminal,the real slim shady, who knew, kill you, and stan.  I highly recommend that you get off your  computer and buy this album, the Marshel Mathers LP...
B000002AP1|5.0|All though many will disagree with the fact that the Stooges are a punk band, they are the escence of punk rock. They were rude, they were ahead of their time, and they offended just about everyone that didn't live in Detroit. My first Stooges expierience was on Iggy Pop's &quot;Nude and Rude&quot;, a couple years back. I heard &quot;Now I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot;, and &quot;No Fun&quot;, on there. I was blown away. It was the most primal recordings of punk rock I have ever heard. Then I listened to &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; and &quot;Gimme Danger&quot;. They were both great songs, but something was missing. There was no kick to it. I bought &quot;Raw Power&quot; a little while after. I popped it in, and &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; was revitalized. It was amazing, there was finally a kick, a punch to it. This whole record is extremely loud. The opening &quot;1-2-3-4&quot; of &quot;Shake Appeal&quot; really helps kick start the song. &quot;I Need Somebody&quot; is a song that &quot;Black Sabbath wishes they could of wrote.&quot; <br />If you're just getting into the Stooges... buy all 3 cd's. They all have certain attributes to them. Their self titled cd is straight up garage rock, while &quot;Fun House&quot; sounds like a big jam session. &quot;Raw Power&quot; represents the Stooges at their best, and if you like any kind of Rock and Roll, this cd should be in your collection.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is too complex to do justice to right here. It is an entertaining and thought provoking story that will stick with you long after you are done.<br />The protagonist is Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin. He is brilliant. He is also a child. And the fate of mankind rests in his hands. As the story goes on he is given a level of pressure that few adults could handle, he is tested continually, he is set up for failure while knowing that he can never fail.<br />The pivotal scenes are at the end when he is essentially tricked into doing something that he is unaware of with far reaching effects and implications. And just when you think it cannot get any more compelling we find out that perhaps it was never as clear cut as we thought it all was.<br />The principal theme is war and the effects of war. The seeming inevitability of demonizing our enemies, of sacrificing our friends, and of losing our innocence along the way.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone that likes a thought provoking read with unforgettable characters. It does not matter if you are a fan of sci fi or not because all really good science fiction does is shine it's light back on us.
0446525537|5.0|The best book I've ever read, A Walk To Remember is truly a remarkable story of how true love can conqueur all. I've never cried so much. Nichalas Sparks is a great writer that keeps you turning the pages in this great love story. Landon a somewhat popular young man with many problems in his life falls in love with the school outcast and ministers daughter, Jamie Sullivan. As they become friends they begin to fall in love. They learn more about each other everyday that they are togeter.  Then tragedy strikes when Landon finds out that his Jamie is ill. Together they stay until the end as they learn that Miracles can happen. This book unlike most cheesy love stories gives you hope and understanding as to why things happen the way they do.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Legally Blonde is a must see if you like light comedies and love to laugh. Reese Witherspoon does a fabulous job of playing Elle Woods who is more than the vapid blonde that she initially seems like. <br />Elle Woods is a character that could be annoying in less capable hands but she instead she is portrayed as optimistic and bubbly but with the skills and intelligence to back it all up.<br />One of my favorite scenes starts out as a cliche. Elle is told that a college mixer is a costume party but of course - we have seen this one before - it isn't. She shows up dressed like a Playboy Bunny. In most cases the heroine would have been humiliated (as was the case in Bridget Jones) but Elle decided that she had nothing to be ashamed of and decided to have fun. I love that spirit. A few minutes later we were allowed to see her vulnerability in a different way when she realises that the guy she loves is the first one to underestimate her.<br />I am a fan of films that show the underdog winning out over the people that underestimate him or her. (Even if the underdog in this case is gorgeous and grew up across the street from Aaron Spelling). I own this DVD because it is one of my top feel good movies!
B00003CXBK|3.0|When my sister bought this fabulous Dvd in the US, I was instilled with wonder that many of you will have felt when encountering a Miyazaki film for the first time. However, when I recently watched some of Miyazaki's other works in a Miyazaki film festival, I've changed my opinion.<BR>     Don't get me wrong, I still love this movie, and I was impressed by the lack of any identifiable &quot;Bad Guy&quot;. The English dub was among the best I've seen (Bravo Neil Gaiman! All hail the greatest western comic author!), but the likes of Claire Danes irritated me to no end. I liked the use of English voice actors (well, only one I suppose), but it seems fundamentally wrong for one of the leading characters to have a whiny voice with an American twang to it (cough cough, Sai, cough cough).<BR>      As epic as some of his earlier films, yet with a depressingly cheesy ending. The musical score is catchy and fits the mood of the movie well, while the animation rolls on to capture your imagination. This being one of the first Miyazaki films to extensively use CG graphics, I feel they have mastered the art of electronically colouring scenes. But I felt the CG was used in such a way as to make the separation between hand drawn scenes and CG too obvious. I hope his next film, &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, they will make better use of CG morphing technology.<BR>       Unless trying to complete your Miyazaki collection, buy Nausicaa, Laputa, and Totoro first, otherwise leave this one for the odds and ends of your budget.
B00005QIPH|3.0|The Strokes have taken it back to the basics. Periodically, rock 'n' roll loses track of its roots and veers off into interesting (but distracting) directions. Punk helped refocus rock'n'roll and, although most of the punk bands weren't anything to write home about, they were authentic if nothing else.<br />Now we have The Strokes. Overhyped and overpraised, The Strokes manage to produce a solid debut. Will this band go the distance? Hard to say as many bands that were predicted for great things frequently failed (The Vapors, 4 NonBlondes), while those that didn't initially (The Beatles, Xtc)have produced stunning music. Predicting what awaits a rock band is like predicting what will happen in the stock market; no matter how accurate you might be about one aspect another will prove you wrong and stock will crash.<br />The songs are solid and most demonstrate a good (if rudimentary) understanding of basic songwriting. If this album had come out in the late 70's or early 80's, it would have been influential and hailed as a classic. As it stands, the lyrics are interesting, the songs well constructed and the playing good. The comparisons to bands like Television is a bit over the top. The one annoying aspect of this album is the production. While I like the overall sound of the album, the way the vocals are produced are annoying and make it difficult to understand (of course that critcism has been heard before as well with early REM). Perhaps the sound of the album just takes getting used to.<br />Is This It isn't the most powerful debut but it is more original than some writers here have given it credit for (certainly more original than Coldplay's Radiohead imitation). Everyone has to start somewhere. This isn't a stunningly bad debut nor is it brilliant. Then again, Radiohead's first album was very average. They've managed to produce a couple of stunning albums since then. I'd give The Strokes the benefit of two more albums before I'd suggest they were a waste of time. They have a unique something about them; they just need to develop their sound and mine their talent if they want to succeed.me. They have a unique something about them; they just need to develop their sound and mine their talent if they want to succeed.
0380788624|5.0|This book will satisfy every type of reader,from the historical fiction fan to the science fiction fan to the corporate drone who likes to dream. It is a book that spans half a century, from Japan in WWII to to the Phillipines today. It is a romance, an epic, a war story,and a business story. <BR>I have two critiques to make about it, however. It instoduces a fascinating female character who is plenty strong, then undermines her and makes her as weak as stereotypes would dictate. <BR>The ending is open, and makes me wonder what either possibility means. <BR>That's it. Otherwise, it is interesting, captivating, and worth buying.
B000002UAC|4.0|Meet The Beatles certainly lived up to its title; it acted as both introduction and an overview as to what the band was capable of at that point in time. The irony is that the Capitol release (with only 12 songs almost all originals) was actually superior to their UK and European releases. Why? Well, it featured both their best early singles and their best original album tracks (with the exception of Lennon-McCartney's Hold Me Tight which should have been replaced by either Twist and Shout or Money).<br />It's time for an upgrade so this time maybe we should feature both the American and British configurations of the album (this would still be less than 70 minutes). The songwriting on their second British album shows the band progressing by leaps and bounds. Not a Second Time, It Won't Be Long, All I've Got To Do, All My Loving are all top flight additions to the Lennon-McCartney songbook, while Harrison's Don't Bother Me demonstrates his budding talent as a songwriter.<br />They were still only recording with early technology so Harrison's guitar solos were usually written out and rehearsed. While this limited his ability to contribute to the songs, most of the solos are melodic outgrowths of the songs melody or chord progression. McCartney's bass playing hadn't yet reached the imaginative plateau of Rain or Paperback Writer but he does a credible job. Lennon was always an underrated rhythm guitarist. He helps drive home and increase the power of these songs. Ringo may have not been the most technically proficient but he managed to demonstrate that drummers could introduce just as much feeling into a song as a singer or guitarist could. He's also pretty darn steady.<br />A very good second effort that would allow the band to stretch out on their third and strongest early Beatle album A Hard Day's Night.
B000002IQW|5.0|I won't say that this is the best or the worst album from Skid Row. Each of their album comes from a different period.<br />Their debut showed more of a punk attutude, mostly from their bassist RACHEL BOLAN. It's quite raw, more direct and more crude.<br />SALVE TO THE GRIND album is heavier than the first one, more classic metal.<br />As for their subHuman Race, I would say that Pantera definitely has a little influence on them. It's rawer and more violent than any of their previous albums. It's I think, the least accessible.<br />I would give each of these albums a ***** rating.<br />I don't really have a favourite; each time I pop in one of their albums, I tell myself , &quot; May be this is their best album !!!&quot;. But then I change my mind as soon as I put in another album :)
B000000OQF|5.0|What to say about the greatest album of all time, perhaps? If infectious tunes like Welcome to the Jungle, or Sweet Child O' Mine aren't enough, I don't know what to add? Nighttrain, Out Ta Get Me, Mr.Brownstone, Rocket Queen, My Michelle? If there is an album that has neared perfection in terms of talent, quality, and quantity, it is not Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, nor AC/DC's Back In Black, it is this album. Anyone who likes rock, heavy metal, etc., should own this album. Mr.Brownstone is one of the best songs I've ever heard, and I was a kid in the 80's, and listened through the wimp bands of the likes Bon Jovi, Warrant, Motley Crue. No one could make such an effort, because none of the cited artists had the talent. If Guns N' Roses had not dismantled they would have surpassed the Rolling Stones over the years, with this album, and the Illusion album, and others they could have made. Or maybe they were a one album wonder. But as an old GnR fan, I suggest this album, and their Illusion albums as well. Those two CDs dont have the quality of this one, but they grow on you. I give it five stars, and I feel that anyone who listens to this album carefully would agree with me. ;-)...
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I've always been skeptikal about movies, especially musicals, I thought \\"Grease\\" was awsome, \\"Joseph and the Amazing...\\" seriously [was bad], \\"Sound of Music\\" was ok. But \\"Moulin Rouge\\" Was THE BEST. Ewan & Nicole made it seem like they had something going on off the set (*wink*wink*).

B000002J1C|5.0|_The Yes Album_ is a great place to start if you're new to Yes - not as \\"out there\\" as _Close to the Edge_, _Tales from Topographic Oceans_, or _Relayer_, but definitely more adventurous than their more stripped down 80's and 90's approach.  It contains some of their most played radio \\"hits\\" (\\"I've Seen All Good People\\", \\"Yours is no Disgrace\\", \\"Starship Trooper\\"), and it contains a nice balance between the different genres that Yes have always experimented with.  It's one of those albums that once you get into, you'll play it over and over again.  It especially highlights Steve Howe, Bill Bruford, and Chris Squire at their creative peaks - the early 70s.  Even people who normally *hate* a lot of Yes music, usually note that this as an excellent album.
6300182282|5.0|I have always been intrigued by this subject, always.<BR>Although I am happily married,I have always wondered about the  possibility of an outside affair that would have a couple both on the same level physically and mentally. This movie makes this look possible. The friendship, the passion and the love they share keep them young. I believe their relationship keeps their otherwise mundane lives, compelling. I am sure they grew and stretched their minds in ways that wouldn't have happened otherwise. Same Time, Next Year gives me the hope that this is possible, and if not, it gives me the dream of it.
B00003CXE6|5.0|There are good movies and there are great movies.  A great movie has the ability to transport the audience from mere spectator to participant.  Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR thrusts the viewer into ancient Roman history through the character of General Maximus Meridius.  He is a storied hero, a man with integrity and values, honorable to his lord, Emperor Marcus Aurelius.  Although the film is not completely accurate in its historicity, Scott gives enough fact to send the audience back in time to ancient Rome, during the reign of the Caesars.<br />The film begins on the battlefield with Rome engaging in one last conflict.  A victory will further expand the Empire and secure its quest for world domination, a worthy achievement for a Roman emperor.  Led by Maximus, the powerful Roman army overcomes the opposition in a bloody war scene, which is not for the meek and timid.  Victorious celebration follows, but Marcus Aurelius, aging and dying, is not completely satisfied.  He summons Maximus to his quarters and shares his feelings and wishes with him, as a father would a son.<br />Marcus Aurelius: There was a dream that was Rome. You could only whisper it.  Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish, it was so fragile.<br />Marcus Aurelius: You have proven your valor once again, Maximus. Let us hope for the last time.<br />Maximus Decimus Meridius: There is no one left to fight, sire.<br />Marcus Aurelius: There is always someone left to fight. How can I reward Rome's greatest general?<br />Maximus Decimus Meridius: Let me go home.<br />Marcus Aurelius: Ah, home.<br />These words set the tone for the remainder of the movie for indeed this would not be Maximus' last fight.  Marcus Aurelius' son, Commodus, would soon take over the reign of the great empire and almost instantaneously, the dream that was Rome would disappear.  As for Maximus, he would suffer through many a hardship, and find himself fighting for Rome, not as a general, but as a gladiator.<br />GLADIATOR is a great movie, and one of epic proportions.  It is so good that it can be watched repeatedly, with the audience standing in awe, learning something new with each showing.  This is a film with plenty of action thus satisfying those with a lust for bloody fight scenes.  Men especially will enjoy watching Maximus in his gladiator battles, but women will be enamored with his softer side.  He is a loyal family man, honorable, and a man of integrity.  It is also an educational movie for history lovers or anyone interested in ancient Roman history.  Scott paints a vivid  picture for audiences as he is acute to historical detail, such as the scenes from the Roman Colisseum, which give the audience a real sense of being there.  Moreover, Scott touches on some philosophical and sociological issues that will appease the intellectual mind as well.<br />GLADIATOR is a great movie, because it has a fine cast of actors, beginning with Russell Crowe (Maximus) in the lead role.  Crowe is perfect for the part, having lost around 40 lbs. to play the muscular general, his New Zealand accent adding a touch of a classic quality to the role.  His performance was outstanding and the success of the film depended on it.<br />Playing the part of the antagonist was Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus) who was equally sensational.  He was definitely in character as the evil ruler, but also excelled in his alter-ego, a very frightened little boy who could not live up to his father's wishes.  Moreover, the supporting cast was wonderful from top to bottom, but add two seasoned veterans like Richard Harris (Marcus Aurelius) and Oliver Reed (Proximo) to this list and you get a great movie.  On a sad note, Reed passed away soon after shooting the movie, but the film was dedicated to him in the credits.  His role as Proximo, the trainer of gladiators, was excellent as his character was both tough and funny.<br />In conclusion, many different qualities must come together to distinguish a good movie from a greatone, and Ridley Scott has hit on all eight cylinders.  GLADIATOR belongs in every family's movie archive, yes, it is that GREAT.a great one, and Ridley Scott has hit on all eight cylinders.

0446310786|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is, without a doubt, one of the best books I had to read in high school.  EVERYONE should read this book!<br />\\"Mockingbird\\" tells the story of a young tomboy, Scout, growing up in the South in the 1930s.  It deals with important lessons about racism, tolerance, courage, and justice.  Scout, representing the innocence of youth, has a much more accepting and egalitarian attitude that most of the other Southern whites in her community.  She tries to learn how to get along with everyone in a world where the simple act of talking to an African-American can lead to the undesirable label, \\"n*gger lover.\\"<br />My favorite quote is when Scout's father, Atticus, tells her:  \\"I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand.  It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway... you rarely win, but sometimes you do.\\"  <br />\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a very powerful book.  It will make you angry, make you laugh, and make you cry.  After you finish reading it, I highly recommend the film version starring Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch.

I'm both, so I really enjoyed this movie -- indeed, I have watched the racing scenes countless times.  Otherwise, you'll find the plot very silly, the screen play trashy, and the acting, while commendable, rather unsophisticated.<br />This movie reminds me of the 1990 Hong Kong flick called &quot;Off Road&quot; (a.k.a., Heroes of the Road), starring Jacky Cheung and Loretta Lee.  You may want to check it out as well if you enjoyed this one.
B000050XEI|2.0|I was really expecting something extra ordinary and instead was confronted with watered down Vangelis/Clanaad.  Yeah, the keyboards provide a decent texture and the vocals have that dreamy quality.  I think other artists have done a better job.
B000000H4V|5.0|Finally! HAHAHA! I found it! A true metal album! Sepultura's Chaos A.D. is incredible and should be owned by any metal fan. Forget Roots and Against! Forget that Soulfly garbage! THIS is what you want. After sampling some stuff off of this and Arise, I knew what I had to do. This is what I have to say:<br />Sepultura are extremely  talented. Max's growling, Igor's rapid-fire tribal-sounding drumming, and the lead guitar and bass work is nothing short of unbelievable. It's funny, because the singles \\"Territory,\\" and \\"Refuse/Resist,\\" are not the best songs on the CD. I prefer the thrashier songs, like \\"Slave New World,\\" \\"Biotech Is Godzilla,\\"(spare the name) and \\"Manifest\\". However, the best song on the CD is definitely \\"Nomad,\\" for its blend of heavyness and intrigue. The song isn't too fast, but it is played in a way that makes you want to mosh like crazy. \\"Kaiowas\\" is an awesome instrumental, and the Tribal Jam version(track 14) adds some cooler jungle elements to it. \\"The Hunt\\" is also a ripping track, and they add this effect/noise into it that makes it sound deep and menacing. Wicked! Also, the last track, the live one, just rocks! The second half of the song is ultra-heavy and super-fast, and in the middle, Max starts talking to the crowd and cursing off. It rocks! It's hard to not try and compare it to Arise and say, 'Oh, but Arise was SOOOO much faster and this is where they sold out...'. I think that's pretty wrong. This CD kicks, man!
B00003CXXP|1.0|...at least it felt like it lasted all summer!<BR>A.I. is a truly horrible mess of a movie with one of the<BR>worst (and longest) endings of all-time. It's worth seeing <BR>once - it's an audacious, honest attempt at bravura movie-making - but not purchasing. Combines the worst aspects of Mssrs. Spielberg and Kubrick. You'd be much better off<BR>with Close Encounters of the Third Kind or 2001: A Space<BR>Odyssey.
1587990717|4.0|Nassim Taleb, a successful options trader in his own right, takes an interesting &quot;intellectual&quot; look at the role of randomness, or &quot;luck&quot; in success.<br />One of the general theses of the book is that the risk that an actor took to gain their ex poste success must be factored in when determining the probability-adjusted success of that particular individual.<br />He weaves in extreme (and appropriate) examples to make this point - a janitor who plays lottery tickets (and wins) vs. a conservative dentist that cleans teeth but doesn't play lottery tickets.  If you would re-run their lives in some alternate histories, the dentist would come ahead, perhaps 999,999 out of 1,000,000 - you could hardly call the winning janitor more successful in other words. Absolutely, the one nit that I would make however is that such cases are not the rule, but the exception.  To determine the role of luck or randomness in these other cases would be nearly impossible, since we can't re-run lives.<br />He takes this issue (the role of randomness) and runs with it (correctly in my estimation) to make the point that extreme success in life is a result in many cases of such randomness - that a &quot;survivorship bias&quot; exists (in the media in particular) that focuses on those that succeeded in strategies that would not be successful in most cases - the home runs were hit in the same (but not in as extreme) example as the lottery winner.  Somebody has to win, just by random chance, and to ascribe this success solely to talent, skill, or insight is wrong.  And the media doesn't get this.<br />To some degree one might say that this is the rambling of a conservative professor who has been successful in hitting singles and doubles in life, but has missed the home runs.  And they would be right (I believe), however Mr. Taleb is correct to a degree in his statements.<br />Where I believe that he is wrong is in three areas.<br />First, successful people - those that add value to their area of expertise - are better able to determine the forward probabilities of decisions than the general public.  In practical terms, this might mean that they are better able to pick a good stock (ie the market might think it has a 20% likelihood of success, but based on their better skill or knowledge, they determine that the probability of success is closer to 60% - and they make a killing by bringing this knowledge to the market).<br />Second, people that take these risks (and succeed) - are the people that drive the world forward.  These are the entrepreneurs that make new discoveries, find new markets, and add wealth and prosperity to the people around them.  If you were to re-run their lives again perhaps they would turn out differently -- but then perhaps we would be the worse for it.<br />Third, and simply, luck counts.<br />Notwithstanding some of my comments, I really enjoyed this book, it made me really think about things, and my wife (a non-financial person) picked it up just devoured it as well.<br />4 Stars.dd value to their area of expertise - are better able to determine the forward probabilities of decisions than the general public.

B000002JST|5.0|Punk Blues? AC/DC are a blues band with a punk soul and Let There Be Rock is one of the finest examples of it. Angus is unbelievable on this lp. The jams are some of his fastest and Bon's voice has never been more raw and soulful. Go Down...Listening to this I can't help cheer Bon on and scream...Go Down! Go Down! I remember listening to this album and contemplating how could this album ever be outdone. Amazing enough they have and continue to. The band is without Bon today but the legacy continues on...with that jamming and that solid voice. And God said, &quot;LET THERE BE ROCK and He named it AC/DC!&quot;
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I must attack the people who made this movie, and those of you who liked it.  It is truely a piece of trash.  The characters are totally boring and undeveloped.  Maybe I am asking for to much?  How could they possibly develop characters when the movie is nothing more that a splatter of different scenes fused together with no specific thoughts or reasons. This movie doesn't make a mark anywhere except for the toilet.  It is horrible and the music is very much out of place.  Much like this movie would have been if I was unlucky enough to have bought it. I shudder at the thought.
B000001ZS8|5.0|Yeah, I own the entire Jarre catalog.  This recording was initial exposure to Jarre, which prompted me to get the rest.  Honestly, this stands out the most.  The blend of voices, instruments, and syntys creates a new world music that I wishe he'd revisit.  When I reach for a Jarre disc, this one causes me to listen from beginning to end without skipping tracks.
0140288503|5.0|Mark Bowden's Black Hawk Down is a riveting, gripping and illuminating account of the 1993 actions that occurred in Somalia when two Black Hawk helicopters were taken down and American Servicemen lost their lives.  The story reads almost as a novel and Mr. Bowden's writing style is detailed and incisive.  He doesn't inject his own political views into the story and doesn't provide conjecture on why the events happened and what could have been done to avoid them.  He just tells the servicemen's story and recounts the unbelievable situation that they found themselves in.  The mission seemed routine at the inception, but the men weren't prepared for the amount of artillery that the average Somailian carries on a daily basis.  Mr. Bowden makes you feel as if you are placed right into the firestorm and you get a real sense of the horrifying conditions. Black Hawk Down is a first rate book and worthy of all the accolades that have been bestowed upon it.
006016848X|1.0|Poor, poor John Gray! It is not his fault that the types whom he dealt with and whose problems were mentioned in this book - especially the female parties - are (pardon my expression) - if not fools - next to fools. Plus my rating does not apply to the authour's writing skills, or degrees, or advices (how else could<BR>he have dealt with problems of such creatures) etc etc.... Somehow, although I am very, very woman and that prefer a better world for women, this book has caused me to take men's side in some respects. One star applies to the types. What is wrong with the husband's getting stuck to his chair in front of TV? What is wrong if he wants to relax by starting reading a daily paper very shortly after he comes home from work? What is wrong if he tries to offer solutions to problems the wife is conplaining about? What is wrong if he does not listen much - or as deeply as the wife (J.G. puts) wants him to- to the 'mostly' unnecessary details? I can blame or accuse men in some respects but let's (we, women) realise their basic rights!!!! Human being - man or woman - does not like to listen to matters that are not interest to him or her. And of God , those 101 rules to win your wife's heart!!! Many of them made me wonder whether women expecting those rules to be complied really need husbands or slaves?! The guys certainly have to be interested in family matters and help the wives whenever possible. But I think that<BR>if woman respects his simple pleasures instead of being too sensitive about 'his listening to things that are not really of interest to him' , she will have chance to enjoy 'her own pleasures' , instead of having a 'nervous breakdown'. <br />Well there is an advice that worth to pay attention to : It is not important what you say , it is important how you say it. However , that applies to any relationship , and not only to relationship between married parties. <br />Another thing, this book cannot speak for every society or <BR>culture in the worldand that women need to have a lot of things 'BEFORE' what this book claims women should have .<BR>Plus it repeats things too many times. My last word about this book , yeah read the title.
0553812173|5.0|Erikson has written three books, Gardens of the Moon, Deadhouse Gates and Memories of ice.  This stuff is different.  Dark and compulsive with an indifference to character longevity that makes his warfare based stories seem all to real and his outcomes truly unpredictable.  Do not buy these books if you are looking for a relaxing read.
0871137380|5.0|After reading many of the reviews the overwhelming message is Bowden writes it straight up. Has to be true since I noticed one thing no one else reviewed. The fact that Bowden speaks of our small deployment force for this task. I am angered with our government, not for getting involved, but from this book we sent in way to small of a force. With that this book puts on display the bravery of the American Volunteer soldier. Being outgunned by more than 50 to 1 our men made it out of there in exceptionaly good shape given the conditions. This book has told me, we can't go into combat half ..... When we commit we need to further protect ourselves with much more military support, if we had done that in Somolia, I'm certain this book would never of been written, we would have kicked ... My purpose for the review, it's a real book, get it, Bowden has done a great work and presses a valuable message to our leaders, &quot;If you are going to send troops, do it with greater force than the enemy and stop putting our troops in harms way&quot;. <BR>I want to mention, if you enjoyed this book, check SB 1 or God, a fascinating battle in the middle east and Armageddon. By Karl Mark Maddox
0446605409|3.0|I can't say it's the best book I've ever read.  Detective Corey is pretty cool and I like his attitude but the story line seems very &quot;manufactured&quot; even with the twists.  It was as though characters were thrown in left, right, and centre to throw the reader off the plot.  I think I liked the setting of the book and the accuracy of certain elements more than the story line.  I just couldn't see how he deduced so quickly who the murderer was.  The last half is the best part of the book.  Overall, I'd prefer to see it as a movie.
B00005O5CM|3.0|Reese Witherspoon gives a completely likable and winning performance as Elle Woods, a fashion major who is jilted by her boyfriend, who she thinks is going to propose to her, but instead dumps her for not being serious enough.  He heads off to Harvard Law School and in an attempt to win him back, Elle applies for admission to Harvard and actually gets in.  While there she runs into all kinds of obstacles, including her former boyfriend's new fianc&eacute;e (Selma Blair in an underwritten role) and perseveres in her own sunshiny way.  The film is a total fantasy that expects one to suspend reality, as there is no way in real life anything that happens in the film would actually happen.  The plot is a little thin and it relies on many stereotypes such as the dumb blonde, airheaded California girls, stuffy, pretentious rich East Coast society people and others.  But despite the plot flaws, Ms. Witherspoon is so good, you find yourself being drawn in with her magnetic performance.  She hits all the right notes and appears to be on the verge of becoming a major star.  Legally Blonde is a guilty pleasure and worth watching for ninety minutes of good fun.
0783225857|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is arguably one of the greatest American films ever. You will never be dissapointed. However, do not waste your time with the commentary. I have bought some lousy DVD's (ex.&quot;Idle Hands&quot;) just for the joy of the inventive commentary. This is a classic with a horrible commentary. Director Robert Mulligan gives some good insight when he is allowed to speak. On the other hand Producer Alan Pakula (whose work I have always admired)unfortunately monopolizes the conversation, should have left the matter in Mulligan's hands and stayed out. His comments are interminably redundant: he must mentioned the key being the kid's point of view 800 times (have you no other thing to offer?), constant stroking of Mulligan whom he refers to monotonously in the third person (&quot;Bob&quot; does this or that)even though they are sitting beside one another, and frequently whispers his comments to Mulligan so as not to include the audience (perhaps a blessing, but annoying in its exclusion). One of the most aggravating issues is slighting the actors (except the kids and Peck), not introducing them or talking much about them and ignoring some amazing choices (chief among being Collin Wilcox just barely not touching the Bible as she prepares to testify and lie - brilliant or didn't they notice?). Buy the movie. Ignore the disservice they do to their own work by talking about it.
B000000OQF|5.0|15 years after its debut, this album still ROCKS hard!!  How many other CDs (especially from the 80s) can you say that about.  This album is and always will be a classic!!!<br />Would give it 6 stars if I could.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|This album contains one of the most overlooked songs of Dire Straits, namely the one entitled 'Single handed sailor'. That song is in my humble opinion one of the best ones by this band, which makes the album a must for all lovers of real music!
B00003CXB7|5.0|Robert Altman's M*A*S*H may take place during the Korean War, but the film is all about Vietnam.  Mr. Altman at the time had extreme left wing political views and used Korean as a stand in for the war that was raging on at the time in Vietnam.  By fusing the free love attitude of the counterculture and the lack of regard for authority of most of the 4077th's surgeons into a humorous film, he made light of things to hammer home his point that war is madness and people will do anything to cope.  M*A*S*H made stars of several young actors like Donald Sutherland and Elliot Gould who played the two irreverent leads, Hawkeye Pierce and Trapper John McIntyre respectively.  Mr. Sutherland is the backbone of the film and his portrayal of the Hawkeye is superb.  Mr. Gould is extremely funny and glib as Trapper John.  Other standout performances include Tom Skerritt as Duke, Robert Duvall as the fanatical Frank Burns and Sally Kellerman as the uptight Hop Lips Houlihan.  Mr. Altman wasn't well known at the time, but after the huge commercial and critical success of M*A*S*H, he became a major player and went on to make several hallmark films.  The bonus material on M*A*S*H is first rate, especially the AMC Backstory feature which provides tremendous insight into the making of the film and is just as entertaining as the film itself.
0062502182|5.0|I read the review on the book and find it disgusting how some people are calling this novel cunning and cleverely written for making it a bestseller. Well the message from me to these overgrown grown ups is to make and effort and make their life less complicated. Probably they were looking for another self help book, which will solve all their lifes misery. Or probably they are too skeptical about their own lives. Or they can't expect life to be so simple, they will only appreciate a thick book which will give all the methods avaialable in this world to solve all sorts of problems and they could get a return for each penny they spent on it.So they drill down a simple story. Well maybe for them following their dreams is too unrealistic, they accept life in its full pessimism. Or maybe they don't like people who follow their dreams. Whatever is the problem with these folks, I think they are missing the message. The message is live your dreams even if it is gold, live with your heart and to its full capacity. So go ahead and read the novel, forget about the skeptics, they want to get all their lives problems solved by reading one book. The purpose of life is to live, don't make it overly complicated.

B00005LB9O|3.0|It's hard not to love Travis. I hear them interviewed on a local radio station a lot and they're smart, nice guys. They appear to be good, decent people. Their last album Man Who had some great pop tracks and my expectations were high for this new effort. However, the songs on this latest effort are almost unbearable for me to listen to, so precious and almost sanctimonious and I have to say it--trite. Listening to the album, I can detect the solid talent that is Travis, but their approach was too sentimental, as if they were trying to please a certain audience. In the end, the songs here are fogettable and confectionary. Worst of all, they sound like mainstream &quot;adult rock,&quot; the kind of music my mother listened to when I was a teenager. I look forward to a little less sentimentality on Travis' next effort. Meanwhile, they will have to linger in the shadows of Cold Play, Remy Zero, and Starsailor.
B00003CXTG|4.0|History lesson and a love story all in one. Movies are entertainment and this DVD was packed with a visual audio and strong parallel story lines. Long on time but held my attention. Please note this was my first DVD viewing and I found it to be memorable. Truly felt as though I was viewing from the movie theatre.<br />This movie should appeal to men and women as the love story can not be viewed as merely a chick flick when there is so much action going on with the war scenes. There is fighting and violence but it is tempered with real emotion and real connection. The friendship portrayed between the two lead male characters is parallel to the love they share for the same women.<br />Just an all around good story!
B000002NJS|5.0|This is definitely my favorite Madonna CD. There is a definite change from her previous CDs, whereas there's not so much \\"sex talk\\" in her songs: the texts here are rather of spiritual nature. Madonna's voice is also at her best and she enjoys playing with it, showing how the intense training she went through for the making of \\"Evita\\" has left its mark on her ability to perform greatly every style and to convey feelings and moods.<br />This CD contains some \\"dance\\" songs but also some rather calm, reflective songs. My 2 years old really likes \\"Little Star\\", a goodnight song Madonna wrote for her daughter. Madonna shares her happiness for becoming a mother in another song, \\"Substitute for love\\" and gives hints of how motherhood changed her life in various other songs, like \\"Sky fits Heaven\\".<br />A great buy for all music enthusuasts, not only for Madonna fans.
B000059TPN|5.0|I don't know what Timothy1146's problem is, but I know that this is a great movie. Not really any unbelievably parts and action and humor all around.
B000059MEK|5.0|What an awesome album. Up-beat tempo and loads of fun. Keeps you on your toes! This is a great album to dance to or exercise to. It changes your mood and fills you with energy and fun. The best song on the album is &quot;harder, better, faster, stronger&quot; i listen to it always, and never get sick of it. This album is a mix of techno, house, and electro sound. If you don't have this album, your cd collection is not complete.
0385335482|3.0|&quot;Confessions&quot; is a light and fun but rather predictable read, which ,btw should not suprise you too much as it is very formulaic in it's presentation. However, the one principal thing that  Kinsella does is to manage to give the characters distintinct voices and personality, unlike a lot of fluffy books where the characters are more apt to being generalized and stereotyped (even though they work the same formula).<br />While the characters here are not exactly unique and original, they are not overtly boring at the same time. It's a great no-brainer read that is hilarious at some points and merely funny in others. The only strong point, in my humble opinion, is that Kinsella is a strong writer and she can put together a plot or five together and crate a quirky world that I can relate to being female and holder of many credit cards.<br />Bottom line: Recommended for a 'light' read and worth the effort. worth purchasing as a used book or borrowed from the library.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is by far the most amazing nu-metal band to come around. They mix everyhing togeather to make a cd that is perfect in almost every way. There is not a single song on this cd that is not good though a few are a little different like crawling it is slightly slower but amazing. There first single One Step Closer is also amazing though it has gotten kinda played out and the other songs on the cd are certainlybetter. Songs like With you and In the End are brethtaking and no matter how many times you lisen to them you will never get tired of the band. They are by far my FAVORITE BAND!!!
B0000508U6|4.0|hum... well, okay... this is not really the best album of 2000, in my opinion... well, because i think KID A is incredible... but, i bought this album just after i knew the first single &quot;shiver&quot;... and i knew somehow this was going to be... hum.. the kind of music i needed to hear. and it really worked. in years i've never heard music that really makes me homesick in a weird kind of way, i mean, i didn't (and couldn't) grow with this album, but somehow when i heard it it seemed so familiar and it seemed to be filled with memories of my life and all that stuff so it is impossible to tell exactly what happens to me with this one... the thing is, hum, give it a try... it is the most emotionally intelligent (??) music i ve heard in years (after radiohead, of course) if you like radiohead or travis, well, this stuff is more simple, direct. somehow its sort of neil young influenced, more than all the radiohead thing everyone seems to link to coldplay. travis uses more arrangements and guitar effects. this guys seem to have just only one multi effect but, this is great for rainy days, sitting next to the chimney, staring at the window, etc... if you understood the last phrase, then this is for you... (sorry, my mind is wandering these days) please try &quot;we never change&quot; and &quot;sparks&quot;. you will be haunted by this.
B00005ARDC|5.0|I have to say I loved this album from the very first moments I heard the opening track proper.Okay it starts off with a 50 second strumming up of guitars-but once the sound takes off you're blown away.Acoustic guitar leads into the heaviest of bass drum beats,then the strong and deep bass kicks in and to complete the sound of very heavy fuzzed up guitars give the sound a lot more beef.I haven't heard this sound since the great albums by Jesus And Mary Chain and of course My Bloody Valentine's 'Loveless' album,though I would have to say it's a bit more melodic then that c.d.The vocal's are shared between Peter Hayes and Robert Turner,in fact they seem to take turns in most things bar the drumming which is done by the 3rd member of the band Nick Jago.There are so many good tracks on this c.d.,that it's hard to isolate any one in particular-the only track I'm not sure about is the closing track.On that track the lyrics are not what you'd expect from a band of this sort and I'm not sure if they're just being ironic?All of the tracks have a pulsating drum-beat behind them.The guitars are really heavy at times.You get plenty of feedback and distortion.But they are more full bodied then being just a mere guitar band as on some tracks like the phenomenal track 5 \\"White Palms\\" the whole song is driven by the bass.The sound is like something we haven't heard in a long time.<br /> Some of the songs have plenty of swagger about them.They are a pretty confrontational band with plenty of attitude.This attitude isn't illustrated by use of \\"shock\\" tactic lyrics that we here lots of now.The attitude is totally musically based.Songs like the 3rd track,\\"Whatever Happened To My Rock And Roll\\" almost has an Oasis sound to it-but this would be from their best \\"Definitely Maybe\\" period.Track 9 seem to borrow a riff from Norman Greenbaum's \\"Spirit In The Sky\\" before it gets swallowed in a cacophany of guitars,bass and those drums.Track4 has guitars that intially give it a sort of gothic sound-before the noisy chorus.Track 5 is just the best song I've heard in years-if there's a better one this year I'll be dying to hear it!Track 7 starts off with 2 minutes of a strange vocal chant,before it leads into the most Jesus And Mary Chain track you'll hear.Guitar riffs go off into strange places before we reach a more conventional sound for the chorus.The next track is the only slow track on the c.d. and at times between vocals and guitar sound it could have been a raw out-take from Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\" c.d.<br /> Right now American bands are bringing out the best indie rock c.d.'s.The future looks a lot brighter with The Strokes,The White Stripes and now B.R.M.C.What makes it even more interesting is that each band has it's own very distinct sound.Hopefully these sounds will help get rid of the phoney Nu-Metal sound.
B000009QPG|5.0|This CD is pure genius, Kerry King kicks [butt] and Jeff Hanneman sure knows what he's doing, Tom Araya knows how to put the scream into the vocals and Paul Bostaph put it in stone that War Ensemble is an anthem and always will be. Dead Skin Mask is what makes guitar a creative instument and Seasons In The Abyss the song is way strange, an excellent song. This CD is a great thrash album and is a must buy for any Slayer fan and if you don't want to look like a poser, buy this and then buy Reign In Blood. DO IT!
0679892478|5.0|My 4 yo son has several Suess board books in the car.  They are sturdy and perfect for road trips.  His favorite is 10 Apples Up On Top, because he loves to count, and this is a book that he can \\"read\\" on his own after hearing me read it once.  He likes for me to read it to him too, because he loves the sing song rhyming of Dr. Suess.
B00003CXSM|2.0|Yes, I am one of those women who loves a good romantic comedy -- I've watched so many, and will watch so many more.  But the key word here is GOOD romantic comedy.  Sadly, this movie was not good.  Matthew tried, J-Lo tried, heck, they all TRIED, but it was just too cheesy to save.  Why was it necesary for J-low to mention the m&ms quote?  As if this was some romantic thing he had mentioned before.  He just likes the brown ones, and for a stupid reason. Let it go.  This movie was so badly written it never stood a chance.  J-Lo we loved you as Selena, Matthew, you did a great job in A Time To Kill, so what possesed you to make this movie?  The world may never know. If you want to see a much better written romantic comedy that didn't receive nearly as much press, check out 'Just Write' starring Jeremy Pivon and the guy who played J-Lo's father, he did much better in this movie.  Also check out 'Music from another room' very good.
B00005RHGK|4.0|I would recommend renting this movie just to see the first 40 minutes. They are very frightening. You'll be on the edge of your seat the entire time. The second half is good, but not as scary as the first. Still, I would highly recommend this movie.
6304595247|2.0|I have never seen a period piece that I did not like. I now have. This film was surprisingly bad. In fact, on top of being disappointed, I was shocked by how bad it was. It is hard to believe that such a great, gothic story of star cross lovers, Cathy and Heathcliff, and their doomed families, the Earnshaws and the Lintons, has come to this, a travesty of a film. It conveys all of the abject misery contained in the novel, but none of its saving graces.<br />While this is a film that attempts to tell the entire story, chapter and verse, unlike its 1939 predecessor with Laurence Olivier, it still fails. The main problem is the miscasting of Juliette Binoche. While Ms. Binoche is, undoubtedly, lovely looking and a fine actress, her portrayal of an English girl, Cathy Earnshaw, falls flat. She is unable to fashion a credible English accent. Her underlying French accent is very distracting. Moreover, cast in the dual role of her daughter, Catherine Linton, with the same jarring accent is maddening. One never forgets that she is Juliette Binoche. She also, unfortunately, plays both roles in the same fashion. There is no attempt at any characterization or differentiation between the two other than a blowsy, blonde wig. Like mother, like daughter, I suppose. The roles were a definite overreach for Ms. Binoche.<br />Ralph Fiennes, on the other hand, is well suited to the role of Heathcliff, whom he plays with the intensity demanded of the character. Yet, he, an accomplished actor and worthy of the part, falls short of the mark. While there were glimmers of humanity and a certain poignancy to some of his babarous actions, it was not consistent enough to make the character come across as anything more than a cruelly depraved, miserable slob, rather than an anguished and passionate human being. In fact, his performance fails to make the viewer think anything but &quot;good riddance&quot; at the end. This, however, is the failure of the director, Peter Kosminsky. What was he thinking?<br />It was, however, enjoyable to see Jeremy Northam in the small  role of Hindsley Earnshaw. Now, he would make an intriguing Heathcliff. If one has seen Northam in &quot;Voices From A Locked Room&quot;, one would know what I mean. He has definitely got what it takes.<br />If you do not love period pieces, deduct one start from my review.

B00005QGAX|5.0|I never bought the original back in 1987, as I just became now a fan of MJ, and was just recently introduced to all his music. I bought all his re-released remastered albums (Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous) and bought his new album, Invicible, and all his new singles. This album, BAD, is really the best to be able to dance to. It is just sooooooooooo good, I can't explain it. Every track just makes puts me in the &quot;chase a girl&quot; or &quot;come with me, or get out of my way&quot; mood, you have no idea. Michael Jackson is truly a work of art. He's the KING!<br />MJ FOREVER!<BR>Steve
B00005QGAV|5.0|In grand style with the DANGEROUS CD. I remember listening to it back in 1991 and marveling at the way Teddy Riley fused his driving beats behind the King of Pop, a la Bobby Brown, Boy George, Heavy D and the Boyz and so on. Only, it sounded a whole lot better with Michael. Listening to this remastered version made me bop my head, then do the intricate dance steps MJ mastered back in the day. Those first six songs were KILLERS!!! <br />I got mad all over again, as I did back in the day when I begged for a remix version of \\"She Drives Me Wild...\\" \\"Remember the Time\\" was classic Michael, and should have won him a Grammy. \\"Jam\\" was 90's James Brown, as was \\"Why you Wanna Trip On Me...\\" \\"Who Is It\\" was a serious cut, and if anyone ever listened to the Brothers In Rhythm Remix House version, you knew the deal. \\"Keep The Faith\\" and \\"Will You Be There\\" provided spiritual moments, \\"Give In To Me\\" and \\"Black And White\\" alternative Rock moments. \\"Gone Too Soon\\" inspired me in more ways than one.. <br />It's funny: The song I listen to most these days is the title track that closed this masterpiece. It has a sinister, yet hypnotic groove that you can't help but move to. And the last minute where he just lets Teddy F*&@ it up (Only adding trademark scats and yelps) was pure genious. This was a truly underrated CD. Better than INVINCIBLE, HISTORY and BAD, to the level of THRILLER, and not quite OFF THE WALL, the one that was his best work.
B00005JKG5|5.0|Okay, I've read some of the negative reviews on Flashdance, and all I can say is they make me feel sick!  &quot;Flashdance&quot; is a cultural icon that started so much that we commonly see today in film. I was 2 years old when this movie came out...My mother took me to see it, for reasons that are unknown. However, since that day back in 1983, this movie has been a part of my life in every way. Jennifer Beals is an angel that is extremely under-appreciated. I am an avid collector of Flashdance memoribilia, which most people find odd for a 21 year old guy.  But Hey! It touched me in a weird way, and it really affected me with its serious and powerful meaning. &quot;Take your passion and make it happen&quot;  Is there a better phrase for inspirational motivation?   No, I dont think so!

B000007OY0|5.0|&quot;Hope is a good thing...maybe the best thing.&quot;  So is this movie.
B000002JB3|4.0|&quot;Both sides&quot; was really big step down, but Phil reminds us that he still didn't lost IT. It deserves 4 and 1/2 stars. The best song is &quot;wear my hat&quot; to me...it's funny, it really puts a smile on your face. Title song is also great. I pesonally like 2nd part of album. In 80'es Phil was big star 'cause of his own albums and 'cause he gave us many great albums with Genesis. But in 90'es he dissappear. This is only album from 90'es that he shows us that he is still here...that he is happy, crazy and funny like always. Great album. There is easy listening like &quot;the same moon&quot; and uptempo songs like &quot;river so wide&quot;. I love this album. I you like Phil, buy this one.
B0000070SN|5.0|Hawkwind is woefully underrated here in the states. This album captures them live at their best. True, the material is pretentious and a bit dated, but... Hey, it's got pre-Motorhead Lemmy! How can you go wrong?! Along with a few early Floyd albums, this practically defines prog/space rock at its best. If you enjoyed Pink Floyd Live in Pompeii, you owe it to yourself to get this album.
B00004U8JU|4.0|The book was good.  The movie is good also.  Steven Spielberg's box office hit \\"Jurassic Park\\" is good enough to rival \\"Jaws\\" (well, maybe not).  The story is a very original one, even thought Michael Crichton thought it up.  Richard Attenborough owns and finances a huge island amusement park.  Why is it so special?  Because it's populated with cloned dinosaurs!  <BR>Sam Neill is perfect in the role of Dr. Grant, the dinosaur-loving scientist who, along with his assistant/girlfriend, is invited to review the Park.  Jeff Goldblum provides comic relief as a mathematician who is invited also for reasons unknown.  <BR>And what's a plot without a problem?  After losing electrical power, several vicious dinosaurs escape and wreak havoc on our characters (but where did all the hundreds of Park employees go?  Spielberg never got around to that).  And the computer-animated special effects are AWESOME!  <BR>\\"Jurassic Park\\" boats several very frightening scens, particularly where a pair of deadly raptors stalk Attenborough's grandchildren in a kitchen.  And then there's the infamous part involving a jeep and the T-rex.  <BR>Spielberg has done it again!  He has created a modern classic!  Kudos go to Goldblum, who really makes this film memorable.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney's Junior album \\"Britney\\" may seem like a more adult album, and it is.Britney is now aiming toward a more adult audience with her music, & so far her transformation is going great.Some great songs on her album include \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", \\"Overprotected\\", \\"Lonely\\" (my personal fave), \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\", \\"Bombastic Love\\" & Britney's remix of \\"I Love Rock N' Roll\\". Now I love every song on this CD, but those are my faves out of them all! Trust me, ths album is 5-Star material! Buy it today!  :)
0790729628|4.0|After seeing \\"Blade Runner,\\" i'm fearing the future.  Ridley Scott (director) paints a rather vivid and disturbing picutre of what L.A. will look like in the furute.  Harrison Ford's portrayal of a worn-out detective is rather bland, and it is the impressive special effects and art direction that saves this film.  The futuristic setting is dark, rainy, neon-lit, smoky, slimy, and polluted.  Is this what L.A. will look like in seventeen years?  I certainly hope not.  <BR>The plot could have been interesting.  Several \\"replicants\\" (robots) have been unleashed in L.A., and detective Ford is assigned to track down and kill them.  The film moves at a slow pace, but it saved by the fight scene at the end.  <BR>This movie could be much better.  The whole idea of Ford's character being a robot is laughable.  His voice-over narration sounds like he's drunk and sunken...
B00005ND42|5.0|No one even came close to recording the Beethoven Sonatas as well as Oistrakh and Oborin, the two play as though they were one.<br />While one can argue that the tempos may stray from Beethoven's markings, I dare you to try to find a recording more full of emotion and warmth and that is the most important element to me. Music means nothing if it has no feeling even if it is perfectly executed. The melodies soar like they should and Beethoven would have no choice but to smile if he heard these performances.<br />It may be true that some or even many of Oistrakh's recordings do not sound unlike a performance in a tin can, that is simply not the case here. <br />Fortunately for all of us, this set was reissued very recently.
B00000ILDF|2.0|Directed by David Fincher, &quot;Alien 3&quot; is . . . well, let's face it . . . pitiful.  Not even thrilling, it can't even compare to the pair of semi-classics which followed before it.  The story is weak, the acting bland, the special effects so-average-it's-not-funny, and the entire idea is just dumb.  After two great predecessors, what do you expect?  Okay, maybe sequels are good, but after that?  You have nothing.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Disney was moving in a new direction of animation in 1982.  What better vehicle to use but computers and the video game arena which was the rage of the early 80's.<br />In 1982 CGI (Computer Generated Images) was the leading edge of computer technology and the video gamers were spending millions to play these images.<br />TRON was and still is a timeless one of a kind \\"computer game fantasy\\" which allows us inside the world of the video game.  To be controlled by the users (players) on the \\"Game Grid\\" of TRON.<br />The 20th Anniversary TRON movie now in WideScreeen & Enhanced for 16:9 HDTV is spectacular.  Even with todays video standards 1982's TRON holds its own.  If you have a Progressive Scan ready (480p) TV and DVD Player with Component video then TRON is unbelievable to watch!!!<br />Summary:  Ejected Software Engineer Flynn (Jeff Bridges) using a company workstation, tries to illegally hack into his former employers (ENCOM) mainframe to retrieve his stolen game programs. The MCP (Master Control Program) detects his Clu program. Through the magic of fantasy Flynn is brought into the MCP to battle for his life on the \\"Game Grid\\".  He meets the TRON program (a program made to defeat the MCP - played by Bruce Boxleitner) and together try to defeat the Master Control Program.  The adventure is imaginative, colorful and amazing to watch.<br />This is a one of a kind movie.  There has been no other imitators or sequels made.  It is a unique and spectacular visual experience to watch with an innovative sound track by Wendy Carlos. <br />This is a classic Home Theatre movie to watch again & again.  Enjoy.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Hey eveyone, what are you doing out there? come and see this moviw. on DVD! it's the best movie created. before, when people ask me what my favorite movie is, i would say, i don't know. but now, i'll sy, MOULIN ROUGE!. everything here is good. even though it owon 3 gloden globes awards, and a beautiful mind won 4, which is fairly reasonable, 'cause it's also a good, 5-star film, but not as good as MOULIN ROUGE! acting was very great, camera angle was excellent, lighting was amazing in some place, and average on other, and the theme of the story, love---was the best. hope it'll get to oscars. ithought the director and music composer were very cool, and they have tellent. and mcgregor, cool, handsome. kidman, beautiful, pretty, attractive, very nice. the song track was good too, buy the sound track and this dvd.
630463949X|5.0|I've always been somewhat of a fan of Fleetwood Mac,especially Stevie Nicks. While watching this DVD I was truly inspired by them. Why didn't I ever go see them in person? They were just awesome the way they performed together on this stage. Mick is still an animal on the drums. Lindsey can hold his own too. And Stevie...well need I say more. Her performance with Gold Dust Woman brought a tear to my eye. The encore of this concert is un-believable...worth getting the DVD just for the last 3 songs.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is the top movie. When the Oscar's come out it is no contest. To better this would be to exceed the speed of light.<BR>I have seen it twice and it got better the second time. I watched my date try to figure out \\"Who is real?\\" \\"What is real.\\" Crowe does a superb job of moving in and out of the mind of John Nash. He is even better than Dustin Hoffman in \\"Rainman\\" And that is saying something right there. But the entire cast is right on, start to finish. Don't miss it. When it comes out in DVD, I will Have a copy on day one!
B00005U122|3.0|This DVD was pretty much a disappointment to me. I love Pink Floyd, but I cant compare this to Floyd. Sure the music was there but not the electricity.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Im sorry all of you star wars fans out there but I did not enjoy this movie at all.I found it very boring.Many times i found myself almost falling asleep.I think one of the main reasons i didnt enjoy this film is because of jake lloyd, who plays Anakin, and Jar Jar Binks. i found that Jake lloyd didnt do well, it seemed like he was yelling, not talking.It seems unrealistic that he could turn out to be Darth Vader.Jar Jar Binks seemed to ruin the the whole serious mood of all the previous Star Wars films.Also, all of the pre-hype on Samual L. Jackson, didnt live up.He didnt have a big role, and i was disapointed.<br />I'm a very big Star Wars fan, but i didnt enjoy this one.Im praying that Star Wars:Episode 2 Attack of the Clones is much better, or I wont be seeing the other films that are coming.<br />Yet again, to all of you die hard fans, i say i'm sorry.
B00000K0DT|5.0|&quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; is one of those movies that you will either hate or love, based on your mood or your experience with movies like these.<BR>The movie ends with a revelation that makes the whole movie either really cool or completely pointless...I won't say more than that on the subject.<BR>It is scripted wonderfully, with the characters being introduced and developed relatively quickly and effectively. The acting is also superb (I believe Kevin Spacey was nominated for Best Supporting Actor...he may even have won it). <BR>I found this to be fun movie with a storyline that unravels in a delightful fashion. Highly reccommended, but rent it first.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This movie deserves all of the recognition that it has been getting.This movie is truley inspirirng, and brought to life by the amazing acting jobs done by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and Ed Harris.<br />First, i must say Jennifer connelly, and Russell crowe work magic together.Jennifer Connelly does a great job as Alicia Nash.She has won many awards for her role including a golden globe, and she deserves the oscar, hands down.Her love and sorrow for John Nash seem so real.Her devotion and care is outstanding.<br />Second comes Russell Crowe.He is truley amazing.He deserves to get his second oscar in a row.He makes John Nash come to life in front of our eyes.This role is hands down the best acting job of the year.His skitzophrenia and paranoia is outstanding.It seems so real.<br />On a side note, Ed Harris works magic in his supporting role, and director Ron Howard is simple riveting.Hands down, this movie deserves five oscars.<BR>Russell Crowe-best actor <BR>Jennifer Connelly-actress<br />Ed Harris-supporting actor<BR>Ron Howard-director<BR>A BEAUTIFUL MIND-picture<br />Everybody should go see this movie if they want to see an amazing movie, or you should see this movie if you want to see performances br Russell Crowe,Jennifer Connelly, and Ed Harris that are simply mesmorising.This is a beautiful picture.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Nearly 700 reviews written and not a word about the gay subtext of this techinically brilliant and poignant movie. After so many other theatrical works which have explicitly dealt with the AIDS crisis along comes this movie to speak about a forgotten subject but only through allusion.  Barely disguising a dazzling gay iconography and in the wonderful tradition of the musical, the writers tell us that the story of love is still worth telling even in an era of loves lost. I'd offer this film one more star if its message had been more meaningfully heard.
B000002J1U|4.0|I was reluctant to buy this album at first, hearing that it was one of Zeppelin's lesser efforts. Now I'm glad I did. Although it doesn't quite measure up to ZOSO and Physical Graffiti, LZ III is still a notable and worthy part of the Zeppelin catalog. Rejected by some because of it's high level of acoustic guitar and folk song sound, LZ III still has plenty of the variety fans have come to expect from Zeppelin albums. The styles range from hard rockers (the classic Immigrant Song, Celebration Day, and Out On the Tiles) to blues (Since I've Been Loving You) to just plain weird (Hats Off to Roy Harper) and of course folk (basically everything else). Most consider this an album for diehard fans only, but I say no Zeppelin collection is complete without it.
B00005NTJK|4.0|Im always suspicious at reworkings/mastering of the orginal tapes...however id did find some things appearing brillant and clearer and other instrumental passages a bit mute then their predecesors. Benefit remains a very dark personal album like Minstrel In the Gallery but still ranks up there with of course Stand Up and Aqualung. To pick a favorite Tull album is difficult and one should sample everything from this innovative genius writer Ian Anderson and Company.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Everyone knows this is the best cd ever,every rap fan should  have it,if your a mainstream rap fan,listen to disc one,it has how do you want it,life goes on,america's 2 most wanted,all about you,california love,and only God can judge me,if you want a hardcore beats and lyrics listen to disc 2,even though i like disc 1 better,cause it has less guests i love disc 2 too,if your a hip hop fan this is a essential album,along with illmatic,chronic,doggystyle,me against the world,straight outta compton,and ready to die.
0345413377|5.0|I have read so many other books declared as classics; like Harry Potter, Narnia, and A Wrinkle in Time and this is completely better.  And is tied with Lord of the Rings as one of the best all time books.<BR>Non-fantasy books that make statements about society like Farenheit 451 or White Noise, fall short of this satire on today's society with the most beautiful metafore ever conjured up, The Subtle Knife.  <BR>This series points out that the downfall of society occurs when we create things (like the Ring to rule them all in Lord of the Rings), and the only way to salvage is through love.  While most Fantasy books are just an adventure this book accompanies every place, everywhere.  <br />This will be the last book you'll have to read, I've never read/watched anything better than this before, translated: Best Book Ever.
B00000055E|2.0|I love Pac,and think he's the best ever,but this cd isn't that good,the beats don't fit the delivery,if your so desperate to hear pac's voice again get it,but if not,get something before he died and had a say in what the beat was,and wasn't Suge making money off Pac's soul.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|If &quot;New York, New York&quot; (track 1) would have set the tone for the entire Ryan Adams CD, it would have been, hands down, the best album of the year.  The ebullient flare of the first song is held onto for about seven or eight tracks, then gradually fades, leaving the last half of the album missing something.  It's still a great album to listen to, and even the mediocre songs have flashes of brilliance or small moments that refuse to leave your memory.<BR>While listening to this album, I picked up on Adams' similarities to older musicians such as Van Morrisson, Tom Waits, The Rolling Stones, and Willie Nelson.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This movie is a travesty. I am sure those who liked it were either stoned or bribed. I think to really appreciate this movie you need to have 75% of of your brain removed. It is camp, cliched and unimaginative. I will never watch a movie by Baz Luhrmann again.
B000002UAO|4.0|It is pretty much agreed upon that the Beatles were a pretty outstanding little group. Their earliest days, long before their navy jackets or cryptic lyrics, were no exception. The classic tunes they produced from 1962 to 1964 were as clever, charming and irresistibly catchy as rock and roll gets. 1965's Rubber Soul, however, is where boys became men. After three years of charming millions with their coy ear candy, the Beatles became distinctly more artistic on this superb release. Songs such as \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"In My Life\\" took a broader view of life than the earlier adolescent girl-charming, lovey-dovey pop tunes and even their songs centered around girls and love, such as \\"I'm Look Through You,\\" \\"Run For Your Life\\" and \\"Drive My Car\\" are more multifaceted and intense than ever before. Musically, as well as lyrically, the group broadened their horizons. Styles once foreign to pop music such as gospel and folk were interwoven with the LP, the harmonies became more complex and George Harrison brought the sitar into rock music with the beautiful \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown).\\" What's more, the Beatles make this transition without loosing their poprock charm. Many songs of Rubber Soul are as clever, infectious and even danceable as anything they had ever produced. They did not snub their poprock past; they merely set a new standard for its future. Rubber Soul is indeed a turning point for the Beatles, a milestone for rock music and a fine album.<br />Many fans even place it next to or even above such latter classics as Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and the White Album. I would not go that far. Despite being more experimental and ambitious than anything the Beatles (or practically anyone else) had ever produced before it, there are still some kinks present on Rubber Soul. Mr. Harrison was not quite ripe for the spotlight. His songwriting contributions, \\"Think For Yourself\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" sound forced and overintelletualized and the usually incomparable songwriting team of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who, incase you have been living under a rock for forty years, composed a majority of the group's songs, produced two utter duds, \\"Girl\\" and \\"Michelle\\" (\\"Michelle, my bell/These are words that go to together well/My Michelle\\" *ugh*). Despite the average reviews granting Rubber Soul five stars, I just can't give it a perfect score. It is not the Beatles' first masterpiece or a flawless album. It is, however, an important step and an excellent start towards true greatness.
0380715430|4.0|Bill Bryson, better known for his travelogues, writes a fascinating (and not-quite-correct) introduction to English etymology.  Besides exploring the origins of the language, it also traces the varieties of English.  <br />His explorations of American and British slang are the most complete and correct.  When straying further than those, however, he misses the mark.  His grasp of Australian grammar and slang shows that he's been there (which is certainly better than others who have commented on it), but only as a tourist.  Live there, and you'll find a very different linguistic Australia.  <br />Like Bryson's travel writing, this book isn't so much a cohesive piece of writing as it is a series of well-written anecdotes.  There are some places where the continuity is somewhat lacking.  However, this didn't particularly annoy me.  <br />This is a great light-hearted read.  It's certainly not a scholarly work, and doesn't attempt to be.  I won't nit-pick its accuracy, since I don't think that's fair here.  It's a good jumping-off point for learning more about this muddled language.
B00005OCMR|3.0|Steve Lisberger's \\"TRON\\" ... is the first big studio feature film that utilized a majority of its screen time with computer generated and enhanced imagery.  It ushered in an era of heightened visuals that continue today with near photorealism. This lavish two disc set includes just about everything that can be added to the simplistic story of a video-game geek (Jeff Bridges) and sidekick (Bruce Boxleitner), who enter the cyberworld to do battle with the Master Control Program that has a thing for terminating players.  The digital domain of the story is only partially thought out and not fully actualized but has hints of a Matrix-like world dominated by HAL from Kubrick's \\"2001.\\"  Once in cyberspace, the black and white characters with their neon auras are soothing eye candy that belies the gloom of the alternate universe they inhabit.  The bonus material includes director Lisberger's anecdotal commentary along with surprisingly detailed effects information from Richard Taylor and visual supervisor Harrison Ellenshaw.  There's a fascinating 90 minute making of documentary, deleted scenes, alternate music, a still gallery, effects demo reels, storyboards and more.  The futuristic story's ironically quaint by today's standards but still great looking fun for kids and first-timers.
0780625129|5.0|I have to admit that given the story I really didn't want to see this movie.  Recommended it by a friend I eventually sat down to watch it.  When I did I was completely mesmerised.  It takes an incredibly difficult premise and manages to make it credible, evocative and tragic.  It's basically about a member of a white supremacy group, Edward Norton, who goes to prison for three years after killing three car theifs in a race attack.  Told through the eyes of his younger brother, played by Edward Furlong, as he begins to follow in the footsteps of his brother.  The movie takes a look at Norton's time in prison, his return and his effect on those around him.<br />'American History X' certainly doesn't shy away from some of its key moments and is highly graphic, so be warned.  Never before have I watched such horrible sights of brutality and been moved to such an extent, some scenes are just so horrible that you will find yourself crying out.  This makes it even more hard-hitting, and its message is a lot more complicated than 'racism is bad'.  It talks about the effect of society on a disillusioned youth population, racial friction and the family unit.<br />Thanks to Edward Norton's brave, compelling performance, the audience is really dragged into his emotional turmoil.  His performance is unflinching, refusing to cop out and go for the sympathetic vote.  He's backed up by strong performances from Edward Furlong (the kid from 'Terminator 2') and Fairuza Balk (a much underrated actress whose formidable acting ability is yet again proved here) as his girlfriend.<br />This is a movie that has several levels to it.  It's touching, horrific and serves up some troubling issues about the society that we live in.  'American History X' is a movie that everyone should see, and is one of only two movies (the other being 'Heavenly Creatures') that affected me to great depth.
B000002IKR|5.0|Definitly in the same court as as Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeth.  The inconceivable guitar of Alex and perfect vocals of Steve to go along with it.  A rival of Master of Puppets and Peace Sells...but who's buying, with the tunes are well put together and thoughtout.  A MUST HAVE for speed and thrash metal collectors, well worth the money.  If you like this, then check out Flotsam and Jetsam, Exodus, Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer.
6303269826|5.0|Kevin Costner was the perfect choice for Wyatt Earp and Dennis Quaid deserved at the very least an Oscar nod for his performance as Doc Holliday. This caliber of movie and acting is rarely found in movies today which is one of the main reasons I don't watch many. The time was well spent worth the watch. I'm sure Tombstone can be referred to as the condensed soup version of this movie. I was surprised to learn that the \\"fight at the OK Corral\\" didn't take place at the OK Corral and that more than just the Clantons were involved. I guess the other \\"movied clones\\" just liked the sound of OK Corral. I am also a historical fiction buff. This is one video tape that is definitely going to be added to my movie library. Thank you to the supporting cast, the writer, director, cinematographer, Kevin, Dennis, et al. for believing in a project and taking the time to make it come to fruition.
B000001DWG|5.0|By far one of the best grunge CD's ever, even though its a little polished for grunge.  Mother Love Bone is essentially the same line up as Pearl Jam, without lead singer Andrew Wood.  MLB was headed for huge success if Wood's hadn't OD'd on Heroin. I have played this album to breaking point, it is so perfect with its mixture of Hard Rock anthems like &quot;This is Shangrila&quot; and ballads like &quot;Man Of Golden Words&quot;.  It is a disapointment that Woods killed himself because as you will see, Woods is a much better singer than Eddie Vedder.  On my top 5 list with Alice and Chains and Metallica.  If you like grunge, buy this album, it will stay in your Cd player a long time.
B00005NGAK|5.0|After giving away my VHS tape of Feet of Flames, I immediately ordered it on DVD.  Best purchase I made this year!  <BR>Feet of Flames is a fantastic Irish dance and music celebration that features the one and only Michael Flatley.  It is a more expanded version of Lord of the Dance (LOD).  The dancers are more experienced, the costumes have been updated, the music has been tweaked, and best of all is that we get to see Michael Flatley in a new solo dance as well as playing a very beautiful and memorable flute piece.  This was filmed live from Hyde Park in London.  The concert features the biggest show stage ever built and it incorporates all three of the LOD dance troupes.<br />The DVD has some added features.  You can choose which dance number you want to see or you can watch the whole concert.  There is a FANTASTIC &quot;making of Feet of Flames&quot;  mini movie that lasts at least 20 minutes.  This featurette is narrated by the man himself (Michael) as they count down to the day of the show. You really get a good, brief look at the planning and execution of such a huge project.  You also get some very brief comments from the other show stars.  I loved this feature and have been wanting to see a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; piece for some time now. There is also a biography of Michael Flatley.<br />Bottom line:  You don't have to be a music lover to enjoy this enchanting show.  You will love it!  If you are trying to decide between LOD or FOF, go for FOF.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Finally, after Return from Saturn, No Doubt has come out with a new cd! But this is no ordinary cd...it's a mix of reggae, punk, pop, guitar, r&amp;b, rock, and mch much more! It's not just one thing, like pop, or rap, but a mix of many that can appeal to everybody's tastes, even to those people who prefer country, or &quot;nature&quot; music. Contrary to all those teen pop star wanna-bees that make these songs with repitious themes and tunes, No Doubt has given the real meaning to hip-hop, pop, and punk! An experienced singer and celeb, Gwen Stefani belts out these tunes with her awesome voice and talent, with the help from the guys playing rad instruments like the guitar, drums, and many other pop-rock influenced things. So if you like great music, and love more than one type of music, GET THIS CD. It's great, catchy, and plain DA BOMB! Finally, no desperate teeny boppers trying to make their way into the music industry, but talented singers and great lyrics, too!
6304994540|4.0|This film is a not quite as good as Fargo, and O Brother Where Art Thou? was another step down, and The Man Who Wasn't There was even worse.  What's happening to the Coen brothers?  However this is not The Man Who Wasn't There so I do have some good things to say about it.  First of all I would like to think not that it has a paper-thin plot, but that it finds complexity in simplicity.  For intellectually inept characters like &quot;The Dude&quot;, Walter, and Donnie, this see through fiasco with an obvious forgone conclusion leads to an epic adventure, because they can't see the answers in front of their faces.  As a result we get to meet hilarious characters such as Jackie Treehorn, The &quot;other&quot; Jeff Lebowski, The German Nihilist Gang (including Pornstar &quot;Karl Hungus&quot;), John Polito's P.I. character and the young car thief, as well as characters from our protagonists' personal lives such as &quot;The Dude's&quot; land lord and John Tuturro's hilarious Jesus from &quot;The Dude's&quot; bowling league.  Also the narration by Sam Elliot as &quot;The Stranger&quot; is as funny as it is odd.  My opinion is that this character represents the &quot;old&quot; California, before people like \\"The Dude\\" and the other characters in this film overran it.  All in all I think it's a hilarious movie and also engrossing.  It's well worth owning a copy for repeated viewing and better then most of Joel and Ethan Coen's recent work.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This cd, contrary to a review by rich26, is DA BOMB! It's rich with punk and hip-hop, and has really catchy tunes similar to those of Sum-41 and Blink-182. One of the best things about it is that it isn't all about romance, and isn't *sweet & sugary* like some singers, like...Myra, Britney Spears, Mandy Moore...don't get me wrong, I love all these singers, but not everybody sounds good singing pop and sweet bubblegum stuff. It would also get very boring if all the singers sang about romance, and were all pop singers. Please! It wouldn't be called music anymore, but back to my main point...this new cd of Pink's was a smashing hit, at least to me, and has honest and truthful lyrics, and some great rockin', and plenty of good songs. If you don't have this cd, I really encourage you to buy it! Believe me, it won't give you a toothace from too much *sugar*...in fact, this cd (thank goodness!) is, technically, *sugarless*!
B00005A0N5|5.0|The name of this band actually made me look at this CD. Nightwish had that kind of, I don't know, not quite melancholy yet not downright dreary ring to it. I was not sure what to expect from the music even though I had read that they were fronted by a woman. Were they like Theatre of Tragedy? Were they a doom, goth type of band? My questions were answered when Stargazer roared out of my speakers. Here was a something different and cool. Almost like Dream Theater with the intricate guitar and keyboard interplay and downright awesome drums and base work. The double bass work is phenomenal, especially where the drummer rolls with them. Then there is Tarja. That woman is a female version of James LaBrie. Her voice soared over the metallic sounds her bandmates were dishing out with ease. The songwriting is topnotch as well with tempo changes coming in just the right places. The heavy songs are just that and the ballads are downright soul jerkers, as with any good metal ballad. In short, if you like good music, do not hesistate to buy this album.
B00005OC06|1.0|Despite the reputation of the director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, I didn't like this production at all. I found it was even an insult to the masterpiece of Puccini. It's completely wrongfully directed from the beginning to the end. Freni's Cio-Cio san sounds excellent, but, Ponnelle made her to be a weak girl (she should be a strong girl and must have much of self-confidence and discipline). Her father killed himself in order to die with honor rather than living with dishonor and she is very proud of him. That's her philosophy, too. Freni's acting when she says her father is \\"morto\\" doesn't represent Cio-cio san's personality. <BR>It's like Madama Butterfly in the production of Mikado. Cio-Cio san presents her mother, who is not only very poor (as it's written to be) but impossibly comic and ugly at the same time. So is the Consul. He looks like a comedian popped out from a cartoon. Goro isn't Japanese but a clown. <BR>The finest \\"Flower duet\\" is turned into their love scene. I mean, apparently they are having sex on the field. Pinkerton is on the top of Cio-cio san moving up and down and say \\"Come! Come!\\". This is ridiculous. When Suzuki is pessimistic about Pinkerton's return, Cio-cio san is supposed to convince her that none of the rumors is true and he would be back soon. Here, Cio-cio san is already so despaired and obviously she's lost all her hope. How could she convince her maid to keep faith and wait! Humming chorus is merged into Cio-cio san's dream. This scene is so confusingly done. As for me, I don't need to see what she dreams because it's so obvious.<BR>The decor is only one house and the field of grass in the deep fog.<BR>Good thing about this production, though, is Domingo. He is handsome and extraordinary. But his T-shirt looks pretty much from this century.<BR>What was Ponnelle thinking? Wasn't Karajan around when he directed? It's all wrong!
039472903X|5.0|If you're in the profession of advertising, and this book isn't on your bookshelf, dog-eared, stained and well-worn, you've been ripping off your clients.<br />The entire premise of Ogilvy on Advertising boils down to one simple statement (coined by Claude Hopkins nearly 80 years ago in his book Scientific Advertising): &quot;Advertising is salesmanship.&quot; <br />Sadly, the advertising world has drifted from that solid mooring. And now those who profess it are considered anachronistic at best. And kooky at worst.<br />Ogilvy, a staunch admirer of Hopkins, firmly embraced that tenet -- and it propelled him and his agency (Ogilvy and Mather) to the Mount Olympus of the advertising world. Most importantly, it made his clients rich beyond the dreams of avarice.<br />Ogilvy's writing is captivating. His work, legendary. His ideas, timeless. The information in this book is easily work 10 times the cover price.<br />I've been in the profession of advertising for nearly 15 years. I'm also an adjunct professor at a nearby university. I wholeheartedly recommend Ogilvy On Advertising to my students. I firmly embrace its principles in my profession.<br />And I, without hesitation, urge you to read it as well.
B00003CY5J|2.0|I give this two stars; i'd give it only one (which is all the script and direction surely deserve), but anything that has DeNiro and Brando just *breathing* on the screen simultaneously is better than that.<br />But it's slow and it's dumb and it's a total waste of time. I find it hard to believe that baby celluloids died to make this film possible.<br />The script and the direction (by the usually-reliable Frank Oz) never manage to generate any significant amount of suspense or heat, and several technical details of the overall plot are ludicrous. Ed Norton as the potentially-treacherous partner is ridiculous and a bit offensive in his impersonation (to penetrate the targeted facility) of someone suffering some form of brain damage. Brando might as well not be there at all and DeNiro has phoned in a performance that is so monotone no particular part of it stands out as offensive or interesting.<br />Almost the only interesting parts of the film are the details of safecracking; and you can see more of that, with better storis wrapped around it, in \\"Breaking In\\" or \\"Thief\\".<br />A total waste of time.
B000001OAA|4.0|Garbage's first album is good to listen to, but it is not as well developed as beautiful garbage and version 2.0. However, there is a good collection of songs like vow and only happy when it rains. I've had the album for nearly six years now and it still sounds really good.
B00003CWPR|2.0|I thought the movie was good as it dealt with subjects rarely touched on without titilation - Cruise and Kidman do pretty good in all this and the movie is worth watching but unless you are the biggest Kubrick fan this movie is only average.  I think it got all its hype because Kubrick died before the movie was released.
B00005QG9J|5.0|From start to finish, morning view really helps to show Incubus varied sound from the hard rocking nice to know you to the soft mexico to the mello wish you were here. Here is a band that constatnly puts a lot of its emotions into its lyrics and music. In terms of their albums, it has less rap then science and is similar to make yourself in terms of its diversity of sounds. Any Incubus fan would enjoy listening to this album.
0385505833|1.0|I'm not sure how anyone could give this book a good rating. I was annoyed thoughout the entire book and wondered how any reader could think the behavior of the neighbors and friends (and many times the wife) was appropriate and acceptable. The message tells me that if you don't do what your friends and neighbors want you to do...especially when it comes to Christmas...they will treat you with hatred and disdane until they can bring you around to their way of thinking. If the majority of our society truly believes that taking a break from the madness of Christmas is this atrocious of an idea, I'm very worried about the direction we are heading.
6301008960|5.0|Through the years, Ive loved this film for many, many reasons (actors &amp; characters, storyline, happy ending...) I think its one of the best 80s comedies. All actors are really wonderful.<BR>By the way, what happened to Amanda Peterson?
B00005IC2H|2.0|I dont get whats so good about this music -  maybe the fact that i actually understand the lyrircs is what ruins it for me . <BR>I do think some songs are fine like Svefn Englar (sleeping Angels)but i prefer Bjrk Gumunds and radiohead . But like most icelanders im wery prowd of what they have acomplished in the music industry - they are prublubly the most famous after Bjrk ofcourse . <BR>( excuse my spelling )
B000056K04|5.0|&quot;Everyday&quot; is very different from DMB's usual sound.  In this album he uses an electric guitar for the first time.  The album starts of with a bang with &quot;I did it&quot; followed by &quot;The Space Between&quot;, &quot;Dreams of our fathers&quot;, &quot;So right&quot;, &quot;What you are&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Fool to think&quot; and &quot;Everyday&quot;.  All in all this album is great.  If you are a DMB fan and are lookin for some more good tunes this the album for you.  If you arent a DMB fan and are looking to buy your first album, but &quot;Crash&quot;.  That will get you hooked.
B00003CXXP|4.0|A fine swan song to supplant Eyes Wide Shut, this idea of Kubrick's was a labor of love.  Work for it carried on for close to 20 years going through many revisions and ideas.  When his death came to pass, with Kubrick's wife's blessing, Spielberg (a constant contributor to Kubrick's process with the film) got the go ahead to put his spin on what Kubrick had done up to that point.  Based on a short story called \\"Do Robots dream of Electric Sheep?\\" the tale is that of a sentient robot boy who wants nothing more than to love his adopted mother.  With little leaked from the set of the film, not many people knew what to expect from this film, and suprisingly, the reaction was mixed.  People enjoyed his take on \\"Pinochicco\\", while others didn't get it and felt like they were watching a ...  Granted the ending feels very out of place with the rest of the film, it's very touching and makes you realize that there's no one you can love more than your parents.  If there's anything that's lasting with this film, it's more the websites that went with the film.  Very bizzare, but easily besting anything the Blair Witch Project could've hoped for...
B00005RHGK|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Not only was it not scary, funny or at all entertaining.  What (very) little suspense this movie managed to muster up was wasted due to the fact that there was no ending.
B00005RY7X|4.0|Remember those 80s movies where the Coreys (Haim & Feldman) just wanted to have fun and get chicks?!??!?!? WK music its part of those soundtracks...<BR>This is a big throwback to the 80s, there are some guys who say that WK sounds like the 80s glam, i dont think so... WK sounds like Van Halen (even the booklet includes a photograph of WK making a jump \\"a la\\" David Lee Roth)or Def Leppard but louder (and 15 years later)!!<BR>Big guitar riffs, shouts, and stupid lyrics, this is what you'll find in WK's first complete album.<BR>At least 4 songs of this record would become rock hymns for soccer stadiums, and the next teen movie will include some of this...<br />Buy it if you liked the Lost Boys, Karate Kid or any movie from the Haim & Feldman connection...
B00003CXSM|3.0|2 people want to get married.  So they hire a wedding planner.  Only problem is, the wedding planner falls in love with the groom.  This is pretty much the premise of The Wedding Planner.  The movie has its comedic moments, but honestly, with this interesting premise, it could have been a LOT funnier.  As is, it's more of a chick flick attempt at a romantic comedy, with much lost potential.  It's better than other wedding flicks (My Best Friend's Wedding comes to mind) and it's also more realistic in the fact that the bride is not painted as some \\"evil and rich\\" woman that's controlling the groom but he's too blind to see it (as is the usual clich).  In this respect, The Wedding Planner wins, and overall it is an entertaining movie to watch.  It's just sad to see that it \\"coulda been a contenda\\" had more thought been put into the comedic aspects of the movie...
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Scary Movie looked good from the moment I laid my eyes on it. As a teen slasher fan I loved the humor and could recognize all the parts from other films. The characters are totally clueless and some what stupid but that makes it more funny. Some of the jokes are a killer!! Scary Movie is just a hilarious rollercoaster ride of fun and mayhem. I've been waiting for a spoof like this and I got one!! If you want to laugh until you cry watch Scary Movie!
6304539258|3.0|Well, it seems I am one of those very few over the age of 30 who is immuned to the charms of the Star Wars saga.  At the time of its release in 1977, I was only 9 years old and frankly, didn't even feel the need to see it then.  And as the years went by, I saw the phenomenon grow into strastospheric proportions.  Frankly, I was scratching my head in amazement the whole time, wondering what the heck the fuss was about.<br />  For some reason, I was never attracted to this saga even as a kid, having only seen bits and pieces of it.  And I was able to suffer through the whole thing only a few days ago.  It felt like some school assignment to me more than anything.  I had tried to watch it several years prior to this but just found it too boring for words and gave up.  But finally, I was curious and vowed to myself that I would at least see the whole thing.  There is something there for sure, otherwise it wouldn't have endured for as long as it has.  And after that first viewing, I can say that Star Wars is everything the reviewers have described...  First, it is not a great movie by any standards with bad acting, childhish plot developments and cheesy special effects.  True, they were very innovative for 1977 but compared with today's technology, they stand no chance.<br />  Although I was mostly bored while watching, I can recognize Star Wars as the true classic it really is.  And even though I have to admit that I don't like this movie personally, I can totally understand why it has a tremendous lasting value to this day.  The film has become a fixture in time, an icon attached to a pre-computerized era.  People who saw it at the time of its original release are truly the ones who felt that impact the most.  They had never seen anything like this before.  The movie had just the right blend of fantasy, special effects and story twists to capture the imagination of a whole generation of moviegoers at a precise time in history where it was badly needed.<br />  This said, I can totally get why many young people out there don't understand its appeal.  Children and young adults of today have seen much better movies with complex, intelligent storylines and mind-boggling special effects.  In a sense, they are used to the perfection digital technology allows nowadays which didn't exist back then.  When you compare it to &quot;The Matrix&quot; for example, it seems painfully lame and pointless.  And it is true that with time, Star Wars has acquired a cult status so gigantic that it has transformed it into an highly overrated monstrosity with probably too much hype to overcome.  But if you allow your mind to be transported back to 1977, you will be more able to understand why this movie is still reverred this way even today.<br />  The film struck a deep chord in many people at a crucial time in history and was able to create a whole new space-oriented universe through movie-making we now take for granted.  We have to remember that Star Wars was one very important pioneer in the sci-fi genre and it is unfair to compare it to movies being produced today.  It is in a class all its own and should be looked at from the standpoint of its place in cinema history.  I agree with some reviewers who state that George Lucas is somewhat overrated as a storyteller, his &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; fiasco being the ultimate proof.  But back in 1977, when Star Wars hit the theater screens all over the planet, George had somehow succeeded in giving the public its first taste of a fantasy world so appealing that its impact is still vivid today, transforming our movie culture forever...This said, I can totally get why many young people out there don't understand its appeal.

B00005IC2H|5.0|Sigur Ros is absolutely one of the most phenominal sensations to hit the music scene in a long time. However, this band is so progressive that they cannot even be included in the \\"scene.\\"<br />While \\"Svefn G Englar\\" is a fantastic song, I truly believe that the true essence of this album can be found in track 7 \\"Vidrar Vel Til Loftarasa.\\" This song has the perfect build...and the perfect climax. This \\"moment\\" doesn't occur until 7 1/2 minutes into the song, but there is something very sexual about the peak of the song. It gives me goose bumps every time I hear it. God, this is a fantastic album. Beautiful beyond words...
B00005TT77|3.0|Okay...i grant you the songs are great, but this tribute album is not.  Here's my bias: i'm a 50+ audiophile who remembers from actual experience Beatles hysteria...when we'd wait at the record store on the day a new Beatles record came out, then when we got it home we'd listen to it continuously till we knew every word, note, inference, and nuance.  This collection  succeeds only in making me want to hear the originals instead.  (Honey, get out the CD burner, we've got to show these kids what real Beatles music is all about.)  Not one version on this collection holds a candle to the original...attesting to the staying power of the originals after all these years.  And, by the way...i love the wallflowers, but their contribution here is as lame as lame can be. All in all, and adventure in mediocrity.
B000003CMB|5.0|This album struck me with awe 30 years ago and still continues to shine. Raw rock/blues power from a tight unit with so many talented musicians. Duane Allman and Dickey Betts showcase brilliant guitar improvisions, with a dual driving drum base from Butch Trucks and Jaimoe, solid base from Berry Oakley and powerful vocals and keyboards from Gregg Allman. I used to turn out the lights and just let the music wash over me. It still has the same effect but I'm a little too old to fantasize that I will ever play like that.
B00005RYKU|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It had good characters, but was very predictable. I had the whole plot figured out really early in the movie, but it was still fun watching how events unfolded anyway.
B00003CY5J|3.0|***1/2 \\"The Score\\" is a fun, stylish return to the \\"Rififi,\\" \\"Topkapi\\" school of crime drama.  The object of this particular heist is a 17th Century royal scepter from France that happens to be languishing in the basement of the Montreal customhouse just asking to be taken.  One of the would-be takers is Nick Wells (Robert De Niro), a seasoned heister dreaming of the quiet life of retirement but compelled to do this one last job as a favor to Max (Marlon Brando), an old buddy in hock to some pretty dangerous mob figures.  Completing the triangle is Jack Teller (Edward Norton), a brilliant but brash young criminal mastermind whose high-risk temperament is placed in direct counterpoint to Nick's cool, levelheaded demeanor.<br />Perhaps the most amazing triumph for director Frank Oz is his success at pulling together this impressive cast of stellar heavyweights who cut across three generations of movie acting.  Of course, one might wish to see them in roles more demanding of their thespian talents, but we moviegoers will take these three superstars any way we can get them.  And \\"The Score\\" is certainly very entertaining on its own terms.  The technical elements involved in the planning of the heist are beautifully detailed from start to finish.  And Oz generates genuinely nail-biting suspense in many sequences involving close quarters and close calls.  In addition, the Montreal setting is novel and fresh and it is enhanced by some very impressive wide screen photography.<br />A film like \\"The Score\\" lives or dies based on the intricacy of its plotting and the expertise of its craft.  In both cases, \\"The Score\\" excels as an outstanding example of this noble and time-honored genre.  And watching these three acting giants doing their thing in a movie together is OUR well-earned reward.
B000002UUX|5.0|This is the very first Megadeth CD I ever bought and I still feel it's the peak performance, sonicly and structurally, of their career. I was tired of all the Metallica T-shirts and music by 1990 and this was a great break.<br /><br />According to interviews, this album was written and recorded while the two Daves were weaning themselves off the hard drugs they \\"enjoyed\\" during the previous three recordings, and it shows. I don't know if it's Mike Clinks's co-production (he also worked on Appetite for Destruction) but the sound quality between this and their previous releases is worlds apart. Mustaine's songwriting skills are well displayed here. A great progression of composition from earlier works. And the addition of lead guitarist Marty Friedman was perfect move.<br /><br />While this recording fits neatly into the \\"Thrash\\" genr&eacute;, you could also consider it a Metal/Jazz/Punk hybrid. The time changes on Holy Wars, Hangar 18 and 5 Magics are extremely Jazzy. Take No Prisoners is classic aggressive Thrash. They didn't stick any \\"power ballads\\" on this one either, so it's uninterrupted crunch and riffing until you reach the screwy Dawn Patrol. While not really much of a song, it does serve as a nice breather before the crescendo of the title track finishes you off.<br /><br />All in all great performances by all four musicians. The drum work of Nick Menza deserves particular kudos. Keeping up with the Daves and Marty is a real feat. I've played along with this CD numerous times on \\"real\\" and \\"air\\" guitars. Rust in Peace has been a top 10 favorite of mine since it's release and will likely remain on that list for a long time. Buy it used if you have to.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Ithink this is the best movie I have seen,next to the Godfather.It is so intellectual itknocks my socks off!I'm going to see it again and when it comes out on video I will most assuredly watch it over and over! Ron Howard and Russel Crowe make a team the likes of which I haven't seen since Francis Ford Coppola and Al Pacino.Bravo!!
B00005JKQX|5.0|'A Beautiful Mind' is one of the most heartwrenching, deeply emotional and moving films that I have ever seen.  Russell Crowe gives his best peformace yet for a Golden Globe winning performance as John Nash, the nobel prize-winning schizophrenic math genius.  Crowe's brutally honest performance sheds some light on the often misunderstood disease.  I walked out of the theater in shock because of Russell Crowe's performance, it was truly touching.  Nash's wife is played flawlessly by a wondrful Jennifer Connelly.  Connelly brings genuine emotion and feeling into this key character.  Connelly's performance also snagged her a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.  Ed Harris is also wondeful is his role.  I won't talk too much about Harris's role for fear of giving something away!  Akiva Goldsman's brilliant Golden Globe-winning screenplay has many of these sorts of surprises, twists and turns.<br />Critically acclaimed director Ron Howard fills 'A Beautiful Mind' with geniune emotion and heart. I found myself personally touched by this film a number of times.  It's pretty shocking how heartwrenching 'A Beautiful Mind' is at times.  I found myself enveloped in tears along with my friends a number of times while watching this film.  If a film can touch you in the way that 'A Beautiful Mind' did for me, you know that it must be a wonderful film.  Fortunately, 'A Beautiful Mind' snagged the Best Drama award at the Golden Globes the other night beating out films such as 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'In The Bedroom'.  I also feel that the original score for this film by the legendary James Horner deserves some recognition.  Read my review of this deeply-stirring Golden Globe nominated score.
0783225857|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird was without doubt one of the best books I had ever read so I prepared to watch this film with the typically pessimistic view that it could never reach such poignant heights. Harper Lee was able to capture those magical and enchanted feelings that accompany nostalgic reminiscence of ones childhood, and the creators of this wonderful film manage to adapt this to the screen with elegance and brilliance. On top of that, it is accompanied by a great score by Elmer Bernstein and some fantastic acting, most notably by Gregory Peck who was exactly how I had pictured Atticus and portrays his dignity and virtue exquisitely. The DVD also has some really worthwhile bonus features, with some interesting interviews with the cast (including the now adult Scout and Gem) and creators. In short, one of the wisest purchases in my collection!
B000002BUY|5.0|In the world of Incubus, this is how it is: Fungus Amongus:the talent album, showed us what they could do. S.C.I.E.N.C.E.: the very sweet and hard hitting non-commercial album. Make Yourself: the commercial album, got them noticed. Morning View: the crowd pleaser. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is by far the greatest incubus cd, no matter what anyone says.  all of the songs are good, if i had to pick favorites I'd say new skin, a certain shade of green, and favorite things are the best songs on here.  If you're looking for another make yourself or morning view, you wont find it here. what you'll find is a great funk/punk/alternative album loaded with great riffs and lyrics, that has turned into one of my all time favorite cds, and i hope it does to you. they are also awesome live and play a lot of songs live from this cd on the dvd, so i highly suggest that you pick that up, too.
B00005JKQX|2.0|Disappointing movie so I don't know why it won many accolades at the Golden Globes.  Russell Crowe is a brilliant actor and his portrayal of a real schizophrenic mathematic genius was good.  But Crowe's own seemingly charismatic, virile, and magnetic personality take away some believability.  Jennifer Connelley gives a fine performance.  Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer play minor characters but nevertheless are pleasure to watch. The guy who plays Nash's roommate &quot;Charles&quot; is entertaining as he did in the &quot;Knights Tale&quot;. So I wonder why did this movie fell short of entertaining me?  Maybe it took too long to tell a good story.
0425152251|3.0|I read this book after reading The Solitaire Mystery (also by Jostein Gaarder) which also dealt with philosophy but was very interesting.  Sad to say, although Sophie's World is very rich with the philosophic ideas, it lacked on characteristics of being a good novel.  It seemed to me to be more of a book on philosophy instead of a novel (or maybe, it really is intended as a philosophy book). I feel like taking a course on philosophy, which is actually interesting though.  However, the characters were not given enough depth e.g. Sophie, Albert, Hilde, or even the dog Hermes.  Their appearances were merely to break the monotonous lecture about the different philosophers, their ideas &amp; their projects.  <br />If you are highly interested on the topic of philosophy, you might enjoy reading this book, as it summarizes the evolution of philosophy throughout the ages, compressing it in approx. 400 pages.  However, if you are not that keen, I suggest you stick with The Solitaire Mystery instead.  I have yet to read JG's other books to determine if the writer has improved novel writing techniques.
B00005JKQX|5.0|In case the first hour or so of A Beautiful Mind doesn't convince the viewer that Russell Crowe is in the midst of one of the top academy award performances of the last two decades, the final half has to. The majesty and the depth of this man's ability to create and portray is without recent parallel. His total captivation of every nuance and his wringing every possible emotion out of the fiber of the character he plays is simply breathtaking. Crowe is well supported by a perfectly chosen and outstanding cast, and the film's direction by Ron Howard brings the whole incredible intensity of the finished product in one's face time and time again. The fairly quick shift from the patient who agrees to fight the delusions to the older man accepting the Nobel prize was done so well as to have one asking how it happened so smoothly: I was so mesmerized by the electrical performance Crowe was giving that I had to pinch myself to know the ending was there. Walking away from the theatre, I might as well have been on Mars due to the intense impact the film had made on my senses. Thinking back over his three most recent and incredibly different yet masterfully played roles, I can only wonder what Crowe can possibly do next to show even more depth: it doesn't seem humanly possible that one actor can have that much talent packed into one body. This should not be missed by anyone who prizes the ultimate levels of human achievement.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|With a combination of an ordinary threatened love story (i.e. Romeo & Juliet), a theater/stage venue (i.e. Shakespeare in Love), & a musical film (i.e. Evita), this unique film pulled it off successfuly.  I am genuinely impressed with the director's style, the costume/set, & yes, Nicole & Ewan's singing voices.  All through out the viewing time, my husband & I were arguing if it was really their voices & we had to slowly check the credits at the end just to finally end our argument :-)
B00004RF9I|5.0|I can't see how any movie could top this one. Personally my favorite movie is The Godfather, but Network is a very close second. I can't figure out how could anybody consider it one of the 100 greatest, when it surely deserves to be among the 15 greatest films of all times. This entire movie is classy and elegant though it definately has a vulgar and disgusting feel to it, which mostly descends from the shameless world the characters live in. Is a world without decency and sadly enough it has become our world.<BR>The strongest elements of this movie are the incredible performances by Dunaway, Straight, Finch, Holden and Beatty; the thought provoking monolgues delivered by Beatty, Straight and Finch (among many things, they talk about deshumanization, death of individualism, the influence of the social comunication mediums, etc.). All of these monologues are spectacular, they grab your attention and never let go until they're done, but Straight's speech is specially iluminating, it's an impressive showcase of a woman's dignity before the posibility that the man she's given her life to is going to spent his last years of vitality with another woman and the fact that he may come back only means he comes back to give her his \\"menopause\\" and senility, to spend the end of his live with the one woman who can truly supply safety for him in his last days (\\"Is that what i get?\\"). Of course the script is full of this wonderful details. The entire movie is plagued of outrageous dialogue that redefines over-the-top. It is everyday talking deformed to the extreme which only adds to the impact. You can only stand with your mouth open and your ears on disbelief of hearing what this people are saying or doing (which includes murder and terrorism, after all they are sponsoring a terrorist army). There are more bizarre moments you can manage to digest. Truly the dialogue is spectacular, cutting and raw in its twisted honesty. Sidney Lumet's direction holds all of these monstrously powerful elements together, with great pacing and care for detail. After all he is one of the greatest directors of all times (no academy awards is just crime). Serpico, 12 Angry Men, Dog Day Afternoon, The Pawnbroker they all seem dwarfed when compared to this movie. <BR>Network's only objective is to showcase the world of t.v., it never seems pretty but that's exactly the point. Truly one movie you don't want to miss. Its impact will only keep on growing. Twenty years ago it may have seemed a comedy, when all of the situations presented seemed like a far cry from reality, but nowadays it's a scary, apocalyptic look at our society. This movie strikes a mayor blow on our conception of reality.<BR>Another interesting related movie would be The Insider which seems like the antithesis of Network. Al Pacino's righteous Lowell against Faye Dunaway's unscrupulous Diana, and while it's sad to admit, shameless, vicious and disgusting win the battle.<BR>1976 must have been a fun year to live in specially during the Academy Awards when people found the raw, vulgar reality too much to appreciate and ended up changing channels and awarding Rocky (for christ's sake it's like choosing a deluxe bicycle over a bmw).<BR>In my humble opinion few movies have surpassed Network and it's very unlike someone will ever create a masterpiece quite like this. It will propably be bested but it will never be duplicated.
0525946284|3.0|Ken Follett has taken the World War II spy mission novel down an entertaining but certainly untravelled road.  The plot is standard stuff.  Allied commandos parachute into occupied France to a destroy key installation in support of the D Day invasion.  There are all the usual phases - assemble the team, train the team, plan the mission etc, conduct the raid.<BR>     The whole concept, however, has been rewritten with a 2001 twist.  First, the commandos are all women.  I found this interesting, new and plausible.  This, however, is just the beginning.  The herione's brother is gay.  One of the \\" woman \\" commandos, is, in fact, a transvestite.  Two of the women commandos are lesbians.  These three items do little, if anything, to advance the plot and seem to have been written in just for the fun of it.  There is nothing wrong with adding these items for no reason at all, but to do nothing with these items makes it look gratuitous.    <BR>     There are several other \\" throw in \\" items that have nothing to do with the plot.  Why did Follett make the Nazi antagonist suffer from migraines ?  His migraines come into the story at several points, but they never lead to anything and are never critical to the plot.  Why start the story with the herione married to a leader in the Resistance ?  Early on, the heroine falls in love with someone else, and the Resistance husband is later killed.  There is no point where the heroine really struggles with any issue or decision because she is married or married to a Resistance leader.  So why was it there ? <BR>     The story is, in fact, rather loosely written and there are several items that just do not add up.  For example, several of the commandos are killed before they reach the objective.  However, when they reach the objective, the remaining commandos carry out the mission without being even slightly inconvienced by the absence of the others.  So why did we have extra commandos ?  Was it so we could have extra plot lines ?  Wasit so we could have some non essential commandos killed to show that things really are serious without really jeopardizing the mission ?  It reminded me of old Star Trek episodes where the landing party took extra people so someone could be killed by the monster.<BR>Despite all this, however, the story is very entertaining.  The plot moves along very quickly and there are numerous detours as fortune, good or bad, impacts on the commandos.  The bad guy is suitably smart and evil and heroine is beautiful, deadly and resourceful.  Enjoy the story and just dont look too closely.
B00004RF98|3.0|Singin' In The Rain is one of the most loved american films and it's considered one of the greatest musicals of all times. Even without the musical numbers the film does just fine. It's a light comedy, with charming characters.<br />     The story is set during the transition from silents to talkies. Monumental Pictures' greatest on-screen couple, Don Locwood and Lina Lamont, is having a hard time adjusting to the times, since Lina (Jean Hagen) has a rather unpleasant voice. Meanwhile the male half of the partnership, Don (Gene Kelly) finds himself head over heels for a young aspring actress named Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). The plot twists are clever (we must remember this was 1952 almost 40 years before milli vanilli) and the ending is satisfying.<br />     However, while many people consider the musical numbers to be Singin' In The Rain's greatest heights, i never felt quite convinced with a few of them. One reason i liked West Side Story so much was the effortless way the musical numbers and the normal action came together. One existed to embellish the other and everytime a musical number happened it almost seemed logical. Singin' In The Rain misses that aspect. <br />     For example, the first musical number is All I Do Is Dream Of You, or something like that. It's a great, energetic, cute dance that seems perfectly in place (a party), nevertheless the next number Make 'Em Laugh, though amazing, exists only to showcase Donald O'Connor's abilities as an acrobat, since the number doesn't really influence the future development of the film and doesn't  seem quite as related to what's going on in that moment (Don is feeling like he is in the wrong track and O'Connor advises him to make people laugh?). <br />     Another number \\"Beautiful Girl\\" also seems completely unnecesary and it's not that great of a song. But there is also You Were Meant For Me where Don and Kathy dance as they start to grow feelings for each other, it's a simple beautiful and emotive number. Then there's moses supposes, again just an excuse to make Kelly and O'Connor try to outdo each other. <br />     Then there's Good Morning with some pros and some cons. The pros are the good choreography and music and the cons the inadequate theme and the embarrasing part with the coats. But it's all forgiven when the next number comes along. One of the most classic moments in movie history. Kelly shakin', dancin' and singin' in the rain in the culminating number of the entire genre. This time song, music, lyrics, choreography and setting all agree to make this a wonderful spectacle to watch, this is really the glorious feeling everybody talks about.<br />     Five times as complicated is the next number, a musical extravaganza, a story within a story: The Broadway Melody. I'll have to admit that it's as related to the story as Make 'Em Laugh but this one is a masterpiece, with several moods and tones it either sucks you right in or gives you fourteen minutes to go drink some coffee.<br />     I really don't consider Singin' to be the greatest musical of all times. But it does showcase the entire cast at their musical best (Jean Hagen steals the show) and it does feature that guy walkin' around, lookin' happy, shakin' that umbrella and splashin' in the water like there's no tomorrow. That number alone redeems all the rest.

0446677450|3.0|The title of the book attracts me to read it. How can a child have two dads? It sounds interesting. Kiyosaki have two dads. One is his real dad but poor and the other is his friend's but rich. The poor one is highly educated while the rich one has poor education background. Kiyosaki chooses to learn from his rich dad and eventually becomes rich. It reflects that in reality, even if we study a lot, it is not necessary ensuring us to earn a lot of money while studying less does not mean that we are not able to earn a lot. So sometimes I wonder why I have to study so much. Yes, I agree with the &quot;Rat Race&quot;. But if I do not study a lot or work for an employer in my whole life, I do not know what I can do. Invest? (Just as said in the book) Or start up my own business? I do not think I can be so LUCKY as Kiyosaki that he can have so many chances for him to make money. The main idea of this book is to build our own asset column and stay out of debt, which is repeated over and over again in the book. And it seems that it needs quite a lot of techniques and skills of financial investment. The idea seems good but is it really practical?
B00005B36H|5.0|In many ways, I think this is the best Tool disc yet.  The album flows well from front to back and the sound quality is exceptional.

0743201140|5.0|This book is really worth reading. The main idea of the book is to enhance our \\"strength\\" rather than eliminate our \\"weaknesses\\". It does not mean that we totally ignore our weakness but concentrate much on our strengths. I strongly agree with it. I used to put much effort in my weakness but the outcome was not so good, which made me desperate, lacking confidence to do anything. However, the outcome is more likely to be good if I spend much time on my strength. In reality, many successful people also pay attention on what they are good at. There are 34 real life stories supporting 34 positive personality themes described in the book, which is great and realistic!!<br />If you do not know what your strength is, you can buy the book and there is a code come along with it that allows you to join the test and find your strength.<br />Now, come on and discover your strength!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Yes, that is a bold statement, and yes I've seen more of the so-called classics than say most people (Due to an exponential amount of free time), but this film is truely great. As compared to some other films, I quickly came to the realization that 'Hey...there's nothing else like this'. The characters are complex, and the plot is thick. Many, many, many, hidden details placed carefully throughout the movie that elude to the fact of the final outcome between Brad Pitt and Edward Norton (and not moronic clues, such as ones found in Scream as to who is the killer. Meanwhile, I've fallen asleep.) <BR>The Narrator(Norton) is kind of humorus in the fact ol' Chuck's idea while writing the book without and name for the main character was to make this possibly about anyone, any average Joe. <BR>The movie does an awsome job in staying with the book, sans a diefferent ending (which I personally liked the movie better, seeing as there was no hope of a sequel.) And a few missing details on how to blow up various things, which is a big suprise they left it out. <BR>Every actor is perfect, David Fincher is perfect, and the ideas behind it are...well...perfect. Escapism, split-personalities, survivalism, all tackled without being politically correct. It's not suprising that this movie turns a lot of people off. All great works are like that, controversial. The violence turned off some people, and many people wondered what in the heck this was in the theaters, when they thought this was going to maybe be like Bloodsport.<BR>Going over the details is pointless, this film must be seen.
B00005QIPH|2.0|UNBELIEVABLE.<br />It is unbelievable the amount of hype this album has received, and the inhuman set of expectations thrust upon this band to \\"save rock 'n' roll.\\" I'm sure they are loathe to take on a savior complex...which is good, because if they did, they'd fail miserably.<br />What's even more unbelievable is how overrated it is by critics and the general media -- who tend to be a sheepish, bandwagon-ish lot anyway.<br />It is telling on the state of rock today that The Strokes are considered its \\"savior.\\" If THIS is considered salvation and \\"genius\\" for rock today...then truly rock 'n' roll is in a far worse state of disrepair than I thought.<br />This album is average...even a bit cheesy. Average underproduced strum-rock by an average band with a less-than-average proficency on their instruments, sense of dynamics, and overall song structure.<br />The funny thing is, it's described as \\"stripped down\\", \\"raw\\"...all it sounds like to me is that they've purposely underproduced and are trying WAY too hard to be the saviors and insightful, deep, Television-Dylan-Springsteen-Lou Reed singer-poets that they aren't.<br />Some catchy hooks, some interesting rhythm section work (barring the flat, beatbox drum sound), some good lyrics...overall, nothing close to \\"saving\\" anything.<br />BTW...rock ain't dead. Never has been. That's just the way to hype the latest new movement, new trend or hybrid genre...don't buy the hype. All you have to do is what you've always done...search a little deeper, go a little farther, be more patient listening and discerning...you'll ALWAYS find the gems and truly great music.<br />As for the \\"popular\\" music? Take it for what it is...formulaic, sometimes trite, but fun.<br />If it was ALL genius, then there'd be no point in \\"critiquing\\", would there?<br />Peace.
B000002GB6|5.0|I know a single piece doesn't make worth a whole album, but trust me- Feels So Good is *incredible*. Not only the melody and chord progression are simply amazing, and a real pleasure for the ears, but this song's solos are without a doubt among the best I've ever heard, each in their category. I've been hearing time after time the electric guitar solo for years, and now I know the man's name: Grant Grassman. Same with the sax: Chris Vadala. These two solos should be sold separately, as they're two of the most inspired funk-jazz solos you'll be able to listen to ever.<BR>What I mean with all this text is that not only you're buying a great work from Mangione, but also a chance to listen to the wonderful musicians he's surrounded by.<BR>Sweet, melodic, completely inspiring, funky, jazzy, groovy collection. Buy this one, and if you don't like it, sell your copy to me.
B00005OCMR|5.0|I'm not sure where the really bad review came from, especially saying that it was dirty and severely artifacted for I did not experience any of that.  I watched this on a ProScan DVD-player and HDTV (50\\") as well as a proper 5.1 setup and this movie was great!  The colors are incredible (I wasn't expecting *that* good) and the sound was very well redone considering that this movie was not originally mixed for surround.  The extras are very worthwhile and this IS what Disney should have released the first time around.  DO NOT BUY the original DVD, GET THIS ONE!!!
6303109950|5.0|Without question, this is the definitive western of the last 45 years of movie making.  For western fan and non-fan alike, this is the best of the genre.  While there is plenty of \\"shoot 'em up\\" action to satisfy the western lover and a typical Hollywood morality play quality to the film, there is much more.  Val Kilmer positively steals the show with his exquisite performance as Doc Holliday.  His wit and warmth toward Wyatt, his self-confessed only friend, add a charm to the film that transcends the story and will make you want to watch it over and over.  Even when he is in the background of his scenes, he is always watching over Wyatt, hovering like some Colt-toting guardian angel, determined to protect him without regard for his own life.  His electrifying delivery of his line \\"why, Johnny Ringo; you look like someone just walked over your grave\\" near the end of the film will raise both hair and goose bumps on your arms and send a chill down your spine.  And you will find yourself quoting Doc's dialogue, which is delivered with Picasso-like artistry by Kilmer and is as infectious as the tuberculosis that eventually kills him.<br />Kurt Russell does a good job as Wyatt, but seems slightly miscast in the part, if only because he doesn't quite have the right \\"look\\".  Sam Elliot delivers his usual excellent effort as Virgil Earp and Bill Paxton's Morgan Earp deftly handles the not-so-subtle awe in which he holds his older brother, Wyatt.  Billy Bob Thornton, Powers Booth, Billy Zane, Dana Delaney and Michael Biehn each do a fine job in their respective parts.  And, see if you can spot Jason Priestley in one of his early film roles.  Charlton Heston's bit part is done with the satisfying professionalism one expects from this screen legend, leaving only the desire that it had been larger.<br />The photography is transparent, making it easy to watch without realizing just how good of a job the cinematographer did.  Sure, the story isn't completely accurate from a historical perspective, but you will find that minor flaw doesn't matter. This one is a \\"must have\\" for anyone who wants the best movies, regardless of genre.  It is not just the best western ever; it is one of the top 10 of all time in ANY genre.  Don't wait, get it now.  \\"You're a daisy if you do.\\"
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This movie is so forced, trying to be camp, that it really is manipulative and insulting. Who wants to listen to people read Madonna lyrics to each other? The &quot;Warner Brothers meets Rocky Horror&quot; musical numbers are inane. Don't bother, and don't believe the awestruck reviews. This movie has beautiful cinmatography slapped over a seething bit of nuclear waste for a script and for music.<br />The funniest thing about this movie is that, apparently, the director takes it all seriously. Sheesh!
006016848X|3.0|In many of the chapters the facts were diluted by John Gray's opinions.  Many of the experiences were between John and his wife.  This made the book very personalized and hard to apply into my own life.  Many of chapters based on womens moods or mens manlyness are based on the indivisual.  This also makes it hard to apply to your wife or girlfriend. <BR>     This book is probably best for married couples.  Though I am not married some of the chapters helped me understand how a typical woman would react to certain events.  The points made are all very strong and are able to strengthen one's relationship if practiced properly.  It is impossible to miss any of the points made because of the repition that John Gray uses.  This caused me often times to skim the chapter instead of fully reading through it.  Though many of the points were diluted by his opinion, all of them had a hint of truth in them.

B000009O8A|1.0|Part 1: A woman moves from the big city to a small hick town so that she can write a novel. Soon after her arrival she is assaulted ( BRUTALLY raped, beaten, ... and left for dead) by some locals. <BR>Part 2: After surviving the attack(s) she exacts revenge on each of her attackers one by one. <BR>That sums up the plot of the movie. That is all there is to it. Oh, I almost forgot the grotesque, and laughable, scene that is between part 1 and 2 where the heroine goes into a church and asks for forgivness for what she must do to the bad guys. This scene might have had some value had it been established earlier that she was a religious person but never mind.<BR>I don't have a problem with violence in movies, even when they are sick revenge fantasies like this wishes to be. The characters in this movie lacked any dimension so that it was impossible to have any sympathy for any of them. Obviously the filmmaker wants us to sympathize with the women but the way he tries to manipulate us into it by showing us this horrible brutality that is done to her is sick. My guess is that he does this so that maybe we'll think it's ok that she hangs, cuts up, and castrates her attackers. My main beef with this film is the rape scene. i see no reason why it needed to take up a third of the films running time. a good director should know that sometimes less is more. i think that making that long was a sick way of trying to manipulate us into sympathizing with his protagonist. Maybe he wouldn't have needed to do this if he would have properly developed his characters before jumping into the action. And why did he need to make it so graphic. Everyone i talk to says that it has the most realistically graphic rape scene ever. SO WHAT! Just because its realistic doesn't neccessarily make it good, or warranted for that matter. This film was just a showcase for the rape scene. <BR>My opinion is that this movie is garbage. If you want a good revenge movie then rent Death Wish or The Limey or anything for that matter. This film is scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel. I Spit on Your Grave IS the absolute worst film I have ever seen!!!!!!

6305949980|5.0|With the advent of video/DVD, certain movies lend themselves to annual viewing during specific holiday seasons, especially Halloween (It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\\"), Thanksgiving (\\"Home for the Holidays\\"), and of course, The Big One, Christmas (Insert your own favorites here); specific films that for whatever reason manifest the spirit of their respective times of the year, and they generally match up one season per film.  Filmmaker Tim Burton, however, has the distinction of having created a singular film to add to this category, unique in that it is suited equally to both Halloween AND Christmas.  And it tops the entire list of the titles of which that can be said; in fact, it IS the list-- there simply are no others.  Burton's brainchild, which had a gestation period of many years before at last being realized in 1993 is, indeed, in a category of it's own.  It is, of course, \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" directed by Henry Selick.<br /> Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, can put the scare on like no one else.  But after years of doing what he does best-- scaring the wits out of children of all ages, everywhere, every Halloween-- he's bored; depressed, even.  There's just no \\"rush\\" in it for him anymore.  So, after a particularly unfulfilling Allhallow's Eve, Jack wanders off alone into the night to contemplate his circumstance and his future, whereupon he inadvertently stumbles into \\"Christmas Town,\\" and discovers something new (\\"What's this?  What's this!\\")-- a different holiday, as well as the celebration that accompanies it.  Most importantly, though, he also discovers his counterpart, the one who is to this holiday what he is to Halloween.  \\"And they call... him... San-Dee CLAWS!\\"  And Jack, his eyes and ears filled with the sights and sounds of Christmas, is more excited than he's been in a long, long while.  He doesn't know, yet, what all of this is about, but he's going to find out; and he's already made up his mind:  Whatever it is, it's going to be his!  Sandee Claws, step aside-- Jack Skellington is here!<br /> Through the magic of stop-motion animation, Burton's vision-- his story and the characters who populate his \\"nightmare\\"-- comes vividly to life, the process of which is guided along nicely by director Selick.  And what a bunch of characters there are!  Besides Jack (who is, without question, the star of the show), there is the two-faced (literally) Mayor (Glenn Shadix); Dr. Finklestein (wonderfully voiced by William Hickey); Lock, Shock and Barrel (Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, Danny Elfman), the unholy trio who work for the dreadful Mr. Oogie Boogie (Ken Page); and, last but not least, gentle and compassionate Sally (Catherine O'Hara), who cares for Jack and so badly wants to help him find whatever it is he's looking for.  Intriguing characters for a highly original story, imaginatively drawn and presented with care and an expertise that really makes this one work.<br /> Another element that sells it is the engaging score and original songs by Danny Elfman (who also supplies Jack's singing voice).  And Selick uses the music wisely to create an appropriate atmosphere and mood conducive to the storyline.  The songs, especially, are haunting, hypnotic, upbeat and theatrical, and combined with the magic of the splendid visual content, helps set the tone for a rich and thoroughly entertaining experience.<br /> The supporting cast includes (the voices of) Ed Ivory (Santa), Susan McBride (Big Witch), Debi Durst (Corpse Kid/Corpse Mother/Small Witch), Greg Proops (Harlequin Demon/Devil/Sax Player), Kerry Katz (Man Under Stairs/Vampire/Corpse Father), Randy Crenshaw (Mr. Hyde/Behemoth/Vampire), Sherwood Ball (Mummy/ Vampire), Carmen Twillie (Undersea Gal/Man Under the Stairs) and Glenn Waters (Wolfman).  There's a decidedly dark side to this film that may be disturbing to younger viewers, but for those to whom the monster-in-the-closet no longer appears, \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" is good for TWO of your favorite holidays (or actually, for any time of the year, for that matter).  Unique, to say the least, this is a fun foray into fantasy that can be enjoyed time and again.  The story, the characters, the images, the songs; it's all magic.  It is, in fact, the magic of the movies.  Tim Burton style.

B00005QW4K|2.0|I love Army of Darkness.  I waited in line for four hours to see Bruce Campbell's book signing.  He autographed my Army of Darkness t-shirt.  Theoretically, I should love this DVD.  But they cut out the best part!  For those who have seen it, I can tell you that the real ending is nowhere on the DVD, replaced by the \\"original\\" ending.  And when you see it, you will realize why they re-did it.    No Bridget Fonda, no \\"Lady, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store.\\"  Granted, the Audio commentary is great, which saves this disc from getting one star out of pure spite.  But come on.  Would it have killed them to include the real ending?  Or was this a cynical ploy to force us to buy two copies?  Why should I buy this if I have to ALSO buy the real version to get the full effect?  Ridiculous.  If you are a hardcore AOD fan and want the commentary, buy this.  If you want to see it for the first time, get another edition.  This one doesn't cut it.
B00005R62K|2.0|Title should be \\"A Lesson In How To Ruin A Classic And Make More Money By Adding Bonus Tracks\\".  Throw this right in there with Jethro Tull, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Blue Oyster Cult for 70's retreads of the year.  How many more ways can companies package this stuff?  My advice is to find the original \\"Stained Class\\" cd release  on eBay or zShops for a third of this price.  The sound on this remastered verison doesn't show a great improvement over the original.  And after one listen you'll just skip over the bonus tracks every time.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Take a trip to the Moulin Rouge. This film dares you. I went into this movie with high expectations because of all the hype. all I can say is, the film is remarkable. The music electrifies, the heat between Nicole Kidmanan and Ewan Mcgregor is smoldering, and the sets are dazzling. all this combined makes Moulin Rouge the best film of 2001. The film won Golden Globes for Best Actress (Nicole Kidman) Best Original Score, and Best Picture (Musical or Comedy.) While there are no original songs (except for the Kidman/Mcgregor duet &quot;Come What May&quot;) the music is still intense. Especially Kidman swinging on a giant trapeze at the Moulin Rouge crooning &quot;Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend/Material Girl.&quot; You'll never look at the song &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; the same way ever again! All in all, a fantastic film that should win the Best Picture Oscar! Baz Luhrman did a fantastic job!<BR> <BR>A penniless writer named Christian (Ewan Mcgregor) is trying to get a production he writing put on at the infamous Moulin Rouge. Nightclub singer Satine (Nicole Kidman) wants to appear in a production and become a real actress. The Duke is considering putting on a show at the Moulin Rouge where Satine works. They just need a signed deed from the duke to put the show on. Satine, confusing Christian for the duke tries to seduce him. The Duke agrees to let Christian write the production, and let Satine star in it on one condition: Satine belongs to the Duke exclusively. Satine and Christian fall deep in love and are inseparable. But they are breaking the one rule of the Moulin Rouge. That is, NEVER fall in love....<br />Overall Grade: A+ (10++++)
B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day's 4th major album, \\"Warning:\\", is one of the best CD's I have in my collection. The trio is back to the standards that were set with their first major album, \\"Dookie\\", back in the beginning of 1994. The tracks are simple, yet interesting and catchy. Some tracks show they are experimenting with new types of music. <br />Number 6 on the album, \\"Misery\\", is a very unique Green Day song that combines Russian, Mexican and French sounds. Yet the different instruments fit together perfectly and create a nifty song. <br />\\"Macy's Day Parade\\" is another unique track on the album. Sweet violin sounds accompany simple guitar strumming and lyrics with deep meaning. This may remind us of Green Day's earlier \\"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\\" from their earlier album, \\"Nimrod\\", however it's a completely new direction the boys are taking which shows they are maturing as artists. <br />Probably the most popular hit on the album, \\"Minority\\", hops along with folk-like sounds that combine with genuine Green Day lyrics: \\"I want to be the minority; I don't need your authority, down with the moral majority, 'cause I want to be the minority.\\" It is a perfect party song, and the album would not be complete without it. <br />\\"Castaway\\", number 5 on the album, is my favorite track. \\"I'm on a mission into destination unknown, an expedition onto desolation road where I'm a castaway - going at it alone, castaway - now I'm on my own...\\" Those are the highlight lyrics of the track. The song is simple, yet just right. B, G#, E, B, are the notes in the main riff. The fast moving song also includes a short guitar solo that leads into a cool bass riff with shakers in the background. You just have to move to the beat, the song is that good. It is 3:52 minutes long yet it feels like 3.52 seconds. You could play it 10 times over and over again and never get bored of it, which makes it another perfect Green Day song. <br />All songs on the album are good. The other ones I listen to often are \\"Warning:\\", \\"Church on Sunday\\", and \\"Waiting\\".  It is amazing what a band made up of just 3 people can do. Billy Joe Armstrong, the guitarist, wrote all the songs with the exception of \\"Misery\\". He has a true musician's mind, a brilliant musician's mind. The bassist Mike Dirnt and the drummer Tre Cool are also fabulous musicians and all three should be proud of themselves and their accomplishments.
B00002MZ2T|4.0|Its a shame these boys have split up seeing as they made this piece of pop perfection now all we're left with is n'sync.full of heartwarming love songs and sopme rather suprising moments('gunning down romace' a true addition to the dark side of pop).this albums does seem to be more about the lyrics than about the look of the band.shame to see them go really.
B00004XQP4|3.0|You might like this, you might not. Personally, I gave it away to my friend, but you may be different.<br />It depends on your tastes, really.<br />If you were head over heels in love with the old Greenday like I was (my good ol' hometown boys!), you might not like this as much. It's definitely more pop and less punk. This isn't to say that it isn't punk: it's just more of a punk/pop mix with more standard melodies and more designed for radio play. An attempt at a fan pleaser that does not succeed with everyone, and didn't succeed with me.<br />This isn't to say it was a bad CD. It just isn't the same Greenday that I loved. They're actually sounding kind of like Nickleback or Sum41 (EEK! - sorry, couldn't resist.)<br />&quot;Warning&quot; is an okay song. I don't get all the hype about &quot;Minority&quot; - it just sounds like a jingle to me.<br />Buy it if you like, but get Dookie and Insomniac and Nimrod first.

B000021YQV|5.0|At one time, System of a Down was a band I had heard little about. I had heard about but never actually heard &quot;Sugar&quot;. I saw the &quot;Chop Suey&quot; video on MTV a few times and I got addicted to the song, which drove me to go out and pick up this CD as soon as I could. Now, being a more of a fan of bands like Green Day and The Offspring, this music was a little on the heavy side for me. However, I was patient with it and by about the 3rd or 4th listen it really clicked!<br />Prison Song- A protest song about the Prison system of the US. It's really good and the constant screaming adds alot of edge. (like on most of the other songs) 9/10<br />Needles- This one has always been one of my favorite on the album. I just love the meaning of the song and the chorus is awesome and never gets old! 10/10<br />Deer Dance- The heavy intro to this song is great, and the verse following it is even better. Along with Needles, this song definately has the best chorus on the album, but it's verses are much better than those on Needles. 11/10<br />Jet Pilot- Pretty good, but not the best. Everything about this song would be excellent for say..a Limp Bizkit album, but this is a System of a Down album, and it just doesn't measure up to everything else. 7/10<br />X- I really didn't like this one much at first, but it is slowly growing on me. It's really got a great chorus and the verses are decent. Too short. 7.5/10<br />Chop Suey- Great everything, plus jam packed with emotion. The song that drove me to but this masterpeice. I know it's been all over MTV and everything, but it still never gets old for me. 9/10<br />Bounce- At first I thought this was just weird song about a Pogo Stick of all thing, but when you really listen to it it's about girls, and that is sort of strange because System usually talks about more serious things. Yet, the music is really great and moshable. 8/10<br />Forest- I really like Forest, it's probably my favorite on the whole album right now. It has probably the best guitar out of anything on this. The chorus is one of the more emotional and thought provoking and Serj's vocals also shine more than usual. 10/10<br />Atwa- This is the first of the slower songs on this CD. I like it, but it's not really that great compared to the title track or any other song on this. Again, this would really work on a different bands album, but there is much better on this CD.<BR>6.5/10<br />Shimmy- This is another one that took a long time for me to get into, but now I really love it. The chorus is possibly the best on the album, rivaling that of the title track. 10/10<br />Toxicity- If you happen to have a dial up connection and don't want to go through the pain of downloading every song on this album, then just download this one. Everything about this song is fantastic, and it is thought-provoking in more ways than one. 11/10<br />Psycho- This one is not really that great at all in any respect, but it is fun to listen to, and thats important! 7.5/10<br />Aerials- I haven't really fully discovered this song, but hopefully I will in the near future..?/?<br />This CD is probably the best music reflecting on September 11th that I can think of, even if it was released the week before. All in all, a wonderful release that should be heard by all.
B00005LQ04|2.0|This has the Goblin soundtrack which I once bought for the first track, despite it's exhorbitant price. Bit much for six minutes but then it's a very addictive six minutes. Sinister \\"Na-na-na-nah, you're going to die\\" sort of playground thing in the background. Suddenly it goes bananas and someone starts yelling \\"WHICH!\\" Which what? I wish you'd be more pacific. No, that's an ocean. I mean, specific. That's what listening to dodgy Italian dub jobs does to you.<br />Can anyone get past the first ten of this film? That's minutes, not bodies. I've seen that and a bit at the end. I managed to get past the first murder the other night only to see Jessica Harper do the most ridiculous faint in a ballet class ever put on film. Actually, there can't be that many Oscar winning ones, either.<BR>Dario Argento, the director, dismisses objections to his treatment of women in his films and insists on being the hand that stabs. I think he's a coward who won't take responsibility for the climate of fear that women have to live in today. Ah, you say, but what about all the woman in this film who are willing to be portrayed as carved meat? If they have no qualms about betraying their sex, then why should Argento? Well, I just don't want to talk about it anymore. *Sigh* yet another public humiliation.

B000006ZL4|5.0|Every single song on this CD has THE best instrumentals I've ever heard, period. It's just so amazing I'm left speachless. Much better than Dream Theater, but they really shouldn't be compared. I Keep listening to this over and over and I'm simply addicted. Actually the first time I got it I was hooked immediately. It might even be better than &quot;V&quot; Even though I Said that was the best prog metal album ever. The instrumentals and the singing is just UNBEATABLE. My favorite song is &quot;The Accolade&quot;, When i hear the first few minutes of this, I just don't want it to ever end. My other favorite is &quot;Candlelight Fantasia&quot; which has absolutely beautiful and haunting piano playing accompanied with soothing singing. And a Lot of songs have a speed metal sound in the background. None of the songs here are weak, each one is a masterpiece. The 20-minute epic title track is good all the way through. Purchasing this has made Symphony X one of my favorite bands. I suggest this to Everyone in the world, even if you're not a fan of progressive metal, because once you buy this, you will be.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is the best movie I have ever seen!  It has been so long since I have been moved by a movie.  Ewan and Nicole made a beautiful couple.  It was like watching a Disney movie (only it wasn't cartoon, and it was about sex).
B00005R23S|5.0|I'm giving this five stars because it is simply an awesome document of rock 'n' roll's greatest live performer backed by the world's most kick-ass bar band.  The sound and picture of this DVD is almost shocking in its quality.  You'll think that you're looking at an aquarium with the E Street Band playing within instead of a television screen.  However, despite the five star ranking I can't help but remain a little disappointed.  This could have been THE live musical document in DVD history.  Why the Springsteen camp elected to put the HBO special on one disc and then throw a bunch of extra songs on a second is a mystery.  I was at MSG that last night and it was magical.  Anyone watching this will feel its pulse, but what would have put it over the top would have been to sequence this in its proper order with all songs included (except \\"Code of Silence\\" and \\"Further On Up the Road\\" which are new songs probably withheld for a new album).  The second disc then could have been used for songs played on the penultimate evening (\\"The Ties That Bind\\", \\"Don't Look Back\\", \\"Jungleland\\", \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\", \\"Back In Your Arms\\"), additional interview footage with more screen time for the band - these seem to be fascinating people especially Steve Van Zandt.  Subsequently we could then see and hear the deafening crowd chant of \\"E STREET BAND / E STREET BAND\\" and the entire song that led up to Bruce almost breaking down in tears as he sang the last lines of \\"Blood Brothers\\".  Despite these faults this is certainly a must-have for any Springsteen fan, hell any fan of rock and roll.  For those of you with Britney / Creed / Matchbox 20 / etc., fans in your home, please pop this in and give them a rock and roll education.  They'll probably thank you for it.
B00000DR5W|4.0|The spirit of this album is closest, among his large body of works, to that of 'Neo Geo' and 'Heartbeat', in which Ryuichi tried to deconstruct the barriers among various types of music, such as pop, classical, world (ethnic), etc.  'Neo Geo' was an intelligent avant-gardist album which still sounds fresh like its two immediate predecessors `Esperanto' and `A Futurist Guy' as well as YMO's  `Technodelic'.  But `Beauty' on the face of it sounds more like mainstream pop (maybe obligingly for his contract with Virgin!) still with his characteristic style of a residual avant-gardist flavour mixed with ethnic music.  Surprisingly as it was at the time of its release, most pieces turned out to be vocal music, and he started singing himself often quite unlike him until that point in his career.        He once categorically refused to admit, perhaps light-heartedly in an interview ('skmt', a book published in Japan) conducted in Japanese, that the album was then fashionable (e.g. through Peter Gabriel's works) so-called world music.  But it is perhaps safe to say that one of the greatest sources of inspiration for the album was that genre, when you find Youssou N'Dour ('Diabaram') and several little-known local Japanese singers (Y. Ganeko, M. Koja, and K. Tamaki who all sang in 'Neo Geo') all singing in non-English, and arguably Arto Lindsay ('Futique' and reading in non-English in `Rose').  What you'd particularly notice is his effort to exploit ethnic resources which are more accessible to the Japanese ('Asadoya Yunta', 'Romance', and 'Chinsagu no hana', the last one of which has been recycled memorably in his opera 'Life' as 'Evolution of Life'), just as B. Bartok did, as a Hungarian composer, in Eastern Europe.  I don't think what he did in this album comes naturally from any Japanese artist, but only with very conscious highly artistic intention beyond the national norm.
0553106635|5.0|The best (and worst) thing about reading a lengthy book (or a SERIES of lengthy books) is that you spend so much time with the characters that you feel like you really know them; it's as if they really exist. That's good, if good things happen to them. If BAD things happen, though.....<br />   A storm of Swords, Book Three in George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series, is pretty much an endless parade of horror and misery, as characters I have grown to know and love are subjected to some pretty nasty plot twists. I read A LOT, so this next statement, coming from someone who can smell a plot twist coming a mile away, is really saying something: This book has a twist that just knocked me right the hell out. I was so stunned that I put the book down and didn't touch it again for a few days. I needed time to recover. And the end is a shocker! (Don't peek!!!) In the space of 925 pages, Martin took all of the assumptions I had about how this series would end, and threw them out the window...the only complaint I could possibly have is that I wish the rest of the series were available NOW. I can't wait to see what happens next!<br />  Martin is an incredibly skilled writer, juggling literally hundreds of characters (There is an index in the back to help us keep track of who's who and whose side they're on), a HUGE landscape (The book has 4 maps to help the reader), and a whole score of plots and counter-plots. He also manages to take someone who had been one of the prime villains of the series, and turn him into someone vaguely likeable. <br />   I was very angry at Mr. Martin for what he did to my favorite characters in this book, but I'll have to forgive him, because I can't wait to see what he does next. (Don't keep us waiting too long, please!)

I'm still waiting.<BR>The effects were good - especially the bugs - but the movie didn't make the CGI artists' efforts worthwhile. They left out almost all of the things that made the book great - the emphasis on personal responsibility, the bloody failures in the early part of the war, and the whole motivation for the war. I don't remember them mentioning the whole &quot;we make them extinct or they make us extinct&quot; angle anywhere. <BR>The amplified armor? Couldn't do that - you might hide the faces of the actors. What you ended up with is a goofy story of a bunch of teenagers shooting bugs, and a lot of extras getting sliced up.<BR>This movie sucketh, and sucketh mightily.

0767812646|4.0|I bought this movie because I had some vague, but pleasant memories of it from my childhood.  I must say that the movie did not disappoint.  It is a well-crafted musical with vivid characters.  While they're not exactly analogous to their Dickensian counterparts, who portray a much darker, seamier side of London's underworld, the characters sparkle.  Ron Moody as Fagin is unforgettable, and Wild as the Dodger was a perfect casting job.  The musical numbers are memorable, hum-inducing performances, such as \\"Consider Yourself\\"  \\"Oom Pa Pa\\"  \\"You got to Pick a Pocket or Two\\" and \\"Who Will Buy\\". My personal favorite is \\"Reviewing the Situation\\" because I feel the lyrics to that song are so well done and so well executed by Moody.  The adorable Mark Lester is the weak link in an otherwise strong chain.  He plays a passable Oliver, but lacks the oomph that the others bring to their roles, and his voice is somewhat airy but sweet (according to other reviewers, too sweet).  Nevertheless, he fulfills his end of the bargin, portraying a rosy cheeked cherub in the presence of villains.  Oliver Reed plays Sykes to perfection, exuding such dark evil that his sinister shadow precedes him onto the screen.  I handled his killing of Nancy better as a grown-up; however, young children may find that scene as distrubing as I did twenty years ago.  Overall, this is  a finely done musical, and for me, was time well spent. <br />I think I'd better think it out again.

B000002NC4|5.0|I'm not much on words so I'll keep it short.  This is a classic right up there with the best of em'.  The songs, production and (of course) the guitar playing are top notch.  The only drawback, to those who are unfamiliar with the band, is Doug's voice.
B00000JTB2|5.0|Most serious blues fans know how much of an influence Albert King was on the guitar playing of Stevie Ray Vaughan.  This was especially true when Stevie Ray would dig into a slow blues number; when you listen to his solos on tunes like \\"Texas Flood\\" or \\"The Sky is Crying\\" you can hear him playing Albert King licks note for note.   The CD \\"In Session\\" captures Albert and Stevie Ray jamming together for a Canadian television show back in1983.  For years, this blues summit was only available as a rare bootleg video tape; I borrowed a copy a friend had purchased at a specialty store in Austin, TX.   Now that the music has finally been released on CD, everyone can enjoy a great performance by two sorely missed guitar heroes.<br />Where just about anybody with an FM radio knows who Stevie Ray Vaughan is, casual listeners may not be as familiar with Albert King.  Albert King was a frequent performer at Bill Graham's Fillmore auditorium back in the 60's, opening for rock acts like Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix.  Albert King soon developed a large following among white rock fans, and was an early idol of the young Stevie Ray Vaughan.  Albert King's most memorable records were cut on the Stax label, and his \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" became familiar to rock audiences after it was covered by the group Cream.  Albert coaxed a unique, string bending sound out of his Flying V guitar; a sound that many artists have since tried to imitate.<br />Hearing Stevie Ray and Albert playing together is a rare chance to hear a young artist and one of his idols share the stage.  The musical chemistry between these two blues greats makes for joyous listening; each one seems to bring out the best in the other.  The two really stretch out on the slow blues numbers \\"Stormy Monday\\" and \\"Blues at Sunrise\\", and show off some fiery licks on the up-tempo \\"Overall Junction.\\"   Stevie Ray takes over the vocals for a version of his own \\"Pride and Joy\\", and the two exchange solos between verses.   When you listen closely to this album, you can hear just how awed Stevie was to be in the presence of his idol.  This is especially apparent during the bits of dialogue between songs.  At one point, Albert reminisces about a young \\"Little Stevie\\" timidly joining him onstage in Austin.  Stevie laughs good-naturedly, like someone being teased by an older brother.  The respect these two artists had for one another is undeniable.  Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan may no longer be with us, but thankfully music like this helps us to keep their memory alive.
B000000ZGO|5.0|A woman once approached Isaac Hayes and started talking to him about how much she loved Hot Buttered Soul.  The excited woman said to him, \\"Mr. Hayes, you have no idea what I've done to your music!\\".  To which Ike replied in his deep voice, \\"Oh, I believe I do.\\".<br />This is one of the greatest soul albums of all time.  The whole thing has a late night groove.  \\"One Woman\\" is a fairly weak track compared to the rest but \\"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\\" would be worth the price of the album alone.  For the first eight minutes of the song Isaac talks while the bass thumps quietly in the background.  When the song kicks in it's like cool water pouring over your face on a hot summer day.  <br />If you love old school soul music and you don't have this one, then you are really missing out.

B00005QIPH|4.0|The hype surrounding this band before they even hit the studio for this album was enormous.  It's notable to see how the reacted to the pressure: just look at the title of the album.  This tongue in cheek, nonchalant attitude sums up this CD.  It's obvious the band shrugged off the pressure and just did what they do best: write great rock songs, without anything unecessarily clouding the picture.<br />Other reviewers claim that The Strokes aren't very good, that their songs are too repetitive and simple.  In this case, repitition isn't a bad thing.  And repeated listens will reveal that these guys are very good - a lot of subtle things happen in these songs.  Take the first single &quot;Last Nite&quot; for example.  The song starts out with just a single, repeated guitar note.  This note returns several times during the song.  And in spite of the repetition, it's catchy as hell.  The song was surprising to me the first time I heard it - the riff takes off in unexpected, but natural-sounding directions.<br />If you equate complexity with good music, don't get this CD.  Complexity has its place - Smashing Pumpkins are a good example - but can also be disasterous, as on Sunny Day Real Estate's &quot;Rising Tide&quot;.  This album is the best collection of pure, unadulterated rock I have heard since Oasis' first album.  You'll be tapping your foot and singing along (if you can understand the words) as this album grows on you.  Other highlights include &quot;The Modern Age&quot;, &quot;Hard to Explain&quot;, and the more subtle &quot;Trying Your Luck&quot;
B000059HCJ|5.0|Darren Aronofsky, it seems to me, is on his way to be one of the best, most influential directors of the 21st century. His work on Requiem For A Dream, like on Pi, is absolutely stunning, with brilliant use of experimental photography and editing techniques, short, thematically repeating shots (also used in Pi) and the original split-screen techenique. The movie is truly breathtaking, and I mean that most literally - I was starting to run out of oxygen after the first thirty minutes. And I only saw it on VCR. I can only imagine what this must be like in a huge, dark theatre. The harshness of the scenes and the fast, video-clip pace of the movie make it a very difficult, but very rewarding, experience.<br />The seemingly complicated plot covers for a very simple idea. The story (This time adapted from a novel, the story for Pi was written by Aronofsky himself and was much more complicated and original) revolves around four main characters, and tells their four individual tales, with the common elements of addiction, illusion and their consequences. This idea, though, is materialized wonderfully, and makes for a very, very powerful movie. All four characters - Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his mother, Sarah (Ellen Burstyn), his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his friend and drug-dealing partner Tyron (Marlon Wayans), are remarkably well-developed, and each one is a full, real human being. Praise should go to Aronofsky but also to all four wonderful actors, especially Burstyn who did a really remarkable job as the TV junkie jewish mother.<br />The movie is shocking, difficult, painful. You'll feel like your brain is being torn out and cut into little bits. But it's worth every minute. Do NOT rent this out for good light entertainment, but watch it, and eagerly wonder what Darren Aronofsky has in store for us next. I know I am.
B00005J9U1|5.0|&quot;Stir it up&quot; and &quot;lively up yourself&quot; can get me out of bed any morning(for a sister who loves her covers thats a big statement)<BR> All the essential songs you need. Just put you in that mood of relaxation or what ever mood you want to be in, just throw on some Bob. My current favorite is Waiting in vain just got me feeling good! The live feeling that begins with no woman no cry just does some thing to me. Best when in traffic,windows up,hotboxin, or early sunday mornings in pajamas and socks whenever it's worth every penny!
6305622914|4.0|Funny, feel-good comedy about 6 guys who are unemployed and complain about their state of affairs. They agree to do a strip show for a few bucks, but with one slight twist--they'll take EVERYTHING off! Robert Carlyle (who was downright scary as Begbie in \\"Trainspotting\\") has never been funnier and so at ease onscreen, and the other supporting cast memebers (including Tom Wilkinson) are also good. A great movie about following your dreams, physical appearance, and beating the odds. So why the mere 4-star rating? Because there are virtually no features on this disc (just a trailer), plus the sound is not 5.1 surround but 2.0 stereo. It sounds good for what it is, but I would have like to have gotten a better audio presentation. But these are small gripes: \\"The Full Monty\\" was one of the better movies of 1997 and warrants your attention.
0780631684|4.0|Here is a movie that maintains captivating drama and suspense, despite a premise as bizarre and absurd as thinking Trick-or-treat is an airplane. A high school kid getting ready to fly to Paris on a field trip has premonitions that the plane will crash. He and several others get thrown off as a result. When they survive as a result when the plane does crash, death comes back with a vengeance to stalk these victims it missed, and it seems their odds are grim. Perhaps the best reason to see this is to see impressive and then seemingly promising young actress Ali Larter at the zenith so far of her career. We might hope that her career will rise again, but it has some recovering to do. Before this she was wasted in the lame slashfest HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, and after this she went on to be almost as wasted as the murder defendant in the turgid misfire, LEGALLY BLOND. After that the best thing to her name is her role in JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK. That movie has offbeat charm and her role is not without its bizarre merits, but let's face it: It ain't a role with \\"positive career move\\" written all over it. So, here we have Ali at the once and possibly always zenith of her career, in the present movie as the bizarre-named character Clear Rivers. Watch and enjoy this suprisingly watchable flick. It's well worth suspending disbelief of its premise!
0517122707|5.0|Just when you think you've forgotten this delicious book, a memory will pop up regarding the chattering Miss Trixie... or perhaps a bottle of Dr Nutt.  If you like quirky characters and implausible but sadly realistic story lines, do yourself a favor.  Read it.
0380788624|5.0|Get this: The Allied Powers in World War II had cracked both the German and Japanese codes and had tons of information about Axis troop movements, but the Allies HAD to use the information judiciously so as to not make it completely obvious that the codes had been broken (as they would then be replaced with even stronger codes).  The Allies' efforts to conceal their knowledge of the broken codes is the most interesting part  in &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, a novel which follows four different characters (three during World War II, one in present-day time).  The novel continually cuts between the four threads, usually with a little cliffhanger at the end of each chapter before jumping to another storyline.  I found this cliffhangerism somewhat irritating, but I guess in a 900-page book you have to manufacture some suspense to keep the pages turning.  The plot lines range from somewhat interesting to completely gripping, though, so while I always hated to leave one, I was usually glad to rejoin another.<br />There are a lot of little side stories that the author tells as well; a five-page dissertation on eating cereal and a series of graphs plotting one character's productivity versus the time since his last orgasm are my favorites.  I can see why these digressions bugged some readers, as it takes some of the steam out of the plot when the novel takes these interesting but random leaps, but I thought they were entertaining and the narrative is all chopped up and blended anyway with different plot lines.<br />Neal Stephenson is clearly well-versed in information theory, war history, computer network security, the perils of starting a new company in the 1990's, and lots of other esoterica that he displays throughout the book.  I enjoyed the holding forth on various topics, but then again I'm a computer scientist who studied information theory.  I think readers who aren't fascinated by network security or explanations of code-breaking techniques can safely skim over those bits and get back to the meat of the plot, however.<br />Some bits of the book are a little too cute, for instance many of the characters in the present-day plot thread are descendants of the characters in the World War II threads.  Also, the present-day protagonist, a network hacker named Randy, spends the whole book wooing what I would call the discerning hacker's dream woman: a fiercely independent and no-nonsense professional scuba diver.  Why this selective and ambitious woman would fall for Randy is not quite clear to me (but maybe that's just self-loathing talking, since I can identify with Randy to some extent).<br />My only other complaint is that the author tries to answer critics of the Internet by setting up a straw man, a fatuous Finnish professor, whose glib criticisms are easily refuted by Randy.  The Finnish professor and Randy's ex-girlfriend are examples of overly politically correct academics who deserve to be mocked; I just thought that their characters were such caricatures that it makes Stephenson's attempt at satirizing them seem rather too blunt.<br />On the whole though, I completely enjoyed the book and read it voraciously for a couple weeks.  Stephenson comes up with many original and sometimes even absurd concepts in the novel, and I was always interested in reaching the next page to see what he would say next.bits and get back to the meat of the plot, however.  <br />Some bits of the book are a little too cute, for instance many of the characters in the present-day plot thread are descendants of the characters in the World War II threads.

B00005RHGK|1.0|There is a method of shooting horror films where certain elements are masked in the shadows and what you don't see can be more terrifying that what you do--this movie didn't use this technique. I guess the director thought this movie would be even scarier if you couldn't see anything at all. An innovative solution, but I think it came up a little short.<br />Truly good movies have another element called pacing. That's where the pace of the movie slows down to deliver character and plot information, then speeds up to send you racing through action sequences. So at the end of the movie you feel well informed and entertained. They elected not to do this in this movie as well. It starts off nice and slow with the main characters establishing themselves, that drags on a bit too long, and then they inexplicably reversed the equation with the action sequences being painfully slow, and rushing through any informative scenes. So at the end of the movie if felt uninformed and irritated.<br />Foreshadowing is another method good stories use to make you anticipate what is going to happen later in the movie without giving it away, so once it is revealed everything clicks into place and you have all the satisfaction of seeing the last piece of the puzzle fit into place and you really knew what it was the whole time, but couldn't quite put your finger on it. The title of this movie contains such a device, although it was utilized with all the finesse and understanding of a junior-highschool remedial english student. They attempted to use it in two different methods (both of which are valid) each of which undermined the other, and either one on its own would still be considered half-baked.<br />I could go on and on, but I've already wasted more time than I care to on this wasteland of a movie. Was there even a script? It just seems like they were shooting by the seat-of -there-pants. As each scene drags on I can practically hear Ed Wood barking directions from off-camera. The thingthat really makes me lose sleep over this sad excuse for a movie is that Francis Ford Coppola actually put his name on it--he has a producer credit. I just can't even begin to understand. The horror... The horror...
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is positively one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. Russel Crowe (The Insider, Gladiator, Proof of Life) gives one of the best perfomances of his career. This movie deserves the four awards that it won and possibly the Best Actor Award if politics had not got in the way. It is very powerful and moving. And the message behind it is sweat and simple, \\"Love Conquers All.\\" I highly recomend this movie to anyone who loves movies. It has just enough action and adventure as it does drama and comedy. It is an extreemly wonderful and vivid portrayal and is very entertaining. It even has a good shock value in the middle of the film for those who do not know anything of the story from the beginning. Well written and portrayed.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I absolutly love love love this movie, one of my favourites from the python collection, this new dvd is great if only for the neat extras that are included. The only glitch i find in it however is that subtitles keep poping up during the movie which is a hair distracting, fortunatly i have the first Extra free dvd which was released subtitle free! But really the new extras are fab, the distracting subtitles are not.

0440180295|5.0|Slaughterhouse five presents a refreshing view of the time-worn anti-war theme.  The novel skillfully blends history, science fiction, and humor to illustrate the story of Billy Pilgrim, a man who was never made for war.  Slaughterhouse five focuses more on Billy's life than the actually bombing of Dresden to show that war itself is not as dramatic as the people's lives who fought it and were changed by its effects.<br />If you are deciding whether to read Slaugherhouse five or Catch-22, pick Slaughterhouse five.  Though both books are similar in theme, Slaughterhouse five is shorter, easier to follow, and far more amusing and enjoyable than Catch-22.
0451204530|3.0|I found this account of space flight in the 1950's very entertaining.  While the concept of wiping out someone's short term memory is hard to believe, I enjoyed the idea of trying to find out who you are by testing your knowledge and experiences. The hero, Luke, found out who he was too quickly, but the whole story has a quick and entertaining pace. Follett created an insight into the world of early space launches at Cape Kennedy and I enjoyed the action switching from D.C. to Alabama, to Florida.  I bought this book for a long plane ride and was happily engaged  for the trip.  I echo the wishes of other reviewers that the characters should profit from more development, particularly Luke's wife.  All in all, a worthwhile effort.

An undercover cop tries to disrupt a band of hijackings that are done by a suspected group of street racers. i ownt give away the ending, but all of the race scenes are excellent. the portrayal of teh racing scene is accurate, i would know being a part of it. also, the cars are some of the best imports on the scene. i would reccomend this movie to anyone who is looking for a fun ride.
0871137380|5.0|And so ends this excellent book that was clearly written against all odds to tell this horrible story as seen through the eyes of the soldiers. This book will make you angry and sad and will make you cry without a doubt. It is an emotional roller coaster that I couldn't recommend higher. I would strongly encourage you to start by reading the closing epilogue. Bowden explains his amazement that the story had not been appropriately documented and how he was able to meet many combatants at a memorial dedication that opened the doors for him to write this incredible book. I would also strongly encourage you to read the book prior to the movie. While I enjoyed the movie, the written words of the book more accurately record how deadly this attack was and the terror involved. This is not meant as a negative review on the movie, just the power of this book.<br />I must admit, I only vaguely remembered this event. And that is a sad statement that these men could die in the duty of their country without the nation remembering them. The Somalia mission was to provide food for the starving. But in a country dominated by civil war, the top warlord, Adid, quickly steals the food giving the UN Peace force a reason to expand the mission to controlling Adid.<br />On this day, the Rangers and Delta force storm a meeting to capture two top ranking Adid officials when eventually two Black Hawks are shut down. Immediately surrounded by a frenzied crowd, the Rangers and Delta force must fight to save fellow soldiers overcoming fear and injuries to stay alive. It's absolutely amazing more were not killed, as they had to spend the night in this hostile environment.<br />Areas the book covered well not particularly well covered in the movie include some of the following. The difference in Rangers and Delta Force. I was not aware of the power of the Delta Force and how they trained differently. This may have contributed to the problems of the mission. Lack of water and night vision on the mission. Since they thought this was a one-hour mission beginning at 3:00 in the afternoon, no one thought to bring water. What a terrible mistake in this hot environment under extreme physical duress. In addition, the terror of the \\"Lost Convoy\\" could not accurately be reflected in the movie. The book describes how the convoy would stop at each crossroad giving the terrorists time to run one block over and be waiting at every crossroad with a hail of bullets. Basically, every street was a reign of bullets and RPG. No wonder they eventually had to head to the base with over 50% casualties. Also, the plight of Mike Durant, the captured pilot was not covered thoroughly enough in the movie in my opinion.<br />As amazing as this story is, the fact the fighting crew had to run out with the armor support eventually moving ahead of them is even more astounding. I strongly recommend this book to learn more about the brave men who fight for their country.ission.

B00005RHGK|3.0|Throughout the movie, you follow a brother and sister who are being chased by this creature. This creature is attacking everyone it wants, and these two sit there and watch, and when they want to escape, they escape by a hair. <BR>The movie did have the disgusting scenes that are still in my mind, which make it difficult for me to sleep at night. It needs a better plot line, but the scare/disgusting factor is good.

B00003CXTG|2.0|I didn't think this movie could be as bad as the critics made it sound, but after seeing it they were kind.  What a load!  Bruckheimer and Bay never made great films, but at least sometimes they've been entertaining.  Like Armageddon, this movie is neither.  What a shame, because their was a good enough cast and budget to make a last act tribute to the Greatest Generation.  As a bonus, Bay and Bruckheimer ran an uncontested 60th anniversary tribute film.  <br />We've all heard about the script, and it's all true.  It's both unintentionally funny and unconsciously ridiculous.  Give this team credit for not using irony as a safety valve.  Who else would dare put lines like \\"There's nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer\\", or \\"Do me a favor, pray for both of us\\", or \\"Don't worry, you've trained us well\\" over foreboding mood music?  It's priceless.  If you watch Alec Baldwin closely for each of his stilted lines, he looks like he's having trouble keeping a straight face.  You'll have an even harder time.<br />Then there's the love triangle where Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett (or Affleck, depending on the scene) stare at each other doe-eyed.  It's like From Here to Eternity without the chemistry.  It's consistent with the rest of the scenes in that no cliche is left unused.  It might be a waste of time to point out the gaffes if that's what they're supposed to be, like why would at least 10 kids get together at 7 am on a Friday morning to play baseball?  Didn't Hawaii have school in December?  And how did Red suddenly lose his stutter after the raid?  You'd think in a movie like this that other characters would at least mention it.<br />The historical discrepencies are understandable, except for the scene where FDR rose to his feet.  Weren't the attack and the bomb raid important enough without bogus scenes thrown in?  That's part of the problem.  If you're gonna call a movie Pearl Harbor, spend 9 figures making it and premiere it in front of actual survivorsat the scene of the crime, the story and drama of the attack are enough for a movie.  Save the Tokyo bomb raid for another movie and spend the time and money that you would have spent on some 3 dimensional characters, the attack itself and the aftermath.<br />This isn't the worst war film ever made, but it won't be forgotten.  To all future schoolchildren who will inevitably have to sit through this movie during a social studies class, we all apologize in advance.  Unfortunately some current and future teachers will have a dubious grasp of history and even more dubious taste in film, so they will make you watch.  It is not necessarily because they want to punish you.  Now if they force you to watch it in detention....

I also like &quot;Crazy For You&quot; and &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;.  Some of Madonna's cornier songs are also enjoyable, such as &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and &quot;Material Girl&quot;.  If you're a casual listener of Madonna's music, this is the perfect album to get!
B000000W5N|5.0|In the 60s, I grew up in a midwest suburban cocoon. I wasn't at Woodstock in 1969; I was 10 years old. I turned 13 in the summer of 1972. Flip through my 45s and find Barry Manilow, the Troggs, the Eagles, Alice Cooper, and Honeycomb. On Sunday nights my ear is glued to Casey Kasem's Top 40, coming out of Chicago into my red transistor radio. Then I hear this SONG! Like nothing I've heard. It grabs me by the ear and whispers, no, screams! THIS IS ROCK AND ROLL!! It's Tumbling Dice by the Rolling Stones and it changes me forever. I can't afford a double LP on my lawnmower's salary, so I buy the 45 instead. There's this song on the other side called Sweet Black Angel, and it's also like nothing I've ever heard before. I have to wait until Goats Head Soup (still one of my faves, who cares about critics?) until I can buy a complete Stones album. But this song, this 45, started me on a long love affair with the Stones that continues on to this day. Today, they say this is second only to Sgt. Pepper as the greatest rock record ever recorded, but Sgt. Pepper sounds so dated today, while Exiles sounds as fresh as the day it was recorded. #1 in my book!

6300213129|3.0|Young Robert Walker, Jr. conveys much of the same creepiness as his dad (who is affectionately remembered as Bruno on Hitchcock's \\"Strangers on a Train\\").<br />This episode reflects many concerns that are timeless, but also others that are characteristic of the 1960s, the period when the show was made.  Young Charlie is a wild child.  Should he be disciplined, and if so, how?  Or should he yield to his impulses (which in this case are murderously destructive)?  This episode ultimately sides with the importance of parental authority, reminding us that ST-TOS was often more Eisenhower-era than beatnik in its sensibilities. A point in its favor, I should add.<br />Other highlights to be enjoyed in this episode. Uhura sings gorgeously (as in \\"The Conscience of the King\\"). Shatner gets a chance to horse around in the gym.  Grace Lee Whitney stands up against sexual harassment.  And there are two strikingly gruesome Star Trek moments, which, once seen, never leave your mind.  Two young female crewmembers get in Charlie's way.  One lady has her face completely obliterated, another becomes hideously and shockingly aged in a matter of seconds.  ST-TOS offers many of these never-to-be-forgotten visuals, some bloodcurdling, some breathtaking (two classic examples; the moment in \\"The Tholian Web\\" when the Thol ship starts building its web; the fruitless attempt to blast through the Talosian service elevator door in \\"The Cage/The Menagerie\\").<br />Though not one of the best ST-TOS episodes, newcomers to the show may enjoy this one.
0553579908|5.0|Think \\"Lord of the Rings\\" meets \\"I Claudius\\". Even darker than the first novel \\"A Game Of Thrones\\", Mr. Martin pulls out all the stops in \\"A Clash Of Kings\\". There's murder, rape, incest, and that's only the first couple of chapters. With so much going on it's difficult to keep track of all the characters, even with a scorecard. Still, Mr. Martin has kept me at the egde of my seat with this series (and at almost one thousand pages a book that's a pretty good trick). I generally don't like \\"door stopper\\" novels, but I'm making an exception here.
B000000OQF|5.0|Well, what else can be said about this one? I can still remember the day I bought this for the first time (October 10, 1987).Several worn-out copies later, \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" remains my favorite recording of all time. For me, the timing of ths record could not have been better. This became my personal soundtrack during my junior and senior years of high school.There was much I could identify with: anger and rebellion(\\"Out Ta Get Me\\", \\"It's So Easy\\"),the longing to be somewhere else(\\"Paradise City\\"), and the feelings I had for that special girl(the #1 smash\\"Sweet Child O'Mine\\"). These days,when I put the CD on, I just sit back and think about all the years that have passed, and the music still has the same impact it had then. It is rough around the edges, even sloppy at times, yet this is what seperates \\"Appetite\\" from some of the band's later efforts. It carries real, raw emotion that feels genuine, not manufactured.In the era that was the late 1980's, there was commercial pop(Whitney Houston), commercial rock(U2, REM) and the endless wave of commercial pop-metal(Poison, Ratt, Motley Crue, Bon Jovi, etc...) When Guns N\\" Roses came along, it's guitar crunch along with it's Sex Pistols' attitude and lead vocalist Axl Rose's sometimes sensitive/sometimes angry, but very intelligent lyrics, GN'R filled a void which had been missing since the late 70's, when Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, and The Rolling Stones were kings of the hard rock mountain. Subsequently, GN'R themselves were supplanted by the alternative rock movement of the early 1990's, as well as causing their own demise with all the internal fighting/drug use/Axl's increasingly odd behavior, to name a few. As of this posting, Axl Rose is still attempting a comeback using the Guns N' Roses name. \\"Chinese Democracy\\" is the rumored title of the new recording, but it's been 11 years since the last new CD's of original material(1991's \\"Use Your Illusion\\" I and II). Nevertheless, if Guns N' Roses never resurfaceagain, \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" will stand as one of the truly magnificent rock albums of all time,and perhaps as and indicator of what impact Guns N' Roses could have made had the band stayed intact in it's original form.

B00004SPYJ|5.0|Before she made us study &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in High School, my English teacher had the wisdom to show us this version of Romeo and Juliet. I had always thought that Shakespeare was for wimps. Once I watched the initial brawling scene on the TV screen, I was hooked. It is one of my favorite films of all time.
0767802470|5.0|I have seen this film more than three times now on Director's Cut DVD, more if you count the TV broadcasts of this film.  This is a film where you can watch over and over again, and still find some new insights.  <Das Boot> has received many accolades over the years, and let me just say that they are all true.  The acting in this film are superb, and the lighting and set up are virtually flawless.  One memorable scene for me in this film was the shot of the captain in the dark when the submarine was under attack by depth charges.  His face was almost ghost like, showing the battle fatigue that any U-boat captain would have endured under such circumstance.  It is such attention to details, accuracy and empathy that marks a true war classic from ordinary or bad war films.  <br />More specific to the Director's Cut DVD, I found the extra commentary on this film to be extremely insightful, and it really gives you an idea of how much this film has helped the healing process for those surviving U-boat veterans.  Films like <Das Boot> and <Stalingrad> are a testament to hellish nature of wars, and to the enduring human nature.
B000002LCE|3.0|This is the first Dio's first album without Vivian Campbell, and a pretty good one at that.  Craig Goldy proves he can hold his own in Dio's strange musical landscapes through a series of tough, crunchy riffs and solos (just check out the intersting riff on the album's title song).<BR>As far as the rest of the album goes, everything is pretty average.  The band still is exploring the same musical themes that it had on previous efforts, creating a somewhat standard (but still entertaining) metal album.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I bought this CD for the track \\"Video\\".  But, by the time my daughter(who happens to be 3years old!) and I finished listening to it, we were in love. Every woman from 3 to 93 should own this Inspirational masterpiece. India's soulful, hot buttered, melodic voice is wonderfully paired with lyrics that are uplifting to the soul. I am comfortable allowing my young child to listen to this music. I feel confident knowing the messages she recieves from these songs will be that of Strength, Individuality, Confidence and Love.  Thank You, India
B000002L7V|3.0|Like any Dio album, this is chock full of mystical lyrics, operatic vocals, and burning guitar work. In fact, all of these elements are top notch in Sacred Heart.  Ronnie Dio's vocals are inspired, Bain and Appice's rhythm section is as strong as ever, and Vivian Campbell's guitar work is fast and furious.  These things do much to help the record, but there are scores of other things that weigh it down.<BR>First of all, this album has the most clinkers of any other early-lineup Dio recording.  While cuts like \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Children\\" are invigorating, they are lost in the horrid songwriting of \\"Hungry for Heaven\\" and \\"Shoot Shoot.\\"  This is not to say that all of Dio's early work is flawless, but it is much more consistent than this offering.  Also, Dio seemed to know his limits a little better before, since he has traded once concise song structures for longer, more complex pieces that simply fall flat on their face.   \\"Last In Line\\" was not a short song, but at least it didn't lag along like the title track does here. <BR>Generally, this is an album that is best appreciated by Dio's core audience.  As a result, casual metal fans may want to forsake Sacred Heart in favor of Dio's first two efforts, Holy Diver and The Last In Line.
6304076517|5.0|Prospero's Books is not just another of many &quot;Shakespeare modernized &amp; set in a different era&quot; film (not that I don't like those). This is Shakespeare's most fantastic work, The Tempest, hyped up with incredible sights &amp; sounds. It's a dazzling work of imagination based on a dazzling work of imagination. I imagine it hasn't shown much or received much acclaim because of the nudity (LOTS of nudity!), but it certainly is NOT porn. This film is a trip!

0451523938|4.0|Seems to me that the popular conception of this story misses the point a bit.  It's not about good vs. evil -- not really.  It's a tale of social repression and liberty.  <br />Dr. Jekyll discovers a duality within himself -- he states that he is \\"inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellowmen...\\"  but also that he has an \\"...impatient gaiety of disposition\\" that runs contrary to his desire to be esteemed and respected amongst his fellowmen.  <br />And so in truth it is not a dichotomy of Good and Evil -- not in a universal, philosophical sense of those words.  Rather it is a dichotomy of Respect and Passion.   The duality Jekyll finds within himself is of this nature: he truly loves the respect of those around him, but that necessarily means sacrificing \\"undignified\\" behavior.  On the other hand, he truly loves to be undignified, free and unfettered, but that means sacrificing the respect of those he esteems.  <br />Stop right there.  And so what leads him to what he later describes as \\"shameful acts\\" is not so much a desire to do evil, or even a love for vices, but a simple passionate nature.  This speaks of the Victorian set of virtues -- reserved, under control, calm, wise, respected, anything but passionate and impetuous -- more than a more true virtuous nature -- full of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness.  And so Jekyll is condemned by his society to see his more passionate nature as shameful.<br />Jekyll's endeavour is to disconnect these two halves of himself -- this, in itself, could be a worthy experiment, but the danger comes because it is one that his performed upon (and curiously connected to) his own psyche, and there is a grave conflict within his psyche.  In endeavoring to disconnect these two personalities, he is recognizing that neither one is morally superior to the other -- one is simply accepted by society while the other is rejected.  A passionate and undignified man is notby nature more sinful or wicked than a reserved and dignified man.  I would say he believes this on paper, but not in his heart.  Deep down, he is a product of his society, and believes, along with those he esteems, and dignity and reservation are virtues, while passion and recklessness are vices.  <br />Yet perhaps this book is a tale that conforms to, instead of reacts to, Victorian morality.  Edward Hyde turns out to be uncontrollably wicked, murderous, and evil.  Perhaps the point is  that there is no liberty, lack of dignity, \\"gaiety of disposition\\" without wickedness, and virtue lies in reservation and bridling the beast within.  That Jekyll unleashes a monster because he refuses to recognize it as a monster, believing what I wrote above -- that if one could disconnect the two halves, both could live their lives well.  <br />If that's the case, then the book is based on a lie, and one of the lies I hate the most -- that passion is ugly and deformed and should be killed before it can kill.   <br />I remember another story- one of a man who lived in the desert, dressed in camel's hair and ate locusts.  A man who was passionate about doing good -- he was called the best of all men.  And of others around him, pious reserved men who kept the law and were respected in everyone's eyes.  They were called white-washed tombs.<br />want to discuss? ...
B00000DFSK|5.0|This might as well be one of those rare exceptions where the essence of a band is summarized well in a &quot;Best of...&quot; recording. The album focuses on studio recordings by the band before 1990 (don't look for any post-Achtung Baby material here!) plus one new track, &quot;Sweetest Thing,&quot; a nice tune which sounds like a preparation for &quot;All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2.&quot; If you get a chance, though, try to get a copy of the DOUBLE version of the album ([IMPORT] [EXTRA TRACKS]), which is filled with B-sides which come greatly appreciated for those of us who never got a chance of listening to some of those more rare old works.
0688062334|4.0|For those of you that are interest in Harry Potter or Narnia or any young reader fantasy books, &quot;Howl's Moving Castle&quot; by Diana Wynne Jones is something you don't want to miss.  What can we say about Howl's Moving Castle?  Well, its got action, where many battles between Howl the wizard and the Witch of the Waste.  Its got humour, consider a fire demon is afraid of the old lady Sophie.  It is cool, great characters and surprising events you won't expect.  This is one of the book I was reading during the disaster of September 11, and the book really cheered me up.  Believe me, if you live 6 blocks away from the World Trade Center and can't get back to your apartment for 14 days, you wouldn't like to get any more depress than that.<br />A surprising news is that an Animation Studio in Japan called &quot;Studio Ghibli&quot; (the same studio that made Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, and Kiki's Delivery Service), they have got the right from Diana W. Jones to make an animated motion picture adoption of the novel.  Something there to get you reading!
B000002UDB|4.0|Ah yes, this is the album where William Campbell started his diabolical takeover of the Beatles as we knew them. It is very well known that good ol' Paul McCartney was tragically killed in an auto accident on October 10, 1966 (&quot;he blew his mind out in a car, he didn't notice that the lights had changed&quot;). Luckily for the Beatles, he'd left a lot of good songs lying around from his proposed solo release, and most of them were so good they comprised more than half the next Beatle album, the venerable Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. However, after this, it became obvious that McCartney's death couldn't remain a secret, so they did the most obvious thing-- hired William Campbell, a McCartney lookalike and soundalike, to continue on in the band, under the name Paul McCartney. As this album shows, we were not fooled.<br />Magical Mystery Tour is sort of like a bargain cutout Sgt. Pepper. It was about this point that all of the extra effects and gimmicks started to overshadow the actual material, and they got a little dull. It definitely doesn't help things when Campbell was just now trying to write music that was to follow-up such brilliant pieces as &quot;Fixing A Hole&quot; and &quot;She's Leaving Home.&quot; He does certainly try; his &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; is a respectable companion piece to &quot;When I'm 64,&quot; but it's obvious he was just copying the mood and style of the earlier song to recreate some kind of joy, and it only half succeeds. Likewise, his &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; is sort of a dumbed-down &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; it has the elements going for it (extravagant sound effects, three-part harmony, horns), but when you actually think about it, there really isn't a song here. Luckily there was still an old McCartney song hanging around, &quot;The Fool On The Hill.&quot; It helps keep the credibility of the album up, and Campbell does a really nice job performing the song. Unfortunately, his own material couldn't match up. In fact, though Lennon did contribute the absolutely brilliant &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; and George penned &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; (simultaneously creating a genre all his own-- electric mellotron raga), Campbell's lack of proficiency and the other's lack of interest in the project resulted in their using &quot;Flying,&quot; which is actually a tape of Ringo singing in the shower with drums and guitars overdubbed. Sad really.<br />Luckily, in America, the album came padded with some really neato singles. (Of course, they weren't released in their true stereo form until the 70's, but that's not important.) Thus, this album features the brilliant coupling of &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever,&quot; the sledgehammer of a single that hinted to the world that the Beatles were up to something big. It also includes &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; (one of several Campbell songs that mimic McCartney's gift for catchy pop, but lack the true dexterity and thus get REAL annoying after a couple months), &quot;Baby You're A Rich Man&quot; (a nice Lennon tune, showcasing his wit and affinity for oxymorons). And it all ends with &quot;All You Need Is Love,&quot; which is kind of idealistic and sappy, but it's also really really really great.<br />So, this was a pleasent debut for William Campbell. He did hone his talent during the White Album the next year, and actually became a very worthy competitor on Abbey Road, but even so, ever since 1967, the work presented by &quot;Paul McCartney&quot; has been very spotty and often detestable, with flashes of sheer brilliance every now and then to keep us all on our toes. Enjoy!
0764009842|5.0|Exxon Mobil Masterpiece Theatre has done it again! This fantastic TVmovie adaption of the grand Dickens story of \\"David Copper\\" is something all family must have. Though we all know often an film adoption of a novel is not as original as it should be. However, in this production you will find pieces of evidence that the film stayed loyal to the novel. Most of the characters are well adopted in the movie, scenaries are well setup (you will love to see Yarmouth, the boathouse is fantastic!) I believe all Dickens fans will find the film something worthwhile to watch for.
B000002UAU|5.0|Okay, here's the thing. Sgt. Pepper is not the greatest Beatles album. There's a huge difference between cultural significance and musical significance, and I think we are perhaps only now entering an age where we can separate the two (most critics prior to 1990 grew up when this album &quot;changed the world,&quot; and a lot of critics since then have simply gone along with the whole thing). It's a brilliant disc, yes, but most Beatle albums were (and are). I give it five starts because it's a bloody great album, but it's not the greatEST.<br />Just the same, it's a remarkable accomplishment. Revolver had more or less shown what the Beatles were currently capable of as songwriters and musicians, and Sgt. Pepper fused it with a thematic quality and unified spirit (concurrent with the era) that surely must have blown a lot of folks away, who were quick to dismiss them as lovable moptops. The neat thing about this album (as well as Revolver before it) is you can absolutely feel the excitement, you can sense how experimental and intrigued the Beatles were with trying new sounds and doing things nobody had done before (well, nobody they were aware of anyway). The way the title track segues into &quot;With A Little Help From My Friends,&quot; by no means an original idea, is still really cool for a pop disc. &quot;Lucy In The Sky&quot; is beautiful, I've always been a big fan of the way the chords wash into eachother (very psychedelic). The reason this album is so nice are the small little touches, the drone in the middle of &quot;Getting Better&quot; that almost gives it a cut-time feel, or the harpsichord intro to &quot;Fixing A Hole.&quot; In any other circumstance, these tactics would seem pretentious, but here they just sound right (largely because, again, nothing like this had ever really been done with such a global audience). &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot; is rather hokey, the string arrangement (one of the only that George Martin didn't orchestrate) is a littletoo syrupy for me, but the idea is really nice and the call-and-response in the chorus is really nice. &quot;Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite&quot; is inspired brilliance, the most obvious nod to PET SOUNDS on the record (especially the bass line), a perfectly sublime John Lennon ditty.<br />&quot;Within You Without You&quot; is also really nice; while I'm a bigger fan of Revolver's &quot;Love You To&quot; (not to mention &quot;The Inner Light&quot; which came later), this one is really pretty, with great orchestration by Martin and a very lovely melody. &quot;When I'm Sixty-Four&quot; manages to be one of the only McCartney novelty tunes that doesn't make you want to travel to Liverpool and shove his face into a pile of mud; I'm not sure why, it's probably because this was one of his first and it only got cuter after that. &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; is a great song, I love the piano solo, and the way the ending dissolves into echo oblivion is neat too. &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot; is vintage Lennon, especially the time signatures and stuff. Most everyone mentions the way the rooster at the end of the song &quot;morphs&quot; into the guitar, so yeah, that's cool. The reprise is neat too, it does make the album feel more like a complete statement. And then. . . there's &quot;A Day In The Life.&quot; Just go buy this album, if you haven't been sold by the last song you won't be, and if you've never heard the final song before, prepare to be amazed. This is THE one song that is lightyears ahead of anything the Beatles had done before, with the possible exception of the entire medley on Abbey Road it's the most artistic piece they ever attempted. It's brilliant. You won't be disappointed.<br />Yes. Good. Buy it.

B00005IC2H|5.0|if you could sum up pure bliss in music this would be it. Sigur Ros humble themselves to the greater good, creation. the way this band goes about writing is rather interesting. they basicly start on one riff or vocal chord & write the song around that. even tho english speaking people cannot understand the power of the words themselves, we find a way to make up for it ten fold by the sheer beauty of this record. with a mix of eerie voice & guitar (played with a chello bow) playing backed up by orchestra. you can't help but wonder if they had one of those elves that inhabit iceland running around the studio giving them magic tricks to work with. <BR>if nothing i said so far presuaded you to buy this record, hear this.<BR>this band HAS to have seated venues when they play. they prefere to play small venues either opera houses or churches to get a certian atmosphere. forced seating is critical becos so many people get caught in the throes of it all & blackout.<br />...
B00005RHGK|1.0|I have never in my life seen such an insipid, pointless, and utterly annoying piece of so-called &quot;horror&quot; as this poor excuse for a movie!  I am big horror fan, always looking for a good horror movie to see, and this piece of film was the worst I've ever found.  The scariest thing about this movie was that it brought in a single penny at the box office. <BR>     Watching the characters do the dumbest possible things scene after scene was annoying, and if I hadn't seen it in a theater with a lot of people making funny comments, I would have walked out.  Aside from some grotesque imagery at various points in the movie, there was nothing scary in it.  This attempt at horror will leave you not only unamused, but rather annoyed that you wasted an hour and a half or so of your life watching it.
B000000OQF|5.0|The original and the best. Although Use Your Illusion 1&amp;2 had some fine moments, this remains their finest hour. <BR>It is not often that I like every song on an album, but I cannot criticise any tracks, from the opening chords of &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, to the finale of &quot;Rocket Queen&quot;. Nothing needs to be said about this album that hasn't already been said. 1000 words isn't enough to express the joy of hearing the guitar solo in &quot;Sweet Child Of Mine&quot; for the first time, rising with &quot;Paradise City&quot; to a superb climax, tapping your foot to the sheer danceability of &quot;Think About You&quot; or just sitting back and listening to &quot;It's So Easy&quot;. Who can mistake the opening strains of &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; or the frenetic energy of &quot;Nightrain&quot;<BR>What can I say........buy it.

Despite the predominantly youthful audience, you could still hear a pin drop during Spock's death scene.<br />The film works so well on so many levels but the single greatest reason STII is revered by so many Trek enthusiasts worldwide is b/c it is, perhaps, the only Trek film to celebrate the passion of life and death so poignantly.<br />If you haven't seen it, do so ... even if you're not of the Trek variety.
B00003CXN4|3.0|I saw this movie for the first time tonight, and as a matter of fact, it was the very first movie that I watched on the new DVD player I bought today (my first). I was enthralled by the movie. It was a heavy, sometimes-hard-to-follow movie. Make sure you are not looking for a light-hearted comedy. The movie was a mix of many stories, all interwoven. The scale and scope of the various plotlines vary from family life to international negotiations. The characters are sometimes confusing, but overall I am glad I saw it.  <BR>The DVD however was a slightly different story. Since it was my first DVD experience, I loved the basics (picture and sound quality, chapter skipping, easy navigation, zoom, picture-perfect pauses, etc.) However, I was not overly impressed with this perticular DVD's features. It seemed there were few and uninteresting features. The trailers are fun, but you could just watch them online. I would like the DVD to have seen more cool features. Overall good, but not excellent (3)
B00005RHGL|3.0|Although I'm a greater fan of the Lawrence Kasdan / Kevin Costner version of Wyatt Earp's life, TOMBSTONE -- the Director's Cut -- is a marked improvement from the original threatrical version.  Several key scenes are extended from the original release, and many new scenes are added that give the characters a bit more emotional depth.  While much of the action still remains over the top, Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer epitomize the violence so prevalent between the lawmen and the Cowboys of the time period.  Don't be duped, however, by the documentaries; they're very short, and they truly don't add much to the experience.  While some interesting tidbits are thrown out about the making of the picture, very little is of relative substance.
B000002ADT|5.0|For the listener there's so much going on in Kind of Blue that each time you pop it in your cd player, there's always another revelation that comes to you. That's how it is with me.

As time passes the ripples give way and you see deeper and deeper into the pool. It begs to be played over and over.

Not being a comtemporary Jazz fan by habit (more then Country Western type) I was a little surprised when her voice captured by undivided attention.

B00001W0FD|5.0|This is probably my favorite movie of all time.  It's simple and beautiful, but you can read other reviews for that stuff. All I want to say is be careful about which version you order, because this particular one(the reddish box that says &quot;Sidney Berger&quot; at the bottom)IS NOT THE COMPLETE VERSION OF THE FILM.  When the movie was released, it came out in several different shortened forms in order to fit double bills at drive-ins, and the print they used for this particular video is definitely missing a bunch of little scenes here and there.  Video companies are often unscrupulous about the quality or completeness of the prints they choose to format, because if you've never seen the film before, you wouldn't know the difference. This one's still good as far as picture quality goes, but if you are a neurotic like me and you strive for completeness, don't get this one.  They re-released the original film in the 1990's, a fully restored version, I'm not sure which one it is, but don't confuse that with the reMAKE from the 90's. Bad. So don't get the reddish one or the remake.  The good version has an introduction by Herk Harvey, director/lead zombie, that plays before the film. Great movie though, find the full version and snap it up.  See you in zombieland!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Great works of art that challenge conventional notions often polarize opinion, and it's obvious that \\"Moulin Rouge\\" has done just that.  The polarity of opinions seen here on Amazon mirrors the love-it/hate-it reactions the film generated upon release in Spring '01.<br />I think this is because \\"MR\\" reinvents that most sacred and traditional of genres, the romantic musical, and because the film has the audacity to take pop culture [and pop music specifically] seriously.  Plus, the idea of watching Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, whatever you think of their acting, SINGING for more than two hours isn't intuitively appealing.<br />But I urge viewers to give this movie a chance if you haven't already, and I'd highly recommend buying the DVD if you already DO like the film from the theaters.  This is a marvelous piece of cinematic entertainment and the DVD is a fantastic exploration of the medium and the source material.  I applaud the director and his crew for delving so deeply behind the scenes.<br />Make no mistake:  \\"MR\\" is a work of art.  If you didn't like it, I posit that you didn't get it.
B00005NB0H|5.0|Live at Leeds is among the most intense live recordings of a rock band ever. The remastered edition of 1995 restored the sound of this masterpiece in a way that made me feel like a I was sitting next to the band when I putted the CD in my cd player. Now, the record label has released the entire concert in this beautiful packaged special edition.<br />This is a must buy for anyone interested in having a complete Classic Rock collection. Live at Leeds captures a band in its &quot;hungry and angry&quot; years. The crow, the songs and the performers blended to create not only a great concert album but a document to rock and roll. <br />The high point for this release was the incorporation of the Tommy tracks for the first time. This would be the earliest recording of this work known and it simply adds another perspective to this legendary record. <br />The original Live at Leeds was only about 6 songs long and this contributed to its intensity. The thing that amazes me is that now with the full set the concert does not looses any intensity or emotion.
B0000524CY|5.0|The Excorcist is probably one of the scariest movies ever made, with some of the most unforgettable scenes ever cought on film.  If you are under the age of ten, i suggest not watching it because you will be scared out of your mind, that's not a promise, thats a guarantee, other than that I suggest to everyone to watch this movie, i really do.  Although the focus of the movie is on a girl \\"possessed\\"by Satan, it really is a movie about faith and whether or not a catholic priest really has it.  I can't give away the ending but this movie will raise many a question as well as hairs while being viewed.  <br />Truly this is a timeless classic and would make a great dating movie, this movie hopefully would chase the girl or guy for that matter into your arms, it is that scary.  I have yet to try it out, but hopefully i can convince her to watch it.  Any who I really suggest you viewing this movie, it is some scary stuff and  I'm pretty sure you won't leave without feeling a little different after watching it.  See my listmania list and other reviews for other great movies.
B00005LMBK|4.0|Gorillaz is the 21 century first concept album. The idea of artist using fictional caracters is something that has been appealing to succesful artist over time. Maybe the best example of this is the Beatles Sgt. Pepper album (which in no way I am comparing to this release by the way). By using this approach artists are able to free themselves from stablished ideas regarding their musical background and it allows more room for experimentation.<br />Gorillaz has done just that and it has produced and interesting and inventive recording that along with the comic strip characters presents a very believable piece of work. This may not be the most important record of the century but one thing for sure is that it brough excitment to a quite lame year in terms of new and interesting concepts in music.<br />What you get is fresh tracks with music that it does not take itself too serious and that mixes elements from hip hop, electronica and rock.
B00005JKMO|5.0|The director took great pains to illustrate the struggle that 3 time heavy wt boxing champ Ali endured during the first 10 or so yrs of his life.  Ali's latter portion of his career, particularly the fights with Frazier, were thrilling moments that the movie simply did not cover.  Thus, there needs to be a sequel.
B00005JKCF|4.0|I'm really looking forward to this big-screen version of my favourite comic - I've been reading all the Spidey titles for 20 years. I think Tobey Mcguire is an excellent actor, although I'm not sure about the new-look Green Goblin...but I guess I'll get used to it. My only fear is the usual one people have when a cherished franchise recieves an adaptation into a new medium - will it capture the essence of the comics correctly? I don't know how Sam Raimi will cope with handling such a big project as this, so different to his other work, but I'm pretty confident he'll do the best job possible. Let's hope so!
B000002UB3|5.0|Intended as their last album, the Beatles reached a height and granduer with Abbey Road that can not be matched.  Though not as innovative or varied as several of their other efforts, as a complete album, a single piece of music, it has no peer.  Arguably, the second side of the album ( the tracks beginning with and following &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; ) is the best piece of music in the popular canon, featuring the second side medley ( &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot; to &quot;The End&quot; ).  George Harrison finally moved out from behind the Lennon/McCartney songwriting team and siezed a share of the spotlight with &quot;Something&quot;, a beautiful ballad, and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;.  And of course Lennon and McCartney themselves are in as fine a form as they ever would be.  In my opinion, there is no better piece of music made in the last fifty years that can compare.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|I had never heard of Rufus Wainwright before I saw him singing<BR>with Sean Lennon in the John Lennon tribute concert on TV<BR>(fall of 2001).  I was impressed by the strength of his voice,<BR>and that he was singing with Sean Lennon seemed like a strong<BR>endorsement to me.  So I went on line and read the reviews of<BR>his disks and picked this one up based on the the rave reviews.<BR>I am not disappointed.  <br />I mean, wow.<br />There is incredible talent here.  The songwriting is beautiful<BR>and as well crafted as anything Ben Folds, Elvis Costello, Michael<BR>Penn or Aimee Mann (just to name a few of the songwriters I like and<BR>who might be crafty in a vaguely similar way that Wainwright <BR>is).  And the arrangements are simply astounding.  Is<BR>Wainrwright entirely responsible for everything on this album,<BR>or do Alex Gifford, Ethan Johns and Damian Legassick deserve<BR>a share of the credit?  I don't know, but the whole thing works.<br />It's deep.  It lush.  It's grand.  It pops.  It rolls.  It sticks<BR>in your head.  Great great stuff, this.
B00005N53P|5.0|This album is definatly the best rock album in a long time. It gives me hope that there may infact be some life left in rock. The songs are reminiscent of The Ramones, with a touch of the Doors or The Velvet Underground. The album just came out and I am already eagerly awaiting the next one!
B00005OCMR|5.0|I think I speak for every Tron fan out there when I say that this 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition is long overdue but most welcome!  The only way you could improve upon this brilliant piece of work is to release it in a director's cut with DTS, but this still gets 5 stars in my book.  For everyone's information, this is a 2-DVD set.  First one contains the movie, complete with THX Optimizer.  Second one could be entitled &quot;Everything you ever wanted to know about Tron but were afraid to ask.&quot;  It not only contains the deleted scenes, but it also contains storyboards, photo galleries, and an extensive &quot;Making Of Tron&quot; documentary with interviews.  I learned a ton (or should I say Tron) of stuff out of that documentary, among which is the fact that Cindy Morgan still looks magnificent after all this time!<BR>This DVD is a vast improvement over its DVD predecessor, being THX-certified with beautiful widescreen picture and rich 5.1 sound!  Wendy Carlos's music score has never sounded better; I look forward to getting the CD soundtrack when it is released (again long overdue.)<BR>When this movie came out, it quickly became my all-time favorite and to this day, it has stayed there.  Thank you, Disney, for creating this 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition, and thank you to everyone (cast and crew) who helped make it a reality!
B000002HHB|5.0|Natalie Merchant delivers an addictive, reflective, and at times haunting, expressive artistry.  Even my tried-n-true classic rock/metal hubbie pops it in when he thinks I'm not listening!  This CD will never be far from your player.  A definite must have!
0738203335|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Even though I knew some of the history of the Free Software movement before starting to read this book, alot of missing pieces came to me. This book does not only contain information about Gnu/Linux, but also about the people involved, what their motives were for doing it, and how all the strings magically came together. It describes the people, and the idea of Free Software in a non-biased way, which is good once in a while.<BR>Great book to relax with.
B000002HRE|5.0|After reading some of the reviews posted up here i was annoyed. Yeah, i accept that metallica have slowed down to a brisk walk compared to the nauseatingly fast earlier recordings, like whiplash and master of puppets, but like it or not, metallica are still one of the most powerful sounding bands in the world today. <BR>i rate this record 5 stars because it deserves it in my opinion. they have put the time and effort into producing this record and going down new roads - there is no point in manufacturing the same stuff all the time, people will get sick of it which is why load and reload was a welcome change.<BR>dont get me wrong, master of puppets is my all time favourite album and it will take something exceptional to knock it off. i would give puppets a higher rating if i could! reload, however doesnt do this in my opinion.<br />this album is great, go buy it - its well worth it, but get master of puppets first. it still remains the standard for other emerging metal bands to aim for
068818071X|5.0|This book is huge it's over 550 pages,yet it reads like it's only about 300. Before you know it you're well over half way  through. Keyes first book &quot;Watermelon&quot; kept me laughing. This one actually brought a few tears. It's not your average addict/recovery story. I like how it allows her to tell her story yet in the latter half you'll find certain parts of her story being retold with very different perspectives. It almost had me going back to look at certain parts again. I loved it and can't wait to read my third Marian Keyes book &quot; Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married&quot;.
B000002JAX|5.0|I, too, came to this site hoping for the newest release.  I've had Dreamland for many years, and am always checking to see if Ms. Peyroux has done anything else.  Her sultry, sexy and fun presentation of new and old songs is unique.  I really love her music, and would recommend her to anyone who likes the Patsy Cline-Billie Holiday--type style.
B00000K0DT|3.0|Let me start off by saying this is one of my top 10 movies and if I was just grading the movie I would give it 5+ stars, but I am grading the entire DVD.<br />This DVD could have been so much more and had so much potential.  The director's commentary was very informative and at times funny, but was just not enough.  The commentary made reference to scenes that were left on the cutting room floor but for some reason were never included in the DVD.<br />It also would have been nice to get some commentary from the actors regarding their characters.<br />I can only hope that a special edition DVD comes out and offers this plus more.
0788811355|1.0|'There is no God', the so called hero of this film announces mid way through the movie.  This one line sums up the world-view of the entire film.  A 'war' film?, I think not. This film is a vehicle to promote the ideals of man-over-morals.  But even this film has to acknowledge the destructiveness of that lifestyle, if it didn't then none of it would have been believable.<BR>  The unlikable, so called hero, of this film destroys the lives of everyone around him because he lusts for a married woman, and she obliges him. They are two self-indulgent, self-pitying people who happen to find each other and do exactly as they please no matter who it hurts.  This is not a love story, he himself makes it clear to her that she should not get too attached to him, enforcing the fact that to him it is all about sex.  The pathetic part is that the viewer is supposed to like them and cheer them on?  The only likeable character in this movie is the husband and he dies trying to kill the hero, I only regret he failed, the movie could have ended on a high note right there.<BR>   As for anti-everything-that-is-good, the only scenes with Americans is when they almost cause a sub-hero to be blown to bits.  We are supposed to be angry as they callously drive their tanks too close to him while he disarms a bomb, and the whole time they are cheering and celebrating the liberation of Italy, how dare they!  The British are not spared either as their treatment of the (German by the way) hero is shown as nearly racist.  (Maybe the script writer never saw what Hitler did to London).<BR>   In the end we are supposed to believe this is true love, after over 2 hours of muddling through an adulterous affair looking for a plot.  We finally end up getting a lesson in mercy-killing, only the viewer wishes it were he who gets the morphine at this point.  <BR>   The moral? How about...have some.  Trust in God, not yourself, maybe then you will be happy in whatever state you find yourself instead of always going after the forbidden fruit. That way you don't die a painful, protracted death (literally or figuratively) and taking everyone around you with you.  If that were the point of this movie then great, unfortunately we are supposed to embrace these people and their actions...pathetic.
6302293553|5.0|From the opening credits this movie gives belly laughs galore.<br />The ending is a little lame, but it is difficult to end a great classic, so the gang did it in the most unusual way possible.<br />After watching this movie, I never thought of coconuts and swallows (African or European) again in the same way.<br />Watch it and enjoy!
6304398395|5.0|How different would Hollywood be if it had not of been for Charlie Chaplin? This film is about Charlie Chaplin from his childhood days to his days in Switzerland. This film has all the important things that happened to Chaplin including: his first love, acting on stage for the first time, moving to America, getting paid $150 a week making shorts, opening his own studio, the many wives he had, the FBI and the reports on him, making talkies, getting kicked out of America, living in Switzerland, going back to Hollywood to get an award, and other detailed information about his life. This film is based on his autobiography.
6304626495|4.0|This a very funny movie and shows Python's dry wit and physical humor together in one showing.<br />Much like Dogma, some people will be offended due to the nature of the movie, but if you can take it with a grain of salt, as intended, you can truly enjoy this movie for what it is.  A funny movie that makes fun of people.<br />For an even better Monty Python movie, take a look at The Holy Grail.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes &quot;Is This It&quot; is the most exciting thing i've heard for ages. This album is raw and emotional.  Frontman Julian Casablancas has an incredible voice.  In certain instances he sings in a wonderfully lackadaisical manner, in other moments his voice sounds intense and driven. For those of you who have been waiting for something fresh in the rock scene, this is it.
0064407667|1.0|This book was purchased as a gift for my 8 and 10 year olds who loved the Harry Potter series.  After reading the cover, I decided to read the book before they did.  I found the book to be very dark and brooding.  It was billed to be for those who enjoyed \\"Harry Potter\\"...  I did not find that it had any of the positive adult-child relationships found in the Potter books.  \\"A Bad Beginning\\" is quite a depressing read.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.
0385505833|1.0|Other than to boost sales, I don't feel that Mr. Grisham should be proud of this one.  About half way through this brief book, I just wanted it to be over.  If you want either a fun or an uplifting Christmas novel, look elsewhere
0440416027|5.0|I read this book out loud to my three boys, and couldn't put it down!  I got goosebumps while reading it.  It hinges on the edge of fantasy and reality.  David Almond plays on our human need to believe in angels and takes it a step beyond.  This book is a must read.
B00003CXN4|2.0|after a lengthy discussion with a freind about this movie i thought id come and see what other people thought about the film.<br />i for one find i vastly overated...the only strong plot line being bencio del toro's...first off...the colored washes gimmicky, easy..and artsy for art sake not needed nor do they add anything to the film except to make you realise youre now watching \\"character x's\\" story line.<br />now the idea of catherine zeta jones rich suburban wife taking over her husbands business while not impossible is highly improbable and lends an air of unbelievabilty to that part of movie..but that pales in comparison to the problems with michael douglas and his story in the movie..<br />1. yeah ok got it even the drug czar can have a kid hooked on drugs..wow..shocking..<br />2. um ok so none of these super rich kids deals drugs they all travel to the ghetto to get it?..please..what world do these film makers live in find any high school in any neighborhood in america and you will find a kid that sells drugs..<br />3. ok now the \\"drug czar\\" needs to find his little girl..who he cant believe is on drugs..so he takes to the streets no gun no cop no nothing..again ridiculous..a judge that prominent doesnt know one cop in his state he can trust or one person to bring with him to navigate the dangers and could the national drug czar not think a gun might be needed?..or could he not get one?...totally unbelivable<br />4. it just flat out doesnt happen that way in 99.9% of the cases<br />you dont go from your first taste of a drug..crack..to the level she got to in the span of what?..a week...give it a 6 months then maybe...and the imagery of the evil black drug dealer sleeping with the poor white confused girl is beyond sickening and racist..what she didnt have anything to sell to get some cash before she became a hooker?..none of her friends could loan her 10 bucks...<br />5. michael douglas is just not a very good actor..and the boyfreinds little speech to him about blacks and whites and the drug trade was such an obvious \\" i know what you liberals are gonna say and here it is to cut you off at the knees\\" bit of dialouge its funny<br />ok enough ranting...im a big movie fan and after one too many people trying to tell me that this was such a classic i needed to vent a little : )<br />ok so i get it drugs are bad..gee thanksd whites and the drug trade was such an obvious \\" i know what you liberals are gonna say and here it is to cut you off at the knees\\" bit of dialouge its funny<br />ok enough ranting...im a big movie fan and after one too many people trying to tell me that this was such a classic i needed to vent a little : )<br />ok so i get it drugs are bad..gee thanks
B000002G87|5.0|A great example of chemistry & kinship being more efficient than the suprgroups he was involved in up to this point, this proved to be Clapton's pinnacle achievement as an artist. <br />Take his soap opera situation, the band he surrounded himself with (Was there a better rock drummer than Jim Gordon around this time? Has there been a better collaborator for Clapton than Bobby Whitlock?), throw in Duane Allman, Tom Dowd producing, & what you have is a album with great songs, vocals... & yes, guitars. <br />Clapton, whose music is marred at times with inconsistency, was at his BEST in the late 60's & early 70's, & this is the best example of him at his finest.
B000002JNG|4.0|This album came in 1990 which is the year I graduated high school and so therefore may be more sentimental for me than anything but I can't help but love this record.  &quot;I cried&quot; is my favorite cut.  A great song with some of the same mystical qualities that made the Zep records timeless.  My second favorite track is the last one &quot;Watching You&quot;  Plant opened his show with this song.  I was suprised by that but it was awesome.  All of that massive percussion in the beginning balanced with the clean strumming acoustic.  I love this song as it is one of the best displays of desperation.  &quot;Should my darkness prevail, or does your memory fail&quot;  &quot;Love on the wing carry my prayer cherish this moment in times of despair.&quot;  Another highlight was when the entire band picked up acoustic instruments (guitars and mandolins) and played Liars Dance followed by Going to California.  I saw the Plant/Page show a few years later but it wasn't near as impressive.  Anyway...good stuff.
B00005RFAI|1.0|I liked the first Pink album. I think she's a beautiful person with a very strong attitude. I enjoyed the first single off this album and the video. I bought this CD and [didn't like it]. The lyrics are absolutely mind numbing to where i was embarassed listening to it, AND I'M NOT EVEN FEATURED ON IT! This is an embarassment to Pink. This isn't rock, or pop, or anything other than bulltripe on wax. I would rather listen to a Slipknot remix of Britney Spears' \\"Slave 4 U\\" than listen to this... from beginning to end. The beats are wack. The lyrics are wack (and we wondered why Four Non-Blondes didn't last long), and the whole vibe is wack. If she hopes to heal after the cut this is gonna make she'd better call in Timbaland, Missy, JD, Swizz Beats, and The Neptunes for the next album. As much as I hate all of those people it's the only way she'll survive...
B000005H4K|5.0|This is an amazing opportunity to hear Duke in a small group.  His playing is astoundingly clean, thoughtful, spare, yet completely swinging and at times full of beauty.  The energy and elegance that comes through is perfectly set against both Mingus' and Roach's more rough-hewn and sometimes humorous tapestries.  It's one of my favorite trio recordings.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This c.d. is totally awesome.I've been constantly listening to this c.d. for over a month now,as it's just so pulsating with excitement and thrills that it will blow your socks off!On this side of the Atlantic it has been getting a mixture of rave reviews or some more serious hacks make it out to be some sort of bad joke.To describe his music you have to take a trip back to the mid 80's when loud heavy rock music was filled with fun,certainly wasn't meant to be taken very seriously and was the perfect way to kickstart all parties.This is the greatest thing about his music for me,as it's such a welcome break from all the doom and self-gratifying gloom of groups like Staind and Creed.At first I was majorly shocked when I heard this it.It sounded like a cross between Billy Idol,Def Leppard and Meat Loaf-talk about bad taste!But it works so well.Each track is laden with enormous guitars,heavy fast furious drumming,mid 80's synths and out front W.K.'s gruff and grunted vocals.In fact the keyboards are so grandiose that it keeps each track pumping with pure energy.Each track seems to grow from one catchy riff to the next,so it's very accessible.Catchy verse,catchy bridge and an even catchier chorus.The lyrics are so good in that they are completely daft and are just on about being positive and having a good time.On his debut c.d. the word party is mentioned in the title of 3 songs.All of his songs are over almost before they've really started which means you're not very likely to get bored with them.Thankfully the one aspect of 80's rock that he has left out are the ever predictable guitar solo's.If I did have one fault it would be that many of the songs sound very similar-there isn't a slushy ballad in sight here,which I suppose is a good thing.<br /> The c.d. starts off with the explosive &quot;It's Time To Party&quot;-it only lasts for 1:30,but it sets the tone for the whole album.The first 3 tracks sort of lead straight into each other and they are all excellent.The next really great song is track 5 which introduces some uncredited female backing vocalists which give the songs a sort of 'Bat Out Of Hell' feel.I have to say I wasn't a major fan of that classic album(I'm probably alone with that opinion),but I really like this stuff.Track 6-&quot;I Love NYC&quot; is a perfect sentiment for current times,even though I'm sure it was written before the terrible events in September.Lyrically the next 2 tracks are pretty crass with one called &quot;She Is Beautiful&quot; and the other amazingly entitled &quot;Party Til You Puke&quot;-see what I mean about wanting to have a good time?!?Track 10 is one of the albums highlights.On this track-&quot;Got To Do It&quot; his vocals sound quite different-it's more singing and less growling.It's a track that has one catchy riff after another-I mean it's even hard to pick out what is the chorus.The title track starts off with synths sounding like an array of horns.It's really up-tempo and almost has a rock meets dance music feel to it.Once more the female vocalists close out the track in a sort of bombastic fashion.The final track is pretty short as he repeats one of the many sentiments of this album,that is to keep on living in the red!By the end of the album you are so out of breath you need to take a short rest,before starting over the 40 minutes of rock fun and mayhem all over again.If his concerts are anything like the album it will be incredible!<br /> I don't know how big this guy is going to be,but I'm really hoping the spirit of this of his debut album will give guitar music the kick in the butt it so badly needs!Party On!!!
B00005RHGK|1.0|Before I start, let me say I'm a serious fan of horror films. Good horror films. I had heard so many good things that I finally broke down and checked this &quot;film&quot; out. Apparently the rave reviews were all from people who also consider 'American Pie' to be a classic american comedy. The first 20 minutes or so of 'Jeepers Creepers' were intense and excellent. It created a mood very similar to Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Sadly, from there, it sank like a rock. A particularly heavy rock. Like so many other horror films it quickly degraded into an accidental comedy. I like a good monster movie, but this wasn't one of them. With about 30 minutes left the movie started to feel like it was being filmed without a scripted ending. As if they were &quot;winging it&quot;. Terrible. Save your money.
B000003CMC|5.0|Duane Allman once said that he \\"eats a peach for peace.\\" Little did he know that it would bear the title of his next album, of which fate wouldn't allow him to complete. Duane never got to reap in the awards of their new found fame & success.<br />The Fillmore album is still the ultimate statement for the ABB, but this album is the companion album to showcase Duane's enormoous talents. The main centerpiece is the long Donovan inspired \\"Mountain Jam\\", & the romping cover of \\"One Way Out\\" with a snarling Dickey Betts solo & jaw dropping slide solo by Duane.<br />Imagine, a ROCK band from Macon, GA. incorporating the spirit of Kind of Blue, Herbie Hancock, & the Carter family... & creating, improvising, pushing each other... for over 30 minutes! However, their mastery will lead to many other bands that would attempt to accomplish this... & fall short with self indulgent noodling, while citing Miles & Coltrane as....\\"influences.\\" For better or worse, they may have also helped in creating the \\"jam band\\" scene of today.<br />This album is worth 5 stars.... but you have to wonder how this album would've turned out had Duane made it. Songs such as Ramblin' Man & Jessica... what would Duane have done to those pieces? <br />But then again, it wouldn't have spawned songs such as \\"Melissa\\" (compare the version in late 60's to this), & arguably the best song his little brother ever wrote, \\"Ain't Wastin' Time No More\\". The title is almost ironic in the events that follow for this band, but perhaps I'm being too harsh, as not many bands have lost their soul & inspiration.
B000009QPQ|5.0|People have written about the unique harmonies and great hooks (all true), but what's remarkable about &quot;Tomorrow the Green Grass&quot; is how simple the songs really are -- and yet pack an aural wollop.  <br />If you've never heard of The Jayhawks, think of this CD as a collection of the best obscure songs of your favorite band. Imagine &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot; by REM, &quot;Shine a Light&quot; by the Rolling Stones or &quot;Off He Goes&quot; by Pearl Jam. <br />You will be glad you bought this CD!
0553573403|2.0|Cosidering the large amount of fantasy writers out there...You don't have to read anything but the very best. So when I saw the high ratings George R.R. Martin was getting I thought it would be worth my time...I was wrong. To be honest...It just sucked. If I want to read about politics I'll grab a newspaper and read the real thing. I have to give George credit, he was brave with his story telling. He wasn't afraid to kill anyone. But the characters were just pawns in some schemer's plot...so whomever dies in the story was meant to die. I wasn't surprised at all...just think of all the things that could go wrong realistically...and they go wrong... If you are looking for a character that rises above his/her negative heritage and becomes greater...then don't look in this series. Its really just there to be unpredictable...which is good. If you wait for the plot to become intense...you might be waiting for a while. Because you are reading fictional history. Not a epic heroic novel.
B000002JR8|5.0|when i 1st listened 2 this album i was in high expectations since just purchasing great southern trendkill and i must say this album blew me away the 1s 4 tracks always seem 2 be the best on a pantera album but from start to finish far beyond driven will keep any metal fan wanting more BUY IT!
B00003CXB7|5.0|The Five-Star Collection is Fox Studios' top-of-the-line releases.  Movies like French Connection have already made the list, and now Fox debuts the greatest anti-war movie of all time, M*A*S*H.  The basis for the long-running TV series (which also debuted recently on DVD), M*A*S*H introduces us to the antics of Hawkeye Pierce (Donald Sutherland), Trapper John (Elliot Gould), Hot Lips (Sally Kellerman), and Radar (Gary Burghoff).<br />Altman's black comic masterpiece doesn't have a solid plot so much as a series of skits and sketches about life during the war.  From golfing 5 miles from the front to suspension of marital promises to trying to figure out why people are dying all around, M*A*S*H handles the gruesomeness of stupidity of war in the only way possible - if you're not laughing, then you're going to be crying, so it's probably better to laugh.<br />And what a way to bring this classic to DVD - the movie has never looked so good.  For being 30 years old, it looks great after Fox's extensive restoration and is presented in its original theatrical ratio of 2.35:1 with an anamorphic transfer.  There's some grain here and there, but the colors are exceptionally vibrant, with great contrast on the blacks and whites especially.  The sound mix is a decent DD 2.0, which is fine considering that the movie is mostly dialogue, but the lack of a more dynamic soundtrack was noticeable during the football game and any time there was music.  There are enough extras to make up for it, though, including Altman's commentary track, three featurettes including A&E's \\"The Story of M*A*S*H\\" and a 30-year cast reunion that's both touching and funny.<br />The lack of the DD 5.1 soundtrack doesn't sully the otherwise pristine quality of the rest of this 2-disc set.  It's a must have - get it now.  Now, trooper!  Now!
B00005R2M3|3.0|Based on the usual reactionary word of mouth when an artist attempts a major pop crossover, I though I'd hate this. After one listen, I actually DID hate it. Fortunately, I suspected that my aversion was due to being exposed to something totally unexpected, so I kept listening. Final verdict: This is glitzy and crass but also surprisingly well-crafted both lyrically and musically. (I hear echoes of everyone from Lene Lovich and Cher to the B-52s.)<BR>The clincher, though, is Shakira's voice, which floats like a butterfly from octave to octave, and her winsomely flat enunciation of English vowels and consonants. Though she dresses like Charo's illegitimate niece, her lyrics are heartfelt, humble, even tough-minded--teenage girls can, and will, find much worse to model themselves after. Get it while you can...Predicted next career move: Vegas--or Hollywood, wherever the plane lands first.
B00001IVOF|4.0|Hell On Earth isn't as much pure genius as The Infamous but still one of the tightest rap albums ever and was made back when Mobb Deep were still hungry. There is no song that comes close to \\"Shook Ones Pt. II\\" or \\"Survival Of The Fittest\\" but there is not any throwaway tracks either. The beats are dark, raw and original. Those who said Mobb Deep have fallen off since The Infamous are just haters in disguise. True fans know Hell On Earth is a good follow-up, and since then they have far from fallen off. P disses Tupac hard on \\"Drop A Gem On Em\\", another one of Mobb Deep's best hits. The title track is another Mobb Deep headbanger that will not get old. Just check the chorus; \\"Ayyo it's hell on earth, who's next and gonna go first?\\"<BR>Tight. But the standout here is definately \\"G.O.D Pt. III\\", a 'homage' to the movie The Godfather, with a terrific beat and the usual lyrics from P., such as \\"Lookin' for P, well you can find him everywhere, in a project near you, I'll be right there\\".<BR>This is definately a worthy addition to your collection and if you liked The Infamous, then it is a must-have. Cop It Now..........
0062502182|5.0|When I thought about reviewing this book, I had many things to say...but after reading some of the other reviews which pick apart and criticize it, I can see the meaning of the book even more clearly.<br />The writing is simple and clear- not juvenile. It's entertaining and brings a message which does not need to be complicated, except for those who are not ready to see the truth. They are the ones who like their truth heavily veiled and masked, as their self-gratification is in the pursuit. The reality is, the only place you need to look for the truth is in yourself. There is no search required- just your own personal journey.<br />Life does not need to be complicated, and the folks who have made negative comments about those who enjoy this book have obviously missed the point of it entirely- and they bring to mind the phrase \\"Casting Pearls before Swine.\\"<br />You are not going to get anything valuable from this book unless you are READY for the spiritual knowledge which it contains. And that is one of the main points of the book anyway.<br />Personally, I received deep spiritual messages and peace from reading The Alchemist- and I have been on my own spiritual path for over two decades. This book presents information that only those who have actually paid attention to their journey would understand and appreciate.<br />If you read it and don't like it, I suggest you forget about it for at least 5 years and pick it up again. You might be surprised.<br />Update, 10/2003:Oh. My. Gosh. I can't believe how many people just \\"don't get\\" this book!!! Look: the point is not about anyone's \\"Personal Legend\\"!!!<br />THE POINT, is that what you search for is usually RIGHT THERE all along, and that the journey you take to find it is about learning lessons and growing as a person. Get it yet? LIFE IS IN THE JOURNEY, NOT THE DESTINATION!!<br />Santiago set off to find his \\"pot of gold,\\" and after a long journey during which he grew mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, he finally discovers the location of the treasure. He follows the directions and find it RIGHT WHERE HE STARTED!<br />GET IT?!!!<br />You have what you need inside of you all of the time. You don't need to search outside yourself- you need to look within. THAT is the point.<br />Sheesh.the location of the treasure. He follows the directions and find it RIGHT WHERE HE STARTED!<BR>GET IT?!!! <BR>You have what you need inside of you all of the time. You don't need to search outside yourself- you need to look within. THAT is the point. <BR>Sheesh.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I haven't heard the hype &amp; I don't care to hear it. I don't read the music rags, try to avoid popular radio, and don't watch MTV. I just love great music, and the Stokes 'This Is It' is just that -- energetic, well-crafted, intellegent, stripped-down rock. Just listen to it on it's own merits and rid yourself of any self-imposed or hype-imposed expectations (like can the drummer play his &quot;toms&quot;, do they sound like Television, is their sound &quot;new&quot; -- have we all become so jaded about popular music!?). This band loves to play and it shows.
0393973867|5.0|This is one of the few books to actually transcend its nominal domain (comparative anthropology?) to truly extend the broad scope of human understanding. If everyone would read and assimilate the wisdom in this book, human consciousness would take a quantuum  leap. Why do I maintain this?<BR>Because Prof. Diamond convincingly shows how technological innovation and the dominance of some cultures over others is not rooted in the inherent superiority of any nation, culture, race or people, but rather is the perhaps inevitable result of the orientation of our planet's land masses, the parallel evolution of microbes and man, and the very nature of cultural change. This is big stuff, and nowhere have the tired old (but still distressingly overused!) canards of social darwinism, racism, ethnocentrism and a host of other intellectual diseases been more thoroughly--(conclusively)--refuted than in this truly monumental book. I don't care how many PhDs you have or how smart you think you are: If you haven't read this book there are quite a few things you don't know yet.
0451204530|3.0|Code to Zero<br />The novel \\"Code to Zero\\", written by Ken Follett, can be said to be easy to read in so far as the author doesn't use difficult expressions.<BR>The suspenseful and exceptional story deals with the phenomenon of  scientific espionage and grips  the reader and robs himself/herself the sleep.<BR>Although the reader is confused by the regular change between present and past, i.e. the author uses numerous of flashbacks, he/she keeps on reading because the story is not boring like typical other stories which handles always about \\"true love\\", sex, drugs and murder.<BR>Action, emotions and science are combined to an interesting, best-selling novel which doesn't cost much.
B00000DFSK|5.0|Since I own all of U2's albums anyway, my only real reason for buying the CD was for the B-sides (yay!), as well as the new version of \\"Sweetest Thing.\\"  The CD tries to capture the songs that people remember most from the 80s, not necessarily ones that individuals like.  Face it, folks, you can't please everyone.  I think that October is one of U2's most underrated albums, but the simple fact is that there were really no \\"hits\\" from that particular album.  U2 rocks my world, and I can't wait till the release a second \\"best of\\" CD (for more B-sides!)
B00005R87Q|1.0|Hmm.....Point Break revisited, and the acting isn't much better. This could have been a good movie, but it lost it in so many areas. <br />In the initial race, why did the floor mysteriously blow out of the hideous green car? And how did Baldy stay in the car when he was picked up after it blew out? <br />High strung rice running tens in street trim? Sorry, don't believe it. Maybe on the strip with slicks, stripped out and running plexiglass windows. I've been around seriously fast street cars for enough time to know better.<br />The coup de grace was the climactic race scene between the Supra and the slick Charger. The Charger pulls the wheels and then smokes the tires??? Sort of defies the laws of physics and the principle of weight transfer. If the car hooked hard enough to pull the tires (nearly impossible on city pavement, by the way) there's no way those rear tires are spinning. They either smoke or hook, no in between - hard to believe this glaring error even made it out of the cutting room.<br />I was hoping for greatness since there hasn't been a good flick made that really reflects the true street racer spirit. I'm still waiting for someone to make a real street racing movie, and will gladly volunteer to be technical director.
055347359X|2.0|This seems to be a rather heavy-handed polemic, a _1984_ for kids, though frankly I think the kids should skip straight to _1984_.  Lowry's manufactured rightspeak is awkward, the dark surprises hidden beneath the placid surface of the supposedly Utopian society are not at all surprising, and, worst of all, her world is just not believable.  Yes, it's fictional, and probably even allegorical.  It still should be possible, or at least believable, in order to be chilling and convincing.  A society that has learned to control the climate, iron the hills out of the landscape, prevent anyone from seeing colors, etc.?  Give me a break.  To say nothing of the fact that apparently many citizens are aware of the \\"secrets\\" underlying their paradise--the old, defective, or just plain extra are euthanized, etc.--but yet no one before Jonas has tried to blow the top off the system for centuries.  And the old \\"they had perfect lives, but yet they did not feel LOVE\\" line is trotted out in all its triteness.  And while I understand that Lowry was trying to depict a society startlingly different from our own, it's a little sinister that this supposedly-perfect-and-actually-EVIL society is notable for having women in positions of responsibility and power, and allowing men to work in childcare (though I have to note that this was a minor detail, and not the major thrust of the book at all).<br />Also, I find Rifkin's reading extremely annoying.  Surely they could have found someone with a perfect, bland, middle American non-accent to narrate the story of the perfect bland society.  He makes the kids sound whiny and the Giver sound like he's been chain smoking for the past 40 years.  The background music is also cheesy.<br />I gave 2 stars rather than 1 as the writing wasn't completely bad and I appreciate her inventiveness and attempt to spread warnings about conformity.  However, I hate to see classrooms using this dumbed-down dystopian tale; there's enough REAL literature out there that teenagers should be at least trying to read _1984_ or _Brave New World_ instead.re that teenagers should be at least trying to read _1984_ or _Brave New World_ instead.
006019250X|5.0|Although, I am not much of a book reader, a close friend gave me The Illustrated Alchemist as a gift, and told me that I had to read it.  So, one evening I picked it up and started reading.  The story was so beautiful, that I could not put it down.  While I was reading, I got out a highlighter and started marking phrases, which I could relate to in my life.  After reading this book, I honestly felt as if my eyes had been opened.  The Illustrated Alchemist is truly the best I have ever read.
B00003CY0V|4.0|This movie had bad reviews and I heard that after the opening it all goes down hill, but I liked this movie.<br />Swordfish isn't a traditional action movie.  The plot is unique and you don't really know who the bad guys are.  You also feel for Stanley (Hugh Jackman) who isn't a bad guy but is getting sucked into committing crimes to save his daughter.  True, Halle Berry is naked, but not for long.  Its no big deal.<br />While Swordfish isn't worthy of summer blockbuster status, it is still quite entertaining.
B00005R87Q|1.0|Wow, Point Break all over again. And the acting is no better!<br />I had hoped for the best for this movie, since I am a car nut and there are few car flicks that can actually be considered good. But, alas, this one falls into the rubbish heap with the rest. The list forms.....<br />What caused the floorboard to blow out in the hideous green car in the big first race? And how did it return for our hero to rescue Baldy from the cops? Hmmm.<br />Each and every street race I've ever seen didn't have 15,000 people attending. For those who haven't actually been a part of one, they are held in dark, nearly abandoned, semi-rural settings with very few spectators or traffic. The pizza guy sequence was ridiculous.<br />Imports running 10-second quarters in full street trim? Not that I've ever seen to date. Maybe on the strip with slicks, gutted interiors, plexiglass windows, and the boost cranked up to stratospheric levels that will make any head gasket tremble in fear. <br />Lastly, we get to the Charger. Why would Baldy want to even consider messing with building a 10-second import when he has a blown, 9-second Detroit classic hiding in the garage? I wouldn't and I won't. The climactic race scene at the end was the most laughable of all. Coming off the light the Charger yanks the wheels a couple feet AND smokes the tires! WOW! In 15 years of drag racing I've never seen this occur! Probably because it's impossible. Either the car hooks and puts daylight under the wheels (and goes) or it blazes the tires into an expensive cloud of rubber smoke. Not both. Pure nonsense.<br />When Hollywood gets around to making a realistic picture about street racing and it's culture, they can give me a call. I'd be glad to provide some technical assistance.
0446310786|5.0|This is one of the great contemporary books.  It is one of the very few books that can be read at any age or stage of life.  Many relationships, stereotypes, attitudes, personalities are presented in a simple straightforward manner.  This book makes you think.
0780626494|5.0|OK: so we're in the mid-50s, and Walken is this brilliant but eccentric scientist who thinks &quot;the Russians will drop the bomb at any moment.&quot; So he builds this fallout shelter in his backyard -- it's huge! When something happens that forces he and his wife down there, they wind up thinking that Walken's nightmare has come true, and they end up staying down there for 35 years, during which time they have &quot;Adam&quot; (Brendan Fraiser). All kinds of hilarity explodes when Adam gets to finally go above ground (I can't spoil it for you), and ... well, see this movie. Just see it. Trust me. It's laugh out loud funny.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This artist is definately worth listening for.  I found her music interesting.  While many of her vocal characterizations could be compared with other female singers, I thought Shakira's use of vocal characterizations to be refreshing (at the moment). I also found the lyrics, melody, &amp; instrumentation to be unique in the arrangements.  Definately worth a listen.
0790729725|5.0|Goodfellas is a great movie- really well made.  Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are awesome.  I am not a big Ray Liotta fan, but he was ok too.  The DVD is of great quality with good bonus material.
0375500901|4.0|This was an exciting, interesting, thriller, well worthy of four stars.  However, the book was a dissapointment to me, since it was nowhere near as good as either of Silva's previous efforts.  The main characters in this book simply can't compare to Osbourne and Delaroche, and I think he'd do better to resurrect those characters than to stick with Gabriel(which, unfortunately, he appears to have done for his next book).  Also, why have Peel at all if you aren't going to develop that story, and why set up the whole Gabriel/Jackie thing if it is going to fizzle out as it did.

B00005U11Z|1.0|Journey post-Steve Perry is Journey Lite.  The new songs are simplistic, over produced and are filled with meaningless lyrics.  This disc is a reflection of that.  If you like to go to see tribute bands, and free vegas lounge acts, this disk is for you.  Shame on the guys in this band, and shame on me for being fool enough to buy this dvd.  Better to have memories of the real thing, than to have polluted my brain with Journey-Lite.  If you saw the band in the 80s, if you understand the songwriting contribution that Steve Perry brought, move on.

B0000399WI|2.0|I don't understand why so many people love THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION so much. The film is okay, but it definitely isn't exactly the greatest movie of all time, and certainly not close to it. I saw this movie in one of my high school English classes and read the book as well.<br />THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is about a guy named Andy (Tim Robbins) who is accused of murdering his wife, so he is sent to prison for life. In prison, he meets Ellis Boyd 'Red' Reddings (Morgan Freeman), and they become fast friends. Andy and Red talk about their adventures and life stories, and Andy then makes a plan to escape jail.<br />The movie is kind of predictable, since we all know Andy manages to bust out of jail. And it moves very slow. The acting performances (especially by Robbins and Freeman), are superb, and one of the highlights of the film. The storyline and plot are very simple and yet, I just can't seem to understand why this is such a beloved film. <br />This is not a film for all people...I saw it and I didn't like it all that much. If you want REAL drama, then check out films like IN THE BEDROOM, A BEAUTIFUL MIND, or ORDINARY PEOPLE instead. Those films are much more enjoyable! This one, however, is just boring. Skip it!
0780626494|3.0|Blast from the Past is a predictable post cold war farce that is saved by the actors. The supporting cast of Sissy Spacek (When is the last time anyone see Sissy Spacek in a comedy?), Christopher Walken, and Dave Foley with lead, Brendan Fraser (once again playing a &quot;fish out of water&quot; character i.e. George of the Jungle, The Scout, Encino Man, etc.) make up for a predictable plot.  Alicia Silverstone in a far better role from the Batman and Robin movie doesn't seem to be talking with marbles in mouth and is very likable and Brendan Fraser once again has the charm and versatility to pull off his character raised in a fallout shelter and exploring the outside world for the first time. Nothing is done over the top and the movie does not explore how Brendan Fraser's character couldn't fit in, but how he could fit in today's society. An example is Brendan Fraser's &quot;oh so nice&quot; manners taught to him by his parents. Also, there is a nice swing dance routine by Brendan Fraser and two women in a trendy L.A. night club. Overall, a nice film with a little reminder that in 1962, America was at the brink of nuclear war with Russia.
0804115613|5.0|This book changed my life. It's practically my Bible. I love it because it has so much faith in people. The underlying philosophy is that people really are good and can do great things. It makes you feel like you can make a difference, if you're good to be people and love and care about people, which is something anyone, rich or poor, old or young, can do.<BR> A wonderful, rich plot with a colorful cast of characters, this book is perfect except that it fudges up dates sometimes. But that is not enough to take away a star. This book is essential for all women, and for all men who are cool enough to read abook that is mostly about women.
B00003CXMG|4.0|You can definitely see where Kate Hudson comes from.  She shares her mothers sparkle.  This movie tells the tale of Cameron Crowe and how he got started in the life he's in.  It's a great story and wonderful music.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I think Morning View is possibly one of the best albums I've ever owned.  It's impossible for me to pick a favorite, although Just a Phase, 11am, and Warning stick out a little more than the others.  Incubus is definatley one of the most talented bands ever, and Mike is, in my opinion, the most talented new guitarist out there.  Definatley buy this album.  I got it the day it came out :)
B00005QG9J|5.0|Listening to this disc is an adventure is tempo and arrangement.  Though chord progression and vocal range don't tend to deviate as much as I would like, the arrangements of the songs are a refreshing movement from a great deal of boring 3 chord alternative music out there.  Being new to Incubus I don't have the view of the band from the beginning and this may have lent me to take a different approach to this review, but for someone not familiar with Incubus's past work this is a great introduction to the band.<br />One surprise was that the disc did not follow the pattern of Wish You Were Here.  Even after the hundreds of listentings I still like this song.  Much like the discs cover, the song comes off as if you were sitting on a beach as the fog lifts from the sea.  Though maybe not as commercially viable, the rest of the disc comes off the same.  The music skirts through your ears like watching a wave on a voltmeter. I found this most on Nice to Know You, Wish You Were Here, Have You Ever, Blood On the Ground and Warning (which I feel is the strongest track).<br />Incubus definitely has a funk rock feel to it. Not as heavy as a Red Hot Chilli Peppers, but you do get a bass slapping feel to their songs.  Because of the vocals, the moments when the music moves from its stoner groove does not come across like the rap\rock that Incubus has been described as.  If there were the popular screaming vocals this wouldn't be the case.  And this may be the strength of the band for when the soften up as they do on Are You In?, Mexico (another strong one for me) and 11 a.m., the union of vocals and music is delightful and absent of a radio made ballad. But the song that made this a 5 and not a 4 is Aqueous Transmission.  It just doesn't fit on this disc for the length at the least, but the faith this band has in their talents, that they could sell this song to their fan base as well as new fans is very telling.  The song closes the disc as it would the day, and I don't want to get too new age here, but it is very meditative.  Somehow they managed to make this song work.<br />I enjoy this band as I did when I was first turned onto Dave Matthews years ago.  A different type of music from that which I am accustomed to hearing.  Does this mean this style is not out there in more bulk?  Of course not.  And maybe this style is viewed by some as common to some of the music out on radio and MTV. For this reviewer, Incubus has carved out its own niche and I am happy to have heard them.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Surprisingly, I loved Moulin Rouge.  It was one of those rare films that exceeded my expectations by a wide margin.  I'll admit I didn't expect much, as I'm not a big fan of musicals or Ewan McG.  And had I known the Romeo and Juliet guy made it, I probably never would have watched it.<br />I know the love story is incredibly formulaic, but the movie is visually and aurally stunning enough to make the whole experience a load of fun.  From the opening seconds with the conductor guy flailing around to the old reliable 20th Century Fox theme, I immediatley began to get into the spirit and as a result, enjoyed the the show immensely.  I've been humming those cheesy pop love songs for weeks.<br />Great DVD.  I've been playing this thing over and over again. It really shows off the format, with excellent, immersive sound and dramatic colors.  The soundtrack is so much fun you'll be playing this thing louder and louder each time you watch.  See Moulin Rouge with an open mind and you won't be disappointed.
B00000K0DT|5.0|This is one of the best movies, EVER!  I can watch it over and over even though I already know &quot;whodunit&quot;.  You gotta get this one!
B00005QIPH|5.0|I think some of the reviewers are missing the entire point of the Strokes.  All the labels that are being applied to this band are a creation of the media -  try and make up your own minds for once and take them for what they are.  The songs are incredibly infectious and the band seems unaffected by all the hoopla.  They are just out there having fun and being true to themselves.  I saw them last night in Orlando and it was one of the best shows I have ever seen.  Julian C was drunk and it was obvious he was having a blast. Their music won't change the world but it sure makes it a little more tolerable in a year of Brittney, N'sync, Jlo, Bizcuit....<br />Anyway, buy the cd - drink some beer and just enjoy it for what it is.
6305014140|5.0|Jubei is a true hero in the classic term.  He is dashing and charming and witty and too bad he is an anime! A lovely, strong heroine, and several really nasty guys round out this wonderful story line.  The animation is great and so is the dubbing.  One of the first animes I ever watched, and one that helped claim me as a fan.  Not exactly what you would want to watch in front of your kids as there a few sexual situations and a bit of nudity and gore.  Overall this is a near perfect film and I kept forgetting that it was animated.  You feel like everyone in it is real.  A must-see, especially for someoen who is not yet an anime fan.  This one will suck ya in!
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is Bill Murray at his best.  I have owned this movie for about three years and I have watched it at least 50 times.  It makes me laugh everytime.  Phil (Bill Murray) is an obnoxious weatherman who has to repeat the same day over and over until he gets it right. This is a must own and a must see movie.  I rate it as one of the top ten comedies I have ever seen.
B00005QXXO|5.0|Radiohead released this live album, I Might Be Wrong, in late 2001. Comprised solely of tracks from Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) as well as one unreleased track, this album is clean and clear, capturing the beauty of the softer songs and the power of the louser ones.<br />Due to the facts that these tracks are from their two latest albums, there is an absence of actual instrumentation and more use of effects, with the exception of certain songs. Thom Yorke's signature whine and high-pitched vocals take center stage while drummer Phil Selway and bassist Colin Greenwood provide solid rhythm. The counterpart to Yorke's wailing is the instrumental work of guitarist Jonny Greenwood, whose effects gave Radiohead a different type of sound on its previous outings. Together, the band sounds incredible and their live renditions stay true to the originals.<br />The album begins with the bass/drum driven The National Anthem and the twangy I Might Be Wrong. Both are strong tracks; very well performed and sound just as good, if not better, than the album version. The next track, Morning Bell, is like the first two: strong and well-played. Like Spinning Plates stands out on this album because it is simply incredible. The sorrow and pain in Yorke's wail and the beautiful piano piece in the background make this song a beautiful work of art. Idioteque follows close behind with a nice chorus and nice instrumental work. The highpoint of this song is Phil Selway's drum solo. It just seems to come from nowhere and it is outstanding. Everything In Its Right Place is a great song, studio and live. This song isn't too much different from the Kid A version except for the vocal effects of Thom's voice toward the end. Dollars and Cents is a cool track, although I have never heard the album version. Its a lot like the first three tracks. The final song, the unreleased True Love Waits, is another piece of work, sounding like it could have come from an earlier outing than Kid A. Its very touching and quite beautiful. The highpoints of the album are Like Spinning Plates, Idioteque, Everything In Its Right Place and True Love Waits.<br />Radiohead seems no to be afraid to stray from the musical style they began with. Not hearing much from Amnesiac, this album gives me great expectations of the album and the future sound of the band. This is for the fans of Radiohead who enjoy all their stylistic departures. But, if you dislike Radiohead's latest direction, steer clear of this CD.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is a GREAT ALBUM, worthy of anyone's collection.  It is by far my favorite CD since Radiohead's O.K. Computer.  Like O.K. Computer, this CD marks another step in this band's evolution, towards something awesome and unique from anything else. <br />Standout tracks are many on this album, which is what makes it so great.  Here is a list of what I think these tracks are:<br />Nice to Know you - A standard Incubus fair, but done so to the greatist degree.  Good song, enough said. <br />Wish You Were Here - Does what Incubus can do like no others, creates a somewhat agressive but at the same time passive atmosphere.  Lyrics are top notch.<br />11 A.M. - One of the darker songs Incubus has made, but still beautiful. <br />Mexico - The saddist song I have heard from the band, also one of the most beautiful. <br />Echo - An entrancing, passive song. <br />Are You In? - The chorus is undeniably catchy.  Hopefuly this will be released as a single. <br />Aqueous Transmission - In my opinion this song is what raises this album to a whole different level, above other albums.  A sweeping, beautiful song that is simply amazing.  With it's Oriental elements and lyrics that are true poetry, I hope that this is a vision of things to come from Incubus. <br />If Incubus keeps evolving at the rate they are, the results 5-10 years down the road blow my mind.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I was completely surprised by this movie.  I heard nothing but good things about it.  I was so annoyed by the end of the movie I had to watch American pie with a Remember the titans chaser to calm down.  Nicole Kidman was great to look at but everything else was terrible.  They tried to make the movie interesting by putting in a bunch of freaky people but it only made me feel more distant.  Do not buy this movie unless you are into torturing yourself.
B00005NWM3|5.0|The summer of 2001 saw a rise in popularity for the Canadian quartet Nickelback. On the strength of their first single, How You Remind Me, Nickelback dropped their second album, Silver Side Up, only to be faced with extremely strong record sales and a growth in their fan base.<br />Silver Side Up is picking up where their previous release, The State, left off: playing guitar driven rock and roll. Chad Kroeger leads the band on guitar and vocals, singing songs about abuse, life struggles, and Hollywood while Ryan Peake plays the guitar and backs Chad on vocals. Setting the rhythm are bassist Mike Kroeger and drummer Ryan Vikedal, who play each track well and adds power to the Kroeger/Peake double guitar display.<br />The drum driven Never Again starts the album off well. Its a rocking song where Mike and Ryan get some time to show that behind the guitars, they are still there. The first single, How You Remind Me, is a very good lyrics and singing and cool working on the instruments. The only problem is that it is so overplayed. Woke Up This Morning is much like the first track except for the fact that the topic of the lyrics is not as dark and the music is more uplifting. The second single, Too Bad, is another good song. Starting off soft and then breaking out into a rocking chorus. The next 5 tracks are of the same formula as the previous tracks: hard rocking riffs, lyrics ranging from personal to imaginative story-telling and solid rhythm. Nickelback has saved the best for last, found in the song Good Times Gone. The track stands out a bit because its a bit softer than the rest but the lyrics are great and the slide guitar is nice.<br />All in all, Nickelback is a pretty cool band and they play some great music. The only problem I have with the band is their fame. I don't say they are sell-outs but now you have all these people claiming to be Nickelback fans when they are only into one song (poseurs). Too many people like that nowadays. This album is for fans of hard rock and maybe even stuff a little bit softer. For those of you who enjoy this album, you should check out The State. Both albums are wonderful.
B0000399WI|5.0|The whole time I watched this movie I couldn't wait for it to end so I could watch it again.  The acting was perfect and the story was disturbing, compelling and overwhelming.  This is the best drama I have ever seen.  Buy it, Buy it, Buy it Now. You will not regret this purchase.
0062502182|4.0|Most people say that this book is not for children. Well, not knowing this, i went on and read it. Im 14 years old, and i found it very very inspiring. The novel teaches you valuable morals in such a beautiful and simple way. For some people, you dont have to look so hard to understand what Coelho is trying to express. But either way, it is always up to you how you interpret his work. To me, Paulo Coelho is an absolutely marvelous writer. Im very sure that he has more inspiring, and exhilirating novels to come. I highly recommend reading this book to those who enjoy very delightful and possitive novels.
B00005A46T|2.0|I tell you what would be diffrent,i mean really diffrent,a nu-metal band playing a song about how good it is to be alive and that klife isn't so bad but its not going to happen,so we're stuck with slipknot.well they wear masks that are quite well made,but apart from that theres not much left to be said about them.somehow they have become amazingly popular possibly down tro the fact that they wear masks.oh i've just thought of a good point for slipknot,the mask manufacturing industry must be bomming.recesion?who said recesion?
B00003CXRP|5.0|Although  it may sound interesting, this tale of courage, fate, love and most of all survival is more moving and touching than any other movie.<br />Tom Hanks stars in this life story as a Fed Ex employee, who is determined to get hispackages on time.  His plane crashes  and being the only survior he is determined to get out of the island in the Pacific.<br />This tale is truly touching and amazing how such a terrible accident can really change your life completely.  Deffinately a must seen for people of all different tastes in movies.
6304479689|4.0|Presley's second documentary focusing on live performance during his \\"Comeback\\" era ('69 to '73), this one is full of life and Elvis' high energy. His great rapport with his fans is captured beautifully - the close-up of the spellbound ladies at the conclusion of \\"You Gave Me A Mountain\\" is incredible. <BR>The earlier \\"Elvis - That's The Way It Is\\" centered on one event - his third Las Vegas engagement [not counting the 05-56 gig], capturing the behind the scenes events of a huge venue and a huge star. There is a heady nervousness to those proceedings, whereas with \\"On Tour\\" we get a more \\"settled in\\" entertainer - but still the perfectionist!<BR>There are many magnificent moments, i.e., Elvis recording the very personal \\"Seperate Ways\\" (written by friend/song writer/bodyguard Red West); Elvis warming up on [the still unreleased] Kaye's \\"Wandering\\" [interestingly enough, the melody upon which \\"I'll Never Fall In Love Again\\" is based - the Tom Jones/Elvis number] with friend/Music Publishing Rep./Lighting Tech. Lamar Fike, et. al; Elvis singing the Gospel \\"I, John\\" backstage with the Sweet Inspirations. Until this '72 movie, I'm sure many were unaware of the real significance of non-Secular music was in his life.<BR>A reviewer noted a decline in Presley's voice from the '70 documentary. Yes, it is clear that he did lose some control, some color; his vibrato was not as strong. But he seemed to gain range and power. The slight decline could be attributed to constant touring - the instrument was worn.<BR>The '56 TV clip was a terrific segment, capturing the young, raw Rocker, still on the rise. Watching him sing and play live was a revelation back in '73 when I saw \\"On Tour\\" in the movies. At the time, it caused me to discount the '70s personae as overblown, overproduced, unfunky. Today, I can see that a 37 year old man ain't gonna tear it up every time, especially if the average age out there is also (probably) 37.<BR>One final thought: I read that the producers of this film recorded something like two-hours of Elvis being interviewed for the narrative. Would that make a great CD release! M'boy, m'boy...
B00005O3VD|4.0|This is known as Barbra Streisand's signature movie. So where are all of the extra features on this DVD? There should be so many extras that it would take another DVD to fit them all in one package! This thing has nothing. Buy it because it's a great movie but don't expect any more than that.
B00005RFAI|4.0|i liked pinks last album so i purchased this one its only downfall is its slitly slow songs
B00005QZWJ|4.0|I loved this soundtrack even though they cut out a lot of the battel music. Like the music in the very beginning or right before frodo leaves and the battle where Boromir dies. I liked how the included the dark riders music because i liked that the best but i was disapointed they left some songs out. but still a good buy if you love the movie.
B00004R99L|4.0|This is a great animation movie for Disney and non disney lovers. It has some really funny and great parts in it, like the unbirthday part, (Which is incredibal) and the Caterpiller sceen (Which is also great). But the problem with this movie is that it's a little too weird for a kids movie. Just stick in a few curses, take out the songs, and Walla! You Got an adults movie!
B00005JKQX|5.0|This was one of the best movies I had seen in a long time.  Russell Crowe played a phenomenal part.  The film was intense with great plot twists and turns.  An emotional roller-coaster ride with a great ending.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I was blown away by this cd.  I picked it up for &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; and was amazed upon hearing the bouncy &quot;Hella Good&quot;; Lady Saw in &quot;Underneath It All&quot; will make Shaggy and even Marley proud; &quot;Running&quot; has that romance in the space age feel to it whose sentiments are hard to ignore; and &quot;Rock Steady&quot; seem to compliment Running graciously.  Then of course there's &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; that's destined to be a classic.  This new release from Gwen and the gang will leave you craving for more.  I can't believe No Doubt can come up with this after all these years.  Just awesome.
B00005TT77|3.0|An unabashed weepie, I Am Sam uses Beatles tunes, to great effect, to underscore the story of an autistic man (a Beatles obsessive) struggling to keep custody of his 8-year-old daughter.  Without the narrative momentum, though, the songs live or die depending on the artists' interpretive skills.  The closer to the original the artist hews, the less interesting the recording:  Sarah McLachlan, The Wallflowers, The Black Crowes, Heather Nova - all do solid yet unnecessary versions of \\"Blackbird\\", \\"I'm Looking Through You\\", etc.  (The exception here is the uncanny phrasing of Eddie Vedder's gorgeous rendition of \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\".)  Some artists bring their unique skills to bear on the best songs here:  Rufus Wainwright's impassioned \\"Across the Universe\\"; Paul Westerberg's weary \\"Nowhere Man\\"; Grandaddy's robotic \\"Revolution\\"; Nick Cave's dark and redemptive \\"Let It Be\\".  These songs meet the originals head on, and bring out new qualities to these (by now) old warhorses.
B00000JGOH|4.0|This movie may have won critical acclaim but I don't know why the Academy chose to award Paltrow with an Oscar.  Gwyneth resorts to her typical range of emotions and never breaks the mold to emobody the character.  I felt very little compassion for Lady Viola.  Fiennes is well suited for comedic roles and his melancholy is believable in this film.  Judi Dench performs well and deserves her Oscar as Best Supporting Actress.  Personally, I think Cate Blanchett was robbed of the Oscar for her portrayal of Elizabeth.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|As if you didn't already know, Prince is one contrary [guy].  To remind us of what an exemplary musician and lunatic he is, he offers us The Rainbow Children, one of the best and most exasperating releases of his career.  All the great Purple themes are here - religion, sex, and race - married to his deepest jazz, soul, and funk grooves yet.  (The new jazz strains are most impressive.)  He still sings like nobody's business - his vocal showcase throughout should shame all the Mariah's and not-so-new-jack princes into mutes.  The songs are thematic.  I'd go as far to call The Rainbow Children a concept album if I could figure out the actual concept.  Call it then a spiritual song cycle, which is what it is - right down to the spoken narrative voice of God, a blemish on these otherwise thrilling new tracks.  That's a big blemish - a zit on an otherwise perfect face - but learn to listen through it.  It's worth it to hear the greatest musician of his generation truly begin to mature, for the first time, on record.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I am definitely in the love-this-movie category. It hooked me right away from the magical introduction. I wasn't however attracted to the movie by the trailers. This is not a movie that any kind of trailer, or snapshot of scenes, can accurately convey. You really have to watch it. It has far far too many things in it to be described in a single word - almost like a Christmas stocking filled with wonderful unexpected surprises, it fills you with delight and amazement to go through it. <br />It has been criticised for being a triumph of style over substance. I feel this misses the point. Musicals have always been about conveying emotion and entertainment through song and dance, not about delving into serious issues or the human condition. What kind of substance does the BandWagon, Singing in the Rain, The King and I, have? <br />The frantic choppy editing has been criticised but I think the point of the editing was to induce in the viewer that feeling of being overwhelmed when you step into something bizarre. Yes, it is nausea inducing but it's intended to create that precise effect because that was what being in the Moulin Rouge for the first time felt like for Christian, and we see the Moulin Rouge from his perspective. Yes, it's a pity the dance routines were so cut up that we couldn't see more than a blur of images, but that's what Christian felt like when he was in the Moulin Rouge, that was the whole point. He was overwhelmed by it all. They could have shown a blow by blow account of the dance routine, but that would only have served to show off the dance moves, and not the story as experienced through the eyes of the character.<br />Tremendously enjoyable, unusual, unexpected and original. I've watched many movies, but few that I can recall enjoying or wanting to see repeatedly as much as this one.<br />My one regret? That I will never again be able to see it for the first time.
B00005QFHG|1.0|I absolutely agree with 'A viewer from Southfield, Mi USA'.  This movie is paifully awful for anyone who enjoys good foreign and indie films.  If you don't come away from it feeling like you were just forced to eat too many chocolate Easter bunnies, then you are probably among the pretentious thousands who thought it was &quot;deep&quot; or &quot;truly human&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot; as I've read in countless nauseating reviews.  The director rented a lot of very good films (Babette's Fest, Antonia's Line, Like Water for Chocolate) and tried to force everything that was good in those into this.  But, to make it worse, and unlike those films, the director thought we were all too stupid to get the symbolism so goes out of the way to explain EVERYTHING to us. Even the word &quot;tranquilite&quot; needs to be translated by the narrator.  Why does the imaginary kangaroo hop away at the end?  Don't worry, the narrator will explain it.  By the time the statue's grimmace turns into a smile at the end of the movie, I was heaving in my popcorn bag.  How did it get an Academy nod?  Give me a break. It says a lot more about the Academy than the movie.. C'mon, even Adam Sandler gets to vote on those things.  Truth be told, Miramax lobbied the academy really hard on this one.  Don't reward them.  Buy &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; instead.
B00005QDW1|5.0|One of the really terrific albums from 2001, No Doubt delivers literally with \\"Rock Steady\\".  This is a band that does not disappoint.  \\"Rock Steady\\" is a great effort with original songs of several styles, outstanding lyrics, up-tempo beats, and a few wonderful surprises.<br />They begin by demonstrating their talents as a dance band with the driving beat on Hella Good.  Then roll into the modern and catchy Hey Baby.  Their outstanding talent and diversification is brought to exclamation with the fun reggae sounds in Underneath It All and the playful Start The Fire.  Add in the romantic and warm Running, and finish it off with Waiting Room, written and performed with the Artist formally known as Prince, and this is a must add to your collection.<br />Few bands continue to improve with each work, but this is one group to study as an example.  Not only is their music fun to listen to song after song, but they know how to write lyrics, a talent in short supply in too much modern rock.  There are twelve enjoyable songs, after a brief introductory piece.  Each one is different, yet they fit exceedingly well together as an album.<br />I rate this disc at a collectable 4.70 out of 5.00 stars, rounded up to 5.00.  Truly recommended as a highlight of music produced in 2001.
B00000K19E|3.0|..Buffs who parade ideas of a \\"Slave Society\\" controlled by ominous, malefactors pulling strings..In this respect, this film is outright harmful in that this propaganda may be taken too seriously by some. The story line is detailed in the Amazon blurb,though those reviews seem a little too starry eyed. The best scene is the very first where the Moss character plays a cyberpunk version of Supergirl, dodging and flying all over the big city to evade her bad guy pursuers. Notice how the city scape is populated by suit and tie robots, and the triplet bad-guys are all dressed in their oliver green suit/tie combos,never smiling, with the always obligatory sunglasses. Whereas the wonderful cyber-heroes in their black leather outfits, earrings, and bald heads are the masters of the universe. How about a little less stereotyping for gosh sake?! The special effects are good, as are the kung fu tournaments, but the generally vapid and unpleasant characters are in need of some energy,with the sole exception of Moss' character, the only one with personality, not to mention acceptable looks. There are some vertigo inspiring skyscraper shots of the city,which seems to be Chicago, though the landscape here changes a bit perhaps to represent other cityscapes where the \\"robots\\" roam antlike thruout. There's a little mythology thrown in to give it some \\"intellectual\\" clout, though this is mainly embarrassing,except for the very young. And there is more than enough gratuitous violence,the worst being the casual shootem-up in the lobby where Reeves and Moss characters are having a real fun time blowing away the innocent,lazy security guards. What a ball!!! Not to mention the helicopter crash near the top of a skyscraper, not pretty after 9/11...For about 20 minutes of special effects, it may be worth seeing...To think this received over 2370 reviews on [Amazon.com]. And was the top [dollar] grosser of 1999. Anyway, several cuts above \\"American Beauty\\", the Academy Award winner of that dismal year in motion pictures. PS- Sure there are many similar sci-fi films over the years. I suggest the much better and way-underrated \\"Tron\\" from the early 1980's, a similar story without the \\"punk\\" look, more interesting effects,and no cheap gratuitous violence.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I only (really) discovered Radiohead's music two years ago, but I can honestly say that they are now my favourite band.  OK Computer is my second favourite album; Kid A is my favourite.  OK Computer is definitely solid throughout, but I would say that &quot;Airbag&quot;, &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;, &quot;Let Down&quot;, &quot;Karma Police&quot;, and &quot;Climbing Up The Walls&quot; are the standout songs.  It would definitely not be a mistake to pick this album up.
B00005RFAI|3.0|There's only a few words that can describe P!nk's new album - ICY BLU WANNABE. If you don't know who Icy Blu is she had a couple of hit singles c1991. Why do i say this?, along with the atrocious leather she wears in \\"Get The Party Started\\", the sound of that song is too similar to Icy Blu! Make more rock instead girlfriend!
B00005N5S5|5.0|The Terminator, while fun, has never really been held up as a great film. Certainly it was notable for the never ending climaxs that seem to keep coming. But it is most notable for pushing Schwarzenegger into the stratosphere. Still, the crisp, clean sound and video are great, and show how a scene contained a real mixture of the two. For me, the deleted scenes were the big draw - showing what was shot but not used. Watch it once to enjoy the scenes (or scene snippets), and then watch it with the commentary track and find out why it was not used. Some of the reasons you may agree with, but some you may not. I suppose it is extras like this that make owning the DVD worthwhile.
B00005UKKF|5.0|When I saw the concert, I was amazed!!!  This is something you should definetely plan on buying...<BR>The music is fun and the whole visuals were extremely interesting.  The dances were awesome, the best I've seen.  There's lots of stuff. Britney on a box,  on top of a flying platform, flying on air, driving a car, cool costumes, out of this world dance routines, colorful sets, ballet, piano, rain and lots of other stuff.  You should absolutely purchase this...
0060934913|4.0|Tony Bourdain takes us behind the scenes both of his life, and of the life of a restaurant kitchen. It's rip-roaring fun and a wild ride, where simultaneously you are treated to &quot;If this guy who has been such a screw up can make it, so can I&quot; feelings tempered by Tony's &quot;I may be a screw up but it takes a lot to be a chef and you may not have it&quot; caveats. One can just imagine sitting around a bar, throwing back beers while he tells stories of life on the line. He's the cool friend who always seems to be doing something interesting. I enjoyed the book from start to finish.<br />If there is one shortcoming for the average reader of the book, it is that it reads just as if you were sitting in a late night chef hangout bar and Tony's telling stories over brews. It's written for the insider, or at least assumes some level of knowledge of food preparation and finer cooking. He's unapologetic in his opening, explaining that he writes it in the rough language and argot of the kitchen. And it is this casual tone that helps make the book more enjoyable. But for those of us who who may not appreciate some of the argot, it takes away a layer of the story. A glossary would be helpful, but not necessary. It certainly did not keep me from being engrossed in his writing. Also, not being exposed to the world of New York restauranting, some of the restaurant name dropping (name use really) means zip. That, however, really is not a shortcoming of the author, just something the reader has to accept.<br />Food for thought. In other words, a book you can sink your teeth into.
B000056K04|5.0|Everyday was a perfect change for the band.. they added the electric guitar in which dave plays beautifully.. and lyrics which are beyond belief.. i'm such a sucker for cute songs, and this album has it all, upbeat, happy songs.. then cute, thoughtful ones, i love this album!
B00005JKQX|5.0|&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is one of those rare great films that makes you aware of its greatness even as you're watching it.<br />From the incredible performances of Russel Crowe (if he doesn't get the Oscar nod this year, there's no justice) and the rest of the cast to the sensitive and compelling direction by Ron Howard,<BR>&quot;Beautiful Mind&quot; succeeeds on many different levels all at once; a case study of mental illness; the pressures of being cursed with genius; a sensitive and hauting love story, even as a political thriller of sorts.<br />In an age where truly bad movies are constantly hyped as<BR>classics, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; stands alone as the real thing.
0451204530|5.0|This was a thoroughly, engaging novel. It was difficult for me to put the book down. Follett is still the master of suspense, espionage and intrigue. The reader meets Luke, the main character, after Luke wakes up to learn that he has lost his memory. With clandestine CIA operatives tailing him, Luke must find his identity. Along the way, he uncovers a plot where he is the subject to be silenced. Watch as Luke attempts to prevent an enormous disaster in the Cold War.

0671024256|4.0|This book is worth reading just for the insight that he shares about the writing of some of King's best know books.  Add to that his autobiographical material, and you have an excellent read.<br />I am not sure why I have not heard of this book prior to searching for books on writing, but the insight it gives to the craft of writing and King's writing in particular, make this book a treat.<br />I laughed outloud as King describes his early start in writing, and at least a dozen times.<br />The book also motivated me to get on the ball, with my writing, and to make it fun.  He discusses examples of contemporary writers, the different techniques and a few writing projects for the reader to tackle as well.<br />If you are a King fan and dislike this book, it would be a horror.
0345347951|4.0|Childhood's End is an interesting interpretation of the spiritual/metaphysical realm of our known Universe. With scientists continually theororizing about smaller and smaller indivisible micro-atomistic particles (i.e. read current speculations about 10-11 dimensional string theory and p-brane model of the universe), it seems that science in it's presence state is itself a religion, using theory and believable symbols and illustrations to &quot;make sense&quot; of our mysterious world. Without solid empirical evidence that is noticeable to sight and with the blockades that the uncertainty principle poses, spirituality is left to fill in the gaps.<br />In this case, Arthur C. Clarke, the prophetic visionary of satellite communications interprets an encounter with another race of being and the eventual hypnotic capture of our souls by the Overlords and hence their capture by an even more powerful force toward a journey of the creative destruction in combining intellectual and &quot;sixth sense&quot; forces into an aggrandized mass, leaves many ethical conflicts to ponder not only our self-created hectic evolutionary advancement, but one that may be imposed on us by a mysterious, hard to communicate with outside force.<br />Concerning selfish, ignorant thinking, a subservient role served to avoid harm and anger and destructive danger, sacrificing self-expression for safety, good health, and prosperity, and generally being censured for secure matters are very relevant for today's world.<br />While the book is somewhat simply written and jumps to certain expected interpretations of events if followed in a logical, chronological order, it still leaves the greatest task of reader (to imagine a scenario, vision, image) up to the reader himself.<br />Not his best work (2001 and Rendevous with Rama) but still admirably authentic classic sci-fi.

0679720200|5.0|In \\"The Stranger\\", Albert Camus weaves a simple tale of the outright, inhumane, mechanistic, systemic conviction of a man who fitting certain seemingly unfit, merciless criteria for someone suffering from dementia and disorder, is given the death penalty. Based on trivial, superficial quota's this young man who was suckered into a conflict with his neighbor pimp over his former girlfriend and her Arab relatives and who eventually in an instance of a few brief seconds has his whole life condemned due to a series of common-day, hectic evolving happenstances.<br />Was it calculated rage and execution at the world that left him feeling remorseless and seeking comfort of his own actions, irrational exuberance exploited by an older superficial role model, or confused, panicky nurture and nature created automatic, uncontrollable reaction and response?<br />Through a simple, sad tale of events Camus shows how the individual and his motives, dreams, goals, and hopes can be trivialized and brushed aside by the greater biased, parochial, viewpoint of society.<br />Relevant to modern day school shootings and the disillusionment hippies and others felt in the 60s and \\"slackers\\" felt in the 90s.

038533348X|5.0|Using ridiculous concepts and items such as ice-nine, an island run by a peaceful demagogue, the invention of Bokonism but it's banning in the public sphere in order to reinforce it's name and aims into people's minds, and the numerous questionable career practices people engage in from Ruler's whore, to Ukrainiane's midget exploitation of trade secrets through a love affair, to heir of the ice-nine throne, Cat's cradle utilizes these somewhat phantasmagoric items and ties them in to a workable, though absurd environment with absurd and warped thinking about interpersonal relations and how status and symbols play into them.<br />Sounds kinda like our world, eh??? In fact, it's very analogous to our world and just as a cat is easily amused and full of schizonphrenic ponderings over a cradles motive and purpose, we humans jump around at once significant and then insignificant images and movements through vast re-interpretations relative to the socio-historical context of the times. Once thinking that we've found our quenchable thirst for play and/or food by capuring that pattern of yarn strung together to form a cradle, it is morphed into a new dimension of complexity and mysteriousness.<br />Instead of releasing that which is patently false and which can destroy us (i.e. ice-nine), we humans hold on to these farcical notions. Maybe the key is to create our own farcical analogies and conceptual vision of reality to makes sense of the underlying farcical framework upon which we are evolving. This is what Vonnegut has once again done expertly.<br />&quot;Life is all but a game&quot;, and as with anything it's not about the result but the journey traveled in playing that game and dealing with the competition, our own farcical, subconscious conceptions!
0380973650|4.0|American Gods is Neil Gaiman's big 2001 \\"American\\" fantasy.  The central idea is an old chestnut -- that gods only live as long as they are believed in.  Gaiman modifies this by tying gods to the land, in a sense, such that gods, or a version of them, move to America when people move there.  But most of these old gods are near death -- few people believe in them anymore.  They live on in rather diminished circumstances.<br />The central character is a man named Shadow.  The book opens as he is about to be released after three years in prison.  Just days before his release, he learns that his wife has died in an automobile accident, and the prison authorities let him go early.  On his way home, he meets a strange man called Mr. Wednesday (the significance of the name, and the man's glass eye, won't escape many people, I trust), who offers him a job.  Shadow thinks he has a job waiting, but he soon finds out that his prospective employer has died.<br />Shadow finds himself more or less pushed to taking Wednesday's job offer.  Mostly this job consists of driving around while Wednesday tries to recruit other old gods to join him. It seems a battle for control of America is coming, between the old gods and the \\"new gods\\": the media, the internet, and suchlike.  So we meet a number of nicely depicted gods from the various old countries: Anansi from Africa, Bast and Osiris and Anubis from Egypt, Czernobog from Russia; and so on.  Some of the new gods begin to harass Wednesday and his associates, managing to capture Shadow a couple of times.  And Shadow meets his dead wife as well, in the corrupting flesh, and she begs him to find a way to bring her back to life.  We also get some interludes depicting the lives of some of the immigrants to America, as they bring their gods with them.<br />A long middle section finds Shadow hanging out in an idyllic Wisconsin town, in the dead of winter.  Though even there a dark mystery may lie behind the town's peacefulness.  Finally the battle nears, and Shadow finds himself pushed to test his loyalty to Wednesday to the utmost, even into the land of the dead.  He learns some important truths about his own identity, and he learns the real secret behind the coming battle.<br />The story is resolved both cleverly and movingly.  Shadow is both a character who grows during the action, and a character who pays a great price for his knowledge.  The end manages to surprise, as well.  I think this is one of the best SF/Fantasy books of the year.  There may be a few structural loose ends, and also Gaiman pretty much entirely avoids confronting any of the Abrahamic faiths, which seems to me to leave a conceptual hole, but the book is still powerful and involving.attle nears, and Shadow finds himself pushed to test his loyalty to Wednesday to the utmost, even into the land of the dead.

B00005QZWI|4.0|Howard Shore's score for \\"The Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is beautiful, dramatic, frightening and haunting.  On hearing it before seeing the movie, one of my first reactions was agreement with comments I had read by others calling the music overblown and overly intense.  However, when I saw Peter Jackson's superb movie I realized that Shore's score had to be extremely powerful to complement the spectacular visuals, riveting action, and sheer cinematic sweep of the film.  (There is, in fact, at least one place in the film -- the point when the orcs are trying to force their way into the Chamber of Mazarbul in the Mines of Moria, where our heroes are awaiting them -- when Shore's music is quite loud and yet entirely drowned out by the intense dialogue and sound effects.)<br />Unlike Leonard Rosenman's predominantly dark and dramatic score for Ralph Bakshi's controversial 1978 \\"Lord of the Rings\\" animated feature, much of Shore's score achieves a good balance between passages that make one's pulse pound and pleasant and beautiful passages.  The drama and terror evoked by such tracks as \\"The Black Rider\\" and \\"A Knife in the Dark\\" is complemented by the joy of \\"Concerning Hobbits,\\" the beauty of \\"Many Meetings\\" and \\"The Council of Elrond,\\" the exotic sorrow of \\"Lothlorien,\\" and the epic sweep of \\"The Ring Goes South\\" and \\"The Great River.\\"   Such tracks as \\"The Prophecy\\" and \\"The Treason of Isengard\\" combine several of these emotional elements, while \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\" and \\"May It Be\\" bring the score to a satisfying conclusion that nonetheless fills one with anticipation of Shore's and Jackson's achievements in the two forthcoming films.  Enya's singing of the songs \\"Aniron\\" and \\"May It Be\\" is beautiful and Tolkienian in sound.<br />Tolkien fanatics will be pleased that the majority of the titles of the CD's tracks are chapter titles from Tolkien's book.  They will also be happy that all of the extensive choral and solo singing on the soundtrack (including Enya's \\"Aniron\\") is in Tolkien's invented languages, except for the two end-credit songs, \\"In Dreams\\" and Enya's \\"May It Be,\\" which are in English (although \\"May It Be\\" contains two Elvish phrases).<br />If you enjoyed Tolkien's book and/or Jackson's film, you should enjoy this CD.  I look forward to hearing what Shore does with \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King.\\"
B00005MP58|1.0|After owning the original DVD version since it was released, I <BR>was ready for this release, no more annoying breaks every hour <BR>with the same listing of actors.  I really wanted to view the<BR>extras that were with this version.   But what a waste of money, <BR>I now watch the original,. and the new one is collecting dust.  <BR>The picture quality was/is horrible, all the colors washed out <BR>in the scenery and the faces/clothes of the actors.  This is the <BR>last DVD purchase I will make that comes from A&amp;E Entertainment. <br />What a shame, because I was a satisfed customer until now.<br />BTW - The movie no matter the picture quality is awesome and well worth the money.
0440224764|5.0|I just finished reading this book the other day and WOW WAS I IMPRESSED!!  I have taken to Grisham books over the past few months, this being the third I've read.  It's the story of Patrick Lanigan who has stolen 90 million dollars from a client and his law partners and ran to South America.  Private Investigators are hired by the client that lost his money, and Lanigan is tracked down and tourtured.  He is brought back to the United States and kept under security at a hospital off the coast.  There are many twists and turns and an ending that I didn't expect.  READ THIS BOOK NOW!
B00005B36H|5.0|Fantastic album. Even my conservative parents find it appealing. If I had to have one album, this would be it. It's just as good, if not better than their previous albums. Maynard still keeps those thought-provoking lyrics and melodies that get stuck in your head for weeks. My recommendation: give the guys some credit and buy the album. You won't regret it.
0471413909|5.0|I found Dr. Cordain's presentation very credible and well done. He presents the basics and then offers a plethora of references to support his claims and for additional reading. I never felt bogged down in detail. The recipes and meal plans are thoughtful and delicious. They have allowed me to stick to this new approach without hunger or \\"cheating.\\" Best of all, I feel great. In the future, this is how we all will eat.<br />... after increasing protein consumption and lowering carbohydrate consumption in my diet, my blood lipid analysis improved (i.e., HDL, triglycerides), but my LDL cholesterol remained elevated until I also cut back on saturated fats.  Many of my friends had the same experience.  I don't speak for everyone.  But in my case, Dr. Cordain has it right!
B00005TT77|5.0|then this is one for your collection. The performances rendered here are unique - yet the original composition holds strong. I liked every cut with the exception of Chocolate Genius' cover of \\"Julia.\\" I guess it doesn't take a \\"Genius\\" to know why. Plus, Amazon has each selection available to listen to before you venture forth. Give this a chance. It really is throughly enjoyable.It's one you can sing along with easily as the original arrangements are still here!
B00005S6K8|5.0|If you look through the reviews for this version and those for the old B&W, you'll see that there is a little debate going on about which is better. Really, both films have their merits. The original was cute and unpretentious, presenting a fragile Audrey Hepburn in some fashionable clothing (including that absurd gown she dragged through the tennis court scene). But this recent version has the benefit of having a much more appealing hero. Harrison Ford, though he is awkward in romantic roles, is still a far better choice than the clumsy and unattractive Humphrey Bogart. Ford plays the lead, Linus Larrabee, the oldest of two brothers and the responsible (even greedy) one. Greg Kinnear gives a brilliant performance as the younger brother, David, a playboy with only women on his mind. Caught between the two is Sabrina, even more brilliantly played by Julia Ormond. Unlike Hepburn, who presented a shy and awkward Sabrina, Ormond plays the role with not just shyness or insecurity, but an underlying gentleness that fleshes out the character, making her very real and very appealing.  Each scene, she delivers just the right amount of insecurity combined with the right amount of emotion, and each line is delivered perfectly.  Yet you are never aware that she is acting.  The interactions between Kinnear and Ormond have tremendous \\"chemistry\\", more so than those she has with Ford. But between Julia and Greg, or rather their characters, there is so much honesty and quite frankly such superb acting that what you are witnessing is not some celebrity actors playing themselves playing a role, but two true actors who make it all look natural. (I know, something Hollywood typically doesn't appreciate.) Their scenes bring a passion and a reality to the film that is rather inspiring -- I'd like to see these two paired again, this time as the lovers and not those who end up \\"just friends\\". The storyline is played gently, more for comedy than drama. This film owes a lot to its predecessor, but I have to vote that this is the better, more charming, more emotional and more natural version. The cast of supporting characters is marvelous and expert, including Nancy Marchand as the Larrabee matriarch, John Wood as Sabrina's sensible father, Angie Dickinson and Richard Crenna as the Tysons of Tyson Electronics and a billion dollar merger if David marries their daughter, a physician played by Lauren Holly.   Dana Ivey is Mack, Linus' secretary, who has all the funny lines (\\"We were up to our arms in your underwear drawer. It was like touching the Shroud of Turin.\\")All the supporting cast do a wonderful job of, well, supporting the stars. The pace never lags, the fun and the drama don't stop. The DVD version has excellent sound and color picture.  This is a good investment if you want to see a film that is adult, gently dramatic, clever, and pure pleasure.
0385505833|5.0|This was a quick read for me, I bought it @ 2:30<br />PM and finished it by 5:30PM, with some interruptions. I wasn't certain what to expect because I rarely preview the covers previous to starting my read, I just delve in!<br />I thoroughly enjoyed John Grisham's break from his usual subject matter. The humour and thought he used to breach this subject and<br />plunge to the depths of the 'Christmas Crunch' had me laughing and visualizing this comedy. He had me from the start, wondering what he was trying to convey and just exactly where Krank was taking the audience.<br />I can see this short story becoming the next 'Christmas Movie'. Mr. Grisham has had many of them go to film and I can actually see Kelsey Grammer (Frazier) as the Krank himself!!  The way the guy ends up when attempting to 'Frosty' his home had me rolling, along with his neighbors. His means of acquiring a tree, so late in the season, was a stroke of 'idiotic' genius. How the neighborhood reacts to the Krank's skipping Christmas, being completely bewildered and taken aback by it was hilariuos and oh so true to life.<br />I have to say thanks for the laugh and the true to life story!!<br />Very funny, and the touching action in the end was truely an author-itative touch!  Take it to film, PLEASE, it'll be a hit!  BRAVO!!!!
B00005N83M|5.0|It's definately worth it..there's a mix of Latin, pop, R&amp;B, and some rock to it..it's a great album!!
6304504012|5.0|Excellent combination of cast, music and direction. Madonna's best movie so far. Seems natural, and acting by Jonathan Pryce and madonna makes it worth watching. Can't miss out on the voice of Antonio Benderas. If you like musicals, then this one's definitely for you.
6305428425|4.0|This must be one of the many movies that I'll want to see over and over again. Both Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow give Excellent comedic performances! One that shouldn't be missed. A great movie that will make you laugh all the way, till the end! The dancing in the reunion made me laugh so much, with &quot;Time After Time&quot; by Cindy Lauper being played, which was one of the best parts, that made me love this movie even more! You wont be dissapointed.
B000002B1M|4.0|This is Nas 2nd release, in the same year Big L dropped his first album, along with Jay-Z and The Root´s &quot;Illadelph Halflife&quot;. Well, by this time we all know that Nas´s &quot;Illmatic&quot; was considered a classic, not only in the hiphop field, but in the world of Pop Music. And no doubt that hungry kid felt the pressure to do something that could impress the world like he did it previously. He adopted a new alias - Nas Escobar- and decided do handle the production on the hands of the Trackamasters.<br />The album is good in it´s on way. There´s no Premo &amp; Large Professor´s beats on it, u can realise the differences betwen the first and second albums. The lyrical content changed up a lil´bit, Nas tell tales ´bout gangstas, guns and similarities...He ain´t that hungry kid spittin´verses with fury, now he´s more older and his style is more laid back, but fortunatelly he didnt miss his lyrical skills, no doubt once again he proves he´s a street poet, maybe the G.O.A.T. on this category...He catches your attention with every single line.<br />And this album shows to the listenet the original The Firm team - AZ, Cormega, Foxy Brown and Nas- plus a collabo with Dr. Dre, as a matter of fact, the song &quot;Affirmative Action&quot; is one of the best of the album, these guys trading verses with so muh passion so that is hard for u to ignore them. Maybe I´m wrong but I think Mega´s voice remembers a lot Nature´s...And the flow too!<br />Of course, Mobb Deep drop by and deliver a great song, Hav, P. and Nas always make great songs together...It´s too bad there´s beef among them right now...Overall it´s a good album, u can´t compare to Illmatic...but it was decent sophomore album, and very different from teh first one which shows Nas´s capacity of not stick to the original formula...Maybe was a wrong move, amybe not, but It´s an album that will worth your money.
B000002IWQ|3.0|I was initially disappointed with this album. It lacks the consistency of PRESTO and ROLL THE BONES.Also, there are a few songs here that I absolutely HATE, three to be exact. While STICK IT OUT has a monstrous guitar and bass riff to it, the song itself is lame,especially the lyrics. NOBODY's HERO is my least favorite RUSH song; NEIL PEART tries too hard to rhyme in tackling a controversial subject and GEDDY'S vocal melody is one of his worst! BLAH!! Also, COLD FIRE is another failed attempt to write a song about relationships. NEIL PEART sounds like a robot when he tries to write about love, or a robotic scientist; at least on this song!<br /><br /> Some of this album is GREAT, however!! Songs like CUT TO THE CHASE and BETWEEN SUN AND MOON sees these guys rocking out like they haven't in a long time. BETWEEN is my favorite song on the album; it has a wonderful vocal melody from GEDDY and a very STONES-ish guitar solo from LIFESON, almost sounding like IN THE MOOD. DOUBLE AGENT is another gem of a song, from the very heavy guitar and bass riff that wouldn't have sounded out of place on A FAREWELL TO KINGS, to GEDDY'S spoken part. SPEED OF LOVE is one love song that works, mainly due to the very nice and melodic chorus and some NICE guitar playing from LIFESON.<br /> ANIMATE is another good song, even tho' at six minutes it feels a little too long because it's so repetitous. The instrumental LEAVE THAT THING ALONE is a great song, tho' it's probably RUSH'S most laid back instrumntal. The bass guitar is very loud on this and LIFESON'S more audible and metallic, but GEDDY sings a bit too much.<br />a strange album!
6302820448|5.0|This movie isn't just funny it's hilarious for the following reasons; a single day keeps repeating itself. Murray plays an ignorant jerk, the things this ignorant jerk does with his time, how many times he tries to get Rita to fall in love with him, how many times he's slapped by Rita, the sarcasm, and of course the entire drunk driving scene.<BR>\\"Groundhog Day\\" is about a man named Phil who is a weatherman and who is, well, an ignorant jerk. Phil must go to a small town with a woman named Rita a producer and a cameraman to report whether or not Phil the famous groundhog sees his shadow. While in this small town Phil develops somewhat of a crush on the producer Rita but nothing really comes of it because he's a jerk. Fate steps in and makes the day repeat over and over until Phil finally wins Rita's heart. In this process an armored car gets ripped off, there's this whole ordeal where Phil plays chicken with a train and of course Phil's repeated suicide attempts. Eventually Phil takes his time to his advantage and learns how to play the piano, saves a life, learns to be kind and as I've said before wins Rita over.<BR>This movie is great and I recommend it to everyone who loves romantic comedies. Well, it's sort of romantic... I think.
B00003CXTG|2.0|As soon as the film opened with Soap Opera style melo-drama (which is never addressed in the remainder of the film) I knew this was going to be a tough one. The action sequences were brilliantly done, the story completely predictable and contrived. All of this could also be said about Titanic. However Titanic works because it embaces its sappy melo-dramatic nature. Pearl Harbor doesn't work.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is one of the best books I have ever read!  Purely fantasy, but with a theme that gets you thinking--what is the future really going to be like for future generations.  Can we afford to put so much pressure on our children in order to evolve as a species? Ender is the perfect martyred hero.
B00005N9CV|3.0|Diana Krall is a wonderfully talented musician, but this album lacks energy. She delivers everything well, and properly, and without enthusiasm. Is she bored? I love the music, enjoy her voice, and expected much, much more. <BR>See Julia Fordham for what a bold and creative talent can do with Jazz music in recent years.
B000005IU2|5.0|It really is my favorite. Out of all the cd's i own, i listen to this one most. Even my other favorites(White Light White Heat- Vu, Station to Station - Bowie, Use Your illusion I and II - GNR)<BR>don't come close to giving me the same kind of feeling i get when i listen to The Funhouse. It's a crazy recording. Most will appreciate when they are having a crazy day. I don't know why critics always say The Stooges are such awfull musicaians. They sound great to me. I Love how iggy constantly yelps, he does it so much that you start to think &quot;Hasn't he yelped enough! What is he CRAZY!........Oh yea.....Wait a minute he is Crazy!..Ha!&quot;<BR>Most of the lyrics are grunts, screams, yells, and howls. I like the Howling on &quot;T.V. Eye&quot;, it's very powerful, and gives you a real ALIVE! feeling that you just can't get anywhere else. <BR>It's a Dark and very creepy album but it is not depressing. It's alive and happening! It makes you want to dance like a maniac. It's like iggy is singing about all these awfull things in his life and how everything sucks but he's not going to dwell on his problems, he's gonna drink some beer, dance around, Kick the saxophone player, scream &quot;I feel alright!&quot;, and be cool forever.
0446678430|3.0|The discussion on leverage is pretty good. Still worth buying if you like Robert's motivation and his stories for your own life and business needs. I still like it even though I gave it 3 stars... Reading the first 1/3 part of the book is quite annoying because he keeps repeating his stories and his points as in his other books. However, maybe that is how we learn, through repetition.. I prefer his &quot;guide to investing&quot; book - it's more practical and useful.
B00005221L|5.0|What happens when the hunter becomes the hunted? This flick answers the question very well. It is a microcosm of what happens when an inferior society meets an advanced one. While on a minimalist approach, it reflects the endless struggle between technology and morality. In our eyes, it is murder to hunt and kill humans for sport. In the alien's eyes, we are merely animals. <BR>It is ultimately reaffirming because Arnold kills the alien. Like every one species that has competed against humans, the alien learned that the most dangerous thing in the world is a human with a rock and an indomitable spirit.<BR>One of my favorites
B00005K9LN|3.0|When it comes to the remasters,I'll pass from this point on when it comes to Priest. British Steel was the beginning of the band's turn to commercialism and simplifying their music. Gone were the tricky rhythm changes of masterpiecies like &quot;Victim Of Changes&quot;, and &quot;Sinner&quot;, as well as any quiet acoustic textures that varied their attack.Radio ready shout alongs like &quot;Breakin' The Law&quot; (&quot;Washin' The Dog&quot;-Beavis And Butthead version),&quot;Livin' After Midnight&quot;, and the ever moronic &quot;United&quot; took their place. The pre-sped metaler &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;, and the surprising &quot;Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise&quot;, and &quot;Steeler&quot; recall a better time (Stained Class)and partially save this one;but folks,please get Sad Wings Of Destiny, and Sin After Sin first if you really want to appreciate this band.
B00004WGC4|5.0|Living a life of quiet desperation is the English way For Basil in this series. It is a dark comedy with slapstick thrown in for the unwary. <BR>Cleese is a comic genius in his role with a supporting cast of characters that combine to make this BBC series one of the funniest.
B00005RDAF|5.0|AWESOME that is the best word to describe the videos.  It give you the full pepsi comercial, the viedos for slave, not a girl not yet a woman, and a few more, it also has a photo shoot with Britney.  I love it.
6305263248|5.0|I didn't think I would like this flick but after watching it once, I was hooked. It's a good story of people whose lives were spent fighting for idealogies that no longer exist. How do they fill the void? Money, danger, the usual opiates of society. <BR>De Niro plays a member of a ragtag group of former spies, etc. who are hired by an Irish group to steal a briefcase. No one knows what is in it, and honestly no one cares. De Niro is excellent, as in everything he does, and believable as an ex-CIA burned out hasbeen. <BR>The action is terrific, with some of the best driving sequences I've seen. Double-crossing and double-double crossing is the rule of the day. Eventually, it turns out that De Niro is actually after the head of the Irish group, a known terrorist, who is a major impediment to peace talks in N. Ireland. At the end of the flick, a radio announcer comments that with the recent death of this leader, peace is assured in Ireland after centuries of fighting. This answers the question of whether everything was worth it.<BR>The DVD shows an alternative ending that is grimmer and probably more realistic. But sometimes, too much realism [hurts].<BR> <BR>One of my favorites.
B000002UAX|5.0|This album is amazing considering the fact that The Beatles were at the verge of extinction as a group. There are many gems such as \\"Back in the USSR\\" \\"Helter Skelter\\" \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and the heavy \\"Yer Blues.\\" I love \\"Don't Pass Me By,\\" Ringo's first composition because it is upbeat and with a distinctive western hoedown style to it. Then there are the quieter, softer ones such as Lennon's tribute to his mother, \\"Julia\\" Harrison's love for God, \\"Long, Long, Long\\" and Lennon's urging of a friend to come out of the darkness, \\"Dear Prudence.\\" McCartney's playfulness shines brightly with such tunes as \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\\" \\"Honey Pie\\" and \\"Martha My Dear,\\" a sweet ballad written for his sheepdog, Martha! John Lennon's harsh, unhappy, and derisive attitute is evident in such pieces as \\"Yer Blues,\\" \\"I'm So Tired\\" and, the real horror, \\"Revolution 9.\\" Now, call me crazy, but I actually like \\"Revolution 9.\\" It's strange, I know, but really, it's interesting. So many different sounds, noises, voices, music, you can never remember them all. George Harrison also has a touch of silliness with his pieces \\"Piggies,\\" almost a nursery rhyme about pigs, and \\"Savoy Truffle\\" a pure rock number describing different types of chocolates and desserts.<BR>\\"Cry Baby Cry\\" is a creepy one. (\\"A meeting round the table for a seance in the dark...\\") Not a good one to listen to at night. <BR>The album opens with the distant sounds of an airplane taking off, then launches into \\"Back in the USSR,\\" Paul McCartney's late 50s, early 60s style rocker inspired by Chuck Berry's \\"Back in the USA\\" and The Beach Boys' harmonies. The filler tracks, \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" and \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road?\\" aren't really so bad. The first one sounds distorted and strained, but the second is brassy and a little too repetitive. \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\" is a comedy number, complete with the pattering of the applause of children after a silly puppet show. Harrison's \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is heavy and complex, with Eric Clapton playing lead guitar. \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" is the acid-induced collage of weird thoughts and stories. Paul McCartney's talents at acoustic guitar come through with the 100% acoustic \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" is full of fiddle. That and \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" are very square-dance songs. \\"I Will\\" is a piece of Paul's soft love for Linda Eastman. Disc 2 opens with \\"Birthday,\\" a piece of straight rock, but is toned down to a sweet acoustic feel with Paul's \\"Mother Nature's Son.\\" <BR>Lennon's word play is obvious with \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me and My Monkey,\\" but his hateful revenge against the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is sculpted into \\"Sexy Sadie.\\" Lennon's slow, laborious \\"Revolution 1\\" is another worthless filler, but the album closes beautifully with \\"Good Night.\\"<BR>Over all, this is an essential album to ANYONE'S collection.
0790740443|5.0|a human trained from birth to be the ultimate soldier meets the ultimate soldier, genetically engineered to be faster, stronger, meaner. <BR>Russell does a good job coming to grips with his humanity in the action-packed futuristic drama. An interesting twist on the old story of an impersonal military trying to create the perfect warrior only to have it destroyed by a soldier fighting for something he believes in. <br />One of my favorites.
B00004U8P9|3.0|I have been a long time fan of Rocky. So when I finally got a DVD player, this is one of the first movies I was eager to check out. Especially when I noted the special features it included: out-takes, cut scenes, and &quot;theatrical experience&quot; stuff. The movie looked great. I have no complaints there. Frank looked extra glamorous with the enhanced picture. And widescreen is always good! My complaint is with these so-called special features. When I see the word &quot;out-takes&quot; I'm thinking some funny scenes where Tim Curry trips on his high heels or something like that. But really, the outtakes are little more than film from unused camera angles. The stuff from VH-1 Behind the Music was interesting enough, but it was nothing new. VH-1 runs Rocky Horror almost monthly, along with the Behind the Music stuff. And the theatrical experience, I think, should remain IN THE THEATER. That's the whole point of audience participation. It's not enjoying it in your living room, it's enjoying it with a whole room FULL of whackos. The cut-scenes were interesting. But that was the only special feature that I really found to be &quot;special.&quot; So, all in all, the movie is an excellent addition to your library. Just don't get your heart set on the extras.
B00003CXN4|1.0|This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life! It had no plot, jumped around at a psychotic pace that no body can follow.  The only people that could possibly like this movie is someone that has no attention span.  Do not watch or buy this movie.  Del Toro must of thought, hey I have a bad movie so I better put in a whole cast of star actors to make my bad movie good.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage Against the Machine delivers another solid album with the Battle of Los Angeles. The sound is a little agressive then the first album, but songs like sleep now in the fire, guerilla radio and Mik Check are as hard and fast as you will find Rage Against the Machine. There are plenty of other great songs like Maria Maria and voice of the voiceless. <br />It is interesting to see Rage continuing to do politics but also to upon emotionally with this album, something the band hasn't done too much of.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Only three movies in my life have I walked out on:<br />1 - Terms of Endearment<br />2 - Drunken Master (Jackie Chan)<br />3 - Moulon Rouge<br />I love movies, and have rented every new release Blockbuster<br />has had over the last 10 years.<br />I'm sorry, but this movie was absolutely terrible. I walked out<br />at the 41 minute mark -- couldn't take it any longer.<br />For you younger people: the green, flaming drinks that most<br />of the characters were drinking are called 'Absinthe'.<br />Absinthe was the late 1800's version of LSD, was very popular<br />in europe, but now very illegal.<br />It seemed to me like the director, writer, cast and crew had<br />found a supply of real Absinthe, and were tripping heavily<br />during the production of this show.<br />Everything was so disconnected, like a jumpled, bad acid trip.<br />The costumes, sets, and camera angles were O.K., but the<br />lighting was always too dark, as though filmed in a dark studio.<br />Nichole had a nervous, bloodshot look that I found disturbing.<br />The lead actor had terrible teeth, too many close-ups.<br />I am sorry to be negative about such a popular movie.<br />No, I'm not a mormon.<br />I really rate this movie ZERO stars, but the website where<br />you type your reviews only goes down to one star.
B00001NFCY|2.0|I got this album soon after it first came out. It was interesting for a while. However, after a while the music just got bland. It seem that the band really did not put all to much into the album. My own prison was good because Strapp put a lot of heartfelt emotion into the album but Human Clay shows how success can spoil a band. Stick with my own prison.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|All I can say is that in a world full of pop ..., Bob Dylan has once again put together art.  Sad, goofy, poignant, and telling all at once, this album has more moods and voices than Time Out of Mind, but its no less effective.  Mississippi is a great song of regret coupled with new hope.  Cry Awhile has the twinges of revenge found in some live versions of It Ain't Me Babe.  This is the album of the year, no doubt about it.  A Master at work again, but this before you buy anything else this year!
B000001Y5J|5.0|Broken is a fairly short, but still very strong and intense. It's tied with fragile as my favorite nine inch nails album. The bests songs are really wich and gave up. The two hidden songs (Tracks 98 and 99) are also a great suprise to hear.
B00005B36H|3.0|To me, this record smacks of an artist deciding they can do anything and get away with it.  you know what I mean?  Everyone from Bob Dylan to the Rolling Stones to Nine Inch Nails has done it.  While the album is technically very good and does have some good songs on it, tool just seems to have lost something since their EP Opiate and first album Undertow.  Those two albums had a new sound while maintaining a song and rock mentality.  This album is full of what can only be described as long, intro jams and reminds me of bands like the dead and the alman brothers.  After a while I wanted a song already.<br />While I am impressed by their ability to manipulate sounds and instruments, and their ability to string notes together, this album just lacks in the rock song I grew to love and expect from them.  Good effort but I would go buy Opiate or Undertow first.
B0000057C5|4.0|Let me start this out by stating that I am not really into the whole metal-goth music scene.  These four stars that I have bestowed upon this CD were unbiased and well-deserved.  Their music is powerful, hard, and engaging with some kind of techno-ish beats, and I like listening to it.  If you do, as well, you should know that Rammstein has produced two other CDs - Herzeleid (earlier) and Mutter (later.)<br />I was looking at some of the reviews, and somebody didn't understand what &quot;Du Hast&quot; means.  I thought I'd clarify this.  You see, it's a play on words.  The word &quot;haben&quot;, (to have) when conjugated in the informal &quot;you&quot; form, is &quot;hast&quot;.  Du hast = you have.  Got that?  However, the word &quot;hassen&quot;, which means &quot;to hate&quot; when conjugated is &quot;hasst.&quot;  Du hasst = you hate.  But the trick is that &quot;hast&quot; and &quot;hasst&quot; are pronounced the same.  So, the guy is saying &quot;Du, du hast, du hast mich.&quot;  And since nobody ever says &quot;you have me&quot;, everybody assumes that he's saying &quot;du hasst mich,&quot; or &quot;you hate me.&quot;  Oooh, the passion!  The pain!  The emotion!  But then, he throws everybody for a loop by adding a new word, saying &quot;Du hasst mich gefragt&quot;.  (&quot;Gefragt&quot; means &quot;asked.&quot;)  So, now he's saying &quot;you have asked me&quot;.  Oh, okay.  He wasn't even talking about hatred in the first place!  We just THINK that he is...<br />Sorry if that didn't make much sense.  I am just trying to help out here.
B000007VCM|5.0|I used to like heavy metal, and some years ago I bought \\"Electric\\" by The Cult because everyone told me how hard it rocked. I pretty much liked \\"Electric\\", so I went out and bought another Cult album, \\"Love\\" (1985). I found a record that was completely unlike \\"Electric\\": no AC/DC-like guitar riffs but plenty of psychodelia and intrincate guitar work, together with catchy guitar melodies (\\"rain\\", \\"nirvana\\"...) and one of the best 80's songs (even if that doesn't sound too difficult) \\"She sells sanctuary\\". And, best of all, the album feels like a whole, I mean, it is one of those albums that feels like the whole of it is better than the sum of all of its songs, however weird that sounds. U2 are given all the credit for saving rock in the 80s, but after dozens of listening sessions, I still find \\"Love\\" far superior to \\"the Joshua Tree\\". This is a record that sounds unlike anything done before it, and it has clearly influenced bands like Flickerstick or even The Cure. Anyone that listens to it (hard rockers, alternative music fans or even goths) will tell you it is a great album. And it is unmovable from my top10 all-time records since I first listened to it. What more can I say? Buy this record!!!
B00005KHJR|5.0|I saw the original US version in the 1970s.  I thought it was really amazing in its depiction of what a pure pagan society would be today.  But, after seeing the DVD version, I realize I never appreciated it's artistic and spiritual value.  Yes someone is sacrificed in the movie and if you wish to claim it is just a horror movie, I will understand, but the final scenes of the movie only show a dedication to the true intent of the movie itself.  There are no politically correct scenes in it.  That's why it feels real.  These are Pagans living in the 20th century.  The only out of place character is Sgt Howie.  Does he get what he deserves?  If you are one of these pagans, you would say &quot;of course!&quot; but if you were a Christian, you would say No!  That's what makes this movie so important.  It is disturbing to everyone who sees it.  And that is good.  We need more movies that make us think.  It's just too bad it had to become a cult classic before they would re-issue it.
038533348X|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It was funny, scandlous, and very interesting. <BR>e
0451191153|5.0|I read this book in my teenage. It gave me the conviction to pursue my beliefs even if they were against the norm. As an adult the message has stayed with me , though now it has been tempered with my own thinking and experience. Perhaps that is what we are supposed to do anyway.<br /><br />This book sets forth the idea how by being egoistic we can be truly happy. To put it simplistically, Egoism is defined as following your dream, that dream may very well be to be a good mom.<br />I would like to say that the book is definitely worth a read for the ideas it sets forth. I admired the clarity of Ayn Rand's vision and her belief in her own ideas, but as readers we are free to learn from them or discard them. There is definitely a reason why this book has survived over 50 years and is still very widely read. All said and done, it is definitely a book worth a read.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Cute movie. New twist on an old story. Reese Witherspoon was great, as was the rest of the cast.<br />Don't miss this adorable movie...it's not only a renter, but it's a good one buy too - just incase you're in a bad mood and want a movie that will make you smile!
B000002GEV|5.0|Supertramp's CRIME OF THE CENTURY is one of those special albums that will stick with you for life. I have had at least 6 different copies of this album since it's original release, on vinyl, cassette, 8 track,..yes, I said 8 Track! (I guess I've just revealed my age, eh?) Anyway, now that this classic is on CD, I guess I can quit buying it now! ASYLUM is one of the great 'art rock' songs of the 70's, standing alongside the best work of Pink Floyd or The Moody Blues. DREAMER and BLOODY WELL RIGHT are worldwide hits that everyone should know already, but with Supertramp it is usually the obscure album tracks that make up the band's best work. You can't go wrong buying CRIME OF THE CENTURY, every song on it is an unforgetable musical experience, and the songs flow together like a perfectly told story. Also check out Supertramp's underrated later release BROTHER WHERE YOU BOUND, an album that is too good to be as Universally ignored as it is!
B00005QIPH|5.0|This review is mainly to rebutt some of the bad reviews here. If you don't like good music, then don't review it... Simple as that. I don't mean to pick out one of you, but it was the first one I saw.... You give Weezer and Strokes bad reviews, and you give 3 Doors Down and Stone Temple Pilots good reviews. Weezer are one of the greatest bands around, and Strokes are an excellent band who have potential. 3 Doors Down are about as comercial as you can get, and STP, well... We all know that Scott Weiland is trying to sound like Pearl Jam (only on his most recent album has he attempted to find his own voice.) You, and most of the people who gave it bad reviews are what I call 'Comercial Junkies'. Anything the industry throws money at to get airplay, you lap up like the hypnotized yuppies you are. Why don't you listen to some real music like The White Stripes, Gomez, or Jeff Buckley.<br />I'm not saying that if you like comercial music, you'll hate The Strokes, but comercial junkies usually have a hard time getting into anything that isn't POP'ish and INSTANTLY appealing. God forbid that an album hasn't been produced to oblivian. Also... Whoever made the comment about the production being so bad that the lead singers voice was drowned out, you obviously are not going to understand why it sounds like that if you hate the band, and don't bother looking behind the reasoning.<br />The Strokes are a very powerful live act (e.g. Download some of their live non-album stuff) and live songs aren't perfect. Songs recorded in a recording studio sound PERFECT! If you see that band live, it's NEVER gonna sound like that, so why make a single sound like that. It gives you false pretences of the bands sound. As they said in an interview (and I paraphrase) you don't need 8 mic's on a drumkit to record a sound from it. 2 or 3 will do it.<br />If you like entertaining rock 'n' roll, not POP-ROCK, then listen to The Strokes, don't believe the hype, and give them a serious chance and you'll find it an enjoyable listen.<br />One thing I always hate arguing over is music, because every has, and is entitled to, their own tastes and opinions, and you can't argue over someones TASTES. I'm just doing my best to explain what some non-fans wouldn't understand about the band because they would never read an article. I think I have a fairly eclectic music taste, and to the guy who said 'buy toxicity instead' that's all well and good. I like System of a Down, as well as SlipKnot and Marylin Manson, to Fiona Apple and Coldplay, to Beck and Cibo Matto, to Eminem and Dr Dre, to Reef and Kenny Wayne Shepherd, to Blind Melon and Radiohead. You name it, and I probably like it.<br />BTW, I, unlike the nay-sayers hear, am not chicken to provide my e-mail address for rebuttle. Feel free to flame me at joshua.y@ihug.com.au
B00005R2BG|1.0|I loved Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet, but I think this project is a failure. I respect him for his ambitiousness and I encourage him to keep up with such attempts for the successes are surely worth it. <br />In my opinion, the film failed in several respects. Foremost, I don't think there is any character development. What fuels Satine's ambition?  How can Zidler be so cold and greedy?  Louie and that gang, they only appear when it's convenient for the unbelievably weak plot.  The life in the club is not developed well either.  Basically, I didn't get a chance to know the characters or the \\"bohemian life\\" well enough to feel anything for them.<br />The musical aspect of the movie did not seem to work either. To me, this really muddled what Director Luhrman was aiming for.  What is the significance of using take-offs of 80's hits?   Is this supposed to be some satirical social commentary?  <br />There is a shallowness and ambiguousness throughout the movie.  Thus, although I wanted to like Satine and Christian, all I could muster was a sense of triteness.
B00005KHJR|5.0|This is a POWERHOUSE of a movie that will blow your mind!!!<br />It is listed as a horror film, when actually it is SO MUCH MORE.  If one classify the genre, I would say Mystery.<br />It begins with an anonymous letter to the Scottish Constable ( Edward Woodward of Equilizer fame) telling of Summer Isle.  A local girl is missing and none of the villagers seems to show any interest.  Flying to the small Isle, Woodward arrives just before Beltane, the pagan May Day Festivals and the find the Island completely immersed in the Pagan ways of Auld.  Head of the Isle is Lord Summerisle (British horror legend Christopher Lee - Dracula for Hammer Films - in his favourite performance), the leader of his pagan island, and it is clear he not only is aware of the villagers beliefs, he encourages them!<br />Slowly, Woodward comes to believe the girl is being held for Sacrifice on May Day as he races to save her.<br />Brilliant performance from Britt Eckland (former Mrs. Peter Sellers and one of the great beauties of her time - * though most of the nude shots are not her since she was pregnant at the time) Hammer horror actress Ingrid Pitt and Diane Cilento (the first Mrs. Sean Connery, mother of Jason) contribute to the eerie feel.<br />The movie portrays pagan beliefs in an unHollywood style, that goes for substance and facts, rather than sensationalism.  The scenery is beautiful and the music written for the film is haunting.<br />The film faced many production problems, to being passed through several production companies, a lot of lost footage from the film editor - a devoutly religious man who thought is sinful to be filming this and was systematically destroying as much as he could, and indifferent reediting by Roger Corman, and then nearly dying in bad handly in the theatres.  Was not seen for nearly two decades, and the version in existence was Corman's poorly edited one, missing over 20 minutes of the 101 minute original verson.<br />I spent years and year trying to track down a copy, and finally for a short time news was good.  The director found that he had an original copy still in his position.  This was released the VHS - first time the 101 version had been seen in nearly two decades!!  Shortly after, it was pulled from the shelves.  Corman's version ( a nice companion piece so it was made of a lot of out takes) came out for a spell.<br />So I am delighted to see this one on DVD and protected for all time.<br />Warning: some flashes of Eckland and her stand-in nude, and people of a very religious nature will not like the content.  Otherwise, this is one fabulous knock out of a film.k down a copy, and finally for a short time news was good.  The director found that he had an original copy still in his position.

B00005BJ2O|4.0|I have had the pleasure of listening to three soundtracks/songs from a series over the last 12months.Three that stand out as collections that are so intimately linked to the product that they form that extra dimension..The Sopranos,Peppers &amp; Eggs,The Fellowship of the Ring,and this eccentric,magnificent,Baz Luhrmann inspired collection.I agree,that this should not be referred to as a soundtrack,it is a collection of songs from the movie,but lead and cast versions are there,be they somewhat supplemented by some extra,if not totally needed, vocals in places.The originals stand alone.<br />The Movie,Moulin Rouge has taken a while to grab me as a cinemagraphic experience,,but the music did immediately.The pairing of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman as flawed and fatally fated lovers in turn of the century Paris,would not have been my choice,and singing a musical to boot,..no way!!!,but they work perfectly together and they sing so genuinely that no one else could now fill that role.Ewan McGregor was a revelation,his treatment of the *Elephant Love Song Medley* and the dynamic and heartfelt*Come What May*(amazingly overlooked in the recent Golden Globes)make this CD worth the price of purchase.The lyrics are quirky ,using snippets from contemporary songs of the last few decades to express love and sentiment,in a way that dialogue could not.<br />Nicole Kidman also aquits herself admirably,with*One Day I'll Fly Away*particularly poignant bearing in mind her recent personal problems.Her vocal performance with McGregor on *Come What May*and her interpretation of the role and songs in the latter half of the movie deservedly got her recognition in the recent Golden Globes awards.The two leads and the combination of the cast in full voice make the hairs stand on the back of your neck stand up,and have you applauding like a romp at the *Rouge*.<br />However,I cannot give this 5 stars,for two reasons,there are songs from the movie that should have been on here,in there cast format,such as the *Sound of Music Sequence*,*Smells Like Teen Spirit sequence*and the darkly magnificent and melancholy*The Show Must Go On sequence*.These were intricate to the plot and to an understanding of the melodramatic climax for the demise of the lovers.<br />Secondly,the employing of established contemporary recording artists to sing songs ,in my opinion ,missed the mark.They do not improve the product.If you have not seen the movie,perhaps,but then again the two are linked,and a view of the movie is a must.I did however enjoy the Bono led *Children of the Revolution*,a great song in any generation.However,Beck doing *Diamond Dogs* left me cold,especially after hearing the cast rendition.If Bowie is on this collection,get the original if you are going to use anything.<br />The not to be forgotten stars in this whole production,are The Moulin Rouge Paris(and of course Paris itself)and Baz Luhrmann.<br />The City of Light meets the eccentric from down under.Luhrmann is leading his own bohemian revolution,and he has taken a standard naive and infatuated boy meets attainable goddess melodrama format and made a truely memorable musical experience.The emphasis is on the colour the sound the songs the magic of truth beauty freedom and love.The aggression in the Nightclub sequences and the Can Can,with the 70s icon recording*Lady Marmalade*thrown in,pure genius!!<br />I have recently been to the Moulin Rouge in its present manifestation,it is a moving experience and I could see why this whole porject was destined for success.<br />Look out for the additional songs from the movie coming shortly.It will complete the picture.<br />In the meantime buy and savour this,4.5 stars.such as the *Sound of Music

B00005RFAI|2.0|I gained a newfound respect for Pink when a watched an Episode of MTV's diary.<br />She clearly is a talented vocalist in the technical sense of the word.  As she sang alongside her Father as he played the acoustic guitar I told my wife, &quot;this girl can clearly sing&quot;. <br />I mean this young lady does have a soulful vibe that Britney, Christina, and a few of the other Becky's don't have.<br />So what happened on this album?  The songwriting!  That's a pretty basic observation.  The lyrics are pretentious and dumb.  <br />I'm not saying that Pink should remain a Hip-hop artist because she is much too talented (vocally) to even get caught up in all that crap.  I won't say that she should hook up with Jam/Lewis or Babyface or any of those folks.  <br />I would say that she should be more selective in her material.  Keep it simple.  &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; is the best song on this album.  Why?  It's not pretentious.  Straight to the point.  Plus, if you notice, this girl is actually singing on this song.  Yeah, I know they have her filtered as if she's singing through an old Vaudevillian type mic, but she is hitting the notes, and her range is not bad either.  <br />She can do better than this.  <br />One caveat, I didn't get her first album.  It was hip-hop/R&amp;B drivel.  I see a lot of the young people expected more of that in this album.  Not surprising.  They don't know any better.  That hybrid stuff is beneath a truly talented artist.  <br />(Which is why has Aaliyah still been living, she would have changed her style too, and directed it towards more discriminating audiences, if she wanted longevity.)<br />Pink will last, as long as she doesn't step to us with this type of mess again, and as long as she stays away from that other Gen-X, Hip-hop, Raver babble.<br />If you don't want to be come a worn our novelty in this business - grow up!  You hear me, Pink, grow up!
B00005QDW5|4.0|4.5 Stars<br />Compilations of any kind are inherently problematic because songs are removed from their original perspective.  I think this is even more the case with a band like Pink Floyd that lived and breathed within the confines of the concept album.  But in many respects, this compilation works even for the hardcore Floyd fan, as long as he or she is willing to reopen the doors of their mind and think anew.  Disc 1, in particular, I find interesting.  Starting with &quot;See Emily Play&quot; on through &quot;Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun&quot;, there is an interesting flow and development that one never would have considered if just listening to the individual albums.  After &quot;Set The Controls&quot;, the beginning of &quot;Money&quot; breaks the trance for me, perhaps because Money was the first Floyd song to be widely played on the FM airwaves.  Disc 2 has its moments of revelation, but I find them to be more fleeting than the first disc.  So if you don't own any Pink Floyd albums, don't expect this set to take you where you want to go.  You're going to have to pay your dues and invest the time and money to listen to at least half of the catalog and injest them as individual bricks in the Wall built by one of the most influential bands of our time.
0446604844|5.0|I picked up this book one afternoon and before I knew it, it was the middle of the night. Twists and turns that will not let you put this book down make it a very fast 500+ page read. This book was my introduction to David Baldacci who belongs among the leaders of suspense story-telling. A thouroughly researched, well edited thriller which belongs on the bookshelves of every mystery/suspense reader. <br />Baldacci, Bring it on!
B000002UJQ|3.0|i really had high hopes for this album.  airbag is a fantastic song, so are homesick alien and paranoid android.  from there, it just goes downhill, with the exception of karma police.  fitter happier is a well concieved but poorly executed idea of pre-fight club ideas.  might be worth it to you, but i don't know.
B00005R2M3|2.0|What happened to Shakira?  The reason why so many of us enjoyed her music was because of her originality in Spanish (despite the Alanis-isms).  Pies descalsos and Ladones were great and she looked great.  Laundry service is a disappointment and I suppose a compromise to launch into the main stream (too bad for us).  Just to sum it up, my 15-year old stepson loves the album and doesn't understand a word of Spanish - it just gets lumped in with Britney and all the other whatevers!  Esperando el proximo! Haydee
B00005JK99|5.0|I can't really say anything more about this movie that hasn't been said. But for me personally, my favorite part is when John Cleese finishes his \\"hideous creature\\" speech as Tim the Enchanter and Graham Chapman turns and says \\"What an eccentric performance!\\"
B000002HEP|5.0|There is no way that I can write an accurate review of this album, it's too monumental. From start to finish this cd is 100%. It never gives up or lets you down. The guitars are as thick as 1000 brick walls. John Garcia's vocals couldn't be more passionate. If you like intellectual bands like Tool that write intense boiling point music then this is something that you should definatly check out. Sit back, crank it up, and expand your mind. It'll do ya some good, I promise.
B00005QXDD|5.0|The first time I saw Tenacious D was on SNL I think in '98.  I did not like them.  I did not get them.  My mind was not yet developed enough to comprehend The D.  They are definately an acquired taste, one taste which I am definately a better person for obtaining.  Seriously though, they really are a good duo and the CD will rock your socks.
0790729628|5.0|I first saw this film in a theatre with surround sound in its first release.  The dripping rain which accompanied most of the outside scenes made my skin crawl!  The scenes which parody earlier Dashiel Hammett / Raymond Chandler classics (like \\"Murder, My Sweet\\" and \\"The Lady in the Lake\\") remain some of my favorite film memories.  All of those movies had a voice over, and perhaps younger viewers would not realize the significance of the voice over in this film.  To my way of thinking, it is essential to the look and feel of the film, and the mood it created for me.  The gadgets and gizmos are almost standard Sci-fi fare for Ridley, but the feel of this movie is unique in that regard. <br />I looked forward to the Director's cut to answer two questions --which remain unanswered.<BR>1. Does the \\"heroine:\\" have an expire date?<BR>2. Is the bladerunner a replicant and does HE have an expire date?<BR>The director's cut, altho it changes the ending, does nothing to answer these questions.  It does eliminate the voice-over, which was one of my fondest aspects of the film.  I choose to stick with the original in DVD, rather than the director's cut.
6304602979|5.0|Ok - so you like high violence, gore, and lots and lots of curse words.  I'll assume you are a guy.  Let me tell you - this is THE perfect chick flick man, THE perfect one.  When I think of it, I compare it to a successful Bonnie and Clyde Movie.  I'm not going to elaborate on that, it could spoil the movie.  <br />The cast is great. Many small parts by such great actors.  Val Kilmer is a character and you never clearly see his face for example.  Again, a very good movie.  You have violence, gore, and cursing for the guys, and a chick romance story for the chicks.  <br />If I were to pick the downsides to this movie, I would have to say this.  The movie soundtrack theme - is [awful].  It's some kind of 80's xylophone [stuff].  Other than that? nope.<br />Highlights of this movie would of course be the end gunning down scene.  The fight between alabama and a mob boss.  and the pimp fight scene.
0345350499|5.0|As a non-native English speaker and non-believer in any religion, it's the first time that I've ever heard of King Arthur.  I fell in love with the book immediately.  Sure enough, the enchanting mists and an ancient saga are captivating; but what shaked me to my very bone is its depth in describing a world of conflicts:  a falling culture (tribes lived by hunting) and emerging new culture (agricultural society with strict feudal hierarchy); male dominance vs female dominance; one fading religion which embraced life force vs a new religion which denied life denouncing them as 'sins'; spiritual vs secular;  love vs lust; faith vs judgment...<br />This is a book that I will cherish for a long time.
B000002JSN|5.0|That's right. This one beats them all. It's the best double album ever, better than The White Album, better than Quadrophenia, better than Electric Ladyland, better than just about any live album you will find, even their own and Queen's Live Killers (which is also great, by the way). Many people consider this to be the last 'great' Zeppelin album. However, it is just the last 'great' Jimmy Page album, as the band still did greatness with In Through The Out Door.<BR>Compiled over quite some time, Physical Graffiti surely made all the waiting worth it. Its blend of pre-Houses of the Holy riff rock and creativity that was coming along more and more as the albums progressed, this is the perfect mixture of Page & Plant's dominance on the first album and Jones & Bonham's masterful work as the best rhythm section of all time, bar none. The first disc itself is worth as much as any Led Zeppelin album, and the second disc just adds to the album's greatness.<BR>On that first disc you will find the following:<BR>'Custard Pie' -- Led Zeppelin had a habit of having the first track on an album be quite raunchy (parts of Black Dog, Whole Lotta Love, even The Song Remains The Same's \\"And it always grows... push, push...\\"), and this one is no exception to that rule. Although not a song you hear often, it takes heavy rock and suggestive lyrics and makes a great song. I love it!<br />'The Rover' -- This song is worth the opening alone, and the rest of it is rather good too. Just a bit less heaviness and more thundering drums than Custard Pie.<br />'In My Time Of Dying' -- I may be wrong, but this is what I believe to be the longest LZ studio track; it's the longest one that I own, at over 11 minutes. The song has an eerie sense of energy to it, and although the same melodies are used throughout the song, they don't get old. An added bonus is the chatter at the end.<br />'Houses of the Holy' -- This song could have made the album of the same name the best of the best. Anyways, its feelgood guitar riffs and wonderful Plant vocals make this one of the three best songs on the album. Another song thats opening is great.<br />'Trampled Underfoot' -- The perfect blend of Zeppelin rock and Zeppelin funk. On no other song is there such a balance between all four members of the band and their contribution to the song.<br />'Kashmir' -- The grandaddy of them all, the Rose Bowl of Led Zeppelin. This is my favorite Zeppelin song along with 'Thank You' of LZ II, and is in my opinion, one of the two best Zeppelin songs of all time(Stairway to Heaven) and one of the ten best songs EVER!!! The unpareil rhythm and unstoppable vocals combine for 8 1/2 minutes of masterpiece.<br />Disc two isn't quite as impressive, but still as good as any:<BR>'In The Light' -- To me, this song is like an ancestor of \\"In The Evening\\" with its unusual intro and repetetive riffing. Too bad it took them two tries to perfect the sound. Nevertheless, it's definitely worth a listen.<br />'Bron-Yr-Aur' -- Another acoustic instrumental similar to 'Black Mountain Side' from LZ I, but better than its predecessor. It's short, but it is beautifully done.<br />'Down By The Seaside' -- I particularly like this tune because of its similarity to something that my favorite band, Queen, might do. As a matter of fact, if Robert Plant wasn't singing, I couldn't tell you any different. Not a diamond in the rough; more like a small diamond in a pile of huge diamonds.<br />'Ten Years Gone' -- This song completes the trilogy of 'Houses of the Holy', 'Kashmir', and itself that is the best of this album. Sounds like nothing before nor nothing after, but it could be compared to the previous album's 'No Quarter.'<br />'Night Flight' -- Everybody plays loud and cheerful on this song, which knows how to make me feel good. Definitely a lift after listening to the riveting 'Ten Years Gone,' which although good, doesn't exactly make you want to get up and dance.<br />'The Wanton Song' -- Everyone else seems to think very highly of this song. Although it isn't bad, I dislike it because it doesn't have the originality of some of the other songs. It would probably be good on another album where it wasn't quite as hidden in the masses of classics.<br />'Boogie With Stu' -- Plain and simple: This song [is weak].<br />'Black Country Woman' -- Blues and rockabilly all rolled into one. Page and Plant might as well be by themselves here. Everything about this song oozes with goodness. Acoustic rock at its best!<br />'Sick Again' -- I rarely ever listen to this song, but when I do, I like it. For some reason, by the time I get to this ultima, I'm tired of listening to Physical Graffiti, as hard as it may seem to fathom.<br />So there you have it. This is the best album of the best band, in my opinion. I hope that if you haven't already purchased it that you will soon, for it is unbelievable.
B00005OM4N|5.0|It's hard to fathom now, but it was not all that long ago that we were living in a pre-Britney world.  This album, her most assured and emotionally-plaintive work yet, completes her progression from child-muse to mature, iconic artist.  From the outset, her declaration \\"I'm not that innocent\\" signalled the dawn of the \\"New Woman,\\" - one who played by her own rules - and not only made Spears an instant role model for the New Millennium, but also cast her as the most socially significant female of her time, as important and historically relevant as Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy was to the Sixties, or Joan of Arc during her tumultuous era.  A lesser artist would crumble under the weight of such expectations, but with this album Spears looks bravely ahead and the breadth of her talent appears endless.  The standout, for all-intensive-purposes, is \\"Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,\\" which reveals a questing spirit caught between the innocence of childhood and the knowingness of an adult.  It's a powerful track, and a stinging response to those critics who rant that someone so young cannot be as sage or possess the wisdom that Spears so eloquently expresses with her music. Tracks such as \\"Lonely\\" and the aching \\"What It's Like to Be Me,\\" confirm that much of Brit's songs are birthed from a very painful place.  That she is willing and brave enough to strip herself emotionally naked and share her gifts with us is what makes her so precious and valid.
0064471837|5.0|From its first mysterious beginning, right through to the momentous, but sudden, ending, this book is a cut above the rest of the YA fantasy out there. However Sabriel is a page-turner, no doubt about that.<br />The story begins with the heroine, Sabriel, in her last year at boarding school in a country, not unlike early 20th century England, called Ancelstierre. We find that she is no ordinary girl, but in fact the daughter of the Abhorsen, a necromancer of much importance from The Old Kingdom, located to the north of Ancelstierre.<br />The Old Kingdom is a perilous country, where two types of magic are ever at war and the dead don't always stay dead. It is the Abhorsen's task to rid the world of evil necromancers and lay the dead back to rest.<br />Sabriel finds her last year cut short when she receives a message from her father, saying he is in trouble, possibly caused by his old enemy Kerrigor. As a result, she sets out on a journey across the Wall to the land of her birth to find, or rescue, her father.<br />Along the way she gains the help of her father's cat Mogget and the mysterious Touchstone, in the race against time (and Kerrigor) to prevent the eventual destruction of the Old Kingdom as she knows it.<br />The technology of Ancelstierre and the magic of the Old Kingdom and what happens when they cross provide a new issue for fantasy, which is often very medieval.<br />This is a book which, though it sounds a little like a horror novel when being described, contains everything a good book, and a good fantasy book at that, should have, plus some very original ideas. There is danger, magic, romance and intrigue all to be found here. A strong heroine, who is potentially a wonderful role model and Garth Nix's brilliant storytelling and humour, combine to make this novel worth every cent, and maybe more...
B00003OSTV|5.0|Quo Vadis is a movie Ive seen many times and never tire watching. It has beautiful and panoramic scenes making it worthy of an epic. I loved Ustinov playing the evil demonic Nero and Laffan playing Nero's Empress wife. Truely I rarely see such great acting in our films of today. <BR>    The greatest attributes of the film are the colliseum scenes in which the Christians are slaughtered  for falsley being blamed for the burning of Rome. Nero was fully responsible for  this horrid act. The scenes of Nero's court are entertaining and funny to see. Watching all of Nero's men cowtowing to their emperor and at the same time showing contempt for Nero's actions. <BR>    The sets are great for 1951 standards and even by todays standards. The Roman Legion formations and custumes were excellent. Taylor's acting is medicore but sufficient and Debra Kerr is a beautiful woman who portrays the poor Christian slave convincingly. It is so so convincing, you would think she was a devout Christian in her private life to her credit as an actress. Also the costumes deserve a five star rating!<BR>    The only negative thoughts to the film are the historial accuracies which reveal how  short of time the Christian persecution lasted. It didn't end with the end of Nero. Don't let this keep you from buying a great film  which does show some Roman and early Christian history and how Roman society existed during Nero's rule. I can't wait for the DVD production of this film. I only wish Hollywood would show films of this quality.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|I love the Beatles and these are some of their best songs, but I definitely wouldn't recommend this CD. Buy the red (Beatles/1962-1966) and blue albums (Beatles/1967-1970), yes its more expensive, but it has all these songs, plus a whole lot more.
B00005UKKF|5.0|Britney Spears may not be the best at singing live, but she got out there and performed like she is known for. When Your whipping you head and moving all the time like she does you try singing, trust me, i would rather hear prerecorded vocals. She did awesome, and she looked great, its nice to know she is not holding anything back, and regardless of what people have to say, she does not care. She has matured, and whether you like her or hate her, she is a damn good performer. I love you Britney!
0452282152|4.0|Girl With a Pearl Earring is an interesting fictional account of the life of a maid, Griet, as she works for the painter Vermeer and his household.  Even though I am not familiar with the painting or Vermeer, I've learned about some of his paintings and his favorite subject matters.  This book will especially interest you if you are a history buff or an art lover.<br />Griet tells the story in first person.  You feel her pain, her fear, her insecurities and her frustrations.  Her family forces her into servanthood after her father is stricken blind in a kiln accident.  She goes to work for the painter Vermeer.  Even though he is the man of the house, it is clear he does not run the house.  His wife, Catharina, and his mother-in-law, Maria Thins, are the true overseers of the house.  Catharina is perpetually pregnant, and the house is full of little girls.  One in particular, Cornilia, proves to be a handful.<br />The book educates the reader as it describes the life of a maid in the 17th century, as well as some of the notions and the culture of 17th century Holland.  I would have liked for the book to be longer, but the book is the perfect length for the story lines that are developed.  All of the story lines are completed, and I didn't find myself wanting to know more about certain characters.  <br />I look forward to reading Tracy Chevalier's other works.
B00004X01U|4.0|This is a step sideways--not forward--for Madonna, given the tremendous success of 'Ray of Light.'  Once again, she's taking a tried and true path and only marginally messing with the formula that made her previous release so popular, by taking leaves from Cher and Daft Punk, and signing William Orbit once again as the producer.<br />'Music' certainly sounds like leftover sessions from 'Ray of Light', but it needn't take any truck from hardcore fans (if there are any left), as it's got less filler than that album.  \\"Impressive Instant\\", \\"What it Feels Like for a Girl\\", the title track, \\"Paradise\\", and \\"Gone\\" are all strong choices for singles, and the copy I picked up came with a bonus VCD of remixes and the 'What it Feels...' video.<br />Even without this extra freebie, it's still worth picking up.
B000006045|2.0|Just sad... Mezzanine found me looking for inspired moments within the bass-and-crackle-laden \\"thump thump\\" of its mostly droning, sickeningly 'deep' little ditties... something I certainly never had to do when listening to 'Blue Lines' or 'Protection'.  I mean, let's face it: trip-hop is dead... Even todays exemplary bands are far too derivative to warrant the attention of anyone who is now old enough (I'm only 20) to have appreciated the earlier stirrings of this ultra-modern trend.  But if you must indulge yourself, 'Blue Lines' and 'Protection' are heady and thick with soul, rhythm, and outright 'groovability' -- not to mention  the lyrics on both ('Blue Lines' being a bit more concretely meditative than its successor), Shara Nelson's voice on the former, and Tracy Thorn's on the latter.  <br />Despite being, as a whole, merely tolerable, there are half-a-handfull of standouts:  Horace Andy's voice is obnoxious, infectious, and awesome; Liz Frazer, when louder/clearer than a traumatized bunny-wabbit, is haunting and generous... Still, at most, 'Mezzanine' is emotionless (and spare me the whole \\"Dude, that's the feeling they were trying to convey...\\" argument), brooding in an utterly lame early- to mid-90s way, and thoroughly unoriginal (any maladjusted teenager with a dimming strobe-light, Pro-Tools, and a collection of Suicide and Joy Division albums could have fashioned an album of equal, or more, imagination).<br />Alas, though, if currently wetting yourself over the ilk of  recent electronica-cum-trip-hop forays (i.e., Radiohead, latter-day Bjork, etc., etc.) and the according collabrative efforts therebetween (\\"cha-chinggg\\"), 'Mezzanine' is stocked at the front counter of your nearest college-campus convenience store for your listening delight.<br />Or... you could just buy it 'cause it's quicker than Valium.
B000002NJS|4.0|From the very beginning, I've never been a Madonna fan; although I have to give her props for creating some classic dancefloor singles, her tendency to create mass media junkets for shameless self-promotion (witness the debacle of her triple-wipeout \\"Erotica\\",\\"Sex\\" and \\"Body of Evidence\\" in '92... handing enough evidence for lifelong critics to prove what they'd been saying forever; she's overrated at best) pretty much turned me off time and time again.<br />But with the overlooked 'Bedtime Stories' (overproduced, but a step in the right direction), and especially 'Ray of Light', she began to make amends by keeping her mouth shut, staying somewhat out of the limelight, and releasing a solid album.<br />Not that 'Ray of Light' is perfect... there's more than its share of filler, but the singles are incredibly strong, simplistic, and focussed; something we can all appreciate when it's time to get on the good foot.  The title track was the monster club hit of the summer of '98, 'Frozen' was the little single that could (check it the Stereo MC's remix if you can; it's tremendous), and 'Candy Perfume Girl' completes the triple-base hit that's expected of any album's side 1.<br />As cynical as I am, I give Madonna a lot of credit for releasing this album.  It doesn't break any musical boundaries, but it hits the target it was aiming at.
0446608955|2.0|This book didn't resonate with me the way Sparks's other books did. Although it was sad, the characters didn't touch me enough to make me cry.  After reading Message in a Bottle I was really eager to watch the movie when it came out.  I have absolutely no interest in seeing A Walk to Remember - The Movie.

0671027573|5.0|This was my very first Linda Howard novel. I finished this book in one sitting and went out the next day to check out all her other books. The book had me laughing out loud, and yet was still able to keep me on the edge of my seat. <br />Jaine and Sam are fantastic characters and make a dynamic pair. They were both charming and funny. I loved their dialogues and how they interact with each other. Just writing about it makes me want to read it all over again!!
B00003CXN4|5.0|Eye-opening film about the drug trade led by a fine ensemble cast.  Benicio Del Toro richly deserved his Oscar as the underpaid Mexican cop; Catherine Zeta-Jones holds her own as a mother whose husband suddenly gets busted for his shady dealings with drug smugglers; and Michael Douglas shines as the politician who initiates an anti-drug campaign while his teen daughter gets hooked on crack right under his nose.  Fine camerawork, great performances, and a wittily-written screenplay makes this gritty drama worth not only a viewing but a purchase.
B000000P17|4.0|I think this is a great CD.  I bought the disc for SINCE I DON\\"T HAVE YOU, I've always liked that song.  My other favorite is HAIR OF THE DOG the NAZARETH remake.  Overall VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!
B00005RZV4|4.0|This is a great CD. When I picked it up I thought that it would be just like most other live albums...a waste of money. However as soon as the first song hits \\"terrible lie\\" you know this is something a little different. The sounds on this album are very harsh and broken almost making even the most harmonies songs like \\"the Frail\\" seem dark and twisted.  The sounds on here bring me back to the Broken and Downward Spiral album. <br />I gave this CD a four because of a few things. The first being that there is nothing new here. If you are a big NIN fan like I am you have heard many different versions of every song on here and you find that this just seems to be a collection of Trent's best work.(unfortunately \\"Were in this together now is not on here) Second of all I found that most of the songs on here did not sound as good as the ones on the normal CDs. It was little things like \\"Sin\\" that just did not have the same sound as the normal version.  I know this is a live album and things will not sound like they do on a studio CD but over all this is a good buy. <br />If you are not sure weather to get it or not I would suggest just giving it a shot. I just want a REAL NIN CD to come out soon.
0393312836|5.0|This book is crazy. Its the written version of the greatest film ever made, and looking at it on paper is quite a thing. The language is quite interesting, and you get in a real droog mindset through reading it, I've read very few things where I've felt like i was in the story, this one of them.
B00005QFE5|5.0|First, I completely agree with everyone who raves about this movie--it's one of the best I saw last year.<br />However, this DVD was supposed to contain both the widescreen and fullscreen versions of the movie.  As far as I can tell, there is no fullscreen version on this DVD.  I tried everything I could think of, including the angle button on my DVD remote, but it's just not there.  So, if you really want to have this movie in a fullscreen format, you are going to be disappointed if you get this DVD.  You may want to consider the VHS version instead.<br />Other than that, the DVD quality is quite good.  There's not much in the way of bonus features, but the picture and sound quality are quite good, and many people will probably not care that the full screen version is missing.
B000002J20|5.0|At the time when this record was released, and still to this day, many snobby rock critics have dismissed this work. But as any fan of Yes knows there is strong argument to be made for classifying this work as the absolute pinnacle of rock. The first side is tuneful. The second side is sweet. The third side is an astounding piece of work. The fourth side is profound. Till we're coming home again, our life seems like a fight. And until we know that people can appreciate this music, there is more work for us Yes fans to do.
B00005U122|5.0|Damn, I don't know where to start with this DVD. Although the extra documentary lasts 18 minutes, the concert has it all.<BR>Great music, an excellent setlist, man this concert is freacking great. You should buy it, and then thank me for it.
078401213X|1.0|I like (no, LOVE) arthouse movies.  But this one left me wondering what was the point ?<br />The basis of the plot was interesting - find a way to crack the stockmarket, using mathematical formulas.<br />That's the part on the cover that got me interested.   I wish there had been more information on the confusing way in which the rest of the movie was to be presented.  I wouldn't have bothered buying it.<br />For much of the movie, the lead performer is undergoing a nervous breakdown, due to the pressures he is facing from a corporate firm on Wall st, who want to crack the market, some Jews who want to work out the name of god (sounds like part of the story \\"the 1,000,000 names of god\\"), and his own pressure at finding out about Pi.<br />This is repeated too many times, and towards the end, I was hoping that he would go quickly, so the movie could end.<br />I know that many people have raved about how good this movie is, how clever the photography is, using different angles to present the information, but for me, it was too far out there.<br />I don't go for the \\"Julia Roberts\\" type movies, and this one was <BR>right at the opposite extreme of her type of movies.<br />Watch it on weekly rental from your video store and if you like it (and moreso, understand it), buy it, otherwise, move along, nothing to see here.
B00000IMCW|4.0|If you're a horror fan, chances are you've already seen this movie.  So I'll not be redundent and get into what most of the other reviewers have already said by issuing the much deserved platitudes.  <BR>    If you haven't seen this movie, do NOT run and rent it.  Contrary to what you may have already read, this movie is not for everyone.  For those of us who are horror fans and especially for those of us- even smaller in number- who are attracted to the sub-genre of zombie films this movie is the be-all-end-all of all reanimated-deceased cinema.  However, because this movie has made its way into the horror film canon, we've overlooked some of it shortcomings that might turn off people who just enjoy the occasional scary movie.  For example, it hasn't aged as well as most of would have liked.  I mean, most of the zombies are creepy, but a good number of them wear only the most splotchiest of blue (?) pancake.  The pacing is VERY slow by today's (or any day's really) standards.  Sure, we can say Romero was building tension, at times even making us forget that the Zombies even exist... But do we REALLY need to see Francine slather herself in make-up and make kissy faces at herself in a mirror with a colt .45?  <BR>     And yes, I agree that the acting is superb- but the characterization is not always consistent.  Is there really any indication that either Steven or Fran is in love with each other? Think about it.  <BR>     But I digress.  I wanted to express my disappointment with the actual DVD.  The digital technology is great; I couldn't live without DVD's, but sometimes the clean, digital picture disrupts the feel of the film.  Just like the \\"cleaning up\\" of Night Of The Living Dead removed the atmospheric, documentary-like graininess of that film, the digitization detracts from the quality of Dawn. (It's no fun when you can see the squibs before they go off.)  <BR>    The added scenes are lame.  They really don't add much to the picture-except to possibly augmentthe already mundane \\"anyone got a cigarette?\\" joke.  <BR>    But most disappointing are the extra features.  The trailer is ok, but for the most part standard with all DVD's.  The Monroeville Mall commercial is clever and oddly eerie.  But the dropped scenes blow.  They're weakness is magnified by the preface describing that overseas scenes were removed because they were too gory and then we get scenes of dialogue!  Dialogue is fine, but don't mislead us with that lousy introduction. We already bought the damn thing at that point, so what are you trying to sell?  <BR>     There are certainly DVD's out there with weaker bonus features than Dawn, but is that an excuse? So much more could have been done. When are we going to be able to see the fabled dual-suicide alternate ending? And would a commentary hurt?  You can't tell me that David Emge (or any of the other stars for that matter) is too busy to sit down for two hours and talk about his film.  <BR>     Please understand that the majority of this criticism of this particular DVD stems from my true appreciation for the movie.  I want to see more.  And I'm sure there is plenty more to show somewhere but I'm not sure why it is not available to the fans.  Unless, of course, the decision makers at Anchor Bay are pulling a George Lucas and plan to re-release a \\"very special limited edition\\" with about four minutes of tacked on extra-material every 6 months for us to buy.
B00005OAIE|5.0|i first heard this cd when i was christmas shopping, they played it overhead at the music store, and i asked who it was.  they said, &quot;john mayer&quot;, and i bought their last copy of his room for squares........needless to say i've been hooked ever since.  yes, it's a &quot;feelgood&quot; cd, but more than that.  every song relays significant emotions of everyday life....3X5 reminds me of being lonely.  It's as if he's on the road trying to describe to a loved one how wonderful and sad being on the road can be.   Lonely in that they cannot share the beautiful scenery or special moments with him. (Just as if you would want them there to share the scenery or experiences and feelings with you at your side, no more 3by5's ).....83 makes me laugh and cry at the same time, it reminds me of my childhood, I can relate to the whole song, i miss my brother(s and sisters)everyday, and make me a red cape too.......makes you wanna fly away back to yesteryear....John succeeded into drawing me into his songs, i become emotionally entwined with the messages he suggests. i could go on, but won't....if you are sentimental, romantic and funloving, and younghearted all at once, you will love this cd.  I like it so much, i plan to buy it for my 2 older brothers and my mom.  and i'm 40! if you like kenny rankin, or michael franks with a touch of sting and dave matthews, then you'll love this, it's a jazzy-poppy-romantic-heartwarming-humorous-folksy collabortion of tunes.  It's too hard to put in words, you just gotta hear it for yourself.  By the way, I have an array of musical interests, from Sting to Cindy Morgan to Lyle Mays to Dixie Chicks to Jars of Clay to Dave Matthews to Out of the Grey....Happy listening..Can't wait for his next cd!
B000021XS0|4.0|I haven't been a dream theater fan for a long time or anything, but I wanted to see what all the hype was about so i got this album. The instrumentals are very good, but I think a lot of the way he sings, the lyrics, and the whole storyline behind this concept album is corny. And I really don't like the slower songs. The songs I Enjoy listening to most is \\"Overature 1928\\", \\"The Dance of Eternity\\", and \\"Finally Free\\".

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Visually stunning, \\"Moulin Rouge\\" mixes elements of drama, theater and music in ways that perhaps no other film has ever achieved.  Part \\"Wizard of Oz,\\" part \\"Shakespeare In Love\\" this is an original vision from director Baz Luhrman, who has isngle-handledly invented his own style with this one-of-a-kind film.  Sure, there are moments that make little or no sense -  nonsense in fact - but you'll be entertained in brash, unexpected ways that perhaps you never thought you'd experience on film.  I was startled, cajoled and shaken at times, frustrated to miss little details that on repeat viewing make some parts make sense, but always drawn into a roller coaster ride that bears little resemblence to anything ever put on screen, and yet owes plenty to other musical and non musical classics.  <br />The revelation here is Ewan McGregor, who seems to be channeling Orson Welles and Robert Downey Jr. at times, but who succeeds beyond all my wildest expectations as an actor, a singer, a performer, and proptagonist.  Nicloe Kidman is grand, and beautiful beyond words, with ravishing red hair that sweeps down her graceful back and costumes that set off her famous curves in new almost non-human ways.  Both are chameleons as actors, and both deserve tremendous credit for taking on these characters who are colorful yet remote.  The supporting cast is tremendous, especially Jim Broadbent.  John Leguizamo's turn as Toulousse-Latreque, while intriguing, is the only sore spot.  His lisp is unnerving and doesn't serve the plot or character one bit (his parts I found were superfulous anyways.)<br />Other than McGregor (again, phenomenal as the writer Christian) the film soars by being both oddly foreign (no one's ever seen anything like this before) and innately familiar at once (at times, you can practically recite the script.)  What Luhrman has done - other than create a masterpiece that will be analyzed and dissected for eons - is to bring pop culture to the plot, via well known songsthat Boomers, Gen X'ers and Y'ers all know by heart.  \\"Come What May\\" the central theme and practically only new song even feels familiar, with its shades of every Broadway musical you've ever loved, from \\"Phantom\\" to \\"Miss Saignon\\" to \\"Les Miz.\\"  <br />If you dream in Technicolor, your nightscapes will surely be enhanced by this unforgettable film, which must take its place beside the most innovative films of all time, from the \\"Wizard\\" to Kubricks \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" from a Spike Lee Joint to a Speilberg spectacular.  Hats off to Baz Lurhman for creating a spectacle that eludes easy classification, in  fact, one that creates its own unique category of film.  You'll find yourself wondering how he achieved this vision, and whether mind altering drugs had anything to do with it (it recalls a great and evil acid trip of the Timothy Leary sort.)  To be sure, any viewer who resists may find themselces frustrated by the quick edits and tornado-like sequences, but let it ride folks.  This is pure movie magic, and destined to be a singular sensation, a landmark achievement in filmmaking that, if you let it, will sweep you away in time and then bring you back to the present before you can say \\"Moulin Rouge!\\"
B00005RDRO|5.0|This is the best movie ever!<BR>It's really funny, and your friends will be glad you made them watch it with you.<br />If you see one DVD this year, it should be this.  And you should try and see some more.
B00003CX96|4.0|I'm thrilled \\"Breaking Away\\" is finally joining the DVD ranks, even if little extras haven't been added.  This is a film worth viewing repeatedly, especially for anyone who has ever felt like they don't belong, or were the last ones picked for the team.  A true modern fable where the underdog wins, \\"Breaking Away\\" feels like an Olympic moment every time I see it...you find yourself rooting for the Cutters and tripping over yourself to help the lead character with his Italian.  Funny, warm and enchanting, this is a family film classic with heart that proves once and for all that sometimes, the best man does win!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Of all the movies of 2001, this is the one I keep returning to. Everytime I watch it I find I see more layers of richness and detail and I find more emotional depth. It's a simple story, but deliberately so, like all the great myths. It turns instantly from broad comedy to romance to poignance and tragedy, sometimes mixing them all simultaneously. There are hundreds of cultural references in this movie, each one adding a mosaic chip of power and emotion to the whole. Take \\"Like a Virgin\\" for instance; you have the waiters' dance from \\"Hello Dolly\\" combined with a dark Satanic vision of sexual evil combined with Jim Broadbent's hysterically looney drag pantomime to deceive and frustrate the lustful Duke intercut with Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's  love story racing toward its tragic climax. This film-making is bold, brilliant, moving, complex and so original that it will change the movie musical forever. It's the first film masterpiece of the 21st century. (Plus the music is great, and how can you not love a movie where John Leguizamo plays Toulouse Leautrec as a parody of Sister Wendy?)
0783243499|1.0|This movie seems (based on the reviews) to be loved by people who think that it's a story of a serial killer that sends up 80's materialism, or who think that it's a moving psychological study of a psycho who doesn't actually commit any murders, but whose vacuity represents 80's culture.  Both views are deeply flawed.  <br />If the main character really is committing the murders, then the story line is completely irrational, as there is no explanation for the disappearance of the bodies he has been storing, and no explanation of why his lawyer would insist at the end that one of his victims was alive.  In other words, if he really is a murderer, the film makes no sense.<br />If the main character is only imagining the murders, then there is no explanation for the detective investigating the murder of Paul Allen (and what happens to him, anyway?), no explanation for how he comes to have a key to Paul Allen's apartment when he comes back to discover it cleaned and painted, and no explanation for why Paul Allen's apartment would have been vacated in the first place, if (as the lawyer insists) he is still alive.  In other words, if he is only imagining the murders, the film makes no sense.<br />So, watch the first 45 minutes for their cinematic style, then turn it off -- unless you choose to view the movie as random images, you will be frustrated to find that there is no plot, many apparent issues remain unresolved, and there is no overarching meaning that is capable of being understood.
0440224764|5.0|I have read a total of 4 Grisham books: The Pelican Brief, The Testament, The Street Lawyer, and most recently The Partner.  I just finished it tonight.  I simply couldn't put it down, and I rarely say that.  This is by far the best of the four, though I have not read all of his books yet but plan to do so.  Why does everyone hate the ending?  At first I was shocked, but then I realized how much better it made the story(I won't give it away).  Unlike his other novels I have read, I found virtually nothing boring in this book.  It was written so well it is amazing.  I don't see how anyone could not enjoy this book.
B0000508U6|5.0|I don't know where these guys come from, didn't hold on to the case long enough to know what they look like but I like it.Coldplay are one of the many bands that just dont get the props they deserve. Try Coldplay on hour drives up the coast with a carmel apple cider and the heater on low and just listen. Dont sing along, dont try to mimic the outstanding guitar playing, just listen! The cd can play the whole way through and I still play it one more time! I dont have a favorite song because I get different feelings about each song every time I hear it. Right now as I play &quot;We never change&quot; I wanna fly and never come down and live my and have friends around-listening to Coldplay!
0440180295|4.0|i know im going to enrage a lot of diehard vonnegut fans out there, but i honestly dont think this book is the holy grail its made out to be. its entertaining, original, funny, and even a little educational, but there are better books out there that have gotten less word-of-mouth advertisement. i liked, and i highly recommend it, but not as the modern-classic end-all-beat-all. that honor, in my humble opinion, belongs to thomas pynchon for Gravity's Rainbow.
B00005MP58|5.0|This was the best Jane Austen production of all time and that is really because never has there been a better Darcy portrayal.Who could not fall in love with this man? The cast gave new meaning to their characters. Perfect performances all around, but I must say again that no one has ever done Darcy as I imagined him to be until Colin Firth, goreous!

6305265488|5.0|&quot;Ever After: A Cinderella Story&quot; redefines the terms of a &quot;fairy tale&quot;.  The story is actually a flashback from the great-grandaughter of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, who is actually named Danielle.  The story opens with eight-year-old Danielle's father returning with her new stepmother and stepsisters.  The very next day, Danielle's father leaves the manor and dies of a heart attack before passing the gates.  Ten years later, Danielle has been reduced to nothing more than a servant, while her stepfamily lives the life of luxury.  One day, the prince steals one of Danielle's horses and is brutally hit by Danielle.  When he is recognized by her, he pays her a large sum to keep her silence.  With that money, Danielle dresses as a courtier and frees Mauriece, a servant the Baroness (her stepmother) sold to pay taxes.  When the prince sees her, she gives him an alias: Comtess Nicole de Lancret.  The king tells the prince that he will host a masque and either choose his bride before that night or he will marry a Spanish princess.  Now that the masque is approaching, Danielle is rushing here and there to see the prince, but to make sure that her family doesn't discover her.  And to make matters worse, the Baroness is trying extra hard to make sure that her daughter, Marguerite, weds the prince.  On the night of the masque, the Baroness discovers Danielle's charade and locks her in the cellar.  How will Danielle escape and get to the masque?  With &quot;Nicole&quot; not there, who will the prince choose to marry?  All of your questions will be answered after you take in the classic &quot;Ever After: A Cinderella Story.&quot;
B00004X01U|3.0|..it just requires a little digging.  Madonna is a brand name. You're being marketed to, and it's time you faced that fact.  If all you know is what's on the charts, then you're seriously deprived.  Do a little research...and please don't take so much stock in the fact that so many contemporary critics give Madonna so much leeway.  They have to find something good to say about such a phenomenon, and they play right into her money-grubbing little hands.<br />This CD is at best &quot;good of kind.&quot;  But what's the &quot;kind&quot;?  Conjob pop is what it is.  And Madonna is laughing at you all the way to the World Bank.
B00005QIPH|3.0|After several listens I upped the mark from 2 stars to 3 on this one as there are actually 4 excellent tunes on the CD and none<BR>of the cuts [are really poor]. On first listen I hated it, mostly due to the inredibly inept comparisons to Velvet Underground, Television, and The Stooges. There are a few spots that sound like V.U. but very little Television and NO Stooges. In fact, this music is so cute and pretentious, such a non-spontaneous bundle of fraternity boy blather that it in fact embodies everything that the Stooges were NOT. I've been avidly collecting music for 25 years and read thousands of reviews every year and this is BY FAR the most [ludicrous] comparison of bands I have ever heard. These guys are the anti-Stooges. However, once taken on it's own merits the CD isn't that bad but is more correctly categorized \\"pop\\" than rock. <BR>The most accurate comparison I've seen is to early Kinks... check out a band called \\"Burning Bridges\\" and their CD \\"Fall of the Plastic Empire\\". These guys REALLY sound like the Stooges.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park have made a striking debut with HYBRID THEORY. It isn't rap/metal in the same way as Limp Bizkit. In fact, they don't sound anything like Limp Bizkit; they have a new, fresh sound all their own. It's so recognizable that, after I had heard &quot;One Step Closer&quot; and &quot;Crawling&quot; a few times each on the radio, I knew that it was Linkin Park when I first heard &quot;In The End&quot;. (At that point, enough was enough and I had to buy the CD.) Their sound is recognizable without ever being repetitious, quite a remarkable feat for such a young band.<br />I played the entire CD and found not one bad song on it. Most songs are very good, and some of them are great. I still love &quot;In The End&quot; the most, because I love how they interweave Mike Shinoda's fluid rapping and Chester Pennington's emotional, anguished lead singing so seamlessly in it. Also, I feel it makes such important statements about life that I can really relate to it. Of course, I also love the jagged-edged &quot;One Step Closer&quot;; again, I can relate to past feelings of being pushed &quot;one step closer to the edge&quot;, and &quot;about to break&quot;! I've also screamed &quot;shut up when I'm talking to you&quot; many times before--but we won't go there. The song &quot;Crawling&quot; is a perfect combination of Linkin Park's edgy metal grind on the choruses with surprisingly soft and lush Savage Garden-sounding vocals and music on the verses. They pull this seemingly impossible feat off with aplomb. Other notable tracks include the opener &quot;Papercut&quot;, &quot;By Myself&quot; and &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot;, although honestly every song on this CD is good and displays the band's talent for blending sharp guitar-oriented rock with cool, textured beats.<br />I think that right now Linkin Park is in the position of being one of the more important bands of the new millennium, and I look forward to hearing them as they grow through the coming years. Of course, I'm sure that the band members have no pretensions at all about the future--in the end, it doesn't even matter! :)
B00003CXTG|2.0|all the women in our little home audience liked this movie while I gotta admit it made me absolutely VOMIT ....... <br />This movie has NO idea what it wants to be; is it a war movie, well there are war parts somewhat disjointed though; is it a love story, well supposedly not since it's called Pearl Harbour rather than 'Conquering Love during Pearl Harbour' ...... <br />Even as a soppy love movie, it stinks, the scenes are contrived, and when they tried to make our sodier boys look like they came from the back country, instead they made them look totally stupid. Even the gratuitous stutterer cast in the movie as comic relief, I think, was totally, I mean totally unfunny. I mean , if anyone was looking for a remake of 'An Officer and a Gentleman' please please ... forget it ... that was a great movie and it made sense ...... <br />By the way on the technical side, I thought the Dolby 5.1 sounded a little washed out and hey give me a break they put and enhanced ide screen on this DVD not an actual wide screen ... what I got was wide screen of the letterbox format .... so lame .... I guess they ran out of money .... <br />If you can leave your brain at home you may enjoy it otherwise give it a pass and save your money .....
B00005TT77|5.0|This is a great CD if you like Beatles at all. The artists singing these songs are VERY good and you'll probably find a new artist that you'll love. (Rufus Wainwright is my new find. These artists do put a new shine on great songs. I an very glad I bought it!
1878424319|5.0|I first heard of this book on Oprah and I had to check it out.  Don Miguel Ruiz gives us four simple agreements to follow to make ourselves happier and fill us spiritually.  While reading this book, the ideas sound so simple, yet profound.  For anyone who is looking to better themselves or trying to attain inner peace, I suggest this book.  I have read it time and again!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I totally disagree with Dr. Ravna's cruel and unusual review. i saw this movie in the theater and thought it was wonderful and that both main actors were wonderful singers. The way the director shot this film was marvoulus. The part where they first go to the Moulin Rouge was just many quick three second shots! I hope this movie wins many Academy Awards and it already won 3 Golden Globes. So if you are thinking of see this movie, RUN out to the nearest rental store and pick up a copy!
0425107469|5.0|I absolutly loved this novel. I think out of all the amazing books Dean Koontz has written this is my absolute favorite. His use of description is great in all of his books. This one takes on a bit differen't approach to the story line. Its not the usuall hit and run or bad vs. good story. I think that if you choose any book to read this one should at least be on your list of Dean Koontz books. GO READ IT!
6305165912|5.0|There is one main reason to watch this movie. That reason is the incredible acting. John Goodman as the Vietnam veteran, Walter, is one of the funniest characters I have ever seen on film. Jeff Bridges' portrayal of The Dude was amazing. When ever I first watched this movie I didn't know what to expect. Well, I can say I laughed me a** off the whole time. My friends and I watched the scene where Walter rolls out of the car five times. Its one of the best scene in the whole movie. The plot is pretty confusing. It involves kidnapping, the porno industry, and above all bowling. I don't reccomend this movie to everyone though. If you like a comedy film that bites back then go ahead, watch it. Its a comedic masterpiece. Its one of the Coen bros. best films. As I was saying if you are easily offended, I wouldn't recommend watching it. Anyway, I theink its a great movie that is definintley worth buying.
B000003S0I|5.0|This album changed my life.  I didn't think music could sound this way.  But it can!  This has been the gateway to tons of great music, led by this giant avant rock record.  Thank you John, Robert, Bill, David.  Thank you so much.

1564029654|5.0|Bill and Percy and Sarah wake in the night to find their Mommy has gone.  At first they are sure she will come back, but as time passes they all become a little worried.  They think.  They worry.  They spread out.  They huddle together.  And after a while, Mommy comes home.<br />This is a nice book to help little ones deal with separation and worry, or a good read for animal lovers or kids who are afraid of animals.  The illustrations of these wide-eyed little creatures are heartwarming.  A good snuggle book.
B00005JKQX|5.0|I absolutely loved this film, as I have loved all of Russell Crowe's movies!  I own them all (and believe me, there are many).  They cover a vast range of situations, personalities and styles.  It is true, some are more worthy than others, but Russell's ability to create a new person, a distinct individual, who stays with you in each character he portrays, keeps me hooked on anything he does.  I can't wait to add this to my collection and I am greedy...I want more!  I am glad Russell is so young and never quite satisfied with his work because that means he will keep producing for years to come. Go Russell!  I like his music too!  Can you tell I'm a fan?
B00005R2IS|5.0|I am very pleased with the job they did in releasing this DVD. I never bought the original on DVD, because it was dubbed, had a lot of video artifact, and no added features. The Special Edition has a great commentary track, the original trailers and a couple of featurettes. The video transfer looks excellent to me, and the 5.1 soundtrack is great! I bought a VHS tape with Mel Gibson's original dialog, but the video quality was awful. This gives me the best of both. I strongly recommend the Special Edition DVD to any Mad Max fan. (Make sure you get the new one, there is another, authorized &quot;Mad Max&quot; DVD available)
B000002GA8|4.0|One of my earliest musical memories is of listening to my parent's copy of this album. At the age I was listening to this, I also had a several \\"learn-to-read\\" comic books that had an accompanying 45 that characterized the words in the book. I treated \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\" and its full-sized LP liner notes (sadly missing from CD release) like one of those books, and read along. During the instrumental sections, I fantasized about the feelings and interactions of the characters as the narrator unfolded the plot.<br />As I grew older, I stopped listening to it, and I don't think it ever really registered that the album was by a guy named Rick Wakeman. How strange is it then, that a decade later I would be exposed Yes' catalog, and consequently Wakeman, by way of \\"90125\\"? There's probably a paper in there somewhere about exposure to music and how it shapes the musical tastes of young minds, but it should be written and printed elsewhere.<br />The immediately relevant point is that I have a unique perspective on \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\". At such a young age, I had no problem digesting the lyrics to this album. It's easily  digestible, all-visual lyric approach was fertile ground for my young imagination.  However, when I rediscovered it in High School, I found myself needing to forgive a lot of the lyrics and the vocal performances. I think I had outgrown them. In addition, vocalists Garry Pickford-Hopkins and Ashley Holt epitomize long-haired, post-hippie, Uriah Heep-sounding, '70's sensitive-macho-male vocal stylings. By today's standards, they come off as embarrassing. In fact, when backed by musical atmosphere, I think Jules Verne's narrative s more convincing than the sung lyrics.<br />However, Rick Wakeman became my favorite keyboardist of all time. Whether you like him or not, it cannot be argued that Rick is in top form as a player and composer on this album. His creativity, musical concept, and unbridled raw playing ability shines through here. The second that the vocalists stop singing and Rick is in front, the quality of the performance is mesmerizing. Any person that can identify the sounds in Wakeman's keyboard arsenal can hear some of the most aggressive, unique, and passionate rock keyboards ever captured on record.<br />\\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" is quite mighty and impressive in its scope. Made during Yes' \\"solo record\\" period, of all of them it is probably the most distinctive and adventurous. It's a live recording of a musical adaptation of the Jules Verne book by the same name. Its instrumentation includes your basic rock guitar, bass, and drums, two vocalists, a percussionist, a full orchestra, and a full choir. In the seventies, when stage sound was not as advanced as it is today, such an undertaking was unheard of and probably considered at least crazy, if not impossible. Rick tried it though, and actually toured with this instrumentation quite extensively. All of the orchestral bits are extremely well-composed and powerful, and barring some very minor performance inconsistencies they stand very well on their own. It should be noted that the orchestra probably couldn't hear a note of what Rick Wakeman's band was playing, so one should probably forgive the occasional cracked or out-of-tune note.<br />As long as no one is singing (choir notwithstanding), the music on \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\" is compositionally exceptional and inexplicable. Thematic use, arrangement, and orchestration are all of the highest quality. The introduction and overture section at the beginning is fantastically majestic and well-orchestrated. Personally, my favorite part of the whole thing is the first three minutes of the \\"second side\\", referred to as \\"The Battle\\". As in many other orchestral/rock collaborations, \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\" does not really integrate the two. The orchestra and choir will play a section, then the rock group will play, but generally they do not blend. A big factor of this interaction is most assuredly the limitations of the live performance, and Rick obviously considered this during its composition. However, on \\"The Battle\\", we get closer to integration than on the rest of the album. The band, orchestra, and choir interact very convincingly. In addition to this, Rick's keyboard part is blisteringly intense, mind-bogglingly fast, and completely relaxed. Even the vocal melody is relatively accessible here, although the lyrics still come off as a little infantile.<br />The lowdown: \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" represents what could probably be considered the greatest strengths of '70's then-progressive now-symphonic rock, as well as some of its greatest pitfalls. It's is quite bold and very adventurous and can make for great listening, if the listener can just forgive the vocals.blend.

0800128052|5.0|I echo the other reviewers who pointed out, this is not a movie about football.  It is about the triumph over bad odds...  About not settling for less than what your dreams contain...  About playing with a much better hand than the hand you were dealt.  I could relate with this movie very much because my life has been very similar to Rudy's.  And on another note, I was so happy to see that a major motion picture gave Sean Astin another chance to shine in &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot;  He's a wonderful, sincere actor whose greatest triumphs are yet to come.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This album is achingly beautiful.  Though wrapped in a package of lush strings, at it's heart is the soulful jazz style of Ms. Krall.  <br />Though much has been written here about her singing (which is at once sultry and sophisticated, plaintiff and jazzy), little has been said about her piano playing, which is first rate.  She can be swingy, even during ballads, and sensitive even when swinging.  She is one of the few musicians who understands that the space between the notes is as important as the notes themselves, and she &quot;plays the spaces&quot; with as much style as the music itself.  <br />This album is a wonderful compliment to her other albums.  Though the others may include more up-tempo numbers, this CD showcases her impecable way around more sensitive tunes.<br />For those who say Ms. Krall is only successful because of her beauty, I would like to go on record saying, though classically beautiful, Diana Krall is not my type.  But her music DEFINATELY is.
B000009DUY|5.0|The trumpets that open 'Revisiting Normandy' announces us the beginning of Steven Spielberg's war drama &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.  The opening sequence, when Tom Hanks' troops dissembark on Omaha Beach during D-Day, is perhaps the most complex ever seen from Spielberg's works.  Too bad the rest of the movie falls into the typical view on human life that the director has: good guys and bad guys, none of them lies in between.  However, this gives John Williams to create one of his most emotional and intimate scores ever.<br />'Hymn To The Fallen' is definitely the highlight of this CD.  An elegy created for those who died during the battle in Normandy.  It's very touching, and the notes just flow richly, supported by a chorus that flows along with the orchestra.  One of Williams' best themes.  It's quite difficult for me to hate this score because you get to like every single note from it.  Even those cues where suspense in present such as 'Battle Preparations' and 'The Last Battle', which makes you feel you are in the battle field.  Another interesting thing about this movie is that Williams didn't -according to Spielberg in the liner notes of this album -want to write music for the opening sequence in order to avoid sentimentality on a gruesome situation, and I totally agree because I felt that the sound effects carried that scene neatly; a scene where you see bullets leaving soldiers in a blood pool.<br />John Williams has done it again.  One great score that touches our hearts and pays respect to those heroes who fought and died during the wars.  One score that stands alone.  One that is better than the film for which it was written.
0393317552|5.0|I have just finished this astonishing book and am amazed at how much I learned.  It was an easy read full of detail regarding our earth, we people and how through some fundamental random apportioning of resources, different histories for different peoples evolved.  His charts and explanations were compelling.   He showed no bias, but rather gave us the details of how nature was complicate in creating certain advantages for certain groups.  It is significant to get the overall picture in this important time.   Highly recommended.
B00005AAFS|5.0|i like rammstein because they are so cool
B00005ATQ9|1.0|After the success of A Clockwork Orange Kubrick made this dud. It is based on a minor Thackery novel about a man who aquires wealth but is not accepted by the landed gentry. He spends huge amounts of money trying to get a title, and in the end loses everthing including a leg. Yes it has no contemporary relevance to anything. <br />The strong point of the film is the photography. The sets, the costumes are all great. However it is like a slow moving tableau rather than a film. The things which make films interesting are some plot, a bit of pace and maybee some issues which are interesting. <br />This film seems to go for at least three hours, maybee it goes for two. It is hard to work up any enthusiasm for the hero as he is such a groveller to the upper class. I mean other people did different things in the time it was set. They could enter politics, go to India or write small satyrical journals. Lyndon just slobs around and gets upset about his non acceptance. <br />The humour is also dreadful. As a service to humanity all existing copies of the DVD should be destroyed.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This movie is beautifully filmed and wonderfully cast.  Ewan does a great job portraying the charming and naïve Christian. And, it is a treat to hear him sing  he has a beautiful voice.  He also looks better than usual  those mohawk haircuts he opts for in real life do not do him justice. Nicole Kidman was outstanding as Satine.  She showed a strong range of emotions and her voice is lovely.  She deserved to win a Golden Globe, and she was gracious in later saying she wanted to share the award with Ewan, who lost out in his category.  Im disappointed that Come What May hasnt won any awards to date, and that the Academy did not allow it on its ballot. It wouldve been wonderful to see Nicole and Ewan sing it together.  Oh well, thanks Baz for the romantic escapism that is Moulin Rouge.  I play my video regularly to enjoy the Moulin Rouge experience as often as possible.
B00005RZV4|4.0|So OK, granted Trent and the band prove that they can perform with the best of them. They put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into each and every song, but, did someone forget to do a decent job at mixing the CD?  I love NIN and always have, but the chopped off beginning and endings drive me nuts.  It's like they downloaded these songs using a file sharing proggy.  (All you former Napster users know exactly what I mean...)  Whatever happened to fade in, fade out?  That aside, if you are a true NIN fan, this CD is a must have.  They are definitely one of the best live bands out there.  Their music has heart, soul and that extra something that gets the blood pumping.
0446608955|5.0|After hearing about the movie, i talked with a few friends and decided to read the book before watching the movie.  Keeping an open mind as to the nature of the story, I wasn't sure what to expect because the story was labeled as a &quot;chick book.&quot;  After reading the first chapter, i couldn't put it down.  The story was great, and i enjoyed Nicholas Sparks' humor inserted all throughout the novel.   A great read, funny, sentimental, and dramatic all rolled into one.  I recommend it without reserve.
