B0083SBJXS|5.0|I love it in the theatre.  I love it on Blu Ray.  A great action movie.  I would recommend it to anyone with a pulse.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry Birds is a great game! But what's with the circus? That's not a season why can't you just make a nouther virsion? Also why pay real money  for power up' s why can't you just do points? Beside' s that AWESOMELY AMAZINGLY AWESOME GAME!!!!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This show is just flat out enjoyable.  Good cast.  Interesting plots.  Well-written.  It was cancelled too early.  I tried it on a whim and now I am hooked.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|20 or more words required (ducks in the road) Whew! Hard to type on this tablet...O.J.'s two goons come to mind...
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|another album you can listen to all the way through without skipping any songs.  Great creativity from the guys!  My favorite tracks are Unbelievers, Step, Ya Hey, Obvious Bicycle - - the last one will seem strange at first but after a few listens you will be obsessed, and walking around saying \\"LIIIISTEEEEN\\" to everyone you come into contact with!
B006PW0F52|4.0|I like Dan Ariely´s style very much. He explains research in a very accesible and entertaining way. After reading his books one almost can jump into the academic world of behavioural economics.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is so awesome that you have to get it it has a lot of cool dragons and stuff
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game kept me busy for a few nights .  As far as hidden pictures go it had a lot of them.  The other puzzles were not as fun t o mebut over all a really good game.
B005KJJ4F8|3.0|It was a pretty awesome read with a very good idea behind it but I got the impression that some of it was made up as the author went along. I absolutely hated the cliffhanger. Felt more let down than anything else. With that being said, I absolutely love Cinder and have a huge crush on Kai!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a very nice app! You cannot go as in depth as the pc version, but it's still functional.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis becomes the man. It is a balanced portrayal of Mary Todd  and the marriage she had with Lincoln.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Loved the way each character was wound into this story can't wait for movie! Recommend to all zombie genre fans
193700788X|3.0|*****Just a WARNING, there may be SPOILERS in this review! Don't read if you want to be surprised!******************<br /><br />Overall, the book was just \\"OK.\\" I found myself just trying to get through the story and not really enjoying it much. I agree with many who have said that the books generally have not been that exciting since Book 9. I saw the whole Sam HEA coming a few books ago (and especially after the novella), but I kept telling myself that Ms. Harris wouldn't (COULDN'T) be that predictable. Alas, I was wrong. Or maybe I was just in denial. Either way, she ended up with the safe and awfully boring guy. After all of her adventures, she's still a waitress at Merlotte's. She's still living in Bon Temps, and we don't really know if she will end up with Sam in the long term. Having said that, Sookie is a simple person with simple taste. She didn't want to be turned, she wanted a family, and she wanted to live out her human life in a relatively \\"normal\\" way. Sam was the only choice that really made sense in light of these facts. Quinn or Alcide may have fit, but Ms. Harris assassinated those characters several books ago. I am a huge Eric fan, but I didn't necessarily want Sookie to end up with him. I knew it wasn't going to work - he's too \\"larger than life\\" (to use Sookie's own words) and she was too small-minded. Having said that, I at least wanted a nicer ending for Eric and for their relationship. There were so many other ways Ms. Harris could have gone with this. Maybe if Eric had stood up to Freyda? Not because he and Sookie would be together, but for his own dignity? He just ended up looking like a spineless worm who does what he's told. That's never been Eric, IMHO. I think there was a way to move Eric and Sookie in opposite directions without completing destroying Eric's character. Oh well. What's done is done.<br /><br />Could I name any positives? Well, I am happy that Sookie seemed content by the last page of the book. And it looks like Bill hada nice HEA with Karin. Oh yeah - and Pam becoming Sheriff of Area 5 was pretty awesome!
B007FIY3VW|4.0|This does what I want.  I've only used the Word so far and have will try to use both the Excel and Powerpoint shortly.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|I originally found this game just browsing around. It loomed like it could be interesting and kind of a time filler. Once you start off you are already in the action. The graphics are great for a mobile device( tablet, phone etc.). It is a very iteractive game. This game is great especially for the price. If you are looking for a good war game that's not going to cost this is definitely that game.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app!  I can finally fall asleep. It does need a timer though, I often awake to what knocked me out in the first place. Pleasant and all, but drains my battery all night. Love sleeping! Wooten woot
B00006AG5N|5.0|good ,good, good music,and when he came back from four years and returned with burning love and suspicious minds wow!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Excellent books and the best way to get them as a four pack bundle. The writing and characters are fantastic. Got me back into reading.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Harry Bosch never fails to be the best detective it was a good story with lots of twists & turns, but Harry came through in the end
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|it was really fun untill it had to do an update and now it wont let me on it keeps saying cant download content at this time
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|This man is amazing - such a visionary. This world is certainly a different place thanks to his existence. Thoroughly recommended!
B00B5A9FLY|2.0|I normally do not write reviews, although I purchase and watch a LOT of DVD - TV sets... but this was SUCH a DISAPPOINTMENT, I had to speak up. I wish I had stopped watching Merlin at the end of Season 4. That one was beautiful and actually ended quite well. But in this 5th season, it's like the writers did not know what to do with the story arc and went off the rails! Some episodes were TOO BIZARRE for belief!  I won't do spoilers.... just a warning: BEWARE: this is NOT the Merlin you got to know and love in seasons 1-4!<br /><br />I would also note that the quality of the discs as they  played went down in my season 4 set, and worse in season 5, with odd \\"scan lines\\" across the faces of the actors if they moved more actively in mid range view scenes. I have no idea why this is, unless they were trying to save money on production? I wonder if others of you noticed this?
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|So far, so good. THANKS!<br />Love the separate notebook organization.<br />Wanted something easy to use and found it. Good product.
B0094K1MH2|2.0|This got such good reviews, but after 15 minutes I stopped watching. I like animated films, but this is one of those annoying realistic looking animated movies. Story was boring.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Only problem is it sometimes freezes or won't update correctly! I play it all the time and the levels get more challenging all the time
157421327X|5.0|I have been studying the art on youtube and so forth so this really was backtracking for me, but for someone new to zentangles it is a great text. I do wish it was thicker with more basic patterns.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|I thought this game was going to be pretty good, or at least moderate when I saw the description and the screenshots, BUT! What it doesn't tell you is that once you download the whole thing after buying it and want to get rid of it to make room, YOU CAN'T DELETE THE GYGABITE OF DATA YOU HAAAAAD TO DOWLOAD!! I would have ranked lower since the graphics seemed like something out of sonic, but I guess I have to wait to rank -5. If the producers do fix this for other people though, that would be fantastic.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|That's a bummer! But just search the web for martian andy weir ebook and go to the link associated with NASA.  Boom get it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is so clever, clean and beautifully executed that you should immediately upgrade to the premium version.  Ipnosoft needs to be encouraged to do more of this work!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft so much because there endless fun, I love playing with friends online. I can't wait for 0.6.2 because there will be buckets,eggs,cake,and servers you can buy.
034580404X|5.0|I haven't read in years and this trilogy will be responsible for me reading on a very regular basis from now on. All 3 books are very well written, easy to read and hard to put down until  finished.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I would recommend this dvd to anyone who likes Rhinna. She has a great voice. When I have a bad day at work I come home and listen to it.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Awe inspiring...amazing .....a virtual portrait of music...what can I say..this is Rod in 70's form....this album takes me back to \\"Foot Loose and Fancy Free\\"...the best Rod in a very long time.
B002EHLNLC|5.0|I cant believe how many years have passed since i bought the original copy of this on CD. This is still My all time favorite album, start to finish. play it through without skipping
B008BU75IQ|5.0|This was certainly a best kept secret!  What a surprise ending. I know this was to be the ending of the three books but Jeffrey Archer has just got to write a 4th book.  Most will agree when they reach the last page!  This book is as good as the 1st one!<br />Mr. Archer, please don't leave us like this.
0316223239|3.0|It´s a compelling story and easy read. It´s interesting how the writer try to tells the story from a 5 years old child point of view, although you can definitely see the adult coming through now and then. It´s fine but not a great book.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|I read this after viewing the movie, the first book was very true to the movie but filled in so many more details for me.  I enjoyed all the books and ended up staying up very late at night to avidly read.  Had to find out what was going to happen next!
B00CL68NOG|3.0|The movie seemed to move along slowly.  It was not hilarious but it did have some funny parts.  Not something I would ever want to watch again.
B002RI9UBS|2.0|I have not seen the movie but thought I would read the book to see what all the fuss was about, after a third of the book, I could not get into it and found reading it a chore, so it is still only partially read.
0736092269|5.0|This book is invaluable for weight training programs.  It will really help you identify what exactly is going on during lifts and what muscle it specifically targets.  It will help you build a well rounded routine and clean up any form issues you may have never realized you had.  I highly recommend this book.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|So many free games don't really do much to challenge you or keep you entertained but that's not the case here. Mahjong Deluxe has plenty of tile lay-outs to keep you busy for ages, and isn't constantly nagging you to buy an upgrade. One of the best games I've downloaded.
B002A9VJ40|4.0|You either already know you like this movie or you do not..playback quality is okay...nice to have available anytime I want it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is a great waste of time. I don't have anything bad to say about it. definitely worth it.
B0042UEU8M|4.0|Got home from work and my niece and mother had stolen my password and ordered this movie. Then I had to watch it with them! It was a decent flick though I feel dirty somehow now.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Very fun app. The intensity of the game is very fun. It's better than all the other Temple Runs. The challenge of the game is amazing.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This second book in the series was even better than the first.  It grabbed my interest from the very beginning and held me captive to the last page.  I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the third book and the continuing saga of Eva and Gideon.
0802473156|5.0|Opened my eyes to other people's interpretation of love. It was a true awakening. A must read for anyone in a relationship.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just like playing Sol on Windows -- reliable, causes no problems, always handy  when you have a few minutes to fill. Highly recommended.
B00383YC2S|5.0|If you like Alzee's ballads you'll  purchase this CD. Not her latest work but recent. I can't take credit for saying this as I read in someone else's review of this young singer's work but I find her ballads unusually soothing. Perhaps it's a strange sort of way to compliment her but it is what it is. I hope she does more work similar to what is on Une Enfant Du Siecle.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Everyone should see this film.  I think it's really important to be cognizant of the fact that 50 years ago our society was split racially and to see how far we've come.
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|The more cd's that he comes out with, the worse they get .I was a great Hot Boyz fan, but weezy has gone out  into left field with his dress and cd content.I think his legiond status has been put into jeopardy.
B006BXT4TI|5.0|Really....they speak, or rather sing for themselves!!! First music I bought for my Kindle Fire!! They ROCK!!  There's nothing like starting the day with The Black Keys!! I'm already humming the first song in my head...
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|This box set is just fantastic; and this is from someone who already owns every song available anywhere that Duane Allman played on, released or not.  It digs into his session work catalog & provides some real, previously unreleased gems; stuff from his work on Goldwax records artists' songs to more of the Live Delaney & Bonnie gig at A&R Studio (the source of the version of &#34;Come On In My Kitchen&#34; from Anthology 2).  Anyone who wants a deep sample of what Duane Allman could do should start here.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Sure not as good as the first. Some of Reachers action was a bit hard to believe.  He is good, but not that superhuman..
B005UKJZ10|5.0|This movie is a 'must see' production! I watched it on a 52&#34; hd screen with home theater sound, but I wish I could've seen it in the theater! Absolutely stunning visually and audibly!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Really enjoyed the first part about how Jack Reacher was developed.  Overall it was a good story and a fun read.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love that it's free. I've read entire novels & sagas on this app on my phone. Great alternative to owning a kindle if you don't mind reading on a smaller screen.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|WOW! Great twisting plot, detailed true to themselves characters, enough description to visualize details, but not so much you want to skip ahead in the reading. No character is safe even when you think they are the hero!!!! LOVED IT
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It did drag in some spots but I can't wait for the next one! I need to know what happens with Aria!
0345803485|5.0|Since I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. All women should read it !!! I'm currently reading book two, and I'm still hooked !!!
B00821OX98|2.0|Slow, boring at times, cheese effects, I started watching it because of the commercials for the new season, but I wont be watching the new season nor the old seasons.
B000F9RB8K|5.0|Well acted and beautifully filmed movie. A must see for every fan of the Western U.S. (despite being filmed in Canada).
1932100660|5.0|We could all live healthier and preserve our environment if more people understood the concepts uncovered in The China Study.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|&#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey &#34; (2012)  is the first of three &#34;The Hobbit&#34; films. Cannot wait till Christmas to see the next installment.<br /><br />A Quality job and the signature richness in colors and sets and emotions and richness in the story that makes it worth re-viewing - over and over - to catch wonderful bits missed in earlier viewings or to clarify a detail.<br /><br />  I read the Hobbit books - all of them &#34;en famille&#34; around the fireplace in the 1970s and husband and children. We were so charmed by the goodness and entertainment in the books that we'd long for a QUALITY film about it all. So the fine job Peter Jackson and company have done here has been a thrill - more and better than we hoped for!<br /><br />Quality is the keyword  - the Brothers Hildebrandt artwork was everyone's favorite and they used it , faithfully, to tell the stories , as faithfully.  Really good work.  The costume, makeup and set design is the best , though sometimes the camera editing seemed to lose it re: the dwarf noses. :-D  A bit of a putty look showing.  But I am descended in part form artisans who looked a lot like them from the good hard work , full of allergens and jolly, hearty ways to counteract it, so I am a fine authority and happy to report they did a fine job of it all.  This past decade they have passed away - all but one - at grand old age -  and so the stories warm me more than ever.<br /><br />The books are long because Tolkien sets up his scenarios at length, and shares  not just the fun dishwashing magic song in the early scenes of &#34;The Hobbit&#34; , but a song and poem made and shared for every event, and references to their ancient forebears in every major moment.<br /><br />SOME setup is necessary if we are to be in full sympathy with the story, and its characters, so I would have liked to have seen a bit more at outset about the wonders of the Dwarf kingdom.  Although they DID share some footage of the emerald and gold walls and columns and monuments in Erebor within the Lonely Mountain.  I would have liked to have seen a grand tour of the place  ( an extended edition that does just that, maybe?)  as a FOCUS not a &#34;while-you're up&#34;, since, that way we are able to be properly empathetic with the terrible loss of their kingdom and home, when it comes, and to long for restoration with the Dwarves.<br /><br />  It was nice to finally see a lady dwarf, as Gimli said in &#34;LOTR: The Two Towers&#34;  that the women can be so shy that it is often thought there ARE no dwarf women. They are lovely, and probably skilled.<br /><br />It is my only grievance with Tolkien - he and his wife were a famous romance and very happy, but when Tolkien was a boy, with a delver Father, he himself and his brother were orphaned and raised by priests who sent him to Oxford in light of his prodigious mind in childhood. This was a fortunate thing for Tolkien and the world ( i.e., us )  But his culture was very male - no girls.<br /><br />To add to it: Then he was a good and happy Father - of four  boys, and I think his classes when he taught were all-male as well.<br />This, of course, leads to the experience of the females in the book as either boyish or even mannish warriors,  or shy and &#34;uber-ladies&#34;, possessed of the love to the point of extreme sacrifice and the range of old-days classical skills. But none of the women in the story are &#34;today women&#34;, in spite of gentle efforts on the part of production to portray the women as important, at least, to the story, and full of virtue.  And the story is set in &#34;olden days&#34; when things were male-dominated, and so we are happy that it goes as nicely as it does on that point.<br /><br />I am always charmed by the personalities of the characters, major and minor - they all have a way of endearing us. A turn of the head, a tone of voice, a quirk in the ways - so faithfully done up by the Wingnuts here. Thanks so much Peter Jackson and folk of Middle Earth.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Bag is roomy and meets my current needs.  I am a new photographer so I don't have a lot of equipment yet.  However I still have plenty of room left for more.
B007712XAU|5.0|Am a big Downtown Abbey Fan and adore this CD set.  Shipping and packaging were good and it arrived in a timely manner.<br />Appears to have been copied, but CD quality is excellent.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|I got it today and listen to it she still has a wonderful voice  my grandkids like it to  thank you  agnetha
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I loved it! Love Flynn's imagination and writing style. Her books are hard to put down! It wasn't as good as Gone Girl but I still recommend it.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This book, as books from this period generally are, is a plodding piece from the modern perspective. I struggled at times to maintain interest, as the plot is winding and, at times, seemingly (emphasis on seemingly) aimless--like a ramble on the moor, one might say--, but I'll be damned if it wasn't absolutely perfect and worthwhile, each and every while. There are books which will haunt the reader for the rest of his or her natural life and characters whose names no reader will ever forget; this book is among the former, and Heathcliff among the latter. Read it, suffer through it, and it will reward you as richly as any book can.
0205313426|5.0|This is the standard to which writing is set. I remembered this book and purchased it a second time because I knew I needed it to brush up.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|Beautifully remastered both from the sound and the picture.  The acting is tops and the actors are all beautiful people.<br />The music is gorgeous and the story very romantic.  Completely enjoyed it
B00028HBKC|5.0|I chose this rating because this is most accurate portrayal of the life and death of my Lord Jesus that I have even seen.  I have always planned on purchasing the movie, and when I saw it priced so reasonably for a new product, I could not resist.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved this series.  Anyone watching it needs to start at Season 1 to really enjoy but so worth it.  I watched Season 1 on Netflix and then there was no more so found Season 2 through my Amazon Prime ... again at no cost.  When went to view Season 3 found that I had to pay $1.99 per episode but believe me ... it was worth every penny I spent!  Love, love, love it!  Can't wait until Season 4 begins.
B0053O89IS|5.0|As always, package was perfect, I was well pleased and not disappointed at all with the product.  I am looking forward to purchasing season 8 as soon as it becomes available.
B005B1AT8G|2.0|I get that checklists are important and I should use them more than I do.  But, the delivery of that point was tooooooo long.  This audiobook was not for me.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Who doesn't love dirty dancing? Well I do n recomend it, I haven't received it in the mail yet but I can't wait to see how well it looks remastered
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I only wish I could watch 5 seasons of this show in a month, every episode leaves you wanting more.  Can't wait til next season is out.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My children loves this its funny and hours of fun and has many different options that you can make your tom the cat do
B00001PE4D|5.0|This is the best one out of the series. I really enjoy this romantic tragedy. It is so Damn Devilish!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have been having a blast playing this game sense I got my Kindle last Christmas. I haven't spent a dime sense I started playing.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Bonamassa is terrific solo but outstanding when paired up with Beth Hart.  Every song is memorable and extremely well done.
B008JF8O9M|4.0|i try printbot on my table an it work great i try different app didn't work at all  but this one work with out no problem great app
0385343248|5.0|Amazing story. It follows an English ship pilot in 1600 who crashes in Japan with his shipmates. It has one of the most compelling and intriguing stories I've ever read, and I highly recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I read from it virtually every day. Very clever app! And, I like that some translations are oral ... I can listen to the Bible in the car or puttering around the kitchen.
B0082Z447U|3.0|Set in 1850 England, the language is ponderous, and the attitudes toward & by women themselves distasteful.  The reader gets a full dose of upper class English mentality & an interesting view of living conditions, morals, & social mores. I usually read books straight through, in a day or two, but this one took me weeks to struggle through.  In spite of that, the author spins a good tale, from various points of views.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book is great! I think it is a must read and it I as good if not better than beautiful creatures!!!!!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Excellent! Not only the story, but also the character development, the side-stories, and incredible animation. Animated films are better than ever.
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|If you are a comic hero fan, the Iron Man series is top notch. Good story line, acting and effects.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am new to tablet reading and wasn't sure what to expect but I have had no problems at all. I use this app with my Nexus 7 and it has been a great experience. I like the ease of use and the fact that I can change font size and color to make my reading experience visually comfortable.
1400069289|4.0|found the book to be very interesting, liked how the author presented habits on the individual along with companies.<br />The only complaint is the book has many footnotes.  However the footnotes are at the end of the book and are extremly hard to look up when reading the book on a tablet
0439023521|4.0|This is just as good as the promises made of it - I would say that my biggest complaint for this novel is that it is told from first-person, which I am not a fan of - that is only a preference - and, of course, the movie in no way does justice to this novelization either - there are a great many details within these pages that never see the screen, and the changes made for the film did not better the book, so one hundred percent, this is a must read - because of the first person point of view and the inclusion of so much narrative and descriptive and not much dialog or action (in comparison) plus the addition of romance (not my usual fare) I give this a 4 out of 5 - but look forward to reading the rest of the series - well done, Ms Collins, well done.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|Selleck is at his best in these great plots. I think these are some of his best.  Only wish there were more of them.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I love this kind of music. Its a little outide of the box and different. Love thebeat and how it makes me think aobut the words.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Game of time will blow your mind and this even rhymes so buy it this instant or die trying to buy it.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|It looks good and got it soon after order, good service. It just meet my requirement for my new camera.
0930073193|5.0|excellent introduction to economics and cause-and-hidden-effect in the real world. i have probably bought and given away 6 or 7 copies of this excellent book
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This show is gritty and real and i like that. If you dont like blood and gore you wont like this show.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Beautifully designed, easy to use and keeps you on target when you choose to follow one of the daily Bible reading plans.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Really well written, entire plot and setting was intriguing and I couldn't stop reading. Which the virtual world was in our time now
0679809015|5.0|I really love this book, the illustration is great, my son of 19 months old enjoys to look for the doors, and just to make the animal sounds and to fine them is already the best for me, when I received it I saw the small size, but then to opened it is like to discover a treasure. Love this and I wish the illustrator could have more chunky books like this, because these are great to create a nice collection.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Patrick and Pete teaming up again, just the way it should be. All is right in the music world again.
B005LAII80|1.0|This movie is freaking gross!I don't know what they were thinking.they took a decent story and made it an up close and personal bloodbath with in your face exploding heads and way too much gore.If you like seeing fatal car accidents in real life then by all means buy this atrocity but if you are like most of us don't waste your money!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|So that you know where I come from: I have followed this series/franchise since it originally aired in '65-66 with \\"The Cage\\" until now. The new cast and movies remain true to Roddenberry's original vision of a future where humanity explores new worlds and cultures; and explores the inner man's (or woman's) potential for darkness or light with right or wrong choices and the consequences involved. Sci-Fi is all about the \\"what if\\"; the best sci-fi challenges our smug paradigms and opens our vision to consider different viewpoints. HOW that vision has been re-birthed in these movies has been fresh and entertaining. Sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />The new cast is excellent in creating both the sentimental and the fresh characters with the exception of one wish on the part of this old Trekker vet: a Spock who has the deep voice and mature complexity of Leonard Nimoy. It added to the gravitas of the character. Quinto's performance is still somewhat tentative in the quieter dialogue and I hope he is able to overcome that. Nimoy brought an assured \\"intellectual cowboy\\" to the role: brains and adventurous daring. Quinto needs to employ more of that gravitas.<br /><br />Karl Urban's Dr. McCoy is outstanding: he has all the irascibility and sense of adventure of the original character. He \\"boldly goes\\" and yet complains about the damned inconvenience of the journey at the same time. Simon Pegg's character development shows a great deal of potential and brings the right amount of comic relief in the heavy scenes.<br /><br />Zoe Saldana is a bit more salty than her predecessor, Nichelle Nichols, but that reflects the change in our own culture's role of women. Both played Lt. Uhuru very well and Nichols' character developed with our own cultural changes.<br /><br />Chris Pine? He embodies the early Capt. Kirk character perfectly. Bright, contumacious, adventurous and reckless with some well-earned experiential caution. Moments in which he looked at those who were obviously \\"extreme\\" displayed the moral center of the character. Prime Directive? Ditch it when convenient.<br /><br />It's an entertaining ride into a favorite Sci-Fi franchise. Let's hope it continues: \\"make it so.\\"
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is incredible.I seen it in 2d in the theatres because I was a cheap bastard that day and regretted it later.The 3D definately makes it better.I seen things in this version that I had not noticed before!Be aware though that this is the 3rd in a series where Captain America then Thor come first.Each one adds a little to the other.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|Lots of reviewers are complaining about the controls.everything worked the way I thought it would, except that I didn't know how to flip the piece (which interestingly enough I didn't need until almost my last piece). But, I guessed on holding the piece and it flipped, yay.<br /><br />The only thing that should be improved is to organize the tiles at the bottom into one screen as the game progresses to remove whitespace.  It does organize them a little, but sometimes I have pieces off the edge of the screen.<br /><br />I didn't see it originally (until I looked at the help menu) but you can see opponents pieces by clicking on their score tab. I tried that prior to reading the help, and it didn't work, but I must have clicked in the wrong place our something.<br /><br />I've beaten it the first two times I played (level 1 and 2) but I have played blokus before, so perhaps that made the game easier for me.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Thor is the second installment of the captain america,Thor,Avengers series.I think it was well done with stunning visuals.I can't wait for part 2!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book in 3 days, not able to put it down.  What I really like about this book is that I was able to become immersed.  I have read several other books since reading Hunger Games and I am now reviewing with a little more experience.  This book is excellent:  well written, good character development, imaginative, believable and memorable.
B005IZLPME|5.0|For those of you out there like me that didn't know you should watch this movie then Thor and then the avengers in that order.The story was good.I think in comparison to the others in the series it was a little slow but it was still good.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Absolutely wonderful movie.  I saw it 4 times in theatres and have watched it twice since ive had it on blu-ray!! Definitely worth buying on blu-ray!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A well written story, about a great American warrior.  It was interesting to read Taya's thoughts and reactions to the events, as they unfolded.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is so good that my baby sister is like &quot;go iron man go!&quot; And she is only 2
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A nice read and had a lot to think about. It is nice to be reminded to enjoy moments in this fast paced world.
B004HWT6DO|1.0|I was unable to watch the movie, had to view it elsewhere instead of home, would of prefer the CD movie, but will try again.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I can't stop playing this game.  It is so much fun, and it was free.  It is good for hand eye coordination.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Agnetha has picked some wonderful material to record and her own composition  is wonderful. This is  her best English speaking album to date. Her voice hasn't lost anything it is crystal clear and full of warmth, charm and energy!! You won't be disappointed if you purchase this album. I give this  album a 10/10. Agnetha is a wonderful story teller  and it has been wonderful hearing her voice once again. The lyrics are mature, deep and yet playful at times.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Always have loved this show, was the main reason I watched MTV back in the day.  Sad its no longer on the network.  Lucky, I was able to purchase the entire series, including the 2 movies.  One of my favorite shows of all time.  Wish MTV could return to there old programming format.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I saw this movie in a theater after seeing the preview when watching &#34;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&#34;. My husband came with me & the both of us LOVED this movie! It is a great story about belief & friendship! I am a high school Math Teacher who showed it to an AP Statistics class after they took their AP exam. I have yet to know of anyone who gives this a negative rating after watching it!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Show is very interesting.  Each show has a new story line with a continuing story ever week.  Enjoy the actors/actress.
B00BD62X14|5.0|If there was any pure five-star rating for a CD, this is it! No disappointments!!!<br />The best of Carl Bruni!
B00BQBNK04|4.0|I really like the movie with all the singing, but this soundtrack is just a taste. It does not have the full songs that are in the movie. It has the main part, but it lacks some all the reframe and verses. The songs lose their meaning that they have in the movie with the reduce songs. In the movie the songs was complex and they went well with the movie and acting, but here the it mainly the highlights to give someone the main theme of the movie. Also a person has to see the movie to understand this soundtrack, but I would think if they had the whole songs than a person may or may not have to see the movie to understand it. I think it would be better if they had the whole songs in this soundtrack and I would pay more for them if they had it. Otherwise this is a good soundtrack and it is quality. That is why I give a four stars because it is great, but it is a taste of the movie.
1936891026|5.0|I think this is a must read for anyone trying to express themselves artistically. I've bought copies for others who I have though could benefit from this book and given them as gifts. It's short and simple, but the last few chapters are some of the most important chapters on the process of overcoming artistic blocks that I've ever read.<br /><br />Pressfield is such an honest author. He details his failures and, well, his successes speak for themselves. I also recommend following Pressfield's blog as he gives tons of free and cogent advice.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|I was waiting a long time to find an alternative of the ps3 pad, finaly this is it : testing on battlefield 3, I was so precise and faster than another player wrote me to tell me his hate... :-) Now before playing you have to config this little box on a Window PC (no mac !!), you can config 2 presets that are switchable with a button on the box, and you cannot use every kind of mouse/keybord, but classics Logitech are working very well ! I think you cannot make a joystick working, so per example you have to care about it when you need to play with vehicules in BF3, and understanding the emulation of pad's joysticks, this point is not so good and some rare times, it bug and I have to reboot the ps3,<br /><br />BUT I don't care, I can play battlefield 3 with a mouse and a keybord with perfect answer and sensivity ! and it rocks !!! maybe I fraged you yet ;-)
0345803493|3.0|Kind of a slow book. I've been trying to get it all read since July of last year. I'm not sure if I want to buy the 3rd one, but maybe only to see how it all ends.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love the Harry Bosch series, and this one did not disappoint . The story has twists and turns to keep the reader guessing, and the author ties it together with a solid ending. I'd love to see this one made into a movie.
0547884591|5.0|If I could meet 5 people in my life !Tim Ferriss is the 1# guy I'd like meet & talk to about many thing!!He's wealth of knowledge ! If there's one of guys who done more than I could anybody can dream of !He's done it!!<br /><br />I've had only 3 days to look at the book so far!I like it !!I glanced over to his first hunt with Steve Rinella (#2 guy on my list for people to meet)He's very honest about his hunt & describes it perfectly!I I can't wait to read the rest!!Again  thanks Tim for writing another Great Book!
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Hayley did some great things with her voice on this album and the band branched out into a couple of different musical styles.  A lot of the album had a really nice '80s pop/rock and roll feel to it, and I loved it for that.  I especially appreciated that it was, for the most part, more upbeat than I was expecting it to be.  It's been in my playlist a lot and I like this as much as any Paramore album if only because they didn't descend into too much moperock.  That kind of stuff appeals to kids, but so much of this album is about maturity, growing up and letting go of pasts that anchor you down that when you think about it, freed from yesterday's chains, one should have the spirit to soar.  It's not what I expected, and I loved it for that, too.  Hayley's vocals really showed off a lot more range on this album, and that was probably the most refreshing thing about it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I found this book very intriguing and gives a look into the underground world of human trafficking.  Will Robie is at his best even when he is off duty and on a personal mission.  This book is a typical Baldacci book as he weaves in intricate details with depth and precision into his story and, of course, there is a twist.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|There isn't really a lot more I can say about this album than &#34;Welcome back.&#34;  I know it's not brand spanking new anymore, but this really feels like old school Garbage, when there were no expectations of their 'sound' and they could just produce and make excellent music.  Shirley Manson sounds as good and as strong as she ever has, and the rest of the band remembered how to make music.  Hope they make more soon!
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|I'm very hard to please when it comes to games. I uninstall most games I try 98% quicker than it took me to download them. I really thought at first this would be one of those 98% and was almost not even going to download it. I'm glad I did though. It's challenging works well and keeps me entertained.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The BEST MOVIE that I have ever seen.  Realistic!  so true to life!  Bradley Cooper was superb.  Can't believe he was by-passed for Lincoln.<br />I read the book, seen the movie 8 times.  I get more out of it each time.  I cry each time.<br />T he parents were great in their respective roles.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about the movie.  I have on my Kindle Fire, and the VCR.  This is a masterpiece to save.<br /><br />Helen Derbonne
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Wow, this movie has stuck with me. They don't go too far over board with horrible images and make their point. I had no idea this level of insane business was going on in our food supply. I feel far better educated to make better choices as well as discuss with others who haven't seen the movie.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is awesome. I am a die hard fan of hidden object games and this one is amazing and free! Great graphics on my kindle, fun and spooky plot. So much fun!I highly suggest this game for anyone looking for adventure!Tons of games, the fun never ends.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! I have a renewed appreciation for all who serve our country! My big thanks to you all who serve everyday for our freedom and safety!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Fun! If you have anything to do, do it before you start playing! Great colors! Easy to play without being stupid.
B00CL50LEC|1.0|Went to see it with my gf cause i thought it was great premise.. whats a zombie thinking, doing ect during end of the world. Even better that it was gonna be a comedy and not a survival horror flick. thats where it ended. Movie is not at all interesting. not funny. contradicts itself the entire time. Almost walked out a few times. only reason i stayed was caused gf asked me too. then she apologized for making us stay after movie was over cause she said was one of the worst movies she ever saw, but was hoping it would get better.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This is a 3D Diablo clone.  The character building is a little linear and lacking.  The camera view is very close to the character and a little claustrophobic.  The story is typical cookie  cutter fodder. But, it is free and is still a good time killer so I will give it four stars.  Runs decent on a Kindle HD at medium settings.  Surprisingly not a battery drain, either.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really like this game....the puzzles were awesome I cannot wait for the next chapter how long do I have to wait because I'm so anxious to ply the next set of levels
0060989157|5.0|This was a great book.  Read it through in one night, couldnt put it down. Would recommend it to those who like this kind of book.
B00AEFYWDC|5.0|Great acting by Edward Norton. I never saw the twist at the end coming.<br />We really enjoyed it - very riveting.
B00BIPCY14|5.0|Good wife offers a compelling storyline that both guys and girls can enjoy...and the legal stuff is not complete garbage like so many other lawyer shows.
B000AP04NI|5.0|After seeing our granddaughter played Ado Annie in her High School musical, we wanted to go back and see the original movie. Glad we bought it - really enjoyed it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is great hut sadly there were a few times where it did not want to open and I had to redownload it.
0439023513|5.0|The reason I thought this was the best out of the 3 is because I literally couldn't put it down. Even though the plot just gets crazy, it really was a page turner. I knew there would be a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter, so I'd literally have to cover the page up with my hand so I wouldn't read ahead.  I was very curious to see how this would all conclude.  While the first book was great in setting everything up and creating the world, I found it to be slow in some parts. Solid conclusion, and while I wanted her to end up with one of the guys, my idea changed as the books went on and I think the author got it right!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is challenging, fun, and addictive. Once I get through the 80 (actually 81) levels, I become a new player and do it all over again...and again...and again.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I have enjoyed the game so far.  The game responds well to both tilts and touch.  I look forward to playing it.
B006M4F67A|5.0|More than the usual number of variations offered in other 247 games. It's easy to use and relaxing to play.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|It is fun and easy, something to waste time! It is easy to use and for a free game, I would recommend this game to others! Appears to work well on the Kindle!!
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Fast paced but ends up rather predictable. A quick read with a few twists and turns gets you to your abrupt ending..
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Loved watching it here with good quality to get ready for part 3, also known at part 4 because RDJ kind of stole the show in the Avengers. :)
B0090SI42Y|3.0|The movie's acting left much to be desired...The movie was a fantasy theme, and I was not very interested. The movie had some cool special effects...
B002RPR6DU|5.0|No need for Today's computerized special effects when the meaning behind the plot is timeless and superior!  The drones actions give them a human like characteristic.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Washington gave his usual exemplary performance as the seasoned actor that he is...I felt the emphasis on the drinking preoccupied the writers and degenerated the movie slightly...A little too much addiction...
B008KYWMY0|5.0|Crocs sling back shoes fit perfectly and are so-o-o comfortable.  I have this style in silver and brown, which I bought last year.  They are cute and go with just about everything.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|This movie had nothing solid written in it's content...Sometimes a movie can just be entertaining even though the acting was horrific at best...
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in years. They touch on real life issues.  Anyone that is 40 or approaching that age will be able to relate.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one of the must have apps for the Kindle. It displays the information you need at a glance that you can't find elsewhere. It hasn't caused any issues and works exactly as I hoped.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Slow beginning, melancholy, but picks up mid movie and turns out very nice.  Streisand is very entertaining as the Mom.
B003G4W49C|5.0|In my top 5 books of all time. I reread it at least twice a year and have done so for many years
B009UZBLSG|2.0|I was able to snag one for 29.99 but that's still pretty ridiculous for what it does. This company needs to get it's supply issues figured out.<br /><br />The connector does what it's supposed to do. I wish there was a way to turn off the phone display when playing a movie.<br /><br />It pairs well with the newer slim HDMI cords. I picked one up from Monoprice but I'm sure amazon has them.<br /><br />I can't wait to use it when I travel next or when my family visits. It will be a lifesaver I'm sure.<br /><br />****UPDATE: This worked for a very short time with a slim monoprice redmare hdmi cable but then it stopped working altogether and my nexus 4 would randomly reboot (I'm running stock, fyi). I went back to an older thick style hdmi cable and it worked just fine. I'm pretty bummed because that cable matched so perfectly to this adaptor.<br /><br />A quick search online revealed this to be a common problem. I theorize the adaptors do work but they struggle with the newest of HMDI standards/cables. That being said, I had to go out of my way to find a slim hdmi cable, most I would encounter in a hotel room or family function would be the older style cables. I hope this helps. I would have to rate this 2 stars now due to the compatibility issues with different cables.
193700788X|5.0|I just finished reading the last installment of Dead Ever After and I really enjoyed this book.  From Mrs. Harris standpoint I can definitely understand why she didn't want Sookie to end up like Pam & Karin....always having to be at Eric's beck & call and having to kill at his command. And it was a possibility that the Queen of Oklahoma would have killed her if Eric kept seeing her. Although Mrs. Harris didn't give more attention to Eric once the marriage was severed with Sookie, I still find I was satisfied by the way things turned out. Sookie came full circle in the series and ended up with Sam.
B004TI1WME|5.0|As a retail manager this calculator is great. It makes counting safes and drawers much easier with the &quot;tape&quot;. It has replaced my huge, clunky, and loud calc in the office when the tapes don't need printed. I have a few task that require the printed tape (counting petty cash drawer in safe) but for all other task this is my go to.
B007L6VR12|5.0|I had been getting bored with Wes Anderson's flicks. You have daddy issues; I get it. But when they killed that dog...holy smoke. Sold. I hate dogs, and killing one on screen made my day. Best part of the film. I know it was fake, and no animals were harmed, blah blah blah, but even the fake dog killing made my day. Always barking, #2ing wherever; 'bout time someone whacked one. Let this be a lesson to all dogs and dog owners.
0783226837|5.0|\\"This valley is just one long smorgasbord.\\"<br /><br />Perfection, Nevada is anything but perfect; the townsfolk can easily be finger counted with no worries about leaving someone out.  This means there had to be several outside additions to serve as, well, food.<br />This is the way I like my monsters, BIG and more than enough to cause plenty of problems.  If they're hungry, all the better.  Speaking of tongues, the monsters have three, each capable of grabbing onto..............whatever.  Making them, after much debate and careless consideration, Graboids.  Their new name courtesy of Walter Chang (Victor Wong), who got to inspect one up close, outside then in.  There are two reluctant heroes in this movie, and two super heroes.  The two reluctant not-so-handymen (Kevin Bacon as Val McKee, and Fred Ward as Earl Basset), want nothing better than to get out of Perfection.  The two super heroes are gun toting husband and wife survivalists hiding from government intrusions of all kinds (Michael Gross as Burt Gummer and Reba McEntire as Heather Gummer).  The plot celebrates the survivors desperate attempt to get out of Perfection........alive.<br /><br />This movie is, at all times, fun.  It's one of my favorite movies to watch.
0140120416|5.0|I started learning russian by myself. Now I have a youg native teacher, but this book is perfect to go alone.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Good Read. I can't wait to see the movie. Humorous sad and uplifting. Read it if you get the chance. Your time won't be wasted.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Movie is Great and the storyline is amazing Hayao Miyazaki is a great writer, and does an amazing job on his movies!
B00062PN6I|5.0|For the money, you cant beat these headphones. I use them to plug in my amp when i practice guitar so i dont bother others in the house.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Sweet game.  Great graphics.  I can't stop playing.  It lags a lot but is still a great game.  I would recommend it for people who.like strategy games and action games.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Movie was great quality when received and I have had no problems since I have received it. Definitely recommend for movie fans.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Gangstar rio is the best game I played in my life. You could have motorcycles, trucks, qauds, and a variety of cars. You should get this game!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played...a real brain teaser, gets you to think but you have to be fast at the same time...clock is ticking :-) I was going to look for something and ran across this and was actually worth downloading. Nothing to dislike...yet. EVERY kid should play this.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|If you love the electric rock and roll guitar, you gotta love Joe!<br />After 50 years of loving rock,just discovered him a few years ago!
B006M4F67A|4.0|Pretty good...I like it and it's worth the download. If ANY kid can play this go right ahead...not really a &#34;little kid's game&#34; but they can try, lol.
B0071BY1PG|3.0|i've never watched this movie despite having seen it airing on cable (changed the channel). i thought since it is dreamworks and 3d, i will probably enjoy it. instead, there were only a few funny moments for me. i didn't find any part of the plot particularly touching besides the brief story between shifu and the cub. dreamworks movies always have a heartfelt spark to them, and this movie was seriously lacking. the 3d didn't wow me except in two scenes (fireworks rocket and flying petals). so ultimately, i feel disappointed in this blind buy and regret spending so much money on this 3d blu.<br /><br />there are too many cliches about chinese culture in this movie and it is hard to like this panda. none of the characters were memorable or well developed besides shifu. maybe because i do not like jack black much, i did not care for this movie. if you are amused by stereotypical comedies like american pie, dumb and dumber, meet the fockers, or whatever....this might be for you. children will most likely enjoy it though.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried a lot. If you didn't you're a heartless demon from hell. Seriously, really good read - the author is rad.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|GREATEST SUPER HERO MOVIE EVER MADE!,<br />no matter how many times I watch it, it never gets old!, I love it!

B001UV4XHY|5.0|The disk came with no damage and the movie works great.  There really isn't much else to say except this movie is great.
B0086700CM|5.0|So fun to play out of all of my games temple run is The best ! Best game ever! I would play it all day long
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is one is a keeper and one that you pull out and watch 1-2x per year.  This movie has it all, intrigue, plot, reality, and lots of inspiration for those who are being told they can't, that won't, you shouldn't.  A very inspiring story that is true.  Every year a new 2 year old comes along with promise to be a triple crown winner, and this classic movie reminds everyone what an extraordinary accomplishment winning the triple crown really is.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|This record was worth the wait.  I have always loved Ritchie Blackmore, but I appreciate the Steve Morse era of Purple too.  Sonically, it is the best sounding work in years.  The songs stretch out with cool arrangements.  Ian Gillan sounds vibrant (no screams, but that's okay... his mid range singing voice is superb).  Its very proggy in parts, but grounded in melody.  It might very well be my favorite Morse era record.  Bloody brilliant old lads!
B008KPDKAE|4.0|This is a quirky romance that guys and girls may like equally.  Life seems simple and straightforward for this engaged San Francisco chef until his fiancee gets the opportunity of a lifetime as a researcher at the University of Michigan.  Their wedding keeps getting pushed back due to life demands and conflicts.  It feels like it's going to end at about 1:40 but the last chapters bring things back full circle differently than you may expect.
B00BESNKB8|5.0|Terrific!!! A real Kung Fu Movie!!!  Reminds me of the best Kung Fu Theater movies from back in the day!!!
B005LJETYI|4.0|Killed this book over a long weekend and enjoyed it. Got a little bit predictable near the end but it is still worth the time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If not for Eben Alexander's impeccable credentials, the book would be no different from so many popular culture claims about the existence of an afterlife.  His scientific knowledge about the brain and how it works sets this book apart.
B004S82OAE|4.0|Good for doing both your ICND1 and ICND2 without having to buy multiple books. Just wish the CD came with the kindle version.
B0097K21YW|3.0|This game is vey hard. I have not gotten the hang of it yet. Angry birds is better than this
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|I ordered this late in the evening to be drop shipped to my mother's address, and a day and a half later she had it- very fast service.<br />She told me she loves it, and a month later she's still playing the heck out of it.<br />Well produced and well orchestrated, and the vocals are pretty good- if you're into this type of music. I'm not, which is why I dropped a star.<br />I'd feel comfortable recommending this.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|It keeps my 7 year old grandson busy when I am not able to give him attention when I keep him!
B006M4F67A|2.0|Hard to see for me. The characters just to small to read quickly. The highlighted options is a nice feature tho.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I like this version, it lets you play all the tiles unlike some that stop mid way and there are no more matches.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. It takes the history of the British Empire and spins a great tale that fits together and knits the generations together. You come away with a good understanding of todays British culture and how the attitudes and social structures still pervade the British people. Rutherfurd is one of todays great writers
B003O86FMW|5.0|On my eleventh time reading this book, it is even more phenomenal than the others. It never fails to intrigue, upset, soothe and so much more. An epic of a book.
B000FBFN1U|1.0|I read the first book and enjoyed it until the hatching of the baby dragons. It just gets more complicated and surrealistic. This is not my stuff. Some of the characters are compelling. Had this been written without all the silly stuff it could have been great. It may be for those who like this genre but I'll pass.
193700788X|5.0|I have loved the sookie stackhouse series. I have been reading the reviews about the last book in the series, and I have been a little dismayed.<br /><br />I have to say that when an avid reader like myself comes to the end of a series, I have been disappointed more than once on how the author chooses to end them. I find that most authors are so over the series, they seem to be in a rush and they leave the readers with a feeling of loss or the story being incomplete.<br /><br />I was thrilled on how the book/series ended. Every character wrapped up very well,  no loose ends. Last night when I read the final sentence of the book, I felt that there was nothing more that could have been written to end the book.<br /><br />I have seen very negative reviews about the book. I just wanted to let you know that I loved it, it left me feeling like Sookie was going to be just fine..
B009RH9J7W|4.0|I chose this item because I can rotate it . This product has met and exceeded expectations.Product is well made. Would buy from this company again.
0307454541|5.0|This mystery series by Steig Larsson is so gripping that it's impossible to put the book down. Girl with the Dragon Tatto is the first of the series, followed by Girl Who Played with Fire and Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. The Swedish movies made from these books are wonderful. There is an American version of the first movie, but it doesnt compare to the Swedish one. I liked these books so much that I started looking for other Scandinavian authors like Karin Fossum. Steig Larrson has passed away so there will be no more of his books to look forward to. He was a great author of a haunting series that you want to read over and over.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  Fun, challenging parts, but never got too frustrating.  Highly recommend if you have enjoyed Lost City or other similar games.
0385347774|2.0|Someone a my book club recommended this book. I was very disappointed in it. I finally gave up on it as it didn't hold my attention.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I loved the depiction of rural Ireland and the life of one so abused by circumstance and society.  His struggle to over come his lonely life kept me turning pages, eager to see if he realizes even a portion of his dreams for a better future.
B0034G4P4O|3.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie very much. The main character appears to be a boy, but really is a young journalist. I bought this movie for my 7 year-old grandson. I don't think he liked it as well as we did, but he may as he gets older.
B000WOXQDM|5.0|I love No Doubt because they make music that's generally upbeat and they like to mix different elements into their songs. This album is abundant in Ska/Pop/Rock goodness. The standouts for me are Spiderwebs, Happy Now? and Sunday Morning. It's one of those albums that make me happy whenever I listen to it; it's good to have an album like that in your collection. Each member of the group brings something great to the album. I highly recommend this album and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
B0043XI3ZO|5.0|I bought this Lego set for my 7 year-old grandson who LOVES lego. He started constructing it immediately after opening the box. I find Lego to be a wonderful means of learning to follow instructions, to visualize a project and to gain dexterity. You can't lose by buying a little boy a Lego set. You just need to know which one he's into!!! There are different categories, like Star Trek, Harry Potter, Ninjago, etc. Ninjago seems to be the most popular with that age group at this time.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|A great story and one told well. Too many stories in Sci-Fi struggle for character development and compensate with technical overkill. Not so in Old Man's War. I could not put this down and will most certainly look for other stories by Mr. Scalzi. Well done sir!!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Best buy I have ever made. Have listened to this album at least fifty times. Very happy with this product.:)
B006M4F67A|5.0|Good game, helps the time go in lines, waiting rooms etc. No problems so far so its a good buy.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like this game. It's nice to have a change from the same old games. Hopefully it continues to be as good as it has started out
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I find #2asthe enjoyable as the first one and as annoying.  I am not the best at reacting quickly to obsrackes, so I seldom succeed at getting over 300me coins.  But i continue to play.  So i must enjoy it
B006P0FIGU|5.0|Great way to rewrite a story that has been told for years.  The plot is outstanding with technology being added to the old settings.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|A great Blu-Ray for any Eagles fan to watch.<br />The quality is one of the best I have seen, it makes my DLP look like a new LED.<br />I wish everything looked that good.<br /><br />The band is always fun to watch, they have a wonderful stage presence and put on a great show.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this Blu-Ray. Enjoy.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena is the third installment in Rick Riordan's Heroes of Olympus series, and once again, Mr. Riordan proves to be a competent, masterful storyteller. When the book came out last October, I deliberately held off on reading it not because I feared it would be bad but because I knew it'd be awesome - and that I'd have to wait a year for the next one. This was definitely a good call. I've spent the past few weeks re-reading Percy Jackson and the Olympians, The Lost Hero, and Son of Neptune. By the time I got to Athena, I was in full fan-girl mode, complete with squeeing.<br /><br />And then I finished the book.<br /><br />Whoa.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Epic.<br /><br />The seven demigods - Percy, Annabeth, Frank, Hazel, Leo, Jason, and Piper - are brought together at the beginning of the book and set off on their quest to close the Doors of Death and battle the giants who want to awaken Gaea. But Annabeth has also been given a special task. Her mother, the goddess Athena, wants Annabeth to follow the mark and avenge her. The group's journey takes them to Rome. In addition to Annabeth, Percy, Leo and Piper also narrate.<br /><br />By switching narrators - a trend he started in The Lost Hero - Riordan took a bold risk. His readers are coming into this series as Percy fans. Now suddenly, there are six other demigods who each have a specific role to play in the coming war. They are equally important and necessary. And his bold move pays off big time. Riordan has created new characters that add a richness and depth to the world he has created. Each demigod has a backstory that has shaped them for this moment in time when they will rise to defend Olympus. And while it may be true that I will never love any demigod more than Percy, there is a certain son of Mars who has found a special place in my heart. And I absolutely cannot wait to see what happens next.<br /><br />Start the series for Percy's sake. Fall in love with new characters. Save Olympus once again. You won't regret it.
B004P1JEWU|4.0|Good read. I still liked the first book the most, but this was still an entertaining and compelling read. 4 stars!
0765325950|2.0|I'll try to do this with no spoilers, but overall I'm officially disappointed. I give it two stars mainly out of nostalgia for the good-old-days. While I didn't mind Sanderson's first two books, this one was just plain bad. The first half of the book is choppy, disorganized and hard to read if you actually care about things like proper paragraph structure. The jumps between scenes and characters are abrupt and often needless. Huge chunks of the book ramble on senselessly. It starts to get better about halfway through JUST long enough to get your hopes up. Unlike some, I don't mind battle scenes. It is, after all, the Last Battle. The long, drawn-out CONVERSATIONS about battle could easily have been cut though. I mean, pages and pages and PAGES of \\"should we commit to plan A or plan B?\\" and yet truly great characters are killed off without even getting a proper send-off. I should say, proper SUPPORTING characters, 'cause apparently being a main character makes you bullet-proof no matter how bad your circumstances. There is ONE (kind of) main character lost as a token gesture, and they make d**ned sure you see it coming a mile away and that you don't really care. Characters who were awesome in previous book either get only token appearances or suddenly become so distasteful that you'd LIKE them to die. And the final pages of the Final Battle? A horrific rip off of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" combined with a big chunk of \\"Harry Potter.\\" Namely the parts of \\"Harry Potter\\" that I hated. Basically, the entire thing is the most poorly written of the bunch. The plot is held together with spit and wax and contains holes you could drive a truck through. No matter how crappy the writing or how badly we had to twist the pattern though, we still managed to squeeze out an ending so nauseatingly happy that I think my pancreas is still suffering the effects. It feels like Sanderson could just FEEL the movie deal coming and was writing for film scenes, not readers. If this is what his writing looks like once he's run out of other people's notes to use, I won't be reading any of his own stuff.riting looks like once he's run out of other people's notes to use, I won't be reading any of his own stuff.
B000HL09SA|5.0|A simple, touching story about a shy boy with a loyal dog who brings him lovingly to a successful life -- in himself and in the world. Touching, endearing and revealing -- each viewer will find part of himself or herself in this story. Perfect for families, especially teenagers who are reluctant to express emotions -- every viewer will be touched. I am a journalist, so the love of writing and verbal expression speaks to me through lines and feelings spoken or never uttered outwardly.
193700788X|1.0|I wish I could unread all thirteen books. This book was just awful. AWFUL. The editor should be fired, as for the writer? I don't think by killing the very thing that made her known was a wise move. Thirteen books???? This whole series is one short story in people magazine at best.<br /><br />\\"Girl is different. Girl has crappy time. Girl get prom king. Prom king loves her difference and wants to live with her forever. Girl dumps prom king because he is different and goes to be with nerdy guy that can breed. the end.\\"<br /><br />What a waste of time that I will never get back. Thanks for nothing C.H.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It had me from the very beginning, I couldn't put it down. It's a very easy read & the plot it's straightforward & uncomplicated, but it does have some plot twists to make it interesting
1616550414|5.0|Great book to get some background into the Zelda Universe.  Personally, I would have enjoyed some more fun facts about the universe that gave it more depth.  Some of the facts given were pretty superficial - I would of rather a little more entry into the history and lore of the games in bite-sized chunks.  Otherwise this was a phenomenal purchase for my collection!
B005USZML4|4.0|As usual, a very well written story line by John Grisham.  It seems that using a 'kid' as a part of his strategy to perhaps recruit young people to consider a career in the legal field.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Great app, it works great and has neat features and graphs that helped me fix my home wifi system setup
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Really liked how the plot slowly built up to the what was anticipated throughout the entire film.  Was a nice surprise to not have to endure a torrid sexual affair and still experience a super action movie.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|this was a grouping of princess items i bought for my granddaughter for her birthday  comforter, sheets, curtains, and bath items  this was just what i needed to top it all off.  it has the princess decals and the cute part is the gems  it really add a little fantasy  and sparkle to the room. the colors are bright, images are clear good quality product.
B007SPPANM|5.0|This movie never fails to tug at the heartstrings.  :3  This is definitely a MUCH better love story than Romeo and Juliet and WAY better than the Twilight series.  :)  Just sayin'.  ^_^
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Really well done. Warner's actions are logical and believable and not just scientific patter. I would like another novel by this author
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|it has great graphics and I play it all night long u will love it. the best game ever and the girls are the best
B000001ESN|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />Here is the dark horse of Rush's master work period, starting with \\"2112,\\" & ending with \\"Moving Pictures.\\"<br /><br />\\"Permanent Waves\\" is filled with inspirational music in it's short 38 minute running time. It has enough ideas to fill a recording two times it's length. Here you'll find some of Rush's most complex playing, & Alex Lifeson really shows us what an all commanding monster on guitar that he really is! Many of his solos are brilliant ascending crescendos, of intuitive genius!  Lifeson knows his guitar better than most people know their selves! Making his guitar an extension of his soul through his body in a monumental flurry of magnificent notes. This may be Lifeson best performance on album! Geddy Lee & Neil Peart are right behind him, laying down a massive foundation of solidness that will withstand the test of time for Lifeson's soaring guitar! The combination of the three, a pinnacle of masterful talent!<br /><br />All the songs here are masterpieces of musical integrities of the instrumental & lyrical kind. My favorite song on this album would probably be \\"Jacobs Ladder,\\" with it's imposing opening & lyrical content, escalating in a all out assault on the ears & the mind. Epic in it's sweep & emotion. This is one of Rush's finest songs, truly capable of sweeping you away in it's musical vortex!<br /><br />Yes, \\"Permanent Waves\\" is the dark horse of Rush, but what a ride! Turn your stereo up loud, & buckle in, as the sea of music that lies within this album is a maelstrom of swirling notes, beats, & ideas! Hold on!
B008N1V11U|1.0|I purchased the kindle edition of this game but was unable to play it on my kindle. Even with my kindle empty this game takes up too much memory to be able to play. A complete waste of money. :-(
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|There are two versions of Coraline 3D.  There is the older anaglyph blu-ray version which includes 4 pairs of red/blue glasses.  The anaglyph version can be enjoyed on pretty much any color tv.  It takes some time for the eyes to get used to the glasses, but ultimately the 3D effect is fairly good (however color rendition suffers greatly).  I'm reviewing the newer \\"3D Blu-ray\\" version which requires a 3D Blu-ray player and 3D TV with its own corresponding glasses.<br /><br />This is one of the best looking 3D titles I own.  I believe the film was shot entirely in 3D and I think it looks every bit as real and dimensional on my 47\\" as it did in the theaters, maybe better.  The color comes through MUCH better than the anaglyph version of course - subtle, muted and controlled throughout much of the movie, brilliant yet honest and believable in the garden scene and the ending.  Coraline is one of my \\"go to\\" discs when I want to demo my 3D setup to friends.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I bought it because I Love the Twilight Saga everyone of them.<br />I saw every movie I now own a copy of every one of them I loved all the music in every one of them.<br />If you liked the Books, Movies You will most likely want the music I recommend getting the music it's all part of it.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|Once again, John Williams is able to evoke the mood of the film for which he has written the music.  Some of it is quite complex for some listeners but the variations are interesting.  The only drawback is that I missed a piece or two which would have integrated period songs into the overall themes.
1455527475|3.0|Should have called the book, \\"why I love Goldman Sachs\\".  In my mind it was a complete praise of Goldman and a typical life at the firm (at the end of the day it is the same old stuff over and over again).  I commend Greg on lasting 12 years in that envirnoment because he seems to be a good enough person.  But, I felt like the book was more selling Goldman than on why he really left.  He basically waited until the last part of the book (i.e. - last part of the last chapter to explain why he left).  I did enjoy reading about Goldman and the culture and how it has changed.  But all organizations change with different leadership.  You either follow the new leader or get out.  Greg chose to get out and I say good job.  But, I think the title is very misleading.  If you are looking for a read about the inside of Goldman and wild excesses that would drive someone to leave, do not read this book.  If you want to know about the basic day in the life and how one man succeeded.  This book is for you.  I enjoyed the read, but the title does not describe the actual content. And for that I have a problem with this book. Just do not expect a glamourus story about all the craziness that mind thinks happens in a wall street firm.  Because this is not that kind of book. It is a basic story of someone getting his dream job and then leaving because of a disagreement with a new management style.  We have all been there.
B0012GMVQC|5.0|Classic Beck fantastic guitar work none better. Beck has  to be the most under rated guitarist out there.<br />He can  do things with a guitar that others cannot, and this includes Clapton !!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have to start off by saying I am a fan of both franchises, but I have to admit I wasn't expecting this to be so good. I was horrified when I heard they were coming out with Angry Birds Star Wars. I thought it would be an abomination. I was so wrong. The implementation of Star Wars type characters into the game is flawless. The levels are smartly designed and call for quite a bit of thinking to get the best score possible and the different types of birds are genius. I highly recommend this to anyone who has liked previous iterations of Angry Birds and even suggest you try this one out if you are just a big Star Wars fan who has never tried these games.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|Excellent game had hours of fun, totally worth the 99 cents. The idea of the game is crazy but works really good
B008GXHOFW|5.0|so flipping awesome even though I don't like spider man. u git to get it!!!!!!!!!!!! z&deg;u totally got to get it men &amp; wemone haaaaaaaa..... GET IT DAMET.<br /><br />  GOOD DAY SINORS &amp;SINORS GARCEAS :0
B00C7L4QB4|4.0|I'm a fan of the Michael Mann \\"Manhunter\\" and I really enjoyed the casting changes for the Dr. Bloom and Freddie Lounds characters; I think the latter is based on E Jean Carroll circa 1983.  This is a very well-shot show - better than Twin Peaks though there are some similarities.  This show is awash in urban grey blues sort of metallic.<br /><br />Mads Mikkelson is awesome to watch.  I really hate him now.  He's really making Hannibal Lecter look very mean, silently petty and sadistic.<br /><br />The bodies in every episode are very shocking and disgusting.  There have been two episodes that were ugly and boring.  There haven't been any scenes that have made me keep an episode on my dvr until the latest one when we are SHOWN more of Hannibal's seething beneath the surface - it's Gillian Anderson's first appearance and she's always a disturbing casting choice to me so it feels right that she is cast in this disturbing show.<br /><br />I surprisingly don't mind Hugh Dancy in the this role  - he has this flat, phd voice that he must enjoy using since he is English.  I think Mads Mikkelson is using his own accent.<br /><br />The set design on this show is sophisticated and a relief from the usual stock images - think Grimm and how every Portland interior looks/feels the same and probably used the same can of paint.<br /><br />Mads Mikkelson's scenes create a handbook of caution - they should be stitched together into one movie.  It is so dangerous to be on his radar.  You can't win with someone like that.
1442346949|5.0|I also have the audio book on CD, and this was a great additional tool to use for college research. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants insight into the life and mind of Steve Jobs!
B009HNCS9M|2.0|The lift that kept this show watchable and interesting is totally gone this season.  I have no idea what happened but not even the familiarity of a long-running show has me catching the episodes as soon as they air.  I've found that I have naturally stopped watching them nevermind eagerly awaiting a new episode.  I can go a week without noticing that I have missed an episode which makes ... Law and Order: SVU a more entertaining, tighter constructed show these days.<br /><br />It's the whole show that is the problem.  It feels like someone has given up on making it good.  It's not just casting Jeanne Tripplehorn or that Reid remains a tedious crybaby well into his thirties.  It's that the stories no longer seem to have impact.<br /><br />At least that one season of the spinoff was fascinatingly strange.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I downloaded this but because of the camera not facing away from a person like on a telephone it is not too useful...I would not buy it again.
B00CPM6PE6|3.0|If you watch only John Barrowman's scenes, you are watching a very tight, very interesting, very stern characterization.<br /><br />Oliver Queen is insane - a serial killer - and it was amusing watching him that way for the first several episodes but the rest of the cast is tedious and it just became watching a clique of people who might not even like each other - certainly Diggle seems to hate Oliver on occasion - but are intent on driving on with this Batman/Buffy impersonation.  It starts to make the characters reprehensible for their striding insincerity.<br /><br />But Malcolm Merlyn's glare and fantastic delivery of his few lines are gems.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is my favorite on Kindle fire.  Igo there  everyday to get my mail  with my friends.  I really like it very much.
B00915G6MG|2.0|just like Supernatural.  The gist that I came away with is that our military is infested with lying killers AND enemy agents.  It's unreal how beloved the frightening looking Abby Sciuto is as it is unreal how obnoxiously stilted the character of Ziva David is.  This show is obviously very stringently crafted - to be intentionally annoying?  There is no way that Mark Harmon's character's offensiveness would have been tolerated in reality.  As with Supernatural, I get the sense that the actors don't seem to be too happy to be doing the same thing for so long albeit well-compensated.  It's just not cool as I realized seeing Colin Hanks in a refreshing performance last week and this week apparently.  Having him on the show is almost as bad as Supernatural airing after Arrow - the contrast must burn.
B00280LYIC|1.0|This is such a great book I mean obsolete the most juicy book I have ever read in my life.
B00CQ1YJKI|3.0|I guess it's ironic that the Chinese doctor is minding the English heroin addict given England's Opium Wars against China.  Every episode feels empty and stylized not helped at all by the English accent and speaking manner of the lead actor - it feels very forced and performance-y.  I don't follow the OTHER Sherlock but I was VERY impressed by Benedict Cumberpatch's line delivery in Star Trek: Into the Darkness.<br /><br />THIS Sherlock is very affected, very look at how English I am.  It's no good if it's obvious.<br /><br />\\"You DO IT TO YOURSELF\\" is something my mother would insist was the only appropriate riposte to gangsterish behavior.  I was floored that this episode was made from the spot-on performance of the deadly bespectacled gambling den overseer and his hidden cameras to Lucy Liu's inappropriate hold on her rent control apartment - a precursor to airbnb shenanigans.<br /><br />Thanks, Hollywood.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle Fire wouldn't charge and this cable and a new Kindle Power Cube fixed everything.<br />Stay away from third party connectors.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Not what I wanted the end to be like. Not exciting, left a lot of room for a better ending.
B008M87GJK|3.0|I judged this app lower because (1) it covered limited subject areas and (2) did not cover each news item in the detail available from NYT or the Atlantic.  However, the images are attractive and the coverage of each item succinct, perhaps better for those on the go.
B002OKO1GI|1.0|So disappointed.  We purchased this movie for family movie night and it wouldn't even load.  We tried it on our pc and our other wireless devices as well.  We have watched movies on Instant Video before, so I don't know why this one was a problem, but I'm not happy that we paid for it and didn't even get to watch it as a family.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Liked it, watch his shows.  Sounds like he always has & opened my eyes you some good bits and  some bad bits.  I will read another.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Scott Jurek's ultra running CV is not debatable. As a ultra enthusiast I seek advice from those who stand out through their achievements. The running community has always been approachable, with a willingness to share their insights. Eat and Run confirms the belief that training will take you within 35% of your goal, but diet will give you the added edge when incorporated with intelligence. This book, though supporting a vegan diet, is more for runners seeking a more holistic approach to running.
B001AVCFJM|2.0|Alternate reality or not, this film is not true to the fabric that made the original Star Trek the benchmark and the inimitable saga of the quest to go where no man had gone before. It just seems way off target and all wrong. This is not thinking man's science fiction. It is simply an unbridled and aimless action film with no clear dramatic cohesive elements. The characters' names have renamed the same, but little else was retained. The biggest disappointment and actually quite annoying was the alternate version of Spock. Zachary Quinto's Spock is all wrong. His portrayal of Spock is downright weird. It was absolutely fantastic to see Leonard Nimoy return as Spock from the original plane of reality. In effect this shows just wrong the concept of this film feels. Karl Urban performance as McCoy was somewhat successful and he did try to throwback to the original concept of the character. Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike fared best. I think this is just an awful film. With the exception of Leonard Nimoy, Karl Urban and Bruce Greenwood the entire cast acts like they had a chip on their shoulder. They are rude, loud, and arrogant and constantly play a game of one-upmanship with everyone they interact with. This is not Star Trek.

B006M4F67A|5.0|It's a great way to play Mahjong with a variety of options for games.  I use it on my Kindle and it's perfect for taking a break from reading or TV and being able to easily play a game or two when not working. It's sweet!

193700788X|3.0|I absolutely loved this series for the first few books. I am a huge Sookie and Eric fan.. Sookie and Quinn... Sookie and Alcide... I think there are so many different avenues that CH could have gone down, but she went with what she went with.. whatever!<br /><br />I love a happy ending and feeling great when I finish a book. I did not do that with this book. I threw the book across the room and woke my husband up. He was not impressed, and neither was I. I feel like this book was quite sloppily written, and the story line was just strange.. but I am not an author so what do I know. I thought the TV show had taken some weird turns, but so did the books. Sigh.<br /><br />(Un)fortunately, I am still a fan, so I enjoyed the end of a series for the sake of it being the end, though its not the particular ending I had in mind. I feel like CH should have spent more time on that certain relationship in the previous books so we weren't all so butthurt about the ending. But maybe that's just me.<br /><br />Anywho. I think book reviews are a bit silly, because everyone is different. I will probably re-read this series in the future, but create an alternate ending in my head (you know you did it too). I'll get over my butt hurting about the ending and move on. In a series this long, we all get attached to certain characters and we all feel differently, and maybe there are more people on the 'i like the way this ended' team, but I'm not holding it against CH or the series as a whole.

B005ELZKWS|5.0|This is an absolute gem of an album which shows again that rock music's potential is not depleted yet. Hagar and Satriani totally rock and achieve a fresh sound. It just becomes painfully apparent how younger bands suck in musicianship and vocals compared to the music produced by the old school rockers.

B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed this trilogy both times I've read them, wonderful love story that depicts lust, love, despair, hope and anger as sentiments necessary to the crude reality of human nature. My only critique is how repetitive the books are (with what the characters say)
B004TI1WME|3.0|Downloaded twice to my kindle fire as the first time said &quot; file corrupted cannot install&quot;.  Second time worked ok. Good calculator but buttons are very small. No instructions on how to label entries (Hold the space to the left of the entry and a window will open. Choose edit text and then you can input your label). Can be very detailed which is more than I need. Will probably uninstall.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Daniel Kahneman has written a book bursting with counter-intuitive observations about human cognition.  The book is excellent on an academic level and a practical level (many illustrations about how cognition goes awry in our daily lives.  It is also a compelling meditation on the human condition.  As good as the first 3/4 of the book was, the final 1/4, on happiness, is filled with enough research and observations so that it could serve as a self-standing book.<br /><br />This is not a book you will swim through.  I took many notes as I read.  But I consider Kahneman's observations every day--this is no exaggeration.  This is one of the most engaging books I've ever read.

B005S9EJ14|4.0|I enjoyed this film very much. It had some great scenes, wonderful, well respected actors and actresses (some of them I liked very much already). Good storyline. A little stereotypical - but perhaps not entirely out of character (given my experiences). I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a modest paced, engrossing film that goes a little outside the normal storyline. With love, death and exotic locations it has something for everyone. It's not an action movie, thank heaven. A person with a patience will enjoy this.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|An intriguing story of sin and redemption...the efforts of ValJean to make something worthwhile of his life, while undergoing the relentless pursuit of Javert is gripping!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What a great book! Love the sequel and CANNOT wait for the third. Great read and love the storym so relatable.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A story of bold knights and fair maidens to prvail against dark forces set to overcome them in the long ago.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|The only bad thin is get the rare plant, and pearl. All the other is good, fun and I like the fish, is so relax
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|Got This As Faotd &amp; Saw The Reviews Of People Complaining That This Isn't A Full Game. I Played It A Good Bit Yesterday, &amp; It Was Indeed The Full Game. I knew So Many People Couldn't Be Mistaken Or Full Of It, So I Was Honestly Expecting To See An Update In The Future Taking Back The Full Game They Obviously Included In Order To Avoid Bad Reviews. Only One Day Later &amp; We Have The Update Already. Thankfully I Checked Reviews First, &amp; Big Surprise...They've Reverted It Back To A .99 Demo. Ridiculous, Despicable Business Practices. you Blatantly Ripped People Off By Charging Then For A Demo They Could've Gotten Elsewhere For Free. Then You Give The Full Game Away In Order To Avoid Being Called Out On Pulling Crap Like That. Then, When Risk Of Hundreds Of 1 Star Reviews Is Out Of The Way, You Try To Swoop In &amp; Take The Full Game Back. I've Bought My Daughter Countless Dinner Dash Type Games On Ios, (Where Demos Are Free Like They Should Be,) But This CompanyWon't Get One More Cent Of My Money. I Don't Care How Much You Enjoy These Games...Don't Install This One!!!
B006M4F67A|4.0|it's more challenging than the version I have on my laptop, but I like it and it's a lot of fun.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This is an entertaining game. If you like Iron Man you should try it.<br />One problem with play on a kindle is being able to fly and shoot down your attackers. I am new to this game and maybe need to practice.
B004GYY714|5.0|This has sooo many stations and it all buffers perfect on my kindle.  Everything on the app is very easy to use.  Good features!
B00821OX98|5.0|If you aren't expecting some award winning masterpiece you can easily enjoy watching this post-apocalyptic end of the world as we know it series.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Got &#34;Team of Rivals&#34; for my boyfriend a few years back.  Now, I bought this DVD for him and he said it follows a lot of the book.  Great acting, excellent period details.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|This amp worked great for a while, and then started having some serious issues.  Quality seems to be lacking.  If you only need something to last you a few months, this might be for you.
0143038419|5.0|I loved the book. I had seen the movie and wanted to read the book for a while after I realized that her writing style may actually be enjoyable. I loved following her on her journey. What is it like to be a 30-something year old woman who has, supposedly, all her ducks in order as American society says you should? What does American life have in store for me in just another decade? Well, apparently, it is full of insecurity just like every single human being on the planet, whether they're rich beyond belief or are in threat of dying from hunger and exhaustion.<br /><br />I love following people's life stories, especially if they are so contemplative about themselves as Gilbert is. I live vicariously through her as if her mistakes, dumb thought patterns that are in need of breaking, and realizations are my own.<br /><br />I think this is a great book for American women and women who feel they must conform to society's form of success or keeping up with apperances. This book is like a permissions slip for people to let go of what they think they need and remember all the different possibilities of life. I think many women relate to her... women who are in no dire circumstances, but realize that they &#34;NEED JESUS!&#34; or something deeper than just achieving what 95% of the world hasn't and cannot.<br /><br />What have I learned after reading this book?<br />- I enjoy food thoroughly every time I eat now. She makes eating food sound like a heaven-sent gift.<br />- My pursuit for a relationship with my God is simpler than my mind wants to make it out to be.<br /><br />If you are a disgruntled middle-aged woman and don't know why or just love reading people's stories, read this.
859037985X|5.0|Despite its boring text-book like cover I found the book an easy read, and for its position as the authoritative text quite accessible.<br /><br />I bought it mostly because I wanted to do something to support the Lua project but was surprised by how useful and readable it was.  The exercises were a handy addition - even tho I didn't do any of them - because it allowed me to check if I had missed understanding something in a chapter.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok so this is one of the best games ever but the creators should start making it like Xbox or maybe computer cuz I kinda play this A LOT an well after a while it can get boaring
B003B96AOW|5.0|I've never been a fan of Marvel figures because they always looked funny to me. But the Marvel Select line really nails the the comic book and movie likeness of many heroes and villains.<br /><br />Deadpool is a very cool piece to have in the collection. I'm not a fan of the fact this character uses guns, but the katanas and other blades are very cool.. I thought these things would be smaller based on images I saw, but apparently pictures do not do these figures justice. You need to see them in person. Absolutely amazing. Deadpool is very tall, coming in at nearly 8 inches in height!<br /><br />Gentle Giant is behind the sculpting of these figures and they will be releasing the new Star Wars Black series this year. I am excited!<br /><br />Upon seeing all of these figures in person I've purchased more of them! I don't think I want to take these guys out of the box. Mainly because I have no where to put them! Not to mention they just look awesome in the box already. These are not your typical 7\\" scale figures. The Marvel Select line is massive!<br /><br />I got mine from BigBadToyStore.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|One of the worst movies I've ever watched.  I read great reviews and was excited to see it.  To this day, over 10 years later, my husband still teases me...
B0027MJU00|3.0|I was a bit disappointed - I have read a few of Gillian Flynn novels, she is a great writer and I expected more.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room was really hard but you'll end up at the end anticipating the last move!It looks like a bunch of machines are trying to hide &quot;the Null energy source&quot; and it was really great with a ending that you'll never predict. I am looking forward to The Room2 or The Room Returns or something like that. Just because college kids made it doesn't mean it's gonna suck just sayin =)
B000F1IQN2|4.0|Good historical remake, I like this better than the older version. Someone talked about this movie recently and I wanted to see it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is the 1 and only app I really play.It is really awesome and fun! Thank u for making this awesome game.
0765325950|5.0|Although this may not have tied up all the story lines I had hoped, I still was very pleased with the way it ended. I was shocked at what happened with some of the main characters, even though their storylines were necessary.<br />Didn't exactly expect the end with Rand to happen the way it did, it made sense from the hints throughout the whole story.<br />I couldn't put it down, started it on the day it released and finished four days later, still talk about it with friends and family that have read it or just are finishing it.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This game is really fun.  I like that if you are stuck on what to do next, the hint will help you.
B00000JG41|5.0|Take Rock, Pop, Metal and Jazz and you have Mr. Bungle, unique to the max.  This is a must for any serious music collector or Mike Patton fan.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This Kindle Table Edition of Mahjong is colorful, challenging and addictive. I am a Mahjong addict with many version on my computer, phone and Kindle Fire HD. This is by far one of my favorites. If you like Mahjong, you will like this for your Kindle.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I really liked this movie. I didn't think it was going to be that good. It really impressed me. It's a must see.
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|Great Anime and great purchase if you are a fan of the original Neon Genesis Evangelion series. A must see take on the classic epic.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|Obviously this is a great record and was number one forever but it sounds soooo good on 180 gram. Love blasting this!
B004EC5IUW|4.0|Great Anime and great purchase if you are a fan of the original Neon Genesis Evangelion series. A must see twist on the classic epic.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|This movie is just fun to watch. Great action and incredible story. Especially if you love Lincoln in genera! Must watch!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|really loved all the songs,  is how the film was seeing through, I recommend to all fans of the films.
B0013J1WKY|5.0|Such an amazing dvd. Christina is raw talent I love her performance in this and all of the wardrobe! Must watch!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Best book I have read in a while. Honest depictions of struggles through mental illness. I highly recommend this book.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Watch it all the time.. even while I'm just cleaning up around the house! Music is amazing and I love this series of Batman!
B00AW28HF6|5.0|I definitely enjoyed reading this novel. It is a compelling thriller which will make stay up all night! The story drew me in. I  enjoyed different locations the author was writing about. I can't believe it is the first novel of this author. I was sure I was reading a work of a well-established author. Way to go, Mr. Gallagher!<br /><br />If you're looking for a good spy novel, this book is right for you.
B000093FLA|5.0|Brad Pitt is amazing in this movie. I see something new and different every time I watch it. Must buy!
B008ODZNLG|5.0|Story of sushi chef, his small restaurant, and the life long dedication to the art of making sushi.  Very interesting story on his determination and views of what perfect sushi is and how its a life long goal to reach.
B00AAQ7LP6|5.0|From start to finish this is brilliant. I love the behind the scenes between songs giving us a glimpse into her life and what she goes through. The wardrobe for this tour was incredible!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I needed this book!  The power of positive thinking is amazing.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is having a tough time, and wants to figure out how to turn it around.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Such an incredible movie. I like to put it on while I'm falling asleep because the music is so perfect! Ryan Gosling is a genius actor!
B004B3BEHU|5.0|I am new to Rihanna's music, but this CD did not disappoint me. I want to hear more. I love downloading MP3 songs!
B00376AVAS|5.0|This record gets me every single time! I love Sade and I look forward to adding more of her vinyls to my collection!
B009MYARIK|3.0|This book is humerous at times but overall just okay. I have enjoyed other Sophie Kinsella books more than this one.
B000QFAG6W|5.0|There is just something about vinyl that makes everything sound so much better! I am happy to have added this record to my collection.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo is an amazing work of ART and FILM.  The topic does not tell the story of the depth of this film - Didn't want to see it - Glad I did!
0007466064|5.0|Excellent books! this is the UK printed copy and is the second of the 5th book. If you like power struggles and good old fashioned backyard brawls then this is the series for you.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Worth watching, definitely recommend to friends. Always something suspenseful and plot is well thought out. Going to watch Season 2!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I have never hated a book before. This is my first. I couldn't WAIT to get through it. Our book club picked it and I felt I had to read it since I was hosting. I ended up doing a lot of skimming. I'm a person who is simply offended by the \\"F\\" word. I first decided to listen to it. Bad choice. Every time that word came up (and it comes up A LOT!) I felt like I was being slapped in the face. I quit listening and thought if I HAVE to read this book those words would be easier to gloss over if I had to READ it. I couldn't focus on the story enough because I was dodging words that are offensive to me which were several times a page. Thank goodness that experience is OVER! I'll never read another Gillian Flynn book EVER again. I would think someone as creative as a writer would be able to create some other way of conveying such intense feelings.
B0087ITBPC|4.0|I'm not sure why people feel they have to put profanity in a great movie. It just ruins it! It even sounded awkward- like it was just stuck in there all of a sudden for no reason. It was such a great movie without the profanity. I like the psychology of it.
B00459EZLW|5.0|I so very much wanted to see a season three but &#34;syfy&#34; channel just had to mess with it and go to wrestling and reality shows, moving SGU around until no one knew when it was on. I will just entertain myself with re-running the show in my living room when I need a fix.
B000LXHK22|4.0|All but the profanity, I liked the movie alot. Great setting! Beautiful countryside! I love Russell Crowe. The movie was fun to watch.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This works amazing! I was sincerely shocked by how much it transformed my indoor photography. Everything is crisp, beautifully lit and clean. The only thing I would say I wish this flash had, was the ability to turn the flasher to the left or right, but it's definitely not a deal breaker if you know how to work a camera. :) HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone looking to achieve beautiful indoor photography.
B0017ANAZO|4.0|I've seen  this before but I wanted to see it aagain but couldn't find it in stores.  It was a  great copy
B006BDHAX0|2.0|THIS is a most irritating app. The shutdown in the middle of a game really messes up my game concentration.To me this is a major aggravation.
B003Z0BWRM|3.0|I love when an author has unique take on the genre. This is my favourite genre to read and this is a very unique and well thought out and written story line. A great read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What's up with this twisted couple?  I suppose someone out there has a marriage like this. But I sure wouldn't want to put this idea in their heads.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't even say enough about how good this show is....season 3 has left me on the edge of my seat!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I like how the story was told, it's a he-said, she-said style. You get to know the characters and be sickened by them. It was a different kind of read for me, and I liked it. It might just be fiction but it happens in real life: that we can do anything, ANYTHING, if we put our minds into it. If we want something desperately. If we were crazy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game for people with a creative mind. There are mobs like the creeper that blows up and the skeleton who shoots arrows from bows. Mine up ores like iron and diamond. This is a wonderful game
B00992CF6W|5.0|Good times use to be unfun then they made a mine craft I found a perfect one I have not be seen a mincraft here is a cool tablet and kindle fire game hope you enjoy
B0091REZMW|4.0|I don't understand some of the things on the game but just keep playing. I like the graphics. I like games where  u look for thing as.just not sure understand all the things of thegame
B001I10ABE|5.0|This is how 'Metallica' aka 'the Black album' is meant to be heard. Never before have the songs hit you so hard. I'm hearing nuances that I've never heard before, even on my relatively budget turntable. If you own a turntable and like the album, buy this while you still can. I promise you won't regret it. If you don't own a turntable and truly care about sound quality, what the heck are you waiting for? BUY ONE!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game.  Makes me feel like I own my own horse without the cost of purchasing one and without all of the expenses.
B00AR9GKJY|5.0|This record is spectacular. All of the reviewers before me have identified how great the actually music is. How is the LP version, though? It's GREAT! From the start of Luminol, it's magnificent. I can hear every little nuance Steven wants me to hear. It's the way this album is meant to be listened to. Also, the packaging and artwork is beautiful. Very heavy-duty LPs with artistic sleeves, and the gatefold is just plain awesome. This was 30 of the best dollars I've ever spent on an LP package. If you have a turntable, don't think twice, BUY IT! If you don't have a turntable.... BUY ONE!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I feel like a broken record lately on movie reviews, but they are all just so &#34;blah&#34;. I mean this one is okay, but it feels like I've seen this same movie done 100 times. I like the actors, and the movie was as watchable as others it has imitated.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I am totally hooked on this fantasy. The only downside is having to wait for Rothfuss to complete it. He is a meticulous writer and he takes his time. Totally engrossing.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It's got strategy, puzzles, and even requires a bit of coordination to complete some levels. One of my favorite apps for ipad, kindle and iphone!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very interesting read. Could not put it down. Heaven sounds wonderful and the book seems believable because it was very factual and written by a doctor.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Season 3 is simply amazing. Many questions answered and many more to be. This is really THE season when the show absolutely grabs and never lets you go. I am very thankful that I waited until all of them were out before I became a follower because I simply would not have been able to endure the agony of waiting each week.
193700788X|5.0|Thanks for the years of fun with this series.  I have loned the books to family and have started others on the series.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|I highly recommend this book and its philosophy.  The author uses real-world examples from his own experience as a corporate entrepreneur and his frankness is helpful and refreshing. Whether you are a budding entrepreneur, an investor in start-ups or a manager in a company working towards innovation or re-design... this is a must-read book.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|I did not know much about this movie before seeing it.  But I remember walking out of theater after seeing it first time thinking-- that was a great movie!!  My favorite movie is The Shawshank Redemption.  This story about the close friendship that develops between the 2 main characters hits a similar note, if not quite as brilliant as Shawshank.  Highly recommended
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great and has great movement for control. Great graphics, great challenges. Me and my daughter love this game.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Easy game to occupy idle time. I enjoy the colors and the different game options. I am happy this game was suggested for me!
B00005JKGK|5.0|I like this movie so much and think it gives such a wonderful representation of the immigrant generation and first generation Americans that I enjoy watching it again and again.  My old copy was no longer in good shape, so I ordered a new one so I can keep on watching it.
B00338QENI|3.0|I thought this would be much more rewarding based on the amount of press coverage it received. Although it started strong, it began to flag less than halfway through and I had to move on to something else.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Didn't read any reviews before starting the book, so was confused for a while by its structure. Needs a bit of an explanation for the uninitiated in a preface. The stories were each a great read, but what is it with this birth mark that tries to tie all the chief characters together? I'm not a mystic...I don't get it. Finally, I personally like a definitive ending to the books I read. This one just seems to slow to a stop...as though there will be some more chapters. Perhaps there will be in a sequel ?<br /><br />OK - now you know my personal preferences and biases, but what about an overall impression? A GREAT BOOK WRITTEN WITH SHEER GENIUS. READ IT...YOU WILL BE FASCINATED.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|GREAT Game it made me think something most games do not do. Bring on more please. Make them even more challenging an longer
1597801585|4.0|There is no doubt that The Windup Girl has a lot going for it.  The sheer volume of ideas and extrapolations are extraordinary.  Most fascinating to me is the idea of a \\"calorie world\\" - nominally the base unit of currency and energy in Bacigalupi's post-petroleum dystopia.  Thus, the big agricultural companies who control the seed supply control the political powers of the world.  In this author's hands, it means that these companies also manufacture pests and diseases that kill all the natural flora of the world, in order to absolutely control the supply of food (and therefore maintain their power).  When they catch wind of a new fruit that has appeared in the Bangkok markets, they are understandably worried.  How can it survive the manufactured blights?  Where did the genetic information to create the fruit come from?<br /><br />Although the calorie company angle drives much of the narrative, it's the other details swirling around that make the book<br />so interesting.  Top of the list of these ideas is the titular windup girl.  She is a synthetic organism, designed to be a \\"perfect\\" secretary (which could include such services as bodyguard and sex toy).  Left behind in Thailand by her former Japanese owner, she is left to perform in a sado-masochist sex show (as the victim) and try to survive in an environment far hotter than she was designed for.  With a typical eye to detail, Bacigalupi creates a creature with very fine pores (because it makes her skin smoother and therefore sexier) and then lets the consequences of such a design (she annot sweat much and therefore is very prone to overheating) drive her motivation and the action surrounding her character.  Many setup-driven story points are used, which is what gives the novel its edge and authenticity, and makes the characters real.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, the story works more as analogy (allegory?) than as science fiction.  There are a number of scientific implausibilities in these setups.  For example, although I love the idea of food becoming a base energy unit, it implies that this world has forgotten about nuclear power.  The lack of vehicles implies they have forgotten how to generate fuels from CO2 or water - technologies that even Nazi Germany in the midst of the Allied bombing campaign was able to continue to use.  Yet the supposedly all-powerful Agricompanies in this novel can't afford to fly their executives around?<br /><br />Similarly, the genetic makeup of a rogue fruit should be trivial to elucidate for a company that creates synthetic pandemics. I guess these kinds of details are not the point of the book, but the entire story would have worked better on a<br />colonization world rather than on near-future Earth.<br /><br />Most people will not have any problem with details such as these.  A bigger problem is with the characters.  None of the main characters are particularly likable.  In fact, all but one or two are thoroughly awful human beings who deserve whatever horrible fate is in store for them.  It makes it hard to generate any kind of narrative flow to the story when you don't care about the character nor sympathise with his/her goals.  Even with that caveat, though, I'm giving the book 4/5 stars.  As I mentioned already, I don't think it's the characters or their actions that are the interesting part of this book, it's the sheer volume of ideas and images that make it worth reading and pondering over.
B000FC1HQY|5.0|i discovered this book while searching for books on african history. once i started reading i couldn't stop. this is a wonderful mix of humor and history. the story of the author's upbringing in africa and her family is a unique and very entertaining as well as education picture of africa during this time period. i have since read her second book and am now reading her third.
B001XV09UG|5.0|For some reason this film makes me nervous every time I see it.  Cruise and Kidman are great as the married couple and as usual for Kubrick, the direction and cinematography are sublime.
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|I like Blake's voice and preferred a couple of songs more than others.  I don't like when it sounds like shouting.  I like a more romantic sound.
0887306667|5.0|I really enjoyed readying this quick blast of knowledge. It's a must read for any marketing team or anyone in general. Great strategies for marketing business or yourself.
B006M4F67A|2.0|98% of the time the game freezes and is forced to close.  The few games I have been able to complete have been great fun but the others are so disappointing when they freeze half way through that I have stopped playing 247 Mahjong.
1591841666|5.0|This dude is cool as ice. I love all his books. This is another great one of many. I highly recommend.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Love this music. Would recommend to anyone. Very poetic and soulfull!  A70's vibe as this was when it was recorded
B00AQB6YDA|5.0|It's a bad ass classic movie. It is one of my favorite westerns of all time. What was it like back then?
B007VPLNGW|5.0|S u per cute game, easy to learn and fun to play. Graphics are good and levels progress steadily. It works well on my kindle fire which is nice, not all apps I have do.
B004856SQ8|5.0|Despite people feeling it doesn't capture what the original A-Team was, the movie is a great action flick to just sit down and enjoy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Finally decided to watch the Walking Dead and ended up watching all 3 seasons in 4 days.  I cannot wait until the fall to see what happens!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|THIS BOOK HIT HOME FOR ME IN MAY WAYS, dealing with mental illness is both hard and true THE WAY MATTHEW QUI K WRITES IT IS VERY CON ICE ! A page Turner !
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|Says its not avaible for my kindle fire ?<br /><br />Why offer it here if you dont support the fire tablet ?<br /><br />Way to NOT go about getting people excited<br /><br />very dissappointed
B008602KQI|4.0|It was a very good movie. This is the second time I've seen it. It has a good plot and the acting is great!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I just made a b and z college and it had every thing I wanted to use! EF and stickers and you could draw and you could change and Color the border!you could make the pictures blury and different sizes and so much more! you should get this app!
B000BZISTE|5.0|This is one of the best dark comedies that has ever been filmed.  Don't judge the movie by the series which, in its own way, is very good, but it's much more inconsistent than this movie.  The movie is all about dark humor.  It's a movie whose humor is timeless.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book I can't wait to read the next one!I totally recommend that you read the book before you see the movie because the movie is nothing like the book. The biggest reason I am mad because the book the cornucopia is gold and in the movie it is silver. Over all I think everyone should read this book!!!
0316789720|5.0|When I was in grade school my favorite pastime was drawing or, doodling really. One year I received this Ed Emberley book for my birthday and I don't think it left my side for months. I must have drawn everything in it a thousand times. I made up stories about everything and made little flip books. I am elated to find it here on Amazon. I bought for my son but, really it's a gift for both of us. I can't wait to doodle again!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Nice light romance. Kept me coming back.  Would recommend for those looking or for a quick read, would be great on a trip/vacation.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|My granddaughter and I played this for two hours straight during a trip and time just flew by. Very fun to play although she got more answers than I did but that would be expected of a nine year old.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|I am not sure why people are saying there are no directions.  There are and, if you read them, you can figure it out.  It took me a bit (I like to do the scan method and that doesn't work on this game!)  So, you have to be red...is that really a big deal?  You can change to multiple players, quite easily!  For a free app, its great....to pay a buck, worth it also!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I have nothing bad to say about this book. It is extremely well written with an amazing plotline that was fast paced and exciting.<br />The characters were good and realistic, along with good themes about myth and reality.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I began reading this book when my elderly aunt had reached a critical stage in her condition, that of cancer that had spread through the majority of her internal organs.  We a r w Roman Catholics. Steeped throughout our lives in an eternity life after wedges our bodies but even she had questioned this nearing the end and I assured her that our faith was valid, even though I have often been skeptical.  It was my plan  to read this book to obtain reassurance for her.  Unfortunately, she passed away 2days ago, before I finished reading it but I know she is in that beautiful realm where her pain no longer exists and I am at peace, once more with my faith.
1477419497|5.0|I truly enjoyed Murder on the Cote d'Azur, - I actually was not able to put the book down.<br />It was the first book I read written by Susan Kiernan - Lewis. At not the last. As soon as I finished Murder on the Cote d' Azur, I could not resist reading Murder a la carte. Also a great mystery book. It will keep you guessing till the very end.  Excellent plot.<br />Both books are very well written, the author creates an unforgivable atmosphere , and takes us to the beautiful land - France.<br />I am going to start on Murder in Provence , and I am sure it will be most enjoyable. Great author. Another Agatha Christie?
B000JMKRKC|4.0|Very well written. A good novel for the person who loves the written word and its many nuances. I think it more suitable for a female audience, but I still enjoyed it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I bought the movie for my daughter because she loves it.<br />this was a Christmas gift for her, and she love sharing it with friends.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, had a trip, from South Africa to Moscow and st Petersburg last year, but to read about places one has actually seen or been inside, brought the history to life. Nice to read about life in Russia apart from heavy heavy novels.nothing I didn't like and I would recommend it to anyone who has been or are going to Russia. I'm halfway through the second book already.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My wife and I were day one watchers of this show and loved it from the beginning.  I highly recommend this show if you're into the zombie trend.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This movie is about how Lincoln fought to pass the 13th amendment. It gives insight to the politics of that time but it also shows the kind of personality Lincoln had. It humanizes him more than any other film because he is not treated as a superhero or a myth but it shows how he handled the stress of his presidency and the perseverance and politicking he had to do and deal with in order to get his amendment passed. This movie has also has moments of humor with Tommy Lee Jones' role. The dialogue is quick and it takes a little bit to catch on to the conflict this movie interprets but it is nevertheless entertaining. I find that time in history interesting so I enjoyed this movie. Perhaps it should have one the Oscar.
B000WQW988|5.0|Wife loves Nirvana and says this is the best concert of them, we have the others to, satisfied, as described
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|This movie is about how during the late 70's about ten Americans escaped the American Embassy in Iran when it was sieged by Ayatollah Komemi's people. They managed to get to the Canadian Embassy and find a secret refuge there. The movie follows the chronicle of the CIA's plan to get them out of there alive and that's where the suspense lies. It's a well written movie.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book reveals the way to really love, live and be responsible for your life.<br />I think everyone should read this book
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I liked this book.  Oprah underlining did not bother me at all.  I am not an expert backpacker.  I enjoyed the story not because of the technicalities of the PCT but the real story,which has nothing to do with the trail.

B000AOEMXM|4.0|First of all the sure spent a lot of money on the packaging, I feel like I got my moneys worth. I watched the series when it was on TV but I don't know if I saw all of the episodes. So far I have watched three seasons and all of the DVD have played with no problems. The episodes with comentairy I watch twice because you get behind the sean information.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie arrived on time and in good condition.This is a great movie for the entire family. Be sure to watch the interview at the end of the movie. Shocking!

B006TF6WAM|5.0|As you go on the journey with Harold, the seemingly simple prose develops into beautifully-crafted description and as the country is revealed, we also similarly see Harold's life be revealed, in all its flawed nature. This is a book I have already recommended to at least a dozen people, as it is easy to read, yet complicated to digest. It is unique, compelling and a joy to undertake.
0345803507|5.0|This book was in great condition. I was very happy with how fast i recieved it and the great condition the book was in.thank you

B00B1MSLDE|4.0|When I discovered that one of my most favorite albums, Bryter Layter by Nick Drake was going to be re-released on vinyl in a special edition box, I was ecstatic and ordered it the day it was out. I just received the box set today and I have to say that the estate of Nick Drake did a wonderful job at at remastering. The sound quality is excellent, and is on very high quality 180 gram vinyl, and has the original inner bag reprinted on a higher quality inner sleeve. It also comes in the original cover and back cover of course.<br /><br />Some of the extra things included:<br />-A full sized reproduction of a \\"Bryter Layter\\" shop poster (that would have been used to advertise the album).<br />-A scan of an original concert list showing many acts playing in the area at the time (including some high class acts like Pink Floyd and Fairport Convention as well as Nick Drake of course).<br />-A scan of Nick's own set list for the handful of concerts he played.<br />-A scan of the original master-tapes with download codes of the album on the back (including a download code for Nick's own personal copy of Bryter Layter, wow!)<br /><br />As great as all of these extra things are, there are some minor missteps; firstly, there is no lyric sheet included with the album. This is a pretty inexcusable mistake on their part. For the hefty price of the box set (at around 60 dollars here in the US) there should have been a printed lyric sheet to the album, even if it was on the back of the shop poster, like the poster included with the Beatles White Album. Secondly, the album cover itself is embossed with small bumps (just like the original release back in '70), however they seem to have over embossed the cover; The bumps become really noticeable in Sunlight which sometimes makes it a bit awkward to view the cover (or back cover). Another thing is that in the video showing the un-boxing of the album, the box was in a clamp-shell case, but the box now is just two separate pieces. No biggie, but just something the mention.<br /><br />All in all, if you are a big fan of Nick Drake, and like the little extras that come included with the album, then I would definitely recommend purchasing this. If you're just looking for a copy of Nick Drake's Bryter Layter, then maybe skip on this one and wait until the album is released as a standalone, like they eventually did with Pink Moon.
0812973992|5.0|You will meet characters that enter your soul as you travel with them throughout many neighborhoods in New York City. The humanity and emotion is raw and shows again our common connections no matter what the social status.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE...TRUE STORY...AMAZING....NOT MANY MOVIES KEEP MY ATTENTION LIKE THIS ONE..THERE WERE SOME REAL SCARY MOMENTS
1476719071|2.0|If you are an adult of above average intelligence, do not waste your time with this book.  The writing is low quality, the plot is repetitive, and the characters are unlikeable (and miserable!) for most of the book. It's like the whole thing sprang from the mind of an 8th grader who's spent a few too many hours watching MTV reality shows.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I t brings back the days of arcade games where you spend hours, if your not careful, and do not realize you are addicted. Great Game.

1400069807|4.0|Good insight into how the food industry decides how much salt, sugar, and fat to put into their products and how those magical ingredients hook consumers into buying more and more!  As someone who's bounced from diet to diet and noticed my cravings fluctuate with each one, it was nice to learn why exactly that was and just how strong these three ingredients impact our body chemistry.  For instance, sugar (the most powerful of the three) isn't just \\"sensed\\" with the tip of the tongue like they teach in many grade schools, but with the entire tongue, top of the mouth, esophagus, and even intestinal tract!  It's no wonder they cram as much of it as possible in our foods despite the grave warnings from nutritionists (one breakfast cereal actually clocked in at 68% sugar by weight)!<br /><br />The only reason Michael Moss's book lost a star is cause I felt some parts dragged on just a little too long, as well as other parts being rather dry, making getting to the next interesting fact or story a chore at times.  Thankfully it wasn't that often, and considering the length and topic of the book, certainly forgivable.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in either: salt, sugar, and fat's affect on the body, the history behind the rise of the food industry, or in another way companies manipulate consumers, I'd strongly recommend this book.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Like other reviews it's nothing new. The author basically just repeat the same story.  I left the book halve done for about a month and then just finished it. Really hope volume 3 has something new.
B009INAGY0|4.0|More aggressive than Leprosy.  You can hear that their music is already going to have some changes.  Still a great album.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|Seriously, how is it that all of the good shows get cancelled?  This show was GREAT... great cast, interesting characters, wildly entertaining, great plots, etc., etc.... Everything you could ask for in a show, and yet, cancelled after one year!  What a bunch of Yahoos - those who decide what stays and what goes in T.V. land.  The movie Serenity was also great.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Chilling, haunting, couldn't put it down. A good story, although I thought that &#34;Dark Places&#34; was a little more suspenseful.

B00AWQEKIK|5.0|This 4 cd retrospective of Stephen Still's career from Buffalo Springfield, Manassas and CS&N is a revelation of the talent and impact Stephen had on the social/political consciousness of an entire generation of Americans. The selections for these cd's span his entire career and are filled with the soaring vocal harmonies and strong guitar work that showcases his talent. There are amazing previously unreleased performances both live and studio versions that will leave any fan shaking their head in awe at the quality of the voice, the guitar, the lyrics.

B008IGP8QE|5.0|My daughter is obsessed with Austin & Ally (particularly Austin!). She was so excited to get this, and she LOVES it. She is always asking to listen to it, and even at two years old, memorized many of the words from the songs. She loves to dance, and this is perfect dancing music. Many of the songs from the show are on the CD.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Serious comedy with moral serial killer, Dexter, is better than most movies and about a billion times better than network crime thrillers. The characters are well drawn, Tropes come into play only as ironic jokes and best yet, you have no idea what is going to happen next. IMO not for kids under 16. Comedy comes into it even as the awful things happen, a bit like real life.
B008ETOSYI|4.0|was a great movie! what I liked about this was the fact that it is not a normal role for Zac Efron, a kind of change of pace. One which I think he pulled off very well. It has some sad parts, a little bit of action, romance and an awesome ending so all in all a great movie!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Well s tree rests in but not tiresome.  Great for sitting around M. do recommend it to all levels and all types of mammsls
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I couldn't believe a child could be so abused in an orphanage run by a church but this story is full of humor and pathos touched with Scotland in the first half of the 20th century and beyond.<br />Although I figured out the secret in the plot well before it was revealed, I still read this book enthusiastically to the end.  The descriptions of some incidents were hysterical and I woke my dogs by laughing out loud several times at the turn of a phrase making me clearly see what was happening.<br />I highly recommend this book.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|LEGOs! How could you miss?! - Well, I suppose you could. But my 2 year-old granddaughter took to them like fish to water. It was her first set and WE spend hours playing! Two for one, as they say. :) - Great price too!
0823016714|5.0|I saw this book months ago and one day I decided to buy it wondering if it would be a right choice. Well, I wasn´t wrong. It´s a great book.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|... in the cameo role of the disgusting ship's cook. He should have been nominated at least for \\"Best Supporting Actor.\\" Of course, the tiger deserved that even more, and all three avatars of Pi were incredible. The oldest Pi, the university teacher of religion in Canada, had a face nobody could distrust or dislike.<br /><br />Needless to say, the cinematography was beyond incredible. I can only imagine how stunning it must be in 3-D; I watched it on a flat screen Panasonic 42-inch plasma and my jaw dropped dozen of times.<br /><br />And that's it. Enough, shall I say, to join the thousand-plus reviewers who have awarded five stars? Only for the technical accomplishments, however. I found the \\"preaching\\" silly and annoying, just as i feared I would from having read the children's book upon which the film is based. To author Yann Martel and to director Ang Lee, I only this to say: Listen to Pi's Father! \\"Use your Reason!\\"
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Love the action. Need more ground flying. And more upgrades, and easy upgrades. Villains are good, some more aircrafts would be cool.
0142419400|5.0|A very very cute read. I so wish I could have a first kiss/love experience as Anna did. With all the hype surrounding \\"YA\\" novels, this here is a definite winner when it comes to establishing a REAL relationship between two young individuals fighting their attraction for each other. The plot was all believable and relatable and maybe predictable but who cares it was good. I did not hate nor dislike any characters as the archetypes of many books like these tend to influence a reader to do. The characters that were \\"difficult\\" were necessary. The situations were so real and grounded that it felt like I knew versions of these people in my own life that went through similar situations in struggling to get what they wanted without hurting anyone. Its an easy and lovely read. Highly recommend if you just want a lighthearted read about first loves.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|As a fan of the Jack Reacher series, I was sure that Tom Cruise was too \\"pretty\\" to pull it off, let alone the differences in physique.<br />I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.<br />Although I think there are other actors who may have come closer to the original character, Tom did a very good job with the role.<br />The series makes this a perfect first step for a series.
1476712042|1.0|I am sad that I bought into the hoopla surrounding novels like these that emerged from the Fifty Shades of Grey world de tour book movement.<br /><br />The characters are ill developed, so unbelievable, not even remotely worth caring for/about. I am tired of the pitiful virgin nymph of a woman whose so average in life but mysteriously wins the heart of the most beautiful man/every girl wants/desires and such without doing nothing but locking eyes with him.....need I say more? There were passionate sex scenes? I don't remember....some fighting? Don't remember that either.<br /><br />In all honesty it was a massive bore. But I bought it (waste of money) so I forced myself to read it (waste of time).<br /><br />I hate to give bad reviews, but I must. Books like these should be available for the public to read for FREE on websites where developing authors share their work and get much needed FEEDBACK on how to improve their work because it could have used major re-working to make this even remotely \\"okay\\" to publish. Shame shame shame.
B00BWC1UZE|5.0|J T putting out more fun music. A good listen, some fun songs. And some that really stick in your head. Great pop album.

B009NG1Q96|5.0|This writer is so talented. The book grabs reader from the first sentence to the last. I didn't put it down, finished the book in one afternoon. Excited for the next!
B008XG1X18|4.0|pinterest is better than i expected and I'm glad I joined  haven't been on much, so that's all I have for now
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|i like this because the numbers are big and i often have my kindle next to me more than a calculator.
B00BVDNKSY|4.0|This is a fun, high-intensity, sensation-overload, reaction-time style game.  Akin to games like Geometry Wars 1&2.  It could have easily have been a 5 start game for me, since I love these kinds of game, but it fails miserably in two main categories, and I almost gave it 3 stars.<br />1) The opening level is way too hard.  The learning curve for this game is extremely steep.  My nieces and nephew, who love games, will have no room for early successes to learn the basics and progress the challenge curve.  They will get bombarded with failure just trying to reach the opening 10sec mark.  Poor game design.<br />2) This game feels like it was designed for the sensitivity of a mouse & keyboard, and not a touch screen.  The touch screen simply does not grant you the level of control necessary to navigate the harder difficulties.  The precision and timing needed to navigate the later levels is extremely high, but the input method is just not on par.  The amount of over-aiming or under-aiming really takes away from the experience.  Small aiming corrections are all but impossible.  This game could learn from console shooters and needs to implement a little degree of aim-magnetism to help with the lack of precision coming from the touch screen.<br /><br />Despite those two major flaws... I cant help but still like the game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I usually don't buy play puzzle games and fin  them kind of boring but this isn't your average puzzle game. It has huge 3D puzzles that wrap you up in mystery of the Room. The graphics also help give off the feel they you aren't playing a conventional puzzle game.<br />Some parts of this game had me utterly befuddled, but with time and some outward thinking anyone can unlock the secrets of this mysterious puzzle game
B005GG0MIS|5.0|What a great book.  It covers history that occurred during my lifetime, yet most of it escaped me.  Books like this show why you cannot trust media and commentators that are contemporary with history as it happens.  Too much is covered up or classified.  Thanks to the authors for bringing to light stories that explain and uncover events that seem puzzling at the time.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A novel well written on all levels. The main character, Victoria, is profoundly affected by her life within the foster care system.  She has been abused, neglected and dragged from home to home. She finally finds love but crumbles and commits an act that changes her life for decades.  Through her love of flowers and their Victorian meanings she finds herself, forgiveness, happiness and love
B00127RAJY|4.0|First, I want to say this is not easy. If you think you can do this and have never worked out before...don't.<br /><br />Second, Jillian levels are easy to follow. Main issue is they become so boring after a week.<br /><br />I think it's helpful. I have lost 10lbs but I have been dieting hardcore too.
B000FA5STS|5.0|i like this book it keep me on the edge of my set all through the book i eill try and new one.
B0093WVND4|5.0|My granddaughter is in the first grade and we will read this novel together. Dahl is excellent writer for kids.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Equals Harry Potter, and caters for a bit more adult audience. Fantasy at its best, even love and romance. Good read!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book had a lot of action, the characters are real and the story was hard to put down. I can't wait for the movie, the special effects should be great.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|An excellent book, like the first one in the series. But I do not believe that this series could only be a trilogy. The timeline of the story hardly advances at all, albeit for storytelling purposes it does not matter.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It answers episodes from the first book. It had great character development and was difficult to put it aside. The second and third book really need to be read one after the other.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|The Costumes were beautiful. The characters get lost in this film, they lack depth... I guess if I had not already watched the older version on &#34;TCM&#34; I might not have been so disappointed in this movie... I expected it to be great, I wanted it to be great! I couldn't wait to see it... If I had watched this first I would have never purchased it...
B006M4F67A|5.0|If you enjoy playing Mahjong, I'm sure you will like this game.  I do enjoy this one very much!  Have fun!
B003UYV08E|5.0|Part 1 was very good and this part simply builds on that and keeps the action rolling and story line building.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great variety of games. Colors are wonderful. Great challenges as you go further into the games. The best one yet.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Talk about a twist, this movie will have you guessing from start to finish and rooting for the good guys.

B004LWZW42|5.0|I know there are hard core enthusiasts but even for the average Joe this movie will keep you entertained with action.
B003QNXPUK|4.0|While i enjoy the invisible shields, i can really only recommend their new product line! If you are trying to save money though, this still comes with the live time replacement! (which i have used)
0894803123|5.0|I purchase this book for use with my ice cream maker. The recipes are great for a one person household. Usually yields about 1 1/2 quarts.
B0016492BW|5.0|recently introduced my 6 & 8 year old sons to this beloved classic treasure!  we were busting our guts laughing! and still quoting lines from the movie months later!
B004R2DS9C|5.0|We bought this for our young (6 yrs) grandson. He LOVES Legos!!! It is great, but he doesn't use it as much as I tho't he would. So if you need a good storage box, this is it, but our grandson plays with his so much, his folks bought him a big table and an organizer with drawers (b/c he has so much!) and he did not use it as much as a child who only plays with it occasionally, or does not have a lot of tools for pretend/play. Seems so many children today have way more than they can even use, and birthdays/Christmas rolls around and you want to bless them, but sometimes the stuff just sits there unused. I would recommend this for a child who does not have everything.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|It is ridiculous that I have put so much time into this game and I now gave to QUIT because I can't go on without paying actual money to get the different gems that I need to hut ponies or buildings. That's just wrong!
1594746168|4.0|Wow, not knowing what to expect I was first impressed with the quality of the book, from the way the pages feel and the quality of the paper and illustrations it's simply first class from the moment I touched it.<br /><br />It's history, vision, twisted and amazing all rolled up in one. Imagination, art, insane? You'll have to be the judge, I for one went from stunned to impressed and back to stunned. First class work.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I have had 2 different anti virus programs (AVG and Antivirus and Mobile Security by TrustGo Mobile Inc.) inform me that this program is infected.
0786891084|5.0|This book is among the best I've read. I cried, I laugh and got desperate with the so well made characters. I finished a couple days ago and still cant shake it. Every single character is so real they almost pop out of the book. This should be more than 5 stars.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Every once in a while I find a GREAT book.  I did with this one.  Don't listen to negative reviews about this book.  I'm not a Sentimentalist but I still loved it.  People who hate books like this probably also hated Life of PI, or the Poisonwood Bible.  Enough said about people like that...they want a fast read where they do not need to use their brain, or they are soulless.  If you have a soul and a brain, you'll love Shantaram!
B009MYARIK|5.0|I  a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella! This book is so fun. It is filled with like able characters and set in beautiful locations! I highly recommend!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This beast tears through any game, you get vastly diminishing returns for gaming with any of the more expensive chips.  I overclocked this to 4.2, and it is everything you could want and more.  I have built a handful of computers with this chip and some of AMD's finest.  If you got the money, spring for the Intel.<br /><br />If you feel the need for an i7, the 3770k is a great chip as well.  Only real advantage to the 3770k is slightly more cache and hyperthreading, both of which games do not tend to use much, if at all.  Video rendering, Folding@home, Milkyway@home, all appreciate the hyperthreading and additional cache.
B00B0U2SFE|1.0|This version is FAULTY. I did not get a chance to look at and when I did it was too late to return it. It's a POS. The 30 day return policy is fine but if a product is faulty there shouldn't be any time limit.
B00B1OEP32|5.0|As in, without music. As long as you love me was why I bought this album acoustic but the whole album sounds great this way.
0547848412|3.0|I bought this book hoping to skip the movie but didn't find it lived up to the hype. For me the info on the religions tended to bog down the story line. I know that they gave depth and explained parts of the reasoning behind the actions of the main character but, for me, they slowed down my interest in the story and I thought about quitting the book. That's not like me.  I usually finish what I start and eventually understood why they were in there at the finish but because it dragged so I almost didn't find it out. I usually like learning about diverse cultures and religions but the way it was written dragged. So I guess I will rent the movie and hope for the best. It wasn't a total wash but I was hoping for more.
B0013GH99K|5.0|I owned this cd before and adored it, but when it was stollen out of my car, I was floored. Now I don't have to worry about that.

B0066W1AZK|3.0|I thought it would have a quick tip or learning session since none of us know how to play and my kids wanted to learn. Will likely look for an app that teaches more for now and maybe some back to this one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was so excited to finally watch all 3 seasons back to back. What a wonderful story and the cast is awesome! Maggie Smith is exceptional and her humorous is above and beyond!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Downloaded this app onto my android powered tablet. It is really neat. Very graphic and pleasant to see it.<br />Love it !!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, I liked that it wasn't a typical or &#34;standard formula&#34; romantic comedy...The chemistry between the main characters was great, good casting really made this one.<br /><br />Three Surprising Things...<br />1. DeNiro is in it...<br />2. Bradley Cooper is a good actor...<br />3. it's based on a book!!
B006M4F67A|4.0|This is a pretty good app as far as Mahjong goes. So far they have not asked me to buy extras.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I think the game is really cute. It's fun to play and pass the time. Nice graphics and bright colors.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I just love this CD so much, my husband have one and I needed one for myself and brought another one for my brother, he will love it too.......I have it in my IPAD but I need a backup and nothing like the real deal to back up any problem with machines.....haaaaaa.....old way of doing so.......
B000FC12ZA|4.0|Although the info provided was awesome, the author jumped back and forth from point to point leaving huge gaps in her journey with little or no continuity to the story.  Otherwise, very good.
193700788X|1.0|I can't believe the way this book flowed! Really......the beach, the devil, all of the old characters.  And if this is how the story was supposed to end, what was the point of the entire vampire world and about. 10 of the previous books, oh wait  I hear it I hear CH laughing all the way to the bank because we all were sucked into buying books that amount to nothing but money making filler!  I feel totally cheated and wish I had never read any of these books!
B002EMESSM|3.0|Then you'll be quite pleased! Otherwise, the film has quite a few well-known problems, and will leave all but the most devoted Trekkie scratching their heads. It does boast having the most viewing angles of the Enterprise ever in one scene (you'll know it when you see it, believe me), so there's that little morsel in their. Does it make the film worth the other 2 hours or so? Some would say \\"yes!\\" without a second thought!
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|I got this game one the Kindle Fire as one of the free games of the day. I am glad I decided to try it. It's fun and the music great.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My children can't get enough of it. They build their houses for hours finding new ways to keep the monsters out.
B00942X8PY|3.0|Puzzles aren't normally my thing, but I decided to give this a shot. I find it a little challenging and a good way to pass the time.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michale Buble is an amazing singer. I have and totally enjoy his other albums, so was excited to learn he had a new one coming out. I am not disappointed in this &#34;To Be Loved&#34; album. I like the choice of songs and Michael Buble delivers them to the full extent of his great talent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|While its not the PC version, the Pocket Edition is still a fun game. I found the controls not to hard to get used too. All I miss are some of the building blocks. Still I think it's fun and enjoy having it.
B00ASVX1BQ|3.0|I won't get into any of the tripe about who was the better Nightwish vocalist. Easier comparing peanut paste with leeks!<br />I have a number of her first band's DVDs, and although entertaining enough, Tarja never really looks comfortable.<br />At her best, great voice, but singing in English looks a struggle.<br />Odd that she considers herself as a lieder singer, and others say she is a lyric soprano! Renee Fleming is a lyric soprano.<br />Great backing band, good-looking show, but in this viewers mind, Tarja too often sings off the note. I suspect that this is really hard stuff to sing. (Tho' Sharon Den Adel gets away with the same problem on The Black symphony.)<br />There are some high points, and too many awful ones.<br />The recording quality is excellent., and the picture and filmwork very good.<br />For real Tarja fans only
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I appreciate how similar all the UIs are for PC browsers, smartphones, and kindles.  I have not found this same level of platform consistency on other apps.
B00AU15HPC|2.0|I recently watched the Moody Blues at the Isle of Wight doco/performance.(DVD). And listened to this set almost the next day.<br />Mr Hayward's voice is very good still. Mostly, this set is very bland, with a couple of surprising, but quite good country pop-rock songs in the middle.<br />The last 15 minutes is horrid beyond belief. Hip-hoppy tripe.<br />I'm sure lovingly and expertly played and constructed. But what were they thinking?<br />Hayward described in an interview how the Moodies took their music very seriously, and their world-views seriously, and that earth/community consciousness came through in their music. (my words). None of that here. Just a mostly soporific wash and some of the most trite lyrics ever.<br />Very disappointing.
0446677450|5.0|This was the first of the &#34;Kiyosaki&#34; series of books that I read.  And it absolutely opened my eyes to an entirely different way of thinking about earning an income, investing money, and starting and running a business.<br /><br />I've heard the criticisms about that Kiyosaki maybe didn't really have a &#34;Rich Dad&#34; and a &#34;Poor Dad,&#34; but just fabricated this concept for his series of books.  Well, doesn't make any difference to me one way or the other.  The info and perspectives were very valuable to me.<br /><br />And I've hear the criticisms that Kiyosaki's books are &#34;oversimplified.&#34;  I suppose that depends on whether or not you've been to business school!  I haven't ... and was frankly intimidated about reading and studying books about business, finance and investing.  So this book was a perfect start for me.  I liked the &#34;stories&#34; about what his &#34;Rich Dad&#34; and his &#34;Poor Dad&#34; said and did and advised, and could, even then, immediately see a substantial difference in their thinking.<br /><br />Rich Dad Poor Dad was for me a really good start to reading many, many business books, and to completely changing my ways of thinking about business, finance and investing.
B00004YZ36|5.0|Visited my birth country in 1976, and plodding along a street off Tottenham Ct road, espied in a window the DG vinyl boxed set, selling for 14 pounds...then about 21 AU$. In Oz it was about $70. Buy.<br />Still learning about the high Baroque and Classics, this set was then a marvel. Recorded during the late '60s.<br />The recording was good by even DG's high standard of the day, warm, beautiful ambience, and the most tasteful playing by Geza Anda. The balance of keyboard and orchesta was spot on.<br />So I find no surprize to read that this collection has &#34;legendary&#34; status.<br />I now have 3 complete sets of Mozart's klavier Concertos. These performances are the best, and this digital dusting off genuinely adds to the brilliance of the collection.<br />If you want a set, and don't have one, look no further than Anda's readings
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I saw it in IMAX3D and before this movie the only movie that awestruck me was Avatar.  From the moment this movie began it was action packed  and even though you know the story they put a 2013 twist on it that made it interesting and intriguing and oh sooooooo good.  I absolutely loved every second and wanted to see it again but unfortunately was not able to.  I've been waiting for it to come out on dvd so I can buy it and trust me it will be well worth it because it will be viewed often.  I only hope that they make a sequel that it is as good or better.
B001CTUI8M|5.0|Greatest show on earth?<br />Nup! But it is indeed extremely good, highly entertaining.<br />Great sound, excellent camera-work. The band is top rank.<br />Den Adel is so often off the note in this, but the sparkling performance otherwise makes up for the vocal imperfections.<br />She really needs to come down out of the soprano stratosphere.<br />Quite a spectacular looking show.<br />And the most furious, ferocious and entertaining percussion solo ever.<br />Flat spot in the duet with Aneke Van G.<br />Brilliant show, highly recommended
B009R659L8|3.0|Not enough excitement or suspense for my taste.  Half way through I suspected what was going to happen, leaving me disenchanted when I was correct come the end of my reading.
B000JMKO0A|5.0|This book is a tremendous read! What great insight to how women feel when they find something meaningful-meaningful enough to let down the walls around her heart~
B0007MAJBQ|4.0|I was happy to see I can still get these disks.  I have several machines that work with these disks and do not want to retire them.  The disks work just fine and they are made by the company that made my machines.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Twists & Turns abound... Just when you thought you had it figured out... BLAM! All those years of build-up/character development... Satisfactorily put to rest in my opinion...
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Although it is quite different from the book, it is a very clever and entertaining story. Good for both kids and adults.
B001MTENOC|4.0|The book “Journey of Souls” and all theses mentioned case studies are filling you with tender hope and you feel that relaxation is coming step by step of each chapter….
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Big Fish game of puzzles. Very entertaining and relaxing. Puzzles are good exercise for the mind. Keeps my &quot;thinker &quot; sharp!
B00632HWOG|1.0|useless for small biz accounts. have tried for years to organize account enough to switch to gmail, but incompatibility w any apps or organizational software has kept me a prisoner. go to hell, yahoo.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|finished the free sample in one setting and immediately downloaded the full edition and will be looking for more from this author to read. Well written, engaging plot and I loved the characters, especially Sophia and Charles! My only complaint was I wish there had been more focus on their relationship. This is a great read if you want something different from the usual urban fantasy books out there.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love this game. I've never played a more interactive kindle game. It's like Spider-Man 2 and 3 in the palm of your hand! A must buy game!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|If you don't like The Pacific because it is vulgar and dirty and turns good men rotten, that might well be because the war in the Pacific was vulgar and dirty and turned good men rotten.<br /><br />And we can't compare fighting the Germans to fighting the Japanese. Look at the PW survival rates--- 3 percent of Americans in Nazi PW camps died, same as other Western nationalities. But 25% of Americans in Japanese PW camps died. It was a different kind of war, and any movie about it will be a different kind of movie. Complaints about bad language? Good Grief. Do you think you are watching a movie about summer camp, or a Girl Scout Jamboree?<br /><br />The language was pretty much like what I remembered from my 3 years in the 1st Marine Division, and that was stateside in the 70s.<br /><br />I think most have it backwards: If you watch a war movie and don't hear constant profanity, then you are not hearing the real thing.<br /><br />One improvement: Make it easier to tell Leckie from Sledge. They did look alike, pale skin and red hair, especially in the first few episodes.<br /><br />Me, I liked The Pacific so much that I bought Sledge's With the Old Breed.  Soon I will set up a larger TV and surround sound and watch all 10 episodes again.<br /><br />Semper Fi. Hoo Rah!
B001R6AW18|5.0|One of the best movies ever made, 80 years later! A must see even for kids, you can't beat the original King Kong.
B001EYK52O|2.0|I thought it would never end.<br /><br />It will appeal to fans of Faye Dunaway wearing odd-colored hats and Steve McQueen not showing emotion.<br /><br />It seemed like a series of 60s TV shows strung together.<br /><br />Once I thought it was ending, but then it went on and on and on. 1.5 stars.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I've only recently discovered this series. I really love it. It's surprising that it only lasted two years on cable! :(
B009JZTP4Y|3.0|When I first saw this in 1979, I was enthused.  Unfortunately, the movie hasn't held up.  I'm amazed they got to make another movie.
B003B02OOG|4.0|As with all John Grisham books, I love it!  Was it my favorite of all his books?  I think not.  There are so many, it is impossible to pick a favorite.  I do love the Theodore Boone books he writes as well.  Please keep writing Mr. Grisham!  What would I do without your books!
0307277887|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot, but it was over much too quickly...so now I'll have to continue the series!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I could hardly waite for this to get here and it came on time, was packaged well and I would order from here again. I just hated to see this series end I have really enjoyed watching it.
B00829GG7M|5.0|Great rock & roll is finally back again. Tons of talent here as they roll through light and shade versions of great blues backed rock and roll!!
B004QHR5GA|5.0|This record is fantastic. It's the kind of record that you don't want to end.  Glass in the Park is my favorite song although all of them are pretty spectacular.  Pure.  Brilliant.  Gorgeous.  Alex is a truly great songwriter.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this record.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is a good app and I believe it will be useful for traveling, etc. I had some difficulty figuring out the alarm, but that probably says more about me than it does about the app.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This one is lots of fun, there are a lot of levels and several are very challenging...will keep you busy for hours!
B005K17RU0|4.0|this app is ok...it has good info for the current time but just like the weather it is not always ACCUrate!
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This app is a lot of fun to play. The more you play it the more you advance and fly more available aircraft
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I was very excited to read this book!  After enjoying \\"The Selection\\" I couldn't wait to get it in my hands- and I wasn't disappointed!  However, this book was a roller coaster of emotions and I felt the excitement and disappointment right alongside America.  Unfortunately, there is a THIRD book that has yet to receive a release date, so I will have to continue wondering what will happened to America and Maxon...  I hate waiting for good books!
B001BR3P0S|5.0|Love this movie!!! It is an original that never ages. Great for anyone ! If you want a good date movie this is it.
B008602KQI|5.0|I watchd this prior to buying it and liked it a lot that I ordered it to add to my collection. The price was good and I got it in a timely matter
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Rodriguez is truly a great artist! I'm so glad he was finally re-discovered and is getting the notoriety he deserves!
B000001BZT|5.0|Copperhead Road makes me come out fighting the so called political correctness nonsense that saturates our/my world these days.  Up there in the realms of 110th street etc.
B009ME47H2|5.0|It was very easy to use.  The recorded sound quality was good.  I would tell other people to try this.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Acting was great. Story was entertaining. I've worked with bi-polar people and this story did not ring true. Also, two bi-polars marrying would produce more by-polar people. Not always, but often.
B00000DCH9|5.0|This CD is unbelievably good because I wasn't expecting anything different. I don't understand the technicals but it sounds great.
0770433782|5.0|This is a beautiful book with beautiful photographs. It's sure to inspire brides and get them excited about the aesthetics of their wedding from the dress to the flowers down to the littlest details. And what bride doesn't like details?<br /><br />If you're looking for inspiration from a variety of different picture perfect weddings, this is your book. It's a great gift, a fun one to poke through and ooh and ahh over wedding gorgeousness. It's not the ultimate wedding planning guide (nor was I expecting it to be), so if you want something more meaty with practical tips, checklists and advice, you're better off looking elsewhere.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|It arrived which I did not order it but I like it. I gave it away as a gift. She Loved it
B00BSJ2YVA|5.0|Well I liked this band the first time I heard it.....rock n' roll as it was intended to be played.<br />If you are here, you already know what I am talking about :)<br />I'd give it 50 stars if I could !!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Just start use it. The panel looks great and easy to use. Every computer keep the updated note immediately.Love it.
B009IN3AOS|5.0|This whole album is excellent. Been listening to it online- very inspirational.<br />'Never Give in' -is an anthem for these times.<br />The description site's give for this band: &#34;A drum and bass quartet&#34; - is a huge understatement.<br />Great music with a twist of many genres.<br />Peace.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I bought this memory card for a Play Station 2 that I picked up at a local second hand store.<br /><br />It does what it says and does it well.  It's the official product so one would expect it to.<br /><br />Not much more to say, really!
B002WY65VU|5.0|Really love this movie. Watch it all the time. Woody is so funny. I don't like comedy much but horror comedy is good.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I read some of the negative reviews before buying it and was expecting to be disappointed. What a delightful surprise to discover the same old Sophie Kinsella - as funny and mischievous as ever! I finished it in 2 days and will reread it. And... I am jealous of those who yet have the chance to read it for the first time :)
B001MYIXAC|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!! American version is okay but the original is just absolutely fantastic. Watch it at least once a week.
1400067820|5.0|This may be one of the best books I have ever read. Certainly one of the best books I have read in a long time.<br /><br />There are books that you might read just for pleasure, an easy escape into some world unlike your own that doesn't require much of you in the reading except that you sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />This is not that kind of book.<br /><br />This book grabbed me from nearly the very first page and never let me go. It requires a lot of engagement from the reader, a lot of thought and, at least in my case, a good dictionary close at hand. That said in my humble opinion it is well worth the effort. Taleb's premise makes so much sense and his examples are so compelling I kept going and going. In 400+ pages now I can safely say that instances where a page has been left without underlined passages or margin notes are few and far between. There is so much here that I cannot imagine anyone who reads it not finding something to be offended by, marvel at, agree with and be challenged by. It is that kind of book and Taleb is that kind of writer.<br /><br />This is how good this book is. I won the copy I read from the LibraryThing Early Reviewer Program. Before I was done I had bought a hardcover copy for myself. I will probably buy another copy for everyone on my Christmas list. They may not read it but it won't be due to not having the opportunity.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The first few were super easy so I thought it would be a breeze but I got stuck on several of the puzzles. Sometimes for many days and then I would google the answers because it would drive me crazy.
B00004WIDQ|5.0|I taped Jurassic Park off the tv a while back on a VHS tape -- lousy quality, so finally decided to get a decent copy.  As usual, Amazon provided not only the DVD, but great service.  Watched it the minute I got it, even though I've seen the movie many times.  I've always loved the subject of dinosaurs -- since I was 9 years old and visited the Museum of Natural History in New York.  Now, this movie isn't a scientific documentary, but it's Spielberg -- anything by him is fun to watch.  The animatronics are so real -- I'm glad I didn't see this as a very young kid, or it would have scared me to death.  But now, it's big fun -- great characters -- the whole ball of wax.  If I had kids, I would let them watch it -- might even inspire them to become real scientists.  Buy it, you'll like it.
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|I actually like part 2 better and got this one by accident but for $5 cant beat it... My nephew loves it my daughter likes it he is 4 she is 2 maybe thats why
B0073PPKCI|5.0|This is fantastic!  I loved the songs and the videos are excellent.  Whether you are a new ABBA fan or someone who fell in love back during their heyday in the 70s and early 30s, you will want to have this album and DVD in your collection.  This was one of their best.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This is such a great show! Awesome for anyone for loves mystery, surreal, horror, and awesome, Awesome cinematography! I love this show so much!
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Agnetha's voice is still clear and beautiful.  She still can hit the high notes like she did in her 20s and 30s.  She will always be the girl with golden hair and golden voice.<br /><br />The more you listen to Agnetha's solo works, the more you realize that she is an international treasure who transcends language and time.  I have always been thankful Agnetha and the rest of her ABBA counterparts learned English so that they would get the exposure they deserved.  The first two songs on the album are wonderful as is her up-tempo dance number, Dance Your Pain Away.  The duet with Gary Barlow is excellent.  It is hard to believe they recorded it at separate times because you would swear they had to have recorded it standing next to each other.  I also loved the last song on the album that Agnetha wrote herself because you can visualize her inner self coming out as she sings the songs.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|A far better film than I gave it credit for being, `Limitless' was one of those rare instances where a preconceived notion of a film is completely flipped after seeing it finally.  My best friend was ranting and raving over vacation about this movie being one of his favorites, and I kind of laughed because I just can't take Bradley Cooper seriously (this was before I finally saw `Silver Linings Playbook' yesterday, so bear with me).  That, and conceptually this just seemed so silly.<br /><br />It is silly, but that isn't the point.<br /><br />The basic premise is that an aspiring writer suffering from severe writer's block and lack of any funds falls into good luck (sort of) when he meets up with his ex-brother-in-law who was a former drug dealer and now is, allegedly, going legit for a pharmaceutical company pimping a drug that unleashes your brains full potential.  He gives our protagonist a free hit, which does its job remarkably well, and soon he's aching for more.  A murder and a burnout later and he's scrambling to keep his addiction, grow his funds and win back his girlfriend, all the while wooing a business prospect.  But things are falling apart, people are tracking him down and a certain thug is trying his hardest to get his hands on more pills.<br /><br />The key to this film working is turning off your brain and allowing the director, Neil Burger, to warp your mind.  The film is executed really well.  For an action thriller, this nails all the right moments to create something engaging and thrilling.  The lighting, the sets, the pacing, the edits and the use of music is all key to propelling the film along.  The cast is decent enough, with Cooper surprising me with the amount of depth he brought to a well written role.  Abbie Cornish is wasted entirely, and De Niro phones in every minute of his screen time, but like I said, the star of the show is Burger.<br /><br />I honestly wanted to hate this, but I liked it quite a bit.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|A SAD BUT INTERESTING MOVIE. THIS IS NOT THE FILM TO SEE WHILE ON VACATION ,BUT IT IS A GOOD ONE.
B004XIZN5M|4.0|Already own the paperback version of the book and love it, but wanted a more portable version. And the ebook was half the regular price when I downloaded it. What I really don't like though, is the Kindle app on my iPhone. It does not let you scroll down to read, only flip endless little pages. :/  I wish it was easier to navigate through books in the iPhone app.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|THIS FILM SHOWS A LITTLE TALKED ABOUT ASPECT ABOUT THE GAME OF BASEBALL. YOU MAY NOT BE A BASEBALL FANATIC, BUT CLINT EASTWOOD CAN BRING YOU INTO ENJOYING THIS FILM.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is an amazing storyteller. I have enjoyed every one of his books and recommend each one to every one. This one was a great 'win the lottery' fantasy. I was waiting for a different ending... Grisham always keeps me guessing!!
B006M4F67A|4.0|It is a good majhong game, but it needs a back button.  There's a great diversity of tile layouts. Would have liked different music also.!
B00785P2QC|2.0|too complicated. too many buttons. I wish I could figure it out. has potential. I deleted it. glad it was free.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this app.it really helps me find the weather quick when I'm on the go and doesn't hesitate to tell
B008VBYN80|4.0|It's a decent free to play game and helps pas the time. Between this and world at arms I don't think I will be able to invest any more time in three types of games.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Pros:<br />Good feel/weight when wearing<br />Poseable mic<br />Volume control and programmable buttons on the headset itself<br />Comes with a dock for wireless receiver<br />Long battery life<br /><br />Cons:<br />Sound quality<br />Flimsy construction<br /><br />When I first bought these, I was really excited to finally have a nice headset, but I was a little disappointed by the sound quality when I finally got to putting them on and using them. They often sound a little tinny and crackly like a cheap pair of headphones, and I was underwhelmed by the bass. They also tend to &#34;cut out&#34; a lot, though I am only about two feet from the receiver. (But I might be TOO close, at that point...) They work but I only use them when I absolutely need to, for the mic. The joints on all the parts also feel a little loose and flimsy. I'm scared they might snap at any moment. These two reasons are why I took off one star. They are not grievous errors to me, but they might make it or break it for someone.<br /><br />That said, they are extremely comfortable to wear. The padded band and ear pieces don't clamp my head too hard and I can wear them for a long time without feeling any discomfort. Being able to adjust the mic easily is nice and I have not heard any reports of bad sound quality coming from my end. I like the buttons, I have them programmed so that I can get up and walk around, and still use push-to-talk. The Logitech software offers a lot of customization options and is fairly easy to use. The volume control is really great too. I can't speak to the full wireless range though because my apartment is fairly small, so I am never very far.

0446580848|3.0|I am a huge DeMille and John Corey fan.  However, this book was not as good as the others in the Corey series.  The Lion was a badass who had many chapters in two great books dedicated to his perspective.  The Panther, on the other hand, is rarely heard from and seems a little wimpy for a DeMille villian.  In my opinion, The Lion and The Lion's game were smash hits, this was a dribbler to the mound.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|One of the BEST shows on television! Supernatural beings being ran off by the 2 brothers...the writers actually do seem to research the paranormal when writing the scripts for this show.

B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I won't say I am an expert on 9-11 and UBL, but I've read many fine books on and around the subject: \\"First In\\" by Gary Schroen, \\"The Looming Tower\\"by Lawrence Wright, \\"Perfect Soldiers\\" by Terry McDermott, \\"102 Minutes\\" by Kevin Flynn, \\"House to House\\" by David Bellavia, \\"Lone Survivor\\" by Marcus Luttrell, \\"Touching History\\" by Lynn Spencer, \\"The Outpost\\" by Jake Tapper, \\"Triple Agent\\" by \\"Joby Warwick, etc.<br /><br />I love \\"Courting Disaster\\" by Marc A. Thiessen, which conclusively makes the case that waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques is not torture, and that Pelosi and the other democrats supported enhanced interrogation until it became politically expedient to do and say otherwise.<br /><br />So in the context of reality, after watching this movie several times, it is simply fantastic.<br /><br />With a wink-wink to Steve Buscemi in ConAir, \\"Define Irony\\"-- Obama bragged about killing UBL, but the liberals decided they did not want to give this movie it's deserved Academy Awards because it's about American justice and showing that enhanced interrogation does produce operational results.<br /><br />Define Irony 2: Obama decides is better to KILL Osama and other terrorists with predator drones rather than capturing, imprisoning, and then using enhanced interrogation techniques to get actionable intelligence like the story this movie so effectively tells... it is better to kill than capture alive.<br /><br />Although some of the events have been dramatized by Hollywood as they are in any movie (For example, the car scene with protestors pounding on Maya's car-- single white women or for that matter about all Expats are not driving cars alone in Islamabad... they didn't tell the SEAL's in Area 51 they were going after UBL that came much later...  the inside of the two helicopters was pitch black for security), but these things make better screen drama.<br /><br />Much of this movie is spot-on accurate. There's a \\"Maya\\" at the CIA and she was the one that never gave up on going after UBL: God bless Maya for her tenacity and thank you Kathryn Bigelow for making this fantastic movie. This movie earned a dozen Academy Awards but the liberals and democrats could not honor American justice by awarding this movie what it deserved. Kathryn Bigelow nailed iconic scenes like UBL's compound and the Helicopter tail on the other side of the wall.<br /><br />Last, I love the soundtrack, especially the Canaries' \\"SEALS Take off\\" and \\"Flight to Compound\\".

B005GFPZYK|3.0|Unfortunately we probably need people like Chris, as he was trained to be, but the toll it takes on such people is even more unfortunate...a destroyed life.  Too many vets are suffering from PTSD and too many have killed themselves (or somebody else)...and that is not acceptable.  There is a flaw in either the training process or the debriefing process that needs to be fixed.

1449325947|4.0|I own both Missing Manual CSS books, the original one (although 2nd edition) and now this CSS3 book.  Yes, there is a lot of repeat here but there is also 100 more pages in the new book, and some of the repeated text has changed a little.  The book can be overwhelming if it is your introduction to CSS.  If you are new to CSS, you are better off with the Head First series and then work your way to this book.  Make no mistake, this book is for more serious web designers and web developers.  However, if you are new to the subject and you do pick this book, as long as you are tech savvy you'll still be okay.  This isn't rocket science after all, but having someone in your corner who has already paid his dues can really reduce a lot of CSS frustration.  I've found in my career that most people I work with (who are software developers doing web projects, but not web designers) simply do not utilize CSS the right way (or even in a smart way).  Anyone who gets through this book will likely be the resident CSS expert at your work place, and that's all it takes usually because many developers don't put in the time with CSS.  So in the end, is the title misleading like some of the other reviewers noted due to the immaturity of CSS3.  You can make that case.  But at least the book continues to be updated.  Consider it a work in progress giving you the latest information possible at a professional level.

B000UFAURI|5.0|I love a couple of things about this album. The main reasons I love this album is that there are solid rockers and really slow, heartfelt tunes too. I love every song here and think the album is excellent! The Foo Fighters have had their share of amazing songs in the past but I must admit that some of these songs are among my favorites from them. \\"Best Of You\\" was definitely a hit from their last album but I think \\"The Pretender\\" from this album (which is similar in style to that previous song) builds on what that song started and brings a bit of its own flavor to the table. I love how the riffs get real crazy at the end of the song as it makes its way to fading out. :)<br /><br />I think Foo Fighters have quite a few really good albums under their belt. But out of the 5 I've heard this one is my favorite. It just doesn't get any better than this.<br /><br />4.7 stars.

B000I8G5B2|3.0|I watched this movie when it came out, and had a vague recollection of it being a dystopian vision of a possible future, where gene testing is used to segment people by caste. That's all I really remembered of it, along with vague imagery of very pretty, very well dressed people going about their business.<br /><br />Watching it again recently, my impressions are sort of different. Yes, this vision of the future looks like a sort of futuristic Ralph Lauren commercial. The thing is, this isn't horrifying. It's a welcome relief to the eyes to look at a lot of people who keep fit and dress like they respect themselves. Look around you: I see a lot of loud, shambling wildebeests who make me long for this future well-dressed \\"dystopia\\" no matter how oppressive it might be. Even the cars are pretty cool looking. Bring it on. Probably, this is intimidating to slobs; I found it invigorating.<br /><br />Science-wise, we know something about how genetic testing works, and what it can do. No, you will never have testing sniffer thingees or finger blood takers that can instantly sequence an individual: chemistry and physics don't work that way. No, we can't tell to a high degree of probability what people will die of. Genes are statistically important, but environment is pretty important in health outcomes. I have lousy genes for strength training: proven by genetic science (though you could tell looking at me before I started lifting weights). Yet, I'm pretty damn strong. I don't even train real hard. Environment. Sure, some people have grave health defects which can be detected by genetic testing: most people don't. And ... why was the Gattica space camp constantly doing the same damn gene test on everyone, several times a day at work? Also, for a society so obsessed with genetic perfection, why can't they breed people who don't have such glaring cartoon-like character defects?<br /><br />Speaking of the characters, I have no sympathy for any of them. I know who I'm supposed to identify with: the non-genetic engineered protagonist. He is a selfish sociopathic jerk. He wants to go to outer space. Hey, so do I. I also don't have a life threatening heart condition which could get everyone else in the space ship killed, nor am I functionally blind, which could also get everyone in the space ship killed, since he's training to be a navigator. Finally, despite his bad ticker, he wants to shack up with a girl ... with a bad ticker. Gee, wouldn't it be great to have \\"normal\\" kids with bad tickers that kill them at 30? What kind of monster is he? The detective: jerk. The protagonist's gene engineered brother: insecure jerk, and a cowardly ninny. The wheelchair bound superman: petulant creepy jerk who has no motivation for any of his actions. Gore Vidal's character: blubber-fey megalomaniacal murderous jerk. Heart-attack girlfriend: paranoid nosey prissy jerk. Maybe the future will be populated by unsympathetic narcissists like in this movie. Reading, say, slate.com, it kind of looks we might be headed that way. Hopefully they at least begin to dress nice and stop eating so many sustainable ho-hos so they don't hurt the eyes so much as they presently do.to identify with: the non-genetic engineered protagonist.

B009IEXKXI|2.0|I bought this book because of the many 5 star reviews but was very disappointed. It is actually very boring and full of expletives. Here's an example of how bad this book is: \\"Over the past few days, I've been happily making water. It's been going swimmingly. (See what i did there? \\"Swimmingly?\\")\\" You would be better off with Robinson Crusoe. I can't believe this has been taken up by Random House.

B00CMAK34O|4.0|Agnetha Fältskog sounds great on this album. Her voice is in great shape.<br /><br />Most songs are ballads which works well with her voice and singing style. There's even a fun dance number (&#34;Dance the Pain Away&#34;) and a duet with Gary Barlow (&#34;I Should Have Followed You Home&#34;) from Take That.<br /><br />The production of the album is strong; it delivers a complimentary package by highlighting the strengths of Agnetha's voice and the songs---providing the listener with a enjoyable album.

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I absolutely love this game!  Great graphics and good sound. There's even a cute little storyline to follow as you complete the missions. My only small complaint is the price of the dollars. I totally understand paying for extra dollar, coins, diamonds, etc in games. However, it is very expensive for dollars. I would have to spend $50 to get the 2 dinos I really want. Other than that, I am having a great time building my dinosaur park!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This is a very good drama; great synopsis of this period in history in the viking culture and period correct clothing and paraphernalia.
0756405890|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone looking to fill the gap left by popularized and albeit great fantasy books/movies of the last decade. I was lucky to stumble upon this book; without any big blockbuster promotions or \\"Team\\" shirts popularized I doubt this would ever have made it onto my desk.<br /><br />Now onto the book:<br />It's Long.  It's very Long. But don't let that deter you, the story is perfectly woven around each of the wayward and often times drawn out sections. The imagery is so vivid I found myself yearning for this to become the next big screen novel to captivate the masses.  As for content, I hate spoilers so just suffice it say that each page is worth the journey.<br /><br />My only complaint is that when I started these novels I did so under the pretense that this was a complete trilogy and to my HORROR at the completion of book 2 I found no option to 'Buy it Now' for a book 3.  With no release date for the final installment of Kvothe's story, begin this journey with caution.

B002SRQ214|5.0|I purchased this product for a budget pc build. I paired it with a MSI 660 twin frozr video card. So far, the combo has been able to handle everything that I have thrown at it with a very solid FPS. It is also nice that this is the AM3+ socket, so that in the future I can upgrade my cpu if needed. I have not bottle-necked at all with this process and the 660, this was something that I was worried about before my purchase but so far, so good. I would high recommend this cpu to anyone that is looking to build a budget friendly pc.

B006M4F67A|1.0|The two boards that I managed to play were great. However, the game froze and forgot my progress more than once per board. I had to start over multiple times and couldn't even make it through the third board \\"Pyramid\\" without it locking up. It also made my phone very hot after 5-10 minutes of play time. Unplayable, uninstalled.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|There were stretches of the 2012 film \\"Jack Reacher\\" so derivative, I would stare from my window and estimate my tax return. I'll be the first to admit Tom Cruise is one of the great movie stars of recent times, and there was an era he could do no wrong. To his credit, he's survived three decades, skillfully choosing productions to maintain a stormy reign. One of the frustrations of his career is he avoids edgy projects, marching through middling films like \\"Jack Reacher\\" where he barely has to pose.<br /><br />Cruise has worked with so many greats -- Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson -- it's no wonder his iconic status has marched far longer than contemporaries (what are Andrew McCarthy, Matt Dillon and Val Kilmer up to these days?). So what to make of \\"Jack Reacher?\\" Based on the popular series of novels by Lee Child, specifically [[ASIN:0345538196 One Shot: A Jack Reacher Novel]], Reacher is a super everyman who lives underground without a credit card to his name. He's been trained with skills rivaling Jason Bourne, is a war hero and travels by Greyhound bus. When lounging at the local motel, he strolls around with his shirt off. In his wake, women swoon and gangs of men are soundly whipped.<br /><br />There's a sadness pervading \\"Jack Reacher,\\" akin to the Clint Eastwood's [[ASIN:B003LCKZ6I The Rookie (1990)]] or, going back further, Burt Reynolds' [[ASIN:B0000C0FFV Heat]]. Clint and Burt, studs of former eras, were well into their senior citizen years when they repeated these fatigued variations of once-macho status. They were depressing films, with Eastwood firing big guns and Reynolds battling Vegas toughs in bell-bottoms. Rather than tackling age-appropriate roles, they were starring in tired formula pictures to maintain dwindling box office muscle. The connecting thread through all of these wheezing attempts is Cruise, Eastwood and Reynolds can act. But for some reason, they couldn't act their age (to Eastwood's credit, he evolved as a considerable director).<br /><br />All one has to do is go back and watch [[ASIN:B000ICXQR4 Born on the Fourth of July]], [[ASIN:B00170M2JY Jerry Maguire]] and [[ASIN:B0036T1RMM Magnolia]] to see Cruise has chops. So why is he wasting his time in machine gun battles? At one point during the concluding dramatics, Cruise has the villain trapped. Rather than dispatch the menace, he throws down his gun to fight hand-to-hand in the pouring rain -- a cliche even when Akira Kurosawa used it in [[ASIN:B004D1CK32 Seven Samurai]]. There's also a car chase that depressingly echoes [[ASIN:B001F4UHGC Bullitt]]. The classic Steve McQueen vehicle is the greatest action film ever made. There's a scene in that coolest of cool films where McQueen goes shopping at the grocery store and humorously buys a large stack of TV dinners. \\"Jack Reacher\\" has little time for such creative quirk.<br /><br />This film was directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who cut his teeth writing the screenplays for \\"The Usual Suspects\\" and \\"Valkyrie.\\" He's not a particularly good director, possessing all the imagination of Paul W.S. Anderson. There's an average mystery here, where a Pittsburgh man is accused of being a random sniper. Like Alan Ladd in buckskin, Reacher rides down out of the mountains and teams with the defense attorney (Rosamund Pike) to uncover a conspiracy. Cruise's character could have been interesting -- just exactly why is he a homeless loner? But the film is too busy with fist fights and Chuck Norris high kicks. And I'm still not sure who the main villain was, played by Werner Herzog of all people.<br /><br />While \\"Jack Reacher\\" turned a profit, Cruise is selling himself short. Newman turned his career around in the 1980s by playing a burned out police officer in [[ASIN:B00319ECCY Fort Apache, the Bronx]]. After years of gimmicky disaster flicks and peculiar Robert Altman excursions, the explosive performance was a revelation. The brave turn would lead to his greatest role as alcoholic lawyer FrankGalvin in [[ASIN:B000SW4DOO The Verdict]]. Gray hair, crow's feet and life's twilight disillusions were embraced, and he would continue to challenge himself with fascinating projects while marching towards unparalleled respectability. One evening, Cruise would do well to turn off his phone and watch a great icon at work.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I've often dreamed of Paul Rudd and I sharing an intimate encounter behind a corn dog stand at a renaissance festival. This is not like that but it's funny.
B0025KVLUG|5.0|Reminds me of my mis-spent youth...and it's Beatle music, so what's not to like?<br />Makes me think the Blue Meanies are still after us.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This is a great track and makes me giddy for their triumphant return. Gets me in the mood for ring pops and glowsticks.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|This could have easily been a Richie Sambora solo album with Jon singing lead vocals.<br /><br />While this is a phenomenal album which I'd highly recommend anyone get their hands on, listen to Richie Sambora's latest solo album and it becomes clear who wrote this album... this isn't Jon's songwriting style; the melodies, progressions, cadences and song structure all scream Sambora, so if you're look for traditional Bon Jovi you're not going to find it here.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|This game isn't scary. It is basic and boring. Much like the music Christina Aguilera makes. Also it handles wonky.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Read &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and was so taken with the writing and the story.  Was excited to read more by this author.  I believe this is her first book.  The writing itself is not as good.  Many sentences are confusing.  And, it wasn't far into the book when it was apparent who the murderer was.  Very obvious.  So the &#34;shock&#34; value wasn't there.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a spinner/weaver and a science fiction lover.  When I saw a scifi book with the title &#34;Wool&#34;, I was intrigued.  I loved the story and wanted more so I bought the Omnibus and was not disappointed.  I sincerely hope Hugh Howey will continue to write more of the series!!
B003DZX3SA|4.0|Bought this movie to fill up my collection of classic Disney movies for the kids to watch before going on a Disney cruise.  Daughter watched it a couple times.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I really enjoyed how the book detailed Franz Stigler and Charlie Brown's experiences in the war. A very emotional ending really solidified 5 stars.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I bought this movie for my son after he fell in love with Jake and the Neverland Pirates.  We've watched this movie more than any other ones we have.
1616550414|5.0|The book that brings certainty to every Zelda series fan. From art to chronology, this is a must-have for every fan.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Can't wait for the next book in the series. Sanderson seems to be more into continuing the series on a regular basis then George RR Martin and the Song of ice and fire.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|Very interesting & intriguing movie, a lot of good actors and the storyline is great. Pay attention to all the little details.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|My absolute favorite star trek movie. I love the story line and the action. Great villian in this movie too!
0307352145|5.0|It might not come to much of surprise to people that know me, but I am an introvert. Though I like being social, I also really appreciate my \\"me time.\\" This book, that covers what it means to be an introvert, studies about introverts, and how we can function better in the world around us, is the perfect book for introverts and extroverts. Yep, that's right, that means everyone.<br /><br />For introverts this book helps us feel \\"normal,\\" and understand what makes us awesome. And for extroverts, this book can help you understand your introverted friends, partners, and coworkers better.<br /><br />Luckily, I read this for a book club I am part of so I was able to have a good discussion about it. Our discussion group consisted of 4 introverts, on extrovert, and one in between. It was great seeing the positive impact this book had on introverts that grew up feeling left out or a little anti-social. And the extrovert, who is actually already very understanding to her introverted friends, enjoyed hearing about how we interact with the world and how we can work even better.<br /><br />One challenge with this book is that it's very black and white, and fairly one sided. Someone in our book club mentioned it would be great for someone to write \\"Loud,\\" so us introverts can learn more about extroverts.<br /><br />This is definitely a book I hope to buy, share with friends, and refer back to often.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This is my 2nd favorite star trek movie. Very exciting action sequences. Also, the characters in the movie is developed for good. JJ Abrams is a wonderful director.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Once you get the game to load it becomes easily addictive. There are only so many things you can do without crystals though. Wish they have you an easier way to collect them.
B00BF123WG|3.0|I was surprised at and disappointed by the briefness of the ending. I expected more detail maybe it could not be done.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like this game but it needs to have more excitement and problem solving instead of just a hidden item feel.
B004FOOQV6|1.0|After purchasing this app it would not download on my Kinlde Fire and said the app was corrupted. I have still been charged for it but I don't have the APP!!!I know it is only a dollar but I don't like throwing money away.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|I've been playing Blokus for a long time now, and it is one of my favorite board games to play with my family. The problem is that with the board game, it's helpful to have all four players there and my family doesn't always want to play. I was so excited when I found this game because it's exactly like Blokus and I can finally play it by myself! If you already know how to play the board game, you'll probably catch on pretty quickly- the controls aren't difficult to figure out. It's a fun game and I'm looking forward to trying to beat the computer players!
B00992CF6W|2.0|One time I created a mansion and the game deleted it. If you get this game you will regret it later on.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it 100% ,but it doesn't have many of the most important features.<br />(EX)<br />Usable crafting table, chests , furnaces, etc<br />Ability to eat food<br />Nether portal<br />The end portal<br />All animals<br />Other than that it does excellent in creative!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love my post it notes. Exactly what I needed. I've used it on my phone for a while and now I've got it on my Kindle.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Worked at first then it started to go off at the wrong time. It was ok T first but it started to act up so I deleted it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Had some unexpected twists, a really great read. Author did a great job with the story line of this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of those games that gets you thinking but it doesn't completely stump you. I hate it when a game is too hard and this one is just perfect! I hope they make a second one soon :)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It has become such a useful tool for me on my new iPod Touch - much easier to carry and have with me all the time than the Kindle Fire I have.  Don't get me wrong I love the Kindle Fire too - but what makes them both so great is this App - now when reading a book, they work together now, so that no matter which device I pick up, it takes me to the last page I read.
B00BT0ZS52|5.0|Very original plot. Never has been done before. Had to watch it twice to get it all but it was profound and entertaining while crossing a broad spectrum of settings and points of view. Great movie!
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I purchased this CD with my new ipod touch.  New ipod = some new music!  I would recommend it too anyone.  Very catchy tunes and not too hard as in rock goes.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Entertaining and unpredictable! It was a good plot with comedy and thrills that keeps you guessing until the end. Invigorating.
B00BP29SAA|4.0|Dr. Panda keeps my 3 yr old entertained. There are some changes I would like see made, but overall a fun game.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Best game ever can't take my eyes off it best part it's free I play it every day if you want fun action adventure get this game it rocks it and minecraft go hand and hand
B008BIZ06M|5.0|As an Offspring fan from way back, this album does not dissappoint.  These guys have stayed true to there sound and have put together another great volume to their collection!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very informative. I was impressed by the facts revealed about this mision that was not covered by the newspapers and other publications. I enjoyed the accuracy of the events that were not published by the public news coverage. I highly recommend reading this book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Can't wait for the next season!  Wish it went on longer.  We spent an entire weekend doing nothing but watching Downton Abbey.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I only saw Les Miserables once many years ago on a trip to London.  I remember enjoying the stirring music in the second half but never thought further about it or purchased any recordings.  Ironically a political parody of One More Day on the internet piqued my interest and I saw several of the performances of the 25th anniversary concert on YouTube and I was hooked and purchased the BluRay disc.<br />The performance is positively breathtaking.  All aspects of the production are superb - lighting, sound, even the staging which is quite convincing despite not being the typical set.<br />The lead performers are incredible, with a special nod to the amazing Alfie Boe.  He definitely owns the role now.  Norm Lewis as Javier was impressive as was Lea Salonga as Fantine and Samantha Barks as Eponine.  I have obtained the DVD of the 10th anniversary concert and enjoyed it as well.  I don't see how anyone could say which is better although I would give a nod to the 25th (by a hair).  I think that NIck Jonas did a credible job as Marius - he only suffers by comparison with Michael Ball but who wouldn't.  It was great that they were able to cast the wonderful Ramin Karimloo in a relatively minor role when he could easily sing Jean Valjean himself.<br />As someone has already said, the encores alone are worth the price of the disc with the original cast reprising One More Day.  The Valjean quartet was an wonderful innovation.  I suspect that Colm Wilkinson was an inspiration to all the other singers on the stage.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|It has great sound and great songs.  The only thing that disappointed me is, it does not have is the last movie's music &#34;sky fall&#34;.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|I've never played the board game that people say this app was based on, and I was a little worried after reading reviews. But I have found this to be an enjoyable game - and did  not find it very hard to learn the basics.  There is a sort-of tutorial on the &quot;help&quot; page.  I think this is one of those games that is not hard to learn to play, but can be hard to learn to play well.  I'm not very good with games of strategy. But  the easiest levels of games are perfect for people like me. And the rest of you (who are good with strategy games) can go on to play all the higher levels.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read the books before the first movie came out, but I decided to read the second one again before I saw the new movie. It was still as amazing the second time! Even though I knew the storyline I was drunk glued to this book. Definitely worth reading! No doubt about it
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is awesome. and it's. free what more could you ask for. love it. love it love it.<br />it makes her happy, happy, happy
B0031RS4UM|3.0|Not bad, right? Lee's style can get a little repetitive and slightly annoying.  But the story is great, some good cliffhanger moments. Worth a read on the commute
B0035JRVBO|5.0|My watched this with my son - his first time - and he loved it! Made me remember what a great movie this is in so many ways.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Great movie for adults!  Made the whole family scream and gave us all a thrill, the adults that is!  Enjoy!!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Entertaining and challenging but not impossible. Makes you think creatively and each puzzle requires different skills so does not get boring.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Really did not care for the interview format....no character development.  No plot no real explanation as to why and what was left.  Just did not like the style of writing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The last time I read science fiction quite as engaging and with comparable depth in the storyline is dune, and that says a lot.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|So I'm a big fan of spider man so why not buy this it's now only $99 cents must buy nice free roaming city takes up space but it's amazing!
B0085LMFAE|4.0|Possibly his best work yet. He put his soul into this project and collaborated with African singers. Brings me back to the 80s
B007Y36K46|4.0|I was anticipating something pretty bad, based on the reviews.  It did drag in parts, but I liked the books and this was a good retelling of the story.  The acting was decent - not great but decent - and that will be good enough if you're into the story. 4 stars = &#34;I like it&#34; and that is an accurate description of my feelings toward the film.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Even though this charger cord did not solve my charging problems with my kindle fire, I still loved the new charger cord. It is smaller and much easier to transport.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I probably didn't give much time to it but felt like it was not very interactive and decided not to keep it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wish they would hurry and create some more... it was a great mind teaser... great way to while away the hours...
B000CNFC76|5.0|I;ve seen this move before and wanted it bad so i'm glad to have it now. thank you very mutch.
B004UQ03P2|4.0|Works good, no complaints, looks nice, does what I wanted it to do, there's not much to review. It's a cover..
B0067TQQI8|4.0|This is a nice USB battery, solid build with two outputs, the built in LED flashlight is a nice touch.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Great performances by Cruise and Hoffman showing their versatility and emotion of their characters.  Cruise begins as a self-absorbed individual but is later transformed by an exceptional brother.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|keeps me entertained for hours!! my grandson likes to help me play. we love the dinosaur world wish things did not cost so much but we love it the same.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|Not cheesy if you open your mind to sci-fi space scenarios.  This pushes the idea of what might happen if the sun quits pumping out good ole UVA/UVB's to all those peeps needing a sun tan.  The graphics are good, story line reasonable, and acting not bad.  Don't mind watching over and over when I've got time to kill since this movie brings about more than just sci-fi but focuses on the human condition of where we stand in the universe...are we worthy of making our own destiny or more apt to believe when it's our time to go...lights out!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I enjoy this game, just another way to be an armchair commander.  I think that they should give more free opportunities.  The more I learn the more I enjoy this game.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|It's a basic cover, no frills and capable of protecting your Iphone.  It's not an Otter Box so if you're a clutz buy more protection.<br /><br />Fits and material feels durable enough for basic drops.  Prevents exterior scratches from basic wear and tear scenarios. (except for business end, would suggest getting a polymer sheet to complement)
030759565X|5.0|My  husband got me this cookbook for Christmas last year and since then I have tried about 20 different recipes from the cookbook. Some I have already made multiples times.<br /><br />To start, I thoroughly enjoy Deb Peralman's writing style and inflections before every recipe. It puts them into context and describes what she likes about them and why. As well as, gives the reader some insight to her life. It makes this cookbook relatable, funny and enjoyable to just sit back and read.<br /><br />Another aspect of this cookbook I love is that there are pictures for EVERY recipe. Perhaps this makes me a bit juvenile, but it really makes a big difference in \\"selling\\" me a particular dish. For most novice chefs descriptions just don't do a recipe justice. Seeing it gets your taste buds going and helps you know if you're doing it right.<br /><br />Now, down to the recipe selection. The variety is pretty wide, though for my needs I'd have liked to see more dinner recipes and less desserts. One thing I do appreciate is the section on vegetarian meals. I am not a vegetarian, but I like having meatless meals at least once a week.<br /><br />There are few recipes that are a bit lackluster, that I find myself saying I bet this would be really good if it had this in it.  For instance, the peas and shells recipe in the vegetarian section could really use some pine nuts or something that could give it more of a dimensional flavor.<br /><br />Most of the recipes are easy to follow and make, but there are a few that require some practice such as the pancetta, chard and white bean pot pies. The first time I made it the tops were a complete and utter disaster. So much so the second time I made it I used puff pastry (which worked very well BTW). I'm sure with practice I could probably get the tops done correctly, but I don't know how much time and effort I am willing to put into that particular recipe when I found a suitable replacement for that step.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this cookbook. The vast majority of the recipes are easy to make, delicious and great for impressing guests. It's a good read that gets you excited about cooking and eating! I hope she comes out with a second.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Amazing game I love it!! I would tell everyone if u like games like this download it now.I just got this yesterday and I'm glue to it already  download this game  a.s.a.p
B002MG2ATY|5.0|Oliver Stone's movie about the assassination of JFK shook loose the government documents that were critical to Jim Douglass in writing &#34;JFK and the Unspeakable,&#34; which documents that President Kennedy was murdered by the CIA and that his death resulted in the tragedy of the Vietnam War.
B003VANOFY|1.0|It lasted a week and now it sits on my son's desk.  There is a humming noise that occurred and when we took it into a retailer to have them check it out, they stated that they are receiving many complaints about this humming noise for this product and there is nothing they can do.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I've learned a few interesting things  about Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. I enjoyed the Saturday night Live performance and after my morning radio station reviewed The Heist, I decided to go ahead and buy it. This is the first Hip Hop record that I've bouthg in years and I have to say I really love it!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I can't put this book down. The detail for each character puts you right there in the middle of the story. I can't wait to get the next book.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game requires logic rather than speed, that's why I like it so much. There are a limited number of screens right now, but you can revisit them to earn other awards.
B004C00EM8|2.0|This version of this film does not contain any extras, only the main movie. This DVD is made in Canada, and it says on the case “sell only in Canada.” This version does not state that it is the ‘R” rated, or the “un-rated” version.  I would assume it is the theatrical, edited version. This film was shot on a digital camera, the move to a Blu-ray does not upgrade the quality of the picture, and it only increases the picture noise. Because of the increased grain of the picture, one has to set an HD 1080P TV to 720P to make the picture look better. Buying the Blu-ray version is a waste of money.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|CD is fantastic, I caught them on tour and these songs are awesome live. One of the best new albums I've bought in a long time.
0316227706|5.0|I own a water dog and was excited to see more than labs and retrievers in the photos.  My only disappointment was not enough photos!  Makes a great coffee table book.
0385341008|5.0|I love this book.  This is the second time I have read it and it is just as good as the first.  Highly recommended!
1574214276|3.0|I purchased this book in hopes of breaking out of my creativity block.  No such luck.  Book is interesting enough but I don't have time to sit, sketch and color in my drawings.  Might be good for a long flight or stuck in the airport.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Did this book just end, really?  Just like that?  Not too bad,writing  was okay,  terrible ending. Four more words before I can hit submit
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I got this game as the free app of the day and it was very fun and enjoyable...all 12 restaurants were unlocked and I was working my way through them. I go to play today and only 6 restaurants are unlocked and if I want the rest of them I have to pay for them. How can they give you all 12 then take half back?! It's a total rip off  because they prob lost money with it being the free app off the day and now they just want to scam you. Don't buy this game and support such a terrible scamming company.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|It performs much better than I would have expected.  This is a quality product with an excellent well thought out design.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Love me some Blake!!  What a great album and great songs. They all should be # 1 hits!  Red red red red red neck!!!!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|The animals you can raise are cute and varied but the time it takes to get them fully raised can be off-putting. Buildings cost far too much for a casual player and those who can't afford to buy coins and jewels and the lack of ability to remove an animal to make room for new pets is a set back. The upside is that it's a fun way to spend the time and a good way to keep younger siblings occupied.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|my kindell was stollen from me ,i did not put this on there ,and i ask to have it turned off<br />the vtube,i heart radio,hulu plus,scanner radio,
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|2 cases were broke which held the last DVD in place.  All else OK. The DVDs have not been watched yet.
158270208X|5.0|I'm grateful that I found this information and I write in the gratitude book almost everyday.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you get the book and start written in it right away.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|Well documented fictional news sources provides interesting reading for the survivalist. Tactics are worth remembering if fiction it is not.
B00B2166BS|2.0|It is not true that this cable charge your nexus 10 faster. That's a lie. Please, do not buy it.
B004IOP18A|5.0|Wonderful, My daughter is a fan and she said the clarity of sound on vinyl is second to none. A perfect gift!
B001F12J48|1.0|Yes, this in 3D but it's in 3D that is over at least 10-years old!  Unfortunately, after I bought it, I read one review that told me the real 'truth' of this so-called 3D DVD.  Yes, when viewed on my 3D TV & 3D Blue-Ray Player w/ real 3D-glasses, there DEFINATELY IS a constant nagging red stripe throughout the entire movie that only disappears when you use the included red & blue cardboard smaller-eared kids 3D-glasses.  And, the picture is quite blurry.<br />This 3D DVD is terrible, but the included animated regular DVD that is also included is pretty good & entertaining.  That's worth the 10-bucks I paid for it & why I kept it.  I wouldn't recommend this for 3D, tho.
B000056BAF|5.0|I love this album.  This is a classic.  I bought this and even my kids like it lol.  I listen to it a lot.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I am a Korean War Veteran.<br />This book points out why all Americans should be proud of the fact that we allowed at least Soth Korea to develop as a thriving Democracy.
B008476HBM|4.0|I never thought I'd ever say that I liked a movie better than a book.  Parts of the book get a little tedious and move slowly.  But the overall story is great.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|I have fond memories of this story and find myself quoting values to my daughter, so we watched it.  The creativity, honesty and humor are well balanced.
B009OYTIXS|5.0|AWESOME show that's all i can say buy it rent it you will not be disappointed Show support for DC enjoy!!!
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I liked the Selection a lot better.  But, since I'm now committed to seeing the series to its conclusion, I’ll finish reading the series.  The Elite really didn’t move forward much….only a few “surprises” in my opinion.  If you loved the Selection, you’ll probably like The Elite.
B000NY12LO|3.0|This book really took me by surprise. I started it a while ago and couldn't get into it but after I just kept reading, I ended up not being able to put it down.
B00COGY2P2|2.0|I thoroughly enjoy the Lee Child Jack Reacher books.  Cruise just doesn't get across the brooding inner man, suffering his own torments...he's most convincing in his action moments but that doesn't cut the mustard.  Sometimes draggy; overall disappointing.
0525423281|5.0|I loved this book. So light and funny. I love Stephanie Perkins. And San Francisco must be a beautiful city.
B001S2PT3M|5.0|Absolutely pleased! Discs were here in days, in brand new condition at a phenomenal price!!  We are hooked on the series and ordering thru Amazon made it so easy - thanks Amazon!
0525423273|5.0|I loved this book! The romance of Anna and St. Clair is so cute. I love they both! That's an amazing romance.
B008RKGF1I|5.0|Great movie when came out in the 80's and still fun!  The music is still current and makes you want to get up and dance - and get in shape!
B004XISI4A|4.0|The story slows down alot from the first few books but still a great story and a great read. I love the character development it seems like everyone is taking a rest to figure out what they want to do rather than the normal fast paced action of the earlier books.
B000002C2E|5.0|Even though I am a huge fan of Muse, my husband and I have been Dylan fans for forty plus years and this one of his classics.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Once you start you can't stop, you'll find yourself reading from morning till evening can't barely wait to turn the pages to find out what happens next.<br />Incredible writing, captivating story, a must read, way better than the tv series/
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|You just can't go wrong with Peter Jackson's directing, adaptation and vision for JRRT's fantasy. I'm so glad that he loves the novels as much as I do. He has done the series proud.
1594746168|5.0|I love these kinds of literary hoaxes that purport to be lost manuscripts/documents/etc., and Hudspeth pulls it off nicely. The previous reviews tell you what it's about, so just let me add that it's done quite nicely. The Codex Extinct Animalia is the most fun part of the book, with its highly detailed views of, shall we say, *outre* animal biology, but the biography of Dr. Black is well worth reading. Darkly and delightfully charming, it tells how these illustrations were created, and the posters, articles, and other illustrations are well done and lend verisimilitude to the whole. The only thing lacking is a bit of a human touch -- it's more intellectually stimulating than emotionally involving, but is well worth a few hours perusal, and more than well worth adding to your shelf of...oddities...
B004SKLD9A|1.0|First off, I  would rate  Equilibrium as a 5 star film,  however  this review concerns the blu ray itself.  If you could even call it a blu ray.  Aspect ratio is cropped from 2.35  to 1.78 ( lame) and there is no multichannel HD  audio track.  Are you kidding me?!  Equilibrium is a great movie but this blu ray just doesn't do it justice.  Don't buy this.  Instead get the Miramax double feature of  Equilibrium  and  Renaissance.  The films  are compressed to fit on one single layer blu ray but at least it is done well with proper aspect.  It at least has DD  though I  would prefer at least DD+  or better yet DTHD or DTS-HD
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Once you get used to some of the quirky procedures you need to go through to make the scans it works great and the scansare wonderful.
B00338QENI|4.0|Besides the fascinating explanations of how research for medical treatments, cures, and heredity have been conducted over the generations, I really enjoyed the story of Henrietta Lacks and learning about her family, which the author endears to the reader very well, who grew up and lived during such precarious times and circumstances as were the years of early and mid 20th century for this black family.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Great story lots of action and fights awesome graphics and sound. I love sci fi this was a very good movie also used it to try out my new surround sound and streaming from Amazon works great!
0425166805|5.0|Personally this book gives people a new perspective about our world.  It shouldn't be taken to heart, but just learning a new viewpoint is mind boggling.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee, I am so very glad you survived your ordeal. Please know that there still are good people in this world but sadly life is getting harder it seems and good people seem to be losing a lot of their goodness of character. There are so many temptations in this world. Who knows how many sickos might try to imitate your captivity Jaycee or say the captivity of those three women in Ohio. It seems that much crime in this country is imitated. So who knows who else might be abducted and held and who knows who might be in captivity right now.<br /><br />That being said Jaycee you and your daughters are lucky to be alive today and lucky to have your freedom. Philip Garrido is obviously a very sick and perverted man. Who films little girls doing splits and stuff at the park? Who rapes an eleven year old girl, fathers two children with her and steals 18 years from her? Philip Garrido is obviously a very unbalanced man and his wife seemed to be pretty bad off two. The wife was an enabler. She lived in a loveless marriage and she participated in kidnapping, drug abuse, and so much more. I think if you hadn't played the game these two forced upon you that they might have lost it and killed you. The Garridos are dangerous people. Philip is schizophrenic and he sounds half out of his mind. That being said I hope Philip cannot use insanity as a defense.<br /><br />As the book goes, yes it was tedious at times but it was also very bleak and depressing. It was one disappointment after another for you, cats being taken from you, cats dying, the bird dying, no way out of that house or that backyard. Garrido knew he'd have it made if he kidnapped a young child who was afraid to venture out into the world. And you didn't know if your mother was still alive, if they were still in California. You had no money. Jaycee you were made dependent upon the lies of the Garridos and you were afraid of the outside world. What kid isn't afraid of getting lost in the woods or in a city. I think Jaycee you only had one viable outlet with the Garridosa and that was to KILL THEM. You chose not to try that I guess. So you are not now a killer and that is something for sure. So now the Garridos are caged like the animals that they are. You know child rapists are know to be raped or killed in prison. It would be nice to know that Phil Garrido got a little of his own medicine. That being said I do think Garrido needs to be on medication. Who knows how might change after medication.<br /><br />Take care Jaycee. I hope someday you find a real love for yourself. I'm sure it must be pretty impossible for you to even think about letting a man back into your life. I don't know what to tell you. I myself have never really trusted women and casual sex was never my thing. I pity people who think the animal act of sex is so important. What ever happened to people dating and taking relationships very slow? Why is LOVE, MARRIAGE and FAMILY treated so badly these days by people. People are afraid of those three words so they try to compensate for it all with lots of sexual adventure, sleeping around, etc.<br /><br />Take care. Glad to see you with your Mom, Shawnee, and the kids and your Aunt.

B000N6TX1S|5.0|I love this movie! This movie have touch my heart! A women tries to flee from another country to have the baby in a safe land! With the help from a guy who was introduce by his ex-wife! I even also heard that there was a book out about this movie! This was a fine gift from a friend of mine! I even told her about this movie, but I didn't tell her the whole movie! I just want her to watch it for herself! This even let you know about armageddon is coming! It is worth watching! Thanks Amazon!<br /><br />Dee Smalls!<br />Representing:<br />Decatur GA!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this for the parents. A gazillion games online and they stick with the old favorite! It's free and it's fun.
B00280LYIC|3.0|This book was a pretty good read.  I enjoyed reading the book, but I do not know if I will buy the rest of the series.
B004GYY714|3.0|Got this before Slacker and Pandora. I dropped this pretty fast for the former. Not a bad app but there are better
B00095NX9G|5.0|We have a dance studio in my town, but it is just ballet and &#34;clogging&#34; or tap-dancing.  I can do the exercises in my own and learn a dance style from the best of the best!  I started belly dancing several years ago, from video.  I love to dance!
B000PD3LIA|5.0|This is just what I expected, couldn't be happier. Really enjoy listening to it. If you like Robert Rodriguez movies with his music in them you'll like the CD.
B009UZBLSG|1.0|This item is extremely overpriced. Similar devices are selling for $60 to $65 less than this device. In addition, I would rather pay $60 for a wireless device which supports Miracast, than the same price for this adapter which should only cost about $5-$10.<br /><br />In addition, the auxiliary port for charging does not work.  The battery on your device will drain even when plugged into the wall socket, via the auxiliary port.
B008OIQYTG|4.0|This CD of comteporay Jazz is one I listen to over and over again. I enjoy having it playing in the car. It calms me while driving. Track number 1 River Man is my absolute favorite; however, the whole CD is worth the buy.
B00BP4X944|5.0|Sally Hawkins puts smiles on all of our faces in this light hearted film. Her character, Poppy, shows us how to ride the fine line between the pain of reality and the joy of the little things in life. This film is full of non-stop laughs and hilarity. 5 out of 5, easily one of my favorite films of all time :)
0385349831|5.0|Coelho delivers another thought provoking analysis of the human condition. Again he takes us on a journey and where we arrive at is much different from where we started. I have never been disappointed with his work.
B002361MLA|1.0|Although Mr. Tolle has some interesting ideas, they are a deception.  This book promotes the original lie, ...\\"You will be like God.\\"
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|My daughter has read the book, but enjoys the movie more.  Her class did the book as a novel story, then watched the movie to compare media to literature.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Amazon PLEASE add more highlighter colors to your app. I started reading on googles play books app because of this. Please innovate. Its only a matter of time before people catch up to you in content.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|Love the album!! With few exceptions the second album is beautiful.  I only wish some of the interludes (many of which are amazing) were their own track.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|I first heard this duo on the MTV Woodie awards but didn't catch the name. After doing some research I found out the name. Previewed it on iTunes but ordered the cd off Amazon. Cd's sound better.  Anyway I really enjoy it. Only 1 or 2 songs I skip but its a great soundtrack for the summer.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have not yet downloaded this game to my kindle fire, but I am playing it on my Samsung Glaxy SII and it is awesome. I really enjoyed the first version of Cut The Rope, and this takes it up a notch.
B007PKDW44|4.0|After hearing a few songs off this album on Pandora I had to check it out. Great from start to finish definitely worth $10.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book was very interesting and i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new way to think about the way society views and defines success. Gladwell clearly did his research on the topic because he consistently uses concrete examples about the stories he tells. I personally had to read it for one of my classes and found it to be the most interesting book i read the entire semester. It really made me sit back and appreciate the opportunities I have been given and what I was able to accomplish. For the class assignment, I had to focus on a specific chapter (the last one) and analyze and write about it. The chapter reminded me of my own life and inspired me to work alittle harder, pay a little more attention to my surroundings and appreciate my current position in life a little bit more. all in all, i gave this book 5 stars because of what i was able to take away from it despite the fact that he clearly states that it was not meant to be an inspirational book.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|The 411 by Maria:<br /><br />I just finished wiping my tears and the tightness in my throat has finally subsided. While I have never read Safe Haven, I find myself longing to dive into the book now that I have seen this beautiful movie.<br /><br />Julianne is great as Katie/Erin a woman who is running from something. She finds herself in sun filled, North Caroline and she decides this is the place for a fresh new start.<br /><br />Alex played by Josh is a widower of two, a boy and girl who runs a convenience store down on the docks.<br /><br />As fate would have it these two beautiful people gravitate toward each other and make nice before Katie/Erin's past threatens to end what they have before it has even begun.<br /><br />This sweet story has so many loveable characters Julianne definitely holds her own as a female lead and who doesn't love Josh? But there were other great characters too, especially the two young actors playing Josh's family. Mimi Kirkland as Lexie Wheatley in her acting debut is simply adorable and Noah Lomax as Josh Wheatley are very sweet. I also love Roger, Red West who has an acting bio a mile long and absolutely loved Katie's only friend Jo played by Cobie Smulders.<br /><br />Ohhhhh yeah and I absolutely was in loving with the coloring of the movie. Very poetic, thought provoking and muted. A perfect palate.<br /><br />The surprise ending was definitely an eye opening moment for me and I don't know how I didn't see it coming.<br /><br />Truly a lovely movie with a little mystery, a little drama, a tiny bit of comedy, romance, and a whole lot of heart.<br /><br />SEE IT!
B00288KNJU|5.0|Directed by Henry Selick, Coraline is a full length, \\"stop motion\\" style animated feature.  Why should you care who Henry Selick is?  Because he is the director of such other stop motion films as \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" and a little movie called \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas!\\"  \\"Wait what?!\\" you may be saying.  \\"Didn't Tim Burton direct The Nightmare Before Christmas?\\"  No!  No I say!  While it was very much his brain child, Tim Burton was actually the producer!  Now that that's out of the way, on to the story!<br /><br />The screenplay is based off of a story by celebrated fantasy author Neil Gaiman.  In case his name isn't immediately recognizable to you, perhaps you might recognize some of his other literary work: American Gods, Marvel Comics' \\"1602\\" & his \\"Eternals\\" re-imagining as well as DC Comics' \\"Sandman\\" series.  Perhaps most memorable to the average moviegoer would be \\"Stardust,\\" which was made into a live-action film in 2007.<br /><br />The one and only possible downside to Coraline's wonderful story is perhaps that it is VERY reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland.  If you can get past that by seeing the plot as more of a \\"shout out\\" than a rip-off, you are in store for a thoroughly entertaining movie full of excitement and charm.  Coraline moves at a steady pace so as not to lose the viewer.  No waiting for something interesting to happen here!  Without spoiling too much for you, Coraline is a young girl who winds up in a new home that carries some old secrets.  Her inattentive parents encourage her to explore and she soon winds up in an alternate reality where things seem quite wonderful...for now.  There are many colorful and memorable characters she encounters and every one of them has a purpose.  Some may find the plot a little cliché but there are still some twists and turns before the credits roll.  Be warned though.  Those with children 8 years old or under may want to wait on this film due to potentially scary content.  Also, there is a verystrange but, in my personal opinion, harmless scene in which an overweight senior citizen is wearing very little.<br /><br />Visually, this is one of those movies that you could watch without any sound and still be entertained.  Fantastic color-schemes and great set & character designs keep you waiting to see what treats the next scene will hold.  Note: The version I saw was in 3D and while it was cool and all, it wasn't really necessary.  If it's the only version that you can get ahold of than don't hesitate but if you have a choice you may want to choose the more affordable standard version.  Especially if you have small children likely to take off the glasses, already wear glasses or are prone to headache or disorientation.<br /><br />The voice acting was good for me because it didn't fall into the common trap of making you think of the well known actor doing the voicework.  This is partially because many of the actors were unknown to me and partially because Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher & Ian McShane did a fine job.  They didn't sound too much like themselves or any of their previous characters, especially Dakota.<br /><br />The musical score was the typical fair for this type of movie but not bad by any means.  At times it sounds like it was done by Danny Elfman but it was actually scored by French composer Bruno Coulais.  This movie is NOT A MUSICAL by the way so if that was likely to put you off it is no longer an excuse.<br /><br />Coraline wraps up at a tidy 1 hour and 40 minutes which is not too long for kids with short attention spans (and tiny bladders) and not so short as to feel rushed.  Overall I LOVED this movie and can't recommend that you see it enough.  It has everything to keep anyone entertained, kids and adults alike.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|No offline reading. Requires audio.  I was pretty disappointed when I first learned that. I do like the audio and the pleasant voice reading the Bible. I also like the chronological daily reading plan.
B00COHIFQS|2.0|I had high expectations for this film and it simply didn't measure up.  There are a few startling scares.  But what this horror film lacks is a menace, malice and imagination.  Nothing here is groundbreaking and I didn't think it was scary at all.<br /><br />I expected it to be beautiful and challenging.  And the only scenes that really measured up were the opening scene and the dream sequences.  Other than those brief moments...you've found a cure for insomnia and a vector for boredom.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I was pleased with its fast arrival and the quality of the DVD.  I would definitely buy this product again.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This album brings me great pleasure.  After watching Scotty on American Idol you are able to hear and see how much he has matured.  I expecr many more great hits from him.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is so much fun, not to mention really well done graphics and a nice story line. Get this app! It's free!
0446547646|5.0|I guess when you truly love someone, time isn't that important.  The renewed love shared by these two is wonderful.  She was able to keep part of him with her in her son.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Headline says it all...fun, just enough historical fact to make you wonder.  Thoroughly enjoyed it and now seeking another Sigma Force novel!
B003B02PEU|5.0|This book is full of suspense and each character came to life in the story. I especially loved the relationship between Willie and Miss Callie. John Grisham really exceeded my expectations.
B001F12J48|4.0|It took awhile the for 3D to come in but when it did it was pretty good and my grandson enjoyed it
193700788X|1.0|Unfortunately I must agree with many of the folks who gave this book 1 star. I'm sure many readers purchased this book to see what would become of Sookie's life, here and after. Well I must say it looks like Ms.Harris put this book together in mighty hurry or had someone else right it for her. Some described the book as \\"fan fic\\". I must agree. For those of you planning on reading this book, you are warned. I think all the review says it all. Totally bummed. :(
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|This is a well-written, fun app.  My 2-yr-old enjoyed playing with it.  However, after just a few levels of play, you are solicited to buy items to make your coral reef grow faster.  I don't think so -- uninstalled immediately.
1476733953|5.0|Saw a review in the newspaper about this book.  Sounded just like the type of story I like.  I was even more impressed than I thought I would be.  Finished the book in one weekend.  Can't wait to read the Shift stories and the new Dust...
B008K8VDPU|4.0|My 2-yr-old daughter has no interest in our piano or keyboard, but loves this app.  Don't know why, but am glad she's developing an interest in music.  She especially likes being able to change the instrument sounds.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Totally happy with Jake Bugg's lyrics & sound! Lots of musical influences. Not a disappointment. Looking forward to introducing him to others.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|Not worth your money.  we bought this for the grand children who are 8 years old.  Neither of them like to play it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Can't wait for the next one! Riordan weaves intricate stories meant to grip you in his story web. Looking forward to the next book in this saga.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|At my age the brain can use all the help it can get.  This app is a good start to meeting that need.  Worth the price.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|The i3 has run with speed, reliability, and aplomb for me since last year. If you've got cash to burn or would like the fastest machine in town go else where. This chip will provide more than enough processing for most (non graphics design/engineering) business environments, casual gamers, internet surfing, and more. Give it lots of RAM and let it rip. Having both i3 and i5 machines I can say it makes a huge difference on the geek bench (especially over clocked..) but in the real world for the (at the time $100+) price difference the i3 doesn't give up much if anything noticeable to it's big sister. I've never felt like I needed more processor on this machine. It is mostly used for internet surfing, streaming videos, light pictures, and non hard core gaming as well as a little MMORPG-ing. Cruises along great, compatibility has been great, no complaints. I can't stress enough I built this as a machine that will do what 99% of people use a computer for. I'm not doing 3d rendering, heavy photoshop, or trying to play the newest and best video games. I built this machine to do that all with the goal of spending less than $500 on it INCLUDING soft ware and peripherals. If you don't blink at the price difference between this and an i5, i7, or greater, obvious any of those chips is better. If you think you'll need it, or want it, and you aren't on a budget or doing an experiment like me, go for the better processor and enjoy. If you want a little wow factor but don't need bragging rights, just plan to do &#34;average stuff,&#34; and aren't into processor intensive hobbies, this little gem is a real bargain.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|For those of you unaware, Vampire Weekend is a band from New York City who formed while attending Columbia University. Prior to their first Album's release they toured the UK with \\"The Shins\\" and their song \\"Cape Cod Kwassa\\" was named one of the best songs of the year before their first album was ever released. Personally, I remember seeing the band name mentioned before the album came out and dismissing them because they sounded like some wanna-be goth band. Needless, when I was finally convinced to listen to it I was surprised by the Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel influenced sounds present on the album. Admittedly, I love the album. The album contains clever references like the oxford comma or to mansard roofs, things that most bands do not write songs about.<br /><br />Their second album was released in 2010, and was also excellent, they continued to do clover thing like rhyme \\"horchata\\" with \\"balaclava\\", and their song \\"Giving Up the Gun\\" was amazing.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was looking forward to their third album when it was released. The first thing I noticed on listen is that they seem to have abandoned their Africa-inspired twee from their first two records for a sound that's distinct but different. However, bands have to mature or they risk becoming stale. This is the point where bands either continue to improve like wine, or turn to be less edible like vinegar. I have to say that I really like the changes  that have been made in the album. I still love their first two albums, but this album is very good. Songs like Step stand out acoustically for the audacity of what they seek to portray. Other songs portray an emotional depth that wasn't present in previously albums, songs like \\"Diane Young\\" show that the band is more than a twee band of privileged New Yorkers. However, they do have some fun points, like \\"Worship You\\" which show they still have a great talent for wordplay and amusing tunes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and is very fun and entertaining it is awesome I enjoyed it very much and it was a good way to keep me from getting board also go sis boom buzz
B005OKTPKC|5.0|Great laugh, great ending. Grisham at his assured best.<br />The characters were believable with the whole gamut of virtues, vice and flaws. Great characters and stories for a cold and wet weekend Down Under. Thank you Mr Grisham.
006114665X|5.0|Ninety-nine years after the outbreak of World War I there is still a lively debate about the causes of the war. In this book the author carefully sifts through and analyzes communications of the powers that participated for a period of about twenty years leading up to the conflict with a particular emphasis on the Balkan states. Earlier authors have attempted to place the overall blame onto one or more nations, usually Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Here that narrative is brought into question. Those who find a deterministic flavor in this book are, I think, missing the point. But it does look as if things inconveniently fell into place during the July crisis of 1914.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Playing on kindle fire HD, no issues.<br />The story is good, game play smooth.  Not a lot of back n forth nonsense.
193700788X|4.0|I admit I am not a devoted fan of this series, but I have read all of the books as they came out.  I enjoyed the Sookie Stackhouse books, but would never have listed them as my favorites.  I felt this was a very satisfying conclusion to the series as Sookie ends the book more integrated into her community and family than ever before, maintaining and reestablishing ties with her supernatural connections, while also severing those ties that were not likely to have a good happily ever after.  As almost every review has revealed that Sookie does not end up with Eric, I feel free to say that I never saw how that would work out in a way that Sookie would want it to.  Throughout the series she has longed for a relationship that fit with her life expectations and she definitely gets that.  We get to touch base with major characters from past and see how they will fit into Sookie's life later on.  So I give this one four stars - still not my favorite, but worth the read and enjoyable.
0553805371|4.0|i am disappointed that these two super smart individuals can see a GRAND DESIGN, but fail to see how that there must be a GRAND DESIGNER!!!!!!!!
B00433SVP6|5.0|Loved every word. What a great book. Can't wait to read the next one. Keep them coming please again and again.
B0091REZMW|4.0|dont know how long they will let me play free cause i just started but so far its lovely. not much story just finding stuff in a house. fine for free!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved the first big, can't wait for the next update. It is a little slow loading, but the animation and guidance are very nice.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the second and final book in the series while at the beach this spring. Mockingjay was just as gripping as the first 2.  Too bad it is the final installment; I would love to see Katniss in action again!
1574214276|4.0|An interesting new hobby and form of relazation.  An interesting way for anyone to be an artist.  I enjoy this art form.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Cloud Atlas is a little hard to explain, mostly because it takes some time explaining itself - things only start falling into place well into the second half of the novel, and even then the sense it makes is intuitive rather than rational. Like the symphony that gives it its title, it's probably better experienced than described.<br /><br />Briefly, however: the novel consists of six very different stories (a nineteenth century travelogue, a 1930s melodrama, a hardboiled detective story, a British comedy, a cyberpunk story and a postapocalyptic thriller), each one interrupting the previous one throughout the first half of the book, and then resuming in opposite order throughout the second half. This means that for the first half, characters and plots and settings keep piling up until you can barely keep track of them anymore - and then, as one story after another gets resolved, it becomes obvious that they are all about the same thing; cruelty and kindness, victims and victimisers, the ever-presence of savagery and the surprising endurance of decency and hope.<br /><br />It's a powerful novel, though perhaps not the easiest one to read. It is recommended to anyone with a patience for sudden shifts in style and themes that only make sense very late in the game, and who want to see how the same ideas can be expressed not only through different stories, but through very different types of stories.
B0000TG9E2|1.0|I ordered this DVD and found that it is formatted for some other country - it won't play in my devices.
0670026557|5.0|The book is a little bit academic in some areas, however, it's a great book that teaches people working towards money&status is not the only way to success.
B00003CXAT|5.0|When this movie first came out, I was a kid. I loved it! It has it all. The animatronics are great, the acting is very believable. I watched in awe and amazement as a kid when the dinosaurs that we only saw moving in cartoons suddenly were moving with people! Now, 20 years later, it still is awesome! The concept is great, the story line is believable. I LOVE this movie still. I highly recommend it!
B00COHAUD4|3.0|Not your old fashioned horror story but the suspense keeps your attention. Wish the ending would have been a lot better.
B00BQUUH7E|1.0|It sends me back to the desktop after the second screen plz fix or give me my money back I want to play this game.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|This was a good movie.  It started a little slow but then it became suspenseful. I would watch it again.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I don't know what is going on but it wont let me get on my world. the app opens and I press start game and then it forces me out of the app. before that I loved it. if it is fixed I will give 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is so much fun but kind of hard to beat the first time you play it but after it is so easy
B006LSZECO|4.0|Had a hard time with it at the begining, too much so, so every day life stuff.  Was a good read a little far fetched but over all I enjoyed it
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I realize that because this product is free, that gives you free license to go crazy with the pop-up ads but this borders on the ridiculous!  Every single play gets one ad or, in some cases, two!  Makes playing the game a bother so I removed it.  Love Angry Birds.  Just really don't like the constant barrage of ads!  I have plenty of other free games that I play.  Not one of them has so many ads that I won't play them.  Angry Birds.....just forget it.  Not worth the irritation.  By the way, marketers, if I just click OUT of a certain ad without opting to click ON it, showing me the same ad a million more times will NOT CHANGE MY MIND!
B000001ELP|5.0|JUST BECAUSE THE TIMING OF IT'S RELEASE WAS OFF, (AND BOY WAS IT OFF) DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE MUSIC ON THIS RECORD IS BAD. IT WAS PERCEIVED AS BAD AT THE TIME BECAUSE FANS OF THE BAND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS DIRECTION. LISTEN TO IT WITH AN OPEN MIND TODAY AND REALIZE WHAT A WONDERFUL MASTERPIECE THIS ALBUM ACTUALLY IS. BRILLIANT PRODUCTION BY BOB EZRIN, AND MASTERFUL, SMART, SONG WRITING BY ALL CONCERNED! THE REMASTERING IS TOP NOTCH AS WELL.
B008MEM24S|4.0|my daughter thoroughly enjoys playing this game....it was well worth the $0.99 I paid for the full version of the game
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|This movie is lengthy, but it feels shorter every time.  First saw this in 48 fps and 3D, which served the action scenes very well.  Wish this blu-ray and and blu-ray players can play it in HFR (high frame rate 48 fps).  Still worth owning!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This game is really alot of fun.When I start playing it is hard to quit.I try to beat my score from the time before.I would recommend this game for all ages
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Haven't seen anything like this yet.  Production and cinematography is movie quality.  Can't wait for more seasons of this fantastic show.  LOTR on steroids (kind of).
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|fairly smooth gameplay with good graphix and point system. and all of this for free? not a bad deal any day of the week.
B004M9AS3Y|5.0|This bag fits all my gear; 15&#34; laptop, iPad, DSLR (5D MKIII w/lens), spare lens, GoPro, chargers, and cables! And it's small and well built.  Sure it can get heavy, but that's the price you pay for being able to carry all your gear.  Protect it with your life!
B003OPUZYY|5.0|Ten Years After never had more than one Top 40 hit, but they were one of the best blues rock/boogie bands to emerge from the pack during the late sixties and early seventies. If you don't have any of their CDs, this is the one to get. It covers their best works....all five lps on three CDs....Ssssh, Cricklewood Green, Watt, A Space in Time and Rock And Roll Music To The World. Highly Recommended!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|One of the heart well rounded books I've read in a long time. Which says a lot, because most of the time I only finish half the book, get bored, and quit reading it. This book I really enjoyed.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This game is another version of bejeweled and it is too easy; not very challenging for adults; its more of a young kid's game
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Just like the TV series but in more detail and depth. Loved it and I'm halfway through the second book already.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|Warning! Spoiler ahead!<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is the story. It has some deep character developments. The shooting scene in the lab is a good example. It's shocking and touching at the same time because I know why it happened.<br /><br />It has quite a few suspenseful moments. The shooting in the lab is one of them.<br />The acting of many actors is engaging. One of the supporting actress who played a female killer is convincingly scary. Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are believable. I did care for their characters.<br /><br />There are a lot of gripping action scenes. For example, the scene where Rachel was sandwiched between 2 policemen in a narrow alley.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, the production budget of this film was $125 million.<br />Domestic gross  $113,203,870<br />Foreign gross  $162,940,880<br />________________________________________<br />Worldwide gross  $276,144,750<br /><br />So, it made a huge profit, more than 150 million of dollars.<br /><br />In short, it's definitely worth watching.
0887081770|5.0|Very creative story, and not to question Eric Carle's artistic work. I love the way how the extended pages are done. They are little surprises for my toddler. I won't give the book to my LO yet though because the extended pages are thiner and she can rip them off. The story makes my heart warm whenever I read for my child. Plus, the book has some simple math concepts such as up, down, very long, small, big, and etc.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|Lord of the Rings has ruled the fantasy roost for over 60 years, reinvigorated by the recent 3 part film version. Game of Thrones has much in common with LOTR (not the least of which is that Sean Bean gets killed off at the end of the first installment.) but as filmed works, there are a few really big differences, which are illuminating about the TV versus feature film medium, which has a far higher budget per hour of viewing time. The feature film can have many more elaborate effects, including truly epic battles. LOTR has two battle scenes which would exhaust the budget of a TV series year in that 30 minutes of film. So how does the small screen make up the difference. In a word, it is Sex. The earlier series \\"Rome\\" had at least one sexually explicit scene per episode. \\"Game of Thrones\\" is even more explicit, including at least one homosexual bedroom scene. The good side of this is that the lead cast is almost perfectly balanced (roughly 14 out of 30 lead characters are women, if you don't count the headliner, Peter Dinklage, who is in a class by himself.) This is a dramatic change from LOTR, which had only three women in important roles, and that was done by major expansion of Arwen Evenstar's role over what we read in the novels. So, even though I know LOTR has a lot of female fans, \\"Game of Thrones\\" is a far better narrative for woman's roles, mostly as advisors and behind the back deal makers and game changers for the make kings. There is even a full blooded queen pretender to the \\"Iron Throne\\".<br /><br />Regarding the DVD release, I'm really happy with the additions. Every episode has a voice over commentary, but some, from the writers, directors, creators, and lead adult actors is better than those done by the child actors. That is not to say their performances on screen are not first rate. Maisie Williams as Arya Stark and Isaac Hempstead-Wright as Bran Stark are both exceptional.<br /><br />And... Peter Dinklage clearly deserves the several acting awards he has received for his role in the series. I am now a big fan of his work.he has received for his role in the series. I am now a big fan of his work.

B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I got this app as the FAOTD and was super excited about it. I've been a huge fan of the Diner Dash series and when I saw that all 12 of the restaurants were unlocked, I thought it was really great. The following day there was an update and made 6 of the restaurants locked and I would have to pay $1 for each of the 6 locked restaurants if I wanted to play them.<br /><br />Now, I don't mind if those 6 restaurants actually came locked. I do, however, find it very disturbing that the version that was given to us for FAOTD was all unlocked and then was switched back to requiring payment. That's really deceitful and underhanded. You should have made it clear that there's material in the app that requires additional play to unlock but to trick people by issuing an update that made the game unavailable the following day is just VERY SHADY.<br /><br />I like the diner dash series and I like the game, I think PF did a good job with the graphics and game interface. I shelled out $6 for the 6 restaurants because I like game. I think from that stunt alone, you've lost a lot of fans and customers.<br /><br />DON'T DO THAT AGAIN!!!!!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|my wife got me hooked on it . only played it once but looking forward to having more chances to play
193700788X|2.0|I did not think the series would end this way. I had a feeling Sookie would not end with Eric, but never thought she would end up with Sam. I would have prefer her ending up with a human like Hunter's dad by the way what happened to him. I picture Sookie living a full life with someone honest and hard working like hunter's dad. Eric making the deal just to keep her safe and at the very end Eric looking over her grave years after reading: beloved wife, mother and grandmother her spirit lives on ... Or something like that. I love Eric and Sookie but having read the books I suspected they were not going to be together. But Sam omg not really the best choice.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|Marvel is by far, one of the best when it comes to comics/super heroes. I've seen this movie a few times in theaters already, it's even better watching them in my jammies. :D
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I was not disappointed with this movie.  I am happy to report that not all of the funny scenes were in the commercials--which is usually the case in a comedy.  It made for a great comedy and a good emotional rollercoaster depiction of what occurs when pregnancy happens in life.  I would recommend this for anyone wanting a comic relief from a dull day.

B005IQZB14|2.0|I really liked this book until about half way through. I wanted to like it so badly, but really I can't like a book when I don't like the main character. Her thoughts and actions really just became increasingly annoying to me. I do not really recommend this book. I was still entertained but I don't really like this book. To me, it seems like she hadn't changed at all throughout the book. I was hoping for some self discovery but did not get it.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Great movie if you take it on concept, and the A-list cast delivers. If you're like X-file's Mulder, and you too &#34;want to believe&#34; then this is for you.

0071752854|5.0|Editors and agents are always looking for fresh ideas. Something innovative that will capture the imagination of the reading public. The process begins with an idea then it evolves into a story to illustrate the concept with some compelling words.<br /><br />For many years I've been interested in the publishing process. Which ideas are published and which ideas languish? What is the process to persuade an editor or agent to take your project or to get a magazine editor to publish your words?<br /><br />Some of this process happens in your pitch. During writers conferences, I've often participated in pitch sessions. I've been the writer coming to the editor or agent with a single idea or maybe several ideas. I've had to craft my words and target a particular magazine or publication (researched ahead of time). I want to persuade the publishing professional to express enough interest that he wants to see my material after the conference. I've also been the agent or editor listening to the writer pitch their ideas at these events.<br /><br />What are the factors that make a difference to capture interest?<br /><br />At the recent Author 101 University, a writing coach told me about a business book from Oren Klaff called PITCH ANYTHING. Notice how I purchased this book because of a word of mouth recommendation. It is the strongest way to influence others to buy a book. It was the title that caught my attention. Then the subtitle hooked me, \\"An Innovative Method for Presenting, Persuading, and Winning the Deal.\\"<br /><br />In the first chapter, Klaff reveals that he raises capital for businesses \\"at a rate of about $2 million per week. From the outside, the reasons for my success seem simple: I offer wealthy investors profitable deals that involve Wall Street banks. But others do that, too. Yet I raise a lot more money than they do. They compete in the same markets. Do the same types of deals. Pitch the same kinds of facts and figures. But the numbers show I am consistently one of the best. The difference isn't luck. It is not a special gift. And I have no background in sales. What I do have is a good method.\\"<br /><br />As a writer, you may be reading this last paragraph and think this book is only for business people and way beyond your publishing life. Not so. Whether you are pitching a magazine article or a book to a publisher, the pitching (or selling) dynamics are the same. Some creative types are going to resist the concept of selling. Yet selling is exactly what you do every time you persuade an editor to publish your work (book or magazine or newsletter or whatever).<br /><br />I've been captivated with the writing in Klaff's PITCH ANYTHING. His stories combined with how-to information make this book worth reading. I'm still reading this book and was also impressed with the customer reviews on Amazon for this book.

B002SAUCBC|5.0|The storyline really makes you think. Why would anyone sign up willingly for this long walk that results in death unless you are the winner. I wish that there was a sequel, I want to know what happens to the winner.
B000066C6Z|5.0|The campy humor in this movie is amazing! Funny story, great acting and a young Val kilmer that just kills it with comedy one liners!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|A 14 episode series that leaves you wanting more! You need to follow it up with the movie Serenity. And then what? I guess you can watch Castle for Fillion's occasional references to this landmark show. I love the mix of old west with space age, and eastern and western culture. Great characters, relationships.  Completely entertaining.  I've watched this 3 times, and know I'll see it again. Five stars.
B006YTYIXG|5.0|By far their most brutal and unrelenting album to date!<br />With guest vokills by Travis from Cattle Decapitation and Dez from DevilDriver<br />I will always support Max Cavalera and his musical output! And if you do too, grab this record!

B005S9EKCW|5.0|Purchased for my mother on her birthday and finally watched it myself!<br /><br />Great Film! And worth the buy! Especially the blu-ray version!
1616550414|4.0|I bought the book because of my appreciation for the many lost hours and days spent in the Zelda Universe. It didn't disappoint. I had a blast going through and reading the specific little details and thought processes of the creators. The pages are dense enough that it I'm not worried that flipping through them will have any lasting effect or deteriorate in any way.<br /><br />The book does have a really heavy bias towards skyward sword. So if you haven't beaten that one, I wouldn't recommend it. It's really a collectors book, which brings me to my main drawback: the book was slightly damaged on the cover in one of the corners when I received it, which is a shame since I have it on display along with a few other collectable books. The damage can't be seen in the display, but I &#34;know&#34; it's there and it bothers me. Hopefully that was just a fluke and doesn't happen to everyone.<br /><br />In the end, the book is what I hoped for: Learning more about Zelda and how everything fit into place...My one drawback aside, I recommend it to fans of the series and collectors.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|The first release in 14+ years!<br />Well worth the buy, cool tones and a triumphant return for these Seattle grunge champions!

B008ZOHCKE|5.0|You can put titles on each page of the book as a subheading in the book that you make up.  I use this a lot!
B0013D8LOK|5.0|This DVD arrived like new!  The cover/case is in near perfect condition and the disc itself has no scratches and plays perfectly.  I didn't spend much money on this and yet I couldn't be happier with it.  Also, I received it fairly quickly.  Lots of times when you buy something at a decreased price you have to wait forever to get it, but this was not the case here.  I highly recommend buying from this vendor.
0061353248|3.0|The book contains interesting insights as to why we seemingly act irrational in our day-to-day purchase decisions, getting us to think about why we make our decisions from a behavioral point of view.<br />This book is recommended for the general public, but may also be of interest to economists, marketers or business people working in retail or consumer goods. The nature of it is more anecdotal, but the book is entertaining.

B0076HNCTQ|5.0|Very good characterization and plot development. Great finale. Would recommend this to any David Lynch fan or cult movie  aficiionado.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The levels are challenging and the information on the ancient world are very useful. The art work used to put the game together is also very good and so is the smoothness of game play. Thoroughly an enjoyable experience.
0425252868|5.0|This book does a great job managing two separate, yet intersecting, story lines. The mix of historical reporting and human interest made this a fantastic read.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Powerfully written yet from the heart of an 11 year old.  Honest.<br />Read the book in 4 short sessions. Congratulations Jayce.
193700788X|5.0|I'm frankly bewildered by the venom in some of the negative, hateful reviews here. I don't feel that the tone or integrity of the characters in this series has changed in this finale.  I think that bringing in, or remembering, so many beloved characters from the series gave a wonderful opportunity to meet and say goodbye, in a way, to each of them, and that the resolutions and relationships were logical and emotionally satisfying. Sookie's love relationship (no spoilers) was, if anything, like finally exhaling to me. It was beautiful, measured, mature, but very passionate!  Kudos, Charlaine Harris. I'll be happy to pick up the first book and read them all again.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Now that I have had some time to use it I can give it a rating.<br /> I have always loved Mahjong and now it has gotten even better because I can sit back in my recliner and play. I like that it keeps my scores so I can go back to a previous one and try and beat myself. A great game.

B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I think you should be able to walk around. also it is very very very very boring. I literally fell asleep playing
B00498YZH8|5.0|I consider this film to be perfect in every detail. The script, acting, and cinematography were all incredibly strong, and the editing was amazingly refined. I loved it.
B004X6PRO6|1.0|more of a political piece than a work of literature --prose is flat and story (if you could call it a story is repetitive)
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice app  very user friendly!  Very easy to use. I like that you can touch th card and it will move to.where you want it. I.don't like.this review app because I canr seem to get out if it. hopefully typing a bunch here will work.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Its a really interesting book written in a very creative way. It has chapters that are unbelievable and some others that in my opinion aren't half as good and I believe is due to the different voices or cultural background of the different characters. Obviously all the Americans or westerners seem to have a really convincing voice and you forget this and get into the story. But then other foreigners (not all) it just feels like their voices are forced and insincere.<br /><br />Its still a pretty darn interesting, creative and very well researched book (geopolitically, culturally, technology-wise, etc.) considering that we're talking about fantasy or sci fi. A must read tho.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I love the game.  It my take up a fair amount of space, but it is well worth it.  No lag, glitches or freezes.  Campaign is standard world takeover plot.  Multiplayer is nice.  You can play others at your house through WiFi , or others around the world through gameloft.  All around fun game, I like that you do not have to unlock weapons in multiplayer, you have all guns and accessories.  An update with new guns every now and then would be nice.
1452110581|5.0|If you love cats and know cats, then this book is a must for you.  If you , like me, have had several different felines share your life, you will recognize almost everything you read in this book.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show, I watched a lot more of it beyond this purchase.  I am happy.<br />I will watch more, I promise.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I'm supposed to be working on stuff today, but I downloaded this game and that's all she wrote. I usually don't like these kinds of \\"match three\\" games, but this one is more challenging and I can probably play it forever. The graphics are beautiful and the little background song is cute, too. I liked it so much that I used my handy, dandy Amazon Coins to purchase the full game. Totally worth it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great show, but I also feel like they played the death card a bit too often in this season.  Not anyone's fault, just how I felt.<br />Great show.  Wish I could watch more right now.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Liked it.  Scenery was fantastic, special effects excellent, acting very good.  The movie was thoroughly entertaining throughout, but not riveting.
193700788X|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this final tale of Sookie adventures.  I read several reviews before buying this book and was fully prepared to be disappointed by it.  I was wrong!  Perhaps because I am only a literary fan of Sookie Stackhouse and do not watch TrueBlood?  I think the characters were very true to themselves and made the next leap of growth in their persona versus making the same mistakes they themselves have recognized again and again.  I believe that Ms. Harris did an excellent job in previous books of putting \\"the writing on the wall\\" and have to wonder exactly what books the critics who are crying foul actually read?  I do wish it had been longer and gone farther into Sookie's future, but that is very much Ms. Harris's style of writing and at the end of each book haven't we all be left wanting just a little more?  Thank you, Ms. Harris for such a wonderful and imaginative series.

B008K8VDPU|2.0|The keyboard is polyphonic, which is good, but every sound is the same. The &#34;grand piano&#34; sounds just like the &#34;guitar&#34;. The only difference is the organ, which can sustain a note when held. Other than that, it sounds just like the piano. The &#34;grand piano&#34; sounds like a children's toy piano. I would think that with so much sampling technology out there, getting a good piano sound would be easy. I guess not.

B00CL0J99K|5.0|For most of the world, Iron Man 3 is the first Marvel film following the massively successful Avengers film.  People the world over have waited to see how Marvel will go back to focusing on a single superhero and whether it would satisfy after last summer's superhero binge.  But for some of us Iron Man 3 is important for a very different reason.  For a few movie fans, Iron Man 3 signifies not necessarily the glorious return of a franchise superhero, but rather the reunion between star Robert Downey Jr. and director Shane Black.  You might be unfamiliar with the name Shane Black (and honestly who could forget a name like that), but you almost certainly are familiar with the movies he has scripted.  In the late eighties/early nineties Black became the highest paid screenwriter of all time.  He's most famous for his work on Lethal Weapon and its first sequel and less famous for films like The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight (although, for my money, The Last Boy Scout is entirely underrated).  His movies combined action elements popular in the eighties with a decidedly film noirish cynicism.  It was no surprise, then, when, after nearly a decade missing in action, Shane Black's first directorial effort was a post-modern noir, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.<br /><br />It was overshadowed by the first Iron Man, but Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was without a doubt Robert Downey Jr.'s comeback vehicle.  It may not have reached the kind of audience that a superhero film can, but it once again proved that Robert Downey Jr. possessed impeccable comedic timing and charisma to spare.  And there's a shared comedic sensibility between Downey and Black.  Both seem to revel in freewheeling and unexpected turns, quick wits and big egos.  And while Iron Man 3 is first and foremost a big budget summer blockbuster, both Black and Downey find enough space to fit their own oversized personalities.<br /><br />There's plenty of back story in Iron Man 3, so much in fact that a lot of information isdelivered by Downey in the form of a voiceover.  The film begins at the turn of the new millennium when people were still worried about the Y2K virus and Eiffel 65's little ditty, \\"Blue,\\" was worming its way into our hearts.  One of the central themes of the film is how decisions have long term consequences that we aren't initially aware of, and so early on we are introduced to Maya Hansen, a genius botanist who is developing a procedure that could eventually help re-grow limbs.  We are also introduced to Aldrich Killian, played, at least in this part of the film, as socially awkward computer nerd who walks with a cane and has yet to master basic grooming techniques.  Killian makes his way onto the same elevator as Tony Stark, and he proceeds to pitch his idea for a venture capitalist start up.  In order to get rid of him, Stark promises to meet him up on the roof in a few minutes and then deliberately forgets about it.<br /><br />It should come as little surprise that thirteen years later Killian the socially clumsy computer nerd has become Killian the suave industrialist.  Killian has somehow cured his limp and is macking on Tony Stark's main squeeze, Pepper Potts.  Meanwhile there's a terrorist on the loose by the name of The Mandarin who has been releasing mysterious footage of himself decrying Western decadence while detonating bombs across the country with impunity.  It doesn't take much to figure out that there's a connection between The Mandarin and Killian (but things are either more or less than they seem at first).  While following one of Killian's henchmen, Stark's former body guard and friend, Happy Hogan, gets himself blowed up real good, and in a fit of rage Stark calls out The Mandarin on television, even providing his home address as a challenge.<br /><br />Stark's challenge is accepted, and three heavily armed helicopters show up at Stark's Frank Lloyd Wright inspired mansion and proceed to blow it up.  Stark narrowly escapes, and decides to play dead in rural Tennessee.  While convalescing in a barn, Stark strikes up a friendship with a precocious ten year old named Harvey.  Stark spends most of the film outside of the Iron Man suit, a smart move on the part of the filmmakers.  One of the chief problems with superhero films is that the superpowers can get in the way of the action.  We're never quite certain how much punishment the protagonist can take and after a while watching two nearly invulnerable people pound on each other starts to lose its appeal.  This is why it's much easier to build a movie around Batman than Superman.<br /><br />There are a number of twists and turns throughout the film, and I don't really want to give them away.  Shane Black is a master at setting up expectations just so he can undermine them.  (Watching Iron Man 3 a year after the Avengers got me thinking that maybe Black is the progenitor of Joss Whedon.  Both really want to pull the rug out from under the audience).  A lot of Black's personality really shines through in the film.  Like Lethal Weapon, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and A Long Kiss Goodnight, the movie takes place at Christmas (this guy loves Christmas).  Much of the dialogue consists of men exchanging quippy exchanges with one another while under nearly fatal doses of testosterone.  And Tony Stark, like Martin Riggs before him, is suffering from mental problems, a case of PTSD following the events of The Avengers.  Hell, the climax of the film even takes place at the docks.  Of course, all of Black's personality is shrouded in the wares of the Marvel Universe, but it's a good fit nonetheless.<br /><br />The film itself isn't perfect, exactly.  The villain's plan is ridiculously convoluted.  There are also a number of moments where the movie attempts to sublimate our collective trauma surrounding 9/11.  Terrorism is used as a plot point, but it's a mostly bloodless kind of terrorism that's meant to be exciting rather than horrific.  Perhaps the most troubling moment in thefilm happens when Tony Stark calls out The Mandarin, claiming that he's out for pure revenge and not politics, as if the two are mutually exclusive.  If we've learned anything after 9/11, we should have learned that vengeance is an extension of the political.  So the film might read as a piece of propaganda to some (which is true of most of the Iron Man movies) but to others it might be a fascinating depiction of America's failure to fully come to grips with 9/11 even a decade out.  But purely as a work of entertainment, Iron Man 3 is the most accomplished of the series.  Where Iron Man 1 and 2 worked best during moments of comedy and only started flailing during the action sequences, Iron Man 3 balances these two modes perfectly.  It got me thinking that this whole superhero thing might have legs after all.

0449806952|2.0|I purchased the kindle version years ago and have read it numerous times since then. Almost 2 years ago I purchased the audiobook, and have listened to it numerous times as well (I put it on my phone, and listen to it while I'm doing yard work.) So naturally I was SUPER excited to get the \\"complete\\" edition, with the additional stories being told. I popped it in this morning and started to listen to it. Max has redone his narrative, which isn't a big deal as it's the same text, just a deeper voice and different tempo. But getting into the first story, I got partway in and... wait, that's not right. The story doesn't go from him arriving at New Dachang, to him and the \\"orderlies\\" over the infected boy. What happened to him going in to look at the infected people in the meeting hall? I literally stopped the cd and grabbed my original version to compare the two. Yep, there's a several minute long part missing from the newer \\"complete\\" edition, skipping important information, and jumping abruptly ahead to where you don't know what's going on. Maybe it's a mistake in editing, and I hope so. But now instead of being able to sit back and enjoy this, I'm going to be listening for what else is missing. It unfortunately has ruined the experience for me.<br /><br />EDIT: I contacted Random House asking if it was intentionally done, if it was a mistake in production, and if so what they're doing about it. I was instructed to \\"return the CD's to the place of purchase.\\" Um... That's not what I asked or even want to do. Even if it was, what company allows returns of cd's, movies, software, etc after they've been opened? From everything I've seen, no-one will, nor have they let you for YEARS. I asked them if they were aware of that policy and I'm still waiting for a response... Bad customer service. Ignoring my questions, giving impossible advice, then not responding at all. I wish I could give Random House 1 star... But the audiobook is still good overall. Just know that when it jumps ahead and things don't make sense, it's not suppose to be that way.

B00AFROVQC|1.0|This was one of the most annoying books I've yet purchased for my Kindle. Not only is it built on clichés, it has absolutely no character development, no structure in the story, and no sense of timing.<br /><br />Inside three days this poor shepherd's boy manages to wriggle his way into the king's elite army, discovers he has hidden powers, is noticed by the mysterious court wizard, is adopted into the king's family, becomes a suitor to the beautiful princess, an enemy to the evil ambitious prince, best friends with the humble and youngest prince, and to top it all up he gets falsely accused of an attempt to poison the king. Ugh. It's as if the author simply made a list of fantasy clichés and wove an empty story around it. Oh, and there's also some talk of a powerful sword and The One Who Is Prophesied To Yield It. That will be this main character as well. I don't need to read the next books to know that.<br /><br />It's also riddled with unrealistic situations. For example, the main character saves the life of one of his fellow soldiers but gets knocked unconscious in the action (he constantly saves lives left and right throughout the entire book, I don't know how they survived for five minutes before he showed up). He lies unconscious for two days and nights. When he wakes up, he is immediately dragged from his bed for a big thank-you ceremony in front of the court. Afterwards, they put him through an entire day of hard training, and to end the day they all go on a hunt, which consist out of a mass of people loudly running through the forest for hours and shooting any animal they happen to come across (well, if animals were that stupid they'd deserve to be shot. Oh and of course he saves the life of the prince again while on the hunt). The main character manages to do all this without feeling tired, sick or without even a headache, despite being in a coma only hours before. Must be one of his many hidden powers.<br /><br />No, a terrible book. At the end the main character gets thrown in the dungeon and he can stay there for all I care.

193700788X|2.0|I don't know what to say about this book. The whole book seemed rushed and I didn't care for the ending. And since when can't Barry and Sookie communicate telepathically over a distance? That was driving me CRAZY! This was my least favorite book in the series.
034580404X|4.0|The books were in excellent condition.  The 1st book was good.  But, like the Hunger Games--I didn't care<br />for the entire Trilogy.  They were ok, but I've read better.

The pictures and descriptions are great. If I was not in a class where my teacher modifies poses for me, the modification options given would be indispensable. Highly recommended.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I like Mahjong and this version works well on my android.  I would recommend it to a friend looking for a brain exercise.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This is a fun game however, unlike other games you don't get more credits for 24 hours and have to purchase credits if you want to keep playing. The game freezes and although they refund your credits you lose any power ups you used during the round. Also one of the most aggravating things is if you brush against the bingo button without having a bingo it ends your game immediately. Quite often I hit the bingo button just adjusting my seat or attempting to click a number on the bottom row.<br /><br />It would be nice if you could purchase the power ups you want instead of getting random ones and also if you could gain more chances to get the collections. Especially without having to give access to people you don't know to your Facebook account.

B008JEJNDE|5.0|I'm just getting started with these shoes after only wearing them a couple of weeks.  They felt a little odd and a little too wide at first, but now I find them to feel really quite comfortable.  I wear them all day long whether I'm out in the yard or running errands downtown. I'm not easy on shoes.  My wife said I would grow to love them and I think she might be right.  The jury is still out on these, but what I've seen so far, they might be the best purchase I've made in shoes in a long time.

Acting is not bad, but compared to noah wyle most of the actors can't hold a candle. Its like watching a master with a bunch of amateurs (Drew Roy & Sarah Carter are also good though) Would recommend to anyone who likes sci-fi and aliens stories.

B000PMFTDQ|5.0|This disc includes some of the most spectacular singing ever recorded.  Though there are many other fine readings of the Four Last Songs, none provide the opulence of tone and range of dynamics achieved by Jessye Norman.  Kurt Masur and the Leipzig orchestra provide admirable support.  At just 46 minutes, this disc could have included more music, but at mid-price buyers need not hesitate.

B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Essentially, this movie is about two guys who aren't the brightest, but have the biggest hearts. They also happen to have the worst luck ever. While they are on vacation restoring their &#34;summer home,&#34; they make the mistake of saving a young, female college student. Her friends misinterpret their good deed and assume that they've abducted her for some pretty sick reasons. And that's where it becomes hysterical. It's a comedy with a unique, back woods serial killer kind of feel - definitely worth watching.

B0063GORYU|4.0|The rules on allowing players to make a choice to leave open empty rows when opening a new batch of cards, makes the game a little bit that much easier. The reason being that the old spider game i was use to playing did not allow such choices. Still its a very good time lossing game.

B007XGJK4G|5.0|Anyone with even a passing interest in Bob Marley or Jamaican culture would enjoy tbis film.  It goes into a fair amount of detail about his white father, including a riveting segment in which they play Bob's &#34;Cornerstone&#34; song for his white cousin, explaining to him that Bob was inspired to write the lyrics after the white Marleys refused to loan Bob money for a car.  Also surprising given that the film is a Tuff Gong production, it doesn't portray Bob as a saint . . , one of his daughters says that if she were her mother, she wouldn't have tolerated his infidelities.  Even if Bob's life doesn't interest you, the lush shots of Jamaica and colorful Rastas will enchant you.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|I liked how the true South of thos days was portryed. That is not meant as a judging comment, it's just the way things were then. Slavery was and is all over the world. This movie is full of action, comedy, retribution and a story of undying love one would die for. Jamie Foxx make a great cowboy, I would love to see him do more westerns. Leanardo DiCaprio played his part so well that it made me want to hate his character. It does get bloody in many parts of the movie, not for kids. I was a little dissapointed in the very end, the horse pracing and circles was a little cheesy. Considering that they are still in the deep south and just blew up a plantation and killed a lot of people, you'd think getting the heck out of there would be more important than impressing his wife with horse tricks. Over all I loved the movie, watched it twice and will buy it when it comes out on DVD.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a excellent true story about two Air Forces during WWII. The finish is the good thing that came out of this World War.
B009T8XBBO|2.0|I don't typically play these types of games, because from what i can tell, no skill is required. the directions are pointless, all you do is touch whatever is circled in green. until you hit a standstill on level 3 or 4 and can't do anything but wait for logs to regenerate. not my idea of thrilling.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The ONLY reason I rated this game a 4 was because it's too short. I wanted a longer game and I was disappointed it was over. Amazing graphics. Great sound.  I can't wait for another installment of this game. I would pay more for a longer game. Worth the $2. Get this game if you love puzzles. Someone referenced Mist and it 100% reminded me of that PC game.

1400069742|5.0|I am fascinated by Franklin Delano and Eleanor Roosevelt and have an extensive collection of books about them.  I thought that I knew quite a bit about our 32nd president until I read Lynne Olson's wonderful new book, Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh, and America's Fight Over World War II, 1939-1941.  Even knowing how this story turns out in the end, the entire book was totally engrossing and had more intrigue than a spy novel.<br /><br />Despite the title, Those Angry Days is not just about FDR and Charles Lindbergh.  Olson goes into great detail about the battle between Interventionists (who wanted us to assist England when they went to war with Germany) and the Isolationists during these three years.  \\"Arthur Schlesinger said the dispute was `the most savage political debate of my lifetime.'\\"  After the Supreme Court packing debacle, FDR was loathe to lead public opinion.  So while there was a definite leadership vacuum in the White House, private citizens, clubs, and a British spy agency, BSC (British Security Coordination) helped push public opinion toward the Interventionist viewpoint.  Such a change allowed the mostly Isolationist Congress to move for the adoption of Destroyers for Bases deal, conscription, Lend Lease and the repeal of the Neutrality Act.  Throughout this battle, Isolationists groups tried their hardest to keep the US neutral and their poster boy was none other than flying ace Charles Lindbergh.<br /><br />It was ironic that FDR and Lindbergh would find themselves on opposite sides here, as in other ways, they were so much alike.  \\"Both were strong-willed, stubborn men who believed deeply in their own superiority and had a sense of being endowed with a special purpose.  They were determined to do things their own way, were slow to acknowledge mistakes, and did not take well to criticism.  Self-absorbed and emotionally detached, they insisted on being in control at all times.\\"  Yet, FDR wasn't always in control during this period, and it took people like Herbert Agar, Dorothy Thompson, George Marshall, Robert Sherwood, as well as the Century Group, to force our country to support Britain as they fought Germany alone.  \\"Millions of individuals, convinced that the survival of their country was at stake, became involved in the debate, which for all its anger and mudslinging, was a true exercise in democracy.  Grassroots activism flourished throughout the nation as volunteers on both sides circulated petitions, phoned their neighbors, ran ads, and lobbied their congressman.\\"<br /><br />There was also so much intrigue during this time.  FDR used Hoover and the FBI to investigate Isolationists.  General Hap Arnold leaked top-secret military documents to the press.  German money was used to help Isolationist candidates for congress.  The Isolationist group, America First, was started by Yale students but hijacked by conservative Republicans, aided at times by anti-Semitics.  British Security Coordination was actually a spy organization operating out of Rockefeller Center.  Employing thousands and led by William Stephenson (the man called Intrepid), the BSC \\"planted propaganda in American newspapers, spied on isolationist groups, dug up political dirt on isolationists in Congress, and forged documents that, when brought to public attention, helped foment anti-Nazi sentiment.\\"  Stephenson also encouraged FDR to begin America's own foreign spy agency with Wild Bill Donovan as leader, which brought out the wrath of FBI head, J. Edgar Hoover.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed reading so much about this prelude to our entry into World War II.  Not only was it fascinating, but I enjoyed sharing major parts of it with others.  Also, although I Vine book, I intend to buy a corrected copy for my library.took people like Herbert Agar, Dorothy Thompson, George Marshall, Robert Sherwood, as well as the Century Group, to force our country to support Britain as they fought Germany alone.  \\"Millions of individuals, convinced that the survival of their country was at stake, became involved in the debate, which for all its anger and mudslinging, was a true exercise in democracy.

B009NY43NY|1.0|**Contains Spoilers***<br /><br />I was so very excited for the finale of the SVM series by Charlaine Harris.  I had a 7 hour flight ahead of me, returning to Boston from London, and was ready to fill the entire flight time with saying goodbye to Sookie and finally accepting it was over. All I can say is this; Dead Ever After should have been titled, Dead on Arrival, A Southern Vampire Misery.  Never would I have expected my favorite series to be ended in such an awful and incomplete way.  Charlaine Harris really, really dropped the ball on this book. Books 11 and 12 were a bit lacking, but not enough to deter me from wanting to read the next installment. This book, however, made me want to weep for those few hours of my life I wasted reading and will never get back. My problem with this book is not necessarily Sookie's \\"HEA\\" choice, but with the author's complete and total disregard for the characters and world she had created. Charlaine Harris spent almost 14 years pulling us deeper and deeper into the world of Sookie Stackhouse. With each book the stakes got higher, making us feel that much closer to her characters.  Each book had a pivotal moment when our hearts broke right along with Sookie, making us feel the emotions she so expertly brought out. Perhaps it was a huge Sookie moment, like when Bill admits his deceit and his true intentions for coming to Bon Temps.  Or, perhaps it was a smaller, more intimate moment, when Eric stays by her side to help ease her pain after she is staked in Club Dead.  No matter what was happening, readers of these books felt it deep within their souls.  Dead Ever After had none of these moments...not one.<br /><br />This book read as though it was penned by a complete stranger.  It is full of inconsistencies, distracting me to the point of wanting to pull out the 12 previous books to cross reference.  Maybe Charlaine didn't have the time to double check her own story lines, but it feels more like she just didn't care. This book was not told by the Sookie we have come to know and love. I can not overlook her complete personality change, it just wasn't her. At only 338 pages, it feels rushed and completely reaching, as though the author was desperate to create some ridiculous mystery that would somehow bring all of her original characters back together.  This book would have been infinitely better if she simply decided to focus on Sookie and her future life, versus trying to weave this convoluted tale.<br /><br /> One of the hardest parts of this book for me to accept, and there are many, is how Sookie doesn't bat an eye at her thoughts regarding the cluviel door.  She spent countless books going back and forth with Eric on how their blood bond was manipulating her feelings.  She wasn't willing to admit how much she and Eric loved each other because she was too caught up in the bond.  But, for the final book of the series, she seems pretty sure the cluviel door is the cause of her feelings for Sam, yet she just doesn't care?  Where is her outrage?  Where is her stubborn attitude?  Where is her southern temper demanding to know how and why she feels this way? Sookie became a hypocrite, and settled for a man she has no chemistry with. She had more fireworks with Alcide and Quinn, but she settles for safe...not our Sookie at all.<br /><br /> The character of Eric, besides Sookie, was probably Charlaine's most beloved. She spent 12 books developing his character, 12 books making his fans fall more and more in love with him, 12 books building his and Sookie's relationship.  In comparison, it took Charlaine 3 books to reveal Bill's true nature.  By the end of Club Dead, Bill has not only betrayed Sookie, but he also manages to rape her and almost kill her.  Charlaine managed to destroy the character of Eric in about 10 pages.  The Eric we grew to love would never have sat back with his hands tied; he would have plotted, schemed, and killed in order to avoid his arrangement with Freyda.  The Eric from previous books put his life on the line to come to Sookie during Felipe's coupe, he put his life on the line to stand by Sookie in Rhodes while she held the soda can bomb, he protected her from every enemy she had...he loved her.  I am heartbroken over Charlaine's choice to make him seem weak and disconnected.<br /><br /> The series ended with almost no answers...and it's my opinion Charlaine did this to boost sales of the yet to be released Coda.  I do not believe Charlaine anticipated such a negative reaction to her series finale, and was banking on everyone being desperate to find out what happens to our favorite Bon Temps residents.  If she had provided a well written, well thought out book perhaps people wouldn't be this upset. I would be willing to bet she has major loss of sales revenue for her Coda because of her handling of Dead Ever After.<br /><br /> I have read several times that we critics are acting entitled and just being sore losers because Sookie didn't live HEA with Eric, or Bill, or Alcide, etc.. Charlaine has received hate mail, death threats, all sorts of crazy responses, and while I do not condone this type of behavior, after all this is a piece of fiction, people have the right to be upset.  I look at it like this; you have a favorite restaurant, it is simply the best food you've had.  You go there all the time because you can't get enough of the best steak you've ever eaten. (apologies to the vegetarians out there, feel free to insert a meat free option, LOL) Sometimes you get a different waitress or bartender, you might not really like them, but you have to have that steak so you overlook this.  Then, one day you order this amazing meal, your favorite waitress takes your order and smiles like everything is as it should be.  When your meal arrives it is NOT what you ordered.  The ingredients are wrong, the sauce is so bland you might as well be eating nothing, it is burned, and it looks as though an animal got to it first.  It is simply unacceptable.  Would you call over your favorite waitress and question what was put in front of you?  Would you want to know why the ingredients were changed?  Would you maybe even ask for your money back?  Does this make you entitled?  Does this make you a bad person for voicing how unhappy you are?  No... but it might make you think twice before handing over your hard earned money again.  Her upset fans are not entitled, we're just mourning the life and loss of our beloved Sookie.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Nobody wants to read a novel about North Korea. That's why we all skipped this when it was published over a year ago to excellent reviews. But sometimes a prize is also a spotlight, picking out a book we never should have missed. In a year with some very good alternatives, &#34;The Orphan Master's Son&#34; deserves the Pulitzer. It's a dark, funny, disturbing, novel about identity and story telling versus authoritarian power, with terrific characters and a riveting plot that originates, of necessity, in North Korea, but which speaks to every country, including ours. It's also an amazing act of imagination on the part of Adam Johnson. He did research. He spent some time in North Korea. But really, that is a closed country, opaque, mysterious, and menacing. Johnson's accomplishment is as if Melville wrote &#34;Moby Dick&#34; after a trip to the South Street Seaport Museum, a ride on the Staten Island ferry, and an afternoon gazing up at whale skeletons in the Museum of Natural History. North Korea is the whale, and &#34;The Orphan Master's Son&#34; crawls into the belly.
B005IEGUDY|4.0|Pleasant read, many stories within the story and nicely captures the time period.  The charachters did not totally grab me but they did well represent a person living in through events in their time period.
0316228532|3.0|I waded through the first 200 pages, being introduced to the numerous characters in the book and how they related to each other. It was slow, but a doctor (who I was seeing) saw I was reading it, and commented to me that it did get much better further into the book. So I muddled my way through the next 300 pages plus. It did get better, about the last 1/3 of the book really picked up the pace. But, I still can't say I liked it; mainly because the characters are so unlikeable. With the exception of the teenagers, the adults are basically self-absorbed, petty people with one father being an abusive bully. The poor children have to grow up with these people as parents. A friend of mine said that reading this book must be comparable to a homework assignment, and yes that is how I felt as I struggled through its 503 pages.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book gave me the understanding and tools I need to implement a life preserving diet.  It is very empowering to know that I can control the fate of my health through diet instead of waiting to see which hand nature has dealt me.  I will reference this book the rest of my life and share it with everyone who will listen.  I had a child late in life (aged 41) and it is imperative that I maintain my health so I will be around to raise him.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A good book about the south and slavery.  I learned a lot about slaves working on plantations in the late 1700's.

1419364375|3.0|So far disc 4 has scratches throughout the disc.  I wish the narration used the same voices for the same people...gets confusing sometimes.

0062073192|5.0|The book itself arrived in great condition, giving me a great opportunity to read about just how much of a dick John Winchester really was. I am now very educated on John Winchester dickishness.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I have had my yahoo email for many years. I have never had any problems until they &#34;made it better&#34;! There app for the kindle or the iPad is terrible and rarely works. When I finally found their customer service number, which they do not make as easy access, their customer service rep was rude, and completely ineffective. He could have cared less about my issue that my password would not work and I have had to change it every day for a week. They could definitely take lessons from amazon customer service.
B001EBWIRW|3.0|I watched it because I had heard so much about it. Steve Martin's character was the best and probable the only reason I finished watching it.<br />It was okay. The music wasn't my favorite, and the plot really simple but I would still recommend it. If you have nothing to do watch this.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|What a great return for Arnold.  It's a fun film that feels like it was released during Arnold's prime.  Good supporting cast and good action.  Plus it's always great to see Arnold back.
B00723NWJE|4.0|I really like her soft smokey voice.  It has so much feeling and I can understand everyword she sings which is not only the case these days.
B00ATSBIIG|3.0|Patchworkz is a pretty fun game. I think it started out a little too easy. I also thought the PC version was better.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Music that, sung by Michael Buble, never gets old. It 's fun, it's loving, it's rythmic, and it's enduring.  I really enjoyed his show in Columbus a few years ago. He makes old familiar songs brand new.
