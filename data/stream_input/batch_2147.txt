055357342X|4.0|Though draining and intense, by the end of this third book I am still interested in what happens and how the characters develop.  Martin has magnificently created a multi-layered world--intriguing, engaging but certainly not easy to live in.  The brutality is sometimes hard to take.  Four stars instead of five for one reason:  there was such a tremendous build-up from Danaerys being a young girl exiled, unassertive and cowed who continues to suffer great loss while establishing herself in a harsh culture and then to her finally rising up, presumably, as a woman of a greater destiny. I wonder if Martin ran out of steam for her?  I wouldn't say that her chapters weren't interesting, but Danaerys spent a lot of time being \\"regal and imperious\\" and I found it tedious.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The story is compelling, the writing is mature, and the characters are fun. Overall this was a fun read that made me want to know how it would end. In classic Sparks style there are a few heart wrenching moments and a few light scenes that pull you in and make you root for the couple. Echos of sleeping with the enemy kept playing through my mind, and the tremor of fear radiates throughout the story giving it an urgency that makes you read faster, desperate to know it all turns out the way you hope. A good book for the beach, or to curl up with on a weekend.
0007447868|3.0|The first three novels were riveting and sometimes jaw dropping--storytelling at its best. And then I read the fourth book and, though I really enjoyed it, I have some misgivings about the story's apparent potential to meander away from what's been set up in the first three books. Regarding characters and events, I expect a solid continuation.  After all, those three books represent some real time and money spent getting to know these characters.<br />There were a few chapters I skimmed through or ignored without any detriment to my understanding of the events. Telling the story from different viewpoints is interesting, but it isn't necessary to dedicate a chapter to the viewpoint of every new character. Some of the main characters are missing from AFFC.  Cunning Queen Cersei has turned into something utterly ridiculous and stupid. Sigh.  There is also the unneccessary added plot device of (groan) a prophesy. Not needed and gimmicky.<br />Still, there are some wonderful chapters and great developments.  Hopefully, more follow-through in the fifth book.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I would give this 5 stars just for the incredible writing. However, the plot demands 5 stars as well. I love this story!! It has echos of all the great epics and weaves a story all its own. I can't wait to see what will happen next, in the past of the story and the in the present. The characters are amazing in their depth and complexity. I could rant and rave about how great it is, but really, just read the book for yourself, you won't regret it!
B009AMANBA|1.0|Daniel Day Lewis was great in this movie.  But I believe it should have been sold as a documentary.  I was very disappointed in it as a movie.  It was matter of fact like a classroom history lesson.  If people thought they were going to see action or great dialog they were sadly mistaken.  This movie is all hype - should have been presented on the History Channel.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|I love these books and began reading them when they were first published. I've enjoyed re-reading the series throughout the years as it always morphs with time. I have the hard copies, but I love re-reading them so much I went ahead and bought this digital copy for myself as well. The story enraptures you, the ideas are stimulating, and the characters are vivid and genuine. Read it. Love it.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|If you want to watch a geniune film on the first part of John Paul the Great's life and not a Hollywood production, then this is the film to watch.  I feel an incredible wave of emotion when I see the simple preist who took-on the Nazis and then Communists with love, compassion and a sense of moral righteousness be first nominated, then elected Pope.  To the see the people John Paul the Great grew-up with and the people who endured the struggles with him see him as he's being introduced as Pope chokes me up everytime I watch this movie.  I especially enjoy the scene which shows the moment when Wojtyla the priest, who was not even thought-of as a candidate when conclave began after John Paul I's death, get put forth as a candidate.  It is an exceptionally powerful scene to a priest from Communist occupied Poland as he's elected Pope  -an advertent or inadvertent message from the College of Cardinals against communism and totalitarianism as depicted when Kordek (head of the Communist in Poland toasts Wojtyla as he's introduced as Pope ...love that scene!  I just love the film of how it shows goodness can overcome pure evil, and how GOD will elevate those to lead who need to lead.
B009JBZH54|5.0|We go this for Christmas and it's such a great deal! I love this series and it's nice to have it all in a bundle.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I think this was my favorite book of the Twilight Saga. I loved the wedding  and the honeymoon. Stephenie has away of writing that makes you fell like you are right there. I loved it.
B002U6CJCO|5.0|Great DVD and story line if you like a quiet Van Damme and this type of action hero movie style. Great price for collecting. Pure uncensored, advertisement free repeatable viewing enjoyment.
B0014E917Y|4.0|I live in the United States and area 2 which I received works only in Japan and Africa. Am very leary of purchasing anymore dvds from Amazon henceforth. Very strange as the set is written in English. I realize this is a third party transaction and the people at Amazon have promised to send a return label and have been very helpful, but whoever the third party is should know that area 2 is not applicable in the US!!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This app is surprisingly fun, granted you have the patience. It takes a while for some eggs to hatch, but other than that it's pretty cool.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a fun game; when it works right. Very entertaining. Wish it didn't take so long to load the game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very touching one of my favorite books. Movie and book were similar yet different yet both were amazing. First book and movie that didn't upset or disappoint I loved both.
B00992CF6W|3.0|There should be the demo version. Its free. Not everybody everybody can pay. The App store on the iPhone iPhone has it. The Google Play Store on Androids have it. So how come Amazon doesn't? It's a good game, but that doesn't mean we have to pay for it.
1616550414|5.0|Wow, that was all I could say when I got this book. They really went all out when they made this book, the quality, the color, everything is top notch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game it is somewhat like temple run but more obstacles and collect power ups I would definitely get this if you are reading this
B00992CF6W|5.0|Cough... Cough... I'm sick from playing this SOOO much... G-get it... :):):):):):):):) Just Kidding. BEST APP EVER!!!So what if its 6.99... Its worth it._
B005COO1X6|5.0|Love it....I have not been disappointed yet by any of his stories!!!! Could have been a little more to it though!!! Makes u think twice about approaching a mud covered vehicle
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its a fun game  but it should be easier to get gems. I really like it, its fun and entertaining.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it! It helps me with my math homework when I want to recheck it. Try it this app is awesome.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Lots of twists.....does anyone know if there is a sequel? The ending wasn't what I was hoping...she has to be stopped.
B003GJSUPY|4.0|Being a teenager in the late 60s and early 70s growing up in Boston, I got to see the J Geils Band perform many times.  I loved the music, the beat, the energy that this band cranked out. In high school, the band's  live album &#34;Full House&#34; was my favorite record. I played it hundreds, if not thousands of times.  In my mind, Full House is one of the best live albums ever.<br /> I was delighted to see this mp3 album offered at Amazon.  Blow Your Face Out was recorded in 1975.  I was fortunate to catch the band on several stops on the tour, each time the concert was classic.  This album captures all the things that made me a JGeils fan.<br />I give this record 4 stars.  It is a great album, but Full House remains my favorite live album.  This one's not too far behind.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Very nice collection of Phil Collins music. I had all of these songs on CD's from way back so it was nice to get this collection for my Android tablet.
B000X8KGQM|5.0|This is one of the great musical scores of the 20th century. Ennio Morricone's quirky musical styling was the perfect choice by the movie's producers. There were only 3 movements which were &#34;not my cup of tea&#34;.<br /><br />Quick summary -- MAGNIFICENT !!!
0596009208|5.0|It is a book that every java learner should read.<br />Very pleasant to read.<br />With its presentation and structure makes every java feature easy to understand.<br />Everyone that is new to java,  is familiar with java programming language and wants to understand java deeper, quickly and easily should read this book.<br />I would really welcome a book on EJBs in Head First Series.<br /><br />Keep up with the good work.
B0091XIZO0|5.0|Great composer. Sensitive and talented pianist, one of the world's finest. What a splendid combination. If you are a fan of classical piano, buy this.
B00881VLCE|5.0|love the pics, colorful. Easy to use and a variety of size puzzle pieces to choose from. Would highly recommend.
0679809015|5.0|This book is small, but its a favorite of my 11 month old granddaughter. The flap on each page hides a farm animal, and she will sit and look at them all on her own sometimes, and other times we will sit together and go through each page, with her lifting the flaps ups.  The size works perfectly for her small hands.  She has a lot of books but this one is a delight for her, and for grandma.
1419705849|5.0|It was a great book, it actually got my girl to be interested in reading. In no time she was done!<br />It's a great book to keep the kids intertain :-)
0689835604|5.0|My son and his wife started reading this to my granddaughter when she was only several months old. The bright colors and pictures captured her attention very well.  This is also the book they used to change her diaper and keep her occupied so she wouldn't be squirming and trying to crawl away. It worked great. She is now 11 months old and toddling and is still enjoying it just as much...
B009NPKTN6|1.0|...which was formerly the worst movie of all time in my opinion.  I can't find much redeeming about it; it ruined many of my favorite tunes.
B00AVL23YE|4.0|Linked right up with my Droid Incredible 2 running Gingerbread and is working great.  Connectivity with my Acer A500 tablet, which won't connect to exchange with anything but Touchdown will give this nifty little app 5 stars.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|This was a good movie as it went into more detail then the original.  Overall it was the last item to complete the collection.
0316227706|5.0|Of course I love this book.  How could I not love this book?  It's pictures of dogs doing silly things underwater.  Seth Casteel really figured out how to capture the dog in his natural aquatic environment.  Some of these photos are hysterical.  Others are frightening.  Others are so charming I can't stop cooing.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|a classic, i've seen it a million times and i still laugh my head off.  i think we can all relate and that is what makes it so fun and so forever...
B00005JLD4|5.0|The courage and perseverance depicted in this true story is inspirational and admirable.  It takes a little while to get into the movie, but it is well worth viewing.
B002NWOOXW|5.0|one of my favorites of all time.  this is a wonderful film.  renee zellwegar is such a wonderful actress and this movie is a delight.
B006P96PAO|5.0|This was purchased as a gift.  It is heartrending (you will cry) and inspiring.  Another great movie!!  I am glad I watched it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  It was fun reliving the 50s and 60s.  Also gave me more of an understanding of what it was really like back then since I was just a small child at that time.
0307744434|4.0|I first learned about this book through the National Novel Writer's Month website -- this book was listed as being written by a NaNoWriMo participant, and the author stated that this book was a product of said event.  Being a NaNoWriMo writer myself, I was heartened to learn that someone had not only published a book produced during the event, but said book had been successful enough to warrant bestseller status and a movie deal.  So I decided to check it out for myself, and see what a fellow NaNoWriMo writer had turned out.<br /><br />In the end, I found myself torn over the book -- I love it to pieces, but at the same time it frustrates me, though not enough to make me want to give it a negative review.<br /><br />The titular \\"Night Circus\\" is actually called Cirque de Reves (Circus of Dreams), a uniquely built circus open only at night and with attractions and acts that straddle the line between fantasy and reality, between the fantastic and the outright impossible.  Behind said circus are two magicians -- Marco, assistant to the circus' proprietor and the secret power behind maintaining and organizing said circus, and Celia, daughter of a famous stage magician and serving as the circus' illusionist.  Both are bound to the circus and are pitted against one another in a mysterious contest by their enigmatic instructors... but both end up falling in love, and seek to defy the rules of the game with potentially disastrous consequences for the rest of the circus.  Meanwhile, a farm boy named Bailey becomes entranced with the circus in general -- and with Poppet, the clairvoyant daughter of the big cat trainers, in particular -- and finds his own fate becoming entwined with that of the circus.<br /><br />Let me begin with the one thing about this book that frustrates me -- the main characters, Marco and Celia.  They are some of the flattest, blandest, most cardboard characters I have ever come across in a work of fiction, second only to Bella from the \\"Twilight\\" series.  They aren't annoying or pathetic characters, but they are so devoid of personality that it becomes difficult to care about them.  Most of the other characters, even the minor ones, have at least some personality to them, and I found myself more concerned with their fates than with the lovers/competitors who were the story's spotlight.  In particular, I loved Bailey, Poppet, and Poppet's twin brother Widget, and dearly wish they had been the focus of the story instead of Marco and Celia.  I was always heartened to see another Bailey chapter in the book as I read, while the Celia and Marco chapters didn't hold my interest as well, as the characters were too lifeless for me to be emotionally invested in them.<br /><br />That's my only quibble with this book, however -- the rest is one of the most enthralling and beautiful fictional worlds I have ever come across in a work of fiction.<br /><br />The circus is so grandly described, so beautifully built through Morgenstern's wordcraft, that I find myself wishing it existed in real life so I could pay a visit.  She describes not only the sights of the circus, but the evocative smells -- as one character in the book states, the sense of smell is an under-utilized but powerful sense.  And she makes it all seem entirely plausible and real, to the point where I find myself wanting to visit the Paper Menagerie, attend a Midnight Dinner, purchase a chocolate bat and a cocoa and go watch the illusionist or the contortionist at work, or even simply light a candle on the Wishing Tree.<br /><br />Of all the characters in the book, I think my favorite, besides Bailey and the twins, would be Friedrick, a clockmaker who becomes enamored with the circus to the point that he builds what can only be called a fandom around it (much like Trekkies are to Star Trek).  The collective friendship and brotherhood among these reveurs, as they call themselves, reminds me of the same friendship and brotherhood that exists among fellow fans of some of my own geeky interests, and so helped me identify even more with the titular circus.<br /><br />All in all, I love this book so much that I can't give it a negative review -- it's marvelously written and builds a beautiful world that sucks the reader in and makes them never want to leave.  But sadly, the main characters are so flatly written, so bland and uninteresting, that I can't give this five stars.  I do not regret reading this book, though, and despite the unengaging leads I will happily recommend it to those who like light fantasy and marvelous worldbuilding.me of my own geeky interests, and so helped me identify even more with the titular circus.<br /><br />All in all, I love this book so much that I can't give it a negative review -- it's marvelously written and builds a beautiful world that sucks the reader in and makes them never want to leave.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best teen books written today. Adults will find it enlightening and very real. It evoked a great deal of emotion - from highs to lows. It was heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time - unusual combination in books today.
B0036SUQWA|5.0|great movie. not well known but worth buying. good price and got here in time for the holidays. thanks very much.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Simple story with interesting and intelligent heroine. I will look for more from this author.  I really enjoyed this book and loved that it was free!
B006FE83UE|5.0|A classic movie to have in your collection. My parents loved it, I love it, and now my kids love it. Everyone in it is fantastic and it's a gripping film.
034580404X|5.0|WOW!! What a trilogy of passion and a good reading time for me.  I enjoyed reading each book and thought it was great.

0684847817|5.0|This book is awesome and fantastic the artwork is impeccable.  Brian is outstanding in his creations.  I can't wait to get more of his creations.  GREAT book!!!!
B004UID2LC|1.0|Why do you continue to offer this app? It came up malicious when I tried to download it on my phones. Not the smartest thing to do since I am not the only one to report this.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series,,, hope it never ends!!!!  Can't wait for the rest of the seasons!!  Fabulous cast!! Great locations scenes...
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I've been a huge Tegan and Sara fan for years and was excited for Heartthrob, especially after hearing &#34;Shock to your System&#34; before the release.  They've graduated to more cohesive, extremely well produced sound.  I have been listening to Heartthrob almost every night in its entirety and have a new favorite song everyday!  Super happy!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|game has worked well on my kindle and I have enjoyed showing it to my grandchildren. they love horses so the game is fun for them.
B005LAII12|5.0|Great reviews, online and word of  mouth.<br />Cheaper than a book store purchase.<br />Tons of quotable quotes.<br />Make due with other teddy bears? Never.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It's colorful and fun and a nice memory test. It looks great on my Kindle Fire and when I have time to play it, I always have a good time.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A fascinating, timeless story that is exhaustively researched and well told.  It should be required reading for anyone aspiring to politics.
B000JLSM00|5.0|I still don't understand why this western so totally underrated, didn't win any academy awards. This is John Waynes best performance EVER. And the cast, including Jeffery Hunter and Natalie Wood is superb. Wayne plays against type here, as an indian hater. And he's frakking brilliant in it. This is one of my very favorite movies of all time.
B000W74EQC|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the Harry Potter movies, I love watching them and can do so over and over again, I always find something I missed, it seems funny to some that I am over 60 and still can enjoy this kind of movie, but what can I say, I love them, I hope you will too. Sincerely Janice
B005LAII80|5.0|I liked the Stallone version, which is kind of campy fun, but this version is right on the money. Mega City one is a dismal place, Dredd never takes off his helmet, Olivia Thirlby is great as Judge Anderson who has the worst first day on the job ever, and Lena Helmsley, who should just get the Queen Bitch award for this and Game of Thrones, is excellent as Ma-Ma. I really wish this would have made a ton of money, because I'd like to see a sequel. Karl Urban is tremendous as Dredd, without being over the top at all.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Any one who loves to watch movies and can get into The Fast and Furious series, than this one you will enjoy, just like the others, to me they keep your interest and that I like, so enjoy the movie, like I did. Sincerely Janice Nelson
B000JMKQX0|5.0|What can I add that has not already been said?  This book is seriously the best Zombie Fiction/End of the World Novel in this genre.  I have read this book more than once and happily recommend it to anyone interested in this genre.  My only disappointment, other novels similar never live up to this one!
B00005R87Q|5.0|As I have said before you have to enjoy movies that keep your interest and The Fast And Furious has done just that. I hope you will enjoy them as much as I have, Sincerely Janice
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Bought this book because I saw the review Stephanie Meyer gave it and thought I'd try it out.  I have read all of them including the prequel books.  What a story Ms. Clare weaves!
0545265355|5.0|The creativity and imagination behind this astounds me. I have read the trilogy 3 times and every time I read it I picked up something new. The movie was good, but the books are 50x better. But, it would be so hard to capture the detail that Collins displays in these books on the big screen. Unbelievable! You had to peel these out of my hands!
B0087GJ8KM|3.0|Not a great book but is well worth the time to read. The subject is interesting but the author does not develop it well enough.
B004XISI4A|4.0|I liked this better than a feast of crows I can also understand some of the bad reviews but with this series it's not so much about the minor endings as the journey.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is too focused on porno and S&M  for my taste. I learned a lot of things which I think I could have done without. Largely a waste of time and not really entertaining or woth the time spent.
B004P1JEXE|3.0|I found this very slow and hard to get into until about half way. Even then it left me frustrated with detailed story lines that seemed to end in nothing, but still it's great journey.
B008220C38|2.0|Anna Karenina is one of my ten all time favorite books.  When this movie opened I wondered if I had fallen into a stage version.  As beautiful as the sets, clothing, etc, are, I am surprised anyone unfamiliar with this story, could even pick up what is happening.<br /><br />The best movie version of this story is Masterpiece Classic.  Those actors make these seem like children.  I can understand why those who have not really read Anna, would like this....it is a dramatic, fascinating story.  This was like an appetizer.  Get Masterpiece and be ready to be delighted with a real Tolstoy.<br /><br />The only reason I give it two stars is the beauty of the sets, and the hope that it compels some to read the book or watch the long series Masterpiece production.
0142412147|4.0|I got the book because I love John Green's writing. However, my favorite story turned out to be 'The Jubilee Express' by Maureen Johnson. It was cute and funny, but not overly deep. John Green's piece was a little less serious, but his writing draws the reader in. I had to keep reading, although if it had been written any other way I would have laughed at the plot. I do love his characters, so it was a nice read. The last story was by Lauren Myracle. I read the beginning and couldn't bring myself to keep reading. The protagonist was too self-pitying and annoying, and the kind of girl Johnson's Jubilee would have detested. It did get better towards the end, however, and the way it was finally wrapped up was a little contrived but still cute. If you're looking for some typical teenage fluff and humor, check this out.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my son and liked the good reviews it received . The price is excellent and he is very satisfied with the product and the sound quality. He likes the fit, no squashed ears.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Didn't even expect to find something like this. Feel like I'm at Dave &amp; Buster's but not spending a crap ton of money!
B005XN3150|4.0|The first season of OUAT was great. Can't say enough good things about this show. It leaves you wanting more and then gives it to you. Robert Carlyle, Lana Parilla, Josh Dallas, Ginnifer Goodwin et al., are all great actors. The plotlines were superb, always filled with surprises. Best of all, it's good clean fun. We watch it with our daughter, and she thinks it's a blast.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is very addictive and a lot of fun. Very good graphics and nicely polished UI. It's one of the best Android games I have played.
B009RX85N0|3.0|I've been a fan of OUAT since the first season (which was way better than the second season so far, imho). The first season had great plot twists, superb acting and you sort of looked forward to the end when Snow and Charming were reunited with their daughter Emma and grandson Henry, the Evil Queen was vanquished and Rumplestiltskin found his love and his son Baelfire.<br /><br />However, for the most part, the plots just get more convoluted and dragged out endlessly with often silly devices (e.g., Jacqueline aka \\"Jac\\" in the beanstalk tale, a heavily mascara-ed, I'm-too-sexy-for-my-shirt Captain Hook who sails to Storybrooke with hideously evil Cora, and now a guy from the outside world with a cell phone camera taking pictures of Regina using her magic, etc.).<br /><br />I hoped OUAT would end each story \\"happily ever after\\" then begin new tales with fresh characters and storylines, instead of attempting to weave all the stories into a tortuous never-ending mess. I'm seriously disappointed because Robert Carlyle, Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas and Lana Parilla are great. The show has potential, but it's losing me and I suspect a lot of other fans right about now.
B000A0GP18|5.0|I love this movie its funny and just type of movie i love watching adam is the best every things good
B0015HOFZI|3.0|If you are looking for a basic turntable with limited ability to modify, then this turntable is ok. But beware. You cannot change the cartridge to anything other than the sony replacement. The sound quality is ok, but if you wanted to try a 3rd party cartridge you would be out of luck. The construction quality of the table is decent, but not the highest quality. It does have a phono pre amp included, which is a nice feature since most modern receivers do not have phono input.<br /><br />I would save your money and get a turntable where you can swap cartridges, adjust the anti skate, adjust the tone arm balance, etc.
1452111014|5.0|Nice book, full of designs and ideas of great designers and artists from Disney. Love the film, and if you like art and these kind of books, its one for the collection.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I first bought this on iTunes for my iphone and LOVED it!  When a good friend asked for it for Christmas of course I came to Amazon!  Love this music!
1557048630|4.0|Nice book, full of designs and ideas of great designers and artists. Love the film, so I wanted to know more about the creation of the movie.
1476712042|2.0|Jamie McGuire gives us tattooed, neurotic, egotistical and rather impulsively violent Travis Maddox and seemingly innocent and naive but stubborn Abby Abernathy, two college aged students who collide at Eastern University and to, well, disastrous but interesting results.<br /><br />If you're looking for anything beyond a quick read with very predictable, unrealistic to the point of ridiculous and superficial everything else and in between, then Beautiful Disaster is just for you. If you loved Twilight, and their love-hate introduction and twisty romance, then you'll love this book. If you're looking for hot, sexy and steamy love scenes, a la 50 Shades, you'll be disappointed. This is perfect for a day at the beach or while waiting at the airport, because it's a very easy read. I read the whole thing in less than four hours. It is completely devoid of details and complicated themes and will not require any brain cells or any effort on your part to understand the premise, which is as age-old as the romance genre itself. It will provide enough entertainment, if you can get over the rendering of Travis, who is, at times, completely dislikable yet the way McGuire writes him is as a tortured soul, misunderstood, mysterious yet vulnerable only with the 'right woman' is a classic romantic trope. I didn't mind Abby as much but her issues with her past as the reason she resists Travis' charm was a bit weak and not the point.<br /><br />Their relationship is incredibly unhealthy, extremely polarizing, confusing, messy and utterly senseless--and that definitely is the point. Is it beautiful? No. Is it disastrous, ruthless and toxic, like watching a train wreck off the wheels? For sure. Their attraction to each other, and their reaction to each other, IS hard to not get caught up in but like the wheel, their rocky relationship is an emotional roller-coaster that goes in constant, repetitive circles. Travis is no saint, even when he's baring his soul to Abby. Abby, is at times, silly, stupid and horribly naive and worse, blind and too forgiving. But that's the point, too. The buildup and sexual tension is well done though tame and incredibly angst filled. You will rarely be bored, though it does drag on in parts and the ending is as sweet and expected as any romance junkie would want.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is a good story, not necessarily very good writing and is somewhat FanFiction-esqe. It's for the late-teen, early twenty age group but appealing to the older crowd (like myself), because it flirts between YA and adult romance novels and taps into that primal ideal of raw, exposed and fatal attraction that's hard to dismiss, no matter what age. The idea that a completely dysfunctional and emotionally fraught relationship is portrayed as exciting, sexy and alluring, rather than scary, dangerous and psychologically damaging is the downfall of these types of escapist books. Ultimately, McGuire is smart, merely following a tried and true trend, formula and itch that is sweeping everyone these past few years in YA slash quasi-adult romance fiction; but, she executes it well enough, be that good or bad. Ultimately, check it out of the library first, because it's only good enough for one read.illy, stupid and horribly naive and worse, blind and too forgiving. But that's the point, too.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wow so much better than Temple Run 1!!!!  MY SIS got it on the Apple IPod touch and it lagged a lot. BUT NONE OF THAT IS PRESENT IN THIS KINDLE VERSION!!!!! A great download don`t miss it!!!!!
B008XNZMOU|1.0|Note to Taylor Swift: if you joke about dressing up as a hipster then you are a hipster.<br /><br /> About half the songs sound like other songs- 5 sounds like Eve6 Heres to the night. 13 sounds like a mix of Britney's Lucky and Katy Perry's The One That Got Away. 15 sounds like 3OH!3's Dont Trust Me. Most of the rest are just sad insight into how immature she must be- if you throw your cell phone at your boyfriend in anger then I judge your maturity level to be that of a 14 year-old's.<br /><br />I wish i could send the cd back but it wouldn't even be worth the effort. I was a taylor swift fan up until now but i expected some emotional growth and this does not have it. Major flop.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Great graphics and smooth game play combine with a variety of patterns to make this well worth the money spent.

B003UBTX6S|3.0|I thought the first book in the series was very interesting, but this book had too many unbelievable plot twists- even considering that it is fantasy/fiction.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a good time filler.  Relaxing. Will be good to play as I travel.  Nice to have free games available.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Starts off well, but I never really connect with the characters. Hope the film is better. An okay, quick read.

0131103628|5.0|Great book for anyone who wants to learn C programming, not bad if you also want to learn Objective C after learning this as it relies heavily on the C language.

B00915G6SU|5.0|I fell in the with this show from day one, Dr. Spence Reid is especially my favorite.  As a whole however, the show just has a way to effect me emotionally. From El leaving to Reid being kidnapped...etc. I received all seven seasons for Christmas and I couldn't be happier.  The show pulls me in and I fell like despite all of the cruelty of and to humanity, there is good in the world. Yes I know it's a T.V. show, but like I said it has a way of pulling me in.<br />Anyone considering this series PLEASE, you WILL NOT REGRET It!<br /><br />I am waiting to pre-order the 9th season already! After last nights premier I know it will be a MUST have, I still cannot express how much I enjoy this series as a whole! When I am sick or in need of a stay-cation/ mental health day. I pop some corn, curl up with a blanket and pop in Season One and watch them until I can't keep my eyes open. :)<br />Again, enjoy!
B004UID2LC|5.0|Awesome. It plays clear and sounds clear on my kindle and iphone.  Good move by You Tube.  I really love it.

B00846F1YW|5.0|I got this app for free and expected it to ask for money by the fourth chapter, but it didnt!!!! Very tricky silhouettes, fun puzzles, and bizzarro celebs including James Spader, Toby Maguire, and Brian Denehy make this app MUCH fun!

B0017SWPXY|4.0|A heartwarming story.  The book grabbed me right away.  I did get a bit bored in the middle; but the story line then picked up, and ended on an emotional and inspiring note.
B000JQUGVI|5.0|ya got to wonder how some of these writers from the 1700's to the 1800's pulled off the work they created.  without a computer. without ready references to everything.  and yet wallah!  there it is.  magnificence.<br /><br />it must have been over ten thousand pages and i could have read more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|yep! it's fun and cool and I love my horsie. I had horsies in real life too and ponies turn into loop when they die.
B000GDH9JQ|4.0|Marvellous to be able to see Barishnikov at his best and Hines with his tap dancing is unbelieveable to watch.
B00181JGI2|4.0|My husband and two sons were recently making quotes from and joking about this movie and I innocently said, \\"Oh, I've never seen it\\".  A few moments elapsed before I realized that the room had gone totally silent and I looked up to see three shocked and horrified faces staring at me.<br /><br />Apparently this was an unacceptable state of affairs, so we all watched it that very evening.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether I enjoyed the movie more, or watching these doofuses roll around on the furniture and floor laughing hysterically more.  (Okay, that *may* be a bit of an exaggeration, but whatever. They still loved watching the movie.)<br /><br />Basically, I thought the movie had really funny parts, parts that left me befuddled as to relevance, and parts that I wished it were me that was drinking a White Russian.  I also understood why the males in my house loved this movie so much: The Dude handled problems the way many men do, which is basically a LOT more simply than many females. Of course, that may have been (partially) due to the immense amount of marijuana that Dude smoked, but I'm definitely not sure about that.<br /><br />In all, I really enjoyed watching this movie.  It was funny, well-written and expertly cast.  Definitely recommended.
B005R32L66|4.0|I would recommend this for anyone that has family or friends abroad! ITs a wonderful way to stay in touch and actually enjoy talking....for free! Great job!

0064407667|4.0|Good Quick Read for the early reader with a very sneaky emphasis on vocabulary building. The entire series seems to capture children's attention with mildly dark undertones and rye humor.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|so many great songs, even tho my case was broken the CD was just fine so it really wasnt a loss for me, i like to listen to the songs at night :)
1558900365|1.0|Tape was bad....I was definitely not happy with product.  The tape jumped and was fuzzy. Made it very hard for drama students to follow story. Shipping was fast.

B0001VTPWM|5.0|Robocop : Part man, part machine, all cop.  A classic 80's dystopian futuristic movie.  One of my personal favorite trillogies of all times, though as with many other series, the first is the best and they do go down hill from there.<br /><br />In 1987 when it came out I loved this movie, what young boy wouldn't?  Of course looking back now, my parents probably shouldn't have allowed a 10 year old to watch it!  It was futuristic and cool, especially those futuristic looking cars (Ford Tauruses!).  It was action-packed, violent, and exciting.<br /><br />Now today in 2013, I still appreciate it, but for other reasons.  It is classic 80's, with its dytopian future/evil corporation/gangs of bad guy drug dealers running the show type theme, and after all, I did grow up in the 80's.  Secondly, now that I am an adult myself I can see that it is almost comical with the absurd amount of over-the-top violence this movie has in it.  Supposedly for the first installment, they even had to &#34;tone it down&#34; from the original cut to avoid an &#34;X&#34; rating.  And also, I love cop movies, dystopian futurisitic movies, dark movies, and cheesy movies, and this has elements of all of the above.  And who doesn't get a kick out of seeing &#34;Red Foreman&#34; (Kurtwood Smith) as the main antagonist?  Of course there is Ronny Cox in his portrayal of &#34;Dick Jones&#34;, big corporate sleezeball that you love to hate.<br /><br />Again, the first one is by far the best, it has the best ensemble of actors, characters, best plot, and the best action.  The first one is definitely 5-stars for any 80's movie buff, or fan of shoot-em up action movies, cop movies, or old renditions on &#34;futuristic&#34; societies.  The second one is a bit cornier, but still pretty good, revolving heavily around the same drug-gang theme.  The third one, well, it is not so good, but it does have a very high cheeseyness factor, and really, if you are going to invest your time in the first two, you have to watch number 3.  What hurts 3 more than anything is Peter Weller's absence in the starring role.<br /><br />The Robocop series holds a special place in my heart, up there with &#34;Total Recall&#34;, &#34;Die Hard&#34;, &#34;Terminator 2&#34; and other great action gems of the period.  If you are a 30-something guy like me, you have probably seen at least the first Robocop installment, but maybe not in a long time.  Treat yourself to this great shoot-em up, corny, over-the-top violent, cheesy special effects trillogy and have some laughs with your buddies.  You will be glad you did.watch number 3.

B0011UF79C|5.0|I loved this movie for many reasons.  From an artistic standpoint it is great : the clean, crisp visuals, the very smart melding of futuristic with retro styling, the use of flashbacks and narration.  From a sci-fi standpoint it is equally great : A semi-dystopian near-future where genetic perfection is not only possible through unnatural selection, but is considered the standard.  But what I love more than anything about this movie is the message I take away from it, which can be true in any story, fiction, non-fiction, future, past, or present.  And that message is that persistence, desire, and a will to achieve can prevail against all odds.  I especially enjoy this message because it is so true.  Yes, we do all see the best looking, most athletic, most intelligent, most priviledged among us given a huge head start in life, but how many like \\"Eugene\\" do we see in life?  There are many, those with all the tools to succeed, but cannot use those tools, or choose not to use them because of a lack of desire or motivation.  Then there are the \\"Vincents\\" of the world.  Not particulary advanced in any way, and even with physical flaws that could easily hold them back.  But they have the desire, they have that fire burning inside them to accomplish their dreams.  In this movie the barrier just happens to be genetics, but in real life it can be many other factors...you may not be the smartest, or have the greatest physical prowess, or be the right race, the right ethnicity, or know the right people in high places, and so many of us in those positions resign to that fact and go about our so-so lives.  The Vincent character shows that special kind of person who can overcome these barriers and realize their dreams.  It is an inspiring story.
B000001FS3|5.0|I bought this CD because I wore out my first copy of it. All in all, probably the best album U2 ever made in terms of song after song after song outstanding quality, musicality and writing. Maybe I should stockpile copies for when this one wears out. Or maybe just wait for more changes in technology and have the songs on every possible medium.
0062124293|5.0|Caitlin Moran succeeds beautifully in capturing her feelings and thoughts about feminism in this hilarious and articulate book. As they match my own, I can do nothing but praise her for it! I particularly enjoyed listening to her narrate the audio version.
B008RYN44U|4.0|Very enjoyable and upbeat listening, for the most part. I'm often accused of being stuck in the 80's with regard to my musical tastes, but I like Gwen Stefani's work in several creative fields, so I bought this. Found it interesting that the beat and electronic elements are solidly 21st Century; but I hear echoes of Madonna, Simple Minds, and the one and only &#34;Suddenly Last Summer&#34; in several songs. An unexpected pleasure.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great graphics and storyline. Fun and engrossing to play with wonderful hidden object scenes. Definitely worth the price to unlock the full game.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Of the novels of Jane Austen this is the best.  I first became acquainted with this work about 52 years ago, have read the novel many times and seen this and other film adaptations so often I can recite the dialogue from memory.  This review is not on the book but the movie.<br /><br />I shall not destroy your enjoyment of the film by telling the story.You should read the book and see the movie for yourself.  Regarding the movies this is much better than the BBC version which is broken up into parts.  The acting is superb.  If you don't believe me listen to the actors and director on the special section of the dvd.  When I bought this dvd it was twice as expensive and I felt it was well worth it.  You can have it at a bargain price now and if you are a Prime member have it delivered in a short time postage free.  If you know Austen or are totally unaware of her work you owe it to yourself to buy and watch this movie.<br /><br />Enjoy yourself!
0307596885|3.0|I'd read such wonderful reviews but never found myself warming to the plot driven short stories.  I never loved any of her characters.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I loved the original movie and this was not anywhere near the same. With that being said I did enjoy the movie and appreciated the differences. Both chicks are fiya, action is pretty constant, and the story is interesting to follow.
0316228532|5.0|When I was reading the entire Harry Potter series, I couldn't wait for the next one to come.  Reading and becoming acquainted with each of the characters in the Casual Vacancy; I didn't want to the book to stop either.  I truly wanted to know more about these people.  Brilliantly written!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|starts out slow but once it gets going its a blast. you will almost hate to put it down cuz you might misss something.
030758836X|4.0|totally confusing emotions.  I didn't especially care for the main characters but after all, kept right on reading through til the end.
1468179993|2.0|First of all - Donavan is not associated in any way with TED, has never delivered a TED talk and has never helped to prepare one.  This book reflects his &#34;insights&#34; from watching TED talks.<br /><br />This is a small book, more like a pamphlet actually, where he states some general observations about TED talks that he's watched.  Very little insight into what goes in to creating or delivering an actual TED presentation.  There are some very good presentation books out there, including Duarte and Reynolds  - this is not one of them.
1451695195|5.0|Beautifully written accounting of one man's NDE, from the viewpoint of the Neurosurgeon to whom this happened.  Such validation of what many people have come to believe about what happens to us after our physical body stops.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I like the book a lot. The zombie scenerio is a fun one to daydream about being in. The book gives stories of the scenerio from many different perspectives. Also hits on the pandemic of a worldwide outbreak. I found this book to be extremely entertaining and highly recommend it to all zombie fans.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Glad I did not buy this book.  I don't even get the title.  What does it mean?  Stupid story.  Not worth it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We thoroughly enjoy this TV series. The show captured our hearts with the first episode of the first season. We enjoyed the show so much we watched both season one and season two in two weekends. It is a delightful show with the period costumes and sophisticated story line. The families and servants keep us enthralled with the show. I certainly recommend this show to everyone.
0670022705|5.0|I'm still not finished with it, but an excellent insight into life on earth over time. It's a book you will pick up over and over again.
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|(SPOILERS:  Do not read if you have not seen ALL of Season 3.)<br /><br />Oh my, there is obviously a curse on the Crawley girls!  None can have a baby without one of the parents of the child dying.  First, Sybil died after giving birth, and then Matthew died driving back from the hospital after Mary had their child.  Sybil's death was bad enough, but Matthew's was particularly cruel considering his great joy to have a son.  They even had to show his bloody face and his dead eyes.  And Edith falls for a really nice guy, who just happens to have a wife in an insane asylum and can't ever get a divorce.  Gee, maybe next season Edith will have a child out-of-wedlock, and then both she and the baby's father will be killed by his wife, who escaped from the insane asylum and kidnapped the newborn!<br /><br />Obviously, the creators and writers of this show don't care that they've turned it into a melodramatic soap opera that is alienating many die hard fans.  Having a parent die after two babies were born just seemed like lazy writing.  You can only have so much tragedy in nine measly episodes.  After watching Season 1, I couldn't wait for Season 2.  After watching Season 2, I couldn't wait for Season 3.  After watching Season 3, I couldn't care less about Season 4.  I may watch it or I may not.  In a year from now, I may even totally forget what it was I liked so much about the series in the first place.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Great book read it. I recommend this book because it is really funny and I think that is a good quality for a book
B001H9MYPW|4.0|it was hard to not be entirely consumed by watching this series all at once.  wonderfully acted, well filmed.  the next season was the last, and I'm not surprised.  He needed to get out and live his own life, and I was a little exhausted by all that he went through.... so the timing of the 'end' seemed right.
B00ARAO720|3.0|There are a lot of great looking bicycle stunts provided in the new thriller Premium Rush, nearly a dozen stunt people are credited with these eye popping visuals that take up a great majority of the movie's running time. The movie has also boasts a good cast to it's disposal, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Shannon lend an air of unexpected respectability and add weight to what on the surface would at least appear to be a generic potboiler.<br /> Following the exploits of a Manhattan bike messenger, Wilee (Gordon-Levitt), as in the coyote, who could be a lawyer if he wanted, but can't stand to wear suits and has a need for daredevil thrills that he finds in the New York streets working for about eighty bucks a day. Bobby Monday (Shannon) is a seedy cop who looses a large sum of money at a gambling house in Chinatown, then makes a careless loan and goes across the street to bet and loose at another gambling house.<br /> There paths eventually cross when Wilee is entrusted with an envelope from his girlfriend's roommate that Monday wants to get his hands on. The reason is of little importance, this is what \\"the master of suspense\\" Alfred Hitchcock referred to as \\"the McGuffin\\", it's what drives the plot, but the audience doesn't particularly care about. The cop is dogged in his pursuit of the package, and thus Wilee, and is willing to chase the young man across the near entirety of the city.<br /> Told in more or less real time, the movie is a fully charged and a willing suspense tale that is regrettably underdeveloped, at times tragically routine and far too often silly, resorting to fairly obvious and unconvincing developments. It sizzles at first and then fizzles in the middle. With so much going for it, it would seem a rather surprising stumble.<br /> The camerawork by Mitchell Amundsen is the main asset of the film, helping to get the audience into the feel of the chase and the bike messenger lifestyle. If the rest of the movie utilized this sort of skill and adventure this film would really be able to move more and could offer a lot more thrills. As it is the thrills are dangerously few for a thriller. The editing is taunt in the service of tedious direction.<br /> The leads could be good too, but are given too little to do, they aren't offered the chance for any depth in their roles. Gordon-Levitt has charisma and in the past has proven to be a capable lead performer, but he just fails to have anything to show here and ends up lacking the necessary spark. Gordon-Levitt has been having an impressive year with solid roles in strong movies like Looper, the Dark Knight Rises and Spielberg's Lincoln, 2012 will be remembered as the year that he came into his own as a star, but at least one of his movies will be completely forgotten. Shannon, a very talented character actor, likewise is good, but his role lacks any meat, he is regrettably just a typical movie bad guy.<br /> Directed by David Koepp, one of Hollywood's top screenwriters with credits on blockbusters such as Spider-man, Mission: Impossible, the first two Jurassic Park movies, as well as Angels & Demons and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. As a director, Koepp is a different story though, his credits are by far less impressive including the failed Ricky Gervais vehicle Ghost Town, the Stephen King adaptation Secret Window and something called the Trigger Effect. Premium Rush does nothing to elevate his flagging ambitions as an auteur.<br /> Despite a great start, Koepp's script, which seems to be aimed at thirteen year olds, is amongst his worst, chocked full of clich&eacute;s, unlikely developments and some of the most laugh out loud dialogue of the year. Gordon-Levitt's assertion that \\"breaks equal death\\" is likely be the most memorable part of this whole shamble. It also lacks suspense, the needed tension and a satisfying conclusion. Koepp is known for trouble with third acts, but this time he flounders in beginning of the second.<br /> Any attempts at character development is strictly relegated to the realm of clich&eacute;.  Wilee's girlfriend, a fellow rider named Vanessa (Daniela Ramirez) wants him to act more mature and finish his education or she's breaking up with him. Wilee has a rival for Vanessa's attention who's also a hot shot messenger. Then there is the subplot involving human trafficking that is not only under investigated, but all but discarded and when used strictly as a plot devise, it would seem the movie is in favor of this human violation atrocity.<br /> Premium Rush feels long for ninety-one minutes and by the mid way point I had had more than enough bicycle chases for one movie and just wanted the whole thing to get on with it's story, but it doesn`t really have one to get on with. Then it develops into a ridicules, sad sack of a final twist of simplistic sappiness.<br />  I have an undeniable fondness for a well made action film, I have great admiration for a fine tuned thriller, but Premium Rush is neither, it fails as the most rudimentary escapist entertainment. In the end this all plays out like the Jason Statham Transporter movies at about fifteen miles per hour. Or maybe it's ambitions were just to be training wheels of anarchy.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.comat character development is strictly relegated to the realm of cliché.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|Great service! Item arrived before estimated arrival date. Item seems to be working great!! My son was so excited. His expression was worth the money for a used item, although expensive.
B009AMAMF2|5.0|Cloud Atlas is a conspiracy thriller, a dystopian science fiction story, a high seas adventure, a jovial geriatric comedy, a post apocalyptic action-adventure, to say nothing of the many love stories intertwined, but above it is a deeply moving human story. Cloud Atlas is hard to describe and  difficult to pigeon hole, but one thing I do know is that it is unlike anything  I have seen before  and it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.<br /> This is a feast for the moviegoer, a joy to behold as many different movies play out in front of you. None are necessarily better than the other, and they are all great. Fascinating, exciting and funny in equal measures, a full experience at the movies if ever their was one. You'll need to keep your eyes on this thorough, it will be easy to get lost in the engulfing abyss of shear splendor, but it all becomes clear and actually isn't difficult to follow.<br /> There are those who insist that Cloud Atlas is an empty vessel lacking in depth and substance. I couldn't disagree more, to me their was a great deal of deep feelings and thoughts stirred in my head. Certainly not for all tastes, but what movie is, each viewer will have a different reaction to this film, for some it will be very rewarding.  A movie is  different things to different people and to me this is a multifaceted and meditative experience.<br /> To try and summarize the plot would be an exercise in futility, as so much is always going on here in this accelerating non-linear epic that spans the period from 1849 until 2349. Cloud Atlas is absorbing and succeeds at the delicacy of avoiding pretension. It is bold and challenging and at nearly three hours is a marvel in it's ability to never seem a second too long. Filled with wondrous possibilities and telling a grandiose story filled with hope, redemption, passion and love.<br /> I have always felt that a good test of any actor's ability is to see them play more than a single character in a film because it gives you a clear idea regarding their range and ability to slip in and out of various roles. Here a fine cast with Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, Jim Sturges, Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy, Hugo Weaving, Doona Bae, among others are at the very pinnacle of their talent, they get to shine in about six roles each, one in each story for most of them.<br /> The make-up effects are some of the very best I have ever had the pleasure of feasting my eyes on. The actors manage to effortlessly metamorphoses into a dizzying array of characters thanks to this incredible make-up job provide by twenty-six immensely talented artists. After some recent bad make-up jobs seriously impaired some contemporary movies, I'm looking at you  J. Edgar, such an awe-inspiring job is fantastically refreshing. I am usually pretty sharp at spotting actors under make-up, especially very well know stars, but I have to admit that I know I couldn't tell who all the actors were at any given time. Some people may be distraction by attempts to spot all the actors, but that is ineffective as the stars themselves have admitted in interviews to not always recognizing one another, and the movie is so easy to get caught up in as to forget to keep stargazing.<br /> It took three directors, Andy and Lana Wachowski and Tom Tykwer, to successfully bring this highly ambitious movie together. Three talented filmmakers for sure, but until know they have all emphasized a style over substance attitude. Each have taken and seized the sections of this movie that best caters to their abilities, for example Tyker has taken on the suspense and lighter stories, while the Wachowskis focuss their attention on the action and science fiction elements. This is a very wise thing to do and helps to make it fully clear the need for all three to work in conjunction, I`m not sure any one director, no matter how talented could be able to pull this film off. Their achievements are to be commended and the fact that they realize something so well is staggering.<br />  I was not a fan of the Wachowskis going into this, I hated Speed Racer and was always a wet blanket when it came to their immensely popular Matrix trilogy. Cloud Atlas reminds me that at first they showed a great deal of promise with Bound, a smart and edgy thriller that couldn't have been more different than Cloud Atlas, but with Cloud Atlas they have graduated to the level of greatness and first rate filmmakers.<br /> This thrilling epic is based on an award winning and Nebula nominated \\"unflimable\\" masterpiece of a novel by David Mitchell. Adapted by the three directors, the film is quite different in many respects to the author's book, the movie is more passionate and emphasizing the reincarnation motif. Mitchell has praised the filmmakers for playing to the strengths of their medium that is decidedly different from his.<br />  The movie is lovingly photographed by Frank Griebe and John Toll. Griebe handles Tykwers's parts, the two are long time collaborators going back to their German-language contemporary classic Run Lola Run. Toll works the Wachowskis and is one of the best cinematographers today having won an Oscar for his beautiful work on Mel Gibson's Braveheart.<br /> For sure Cloud Atlas will leave people dived, some will find it brilliant while others will find it to be maddening. I will say that you wont soon forget it, and if your like me you'll become nearly obsessed by it and will want to see it again almost immediately. For others once will be too much, there loss.<br /> I don't know that Cloud Atlas will change anyone's belief system, or that it's aim is anything of the sort, but I think that it will challenge viewers to think, and for any movie that is a remarkable thing. You wont want to miss it, even if you wont like it, it's an experience worth having.  A perfect marriage of art, ambition and entertainment.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very sweet and easy to lose yourself in every page. Well written and easy reading made this book  a page turner.
1568363842|1.0|Definitely NOT recommended for people who want to learn a lot of practical Japanese language in a short time.  Despite the title, it seemed to me that the book requires a great deal of effort to learn a lot of random things very quickly in a sort of childish kindergarden way (\\"This is a key.  That's a book.\\"), and definitely not in order of usefulness - why do I need to know how to say \\"one trillion mechanical pencils\\" before I learn toilet, passport, visa, taxi, bus stop, train station, train ticket, entrance, exit, ...?  There is very little explanation - much of the material raises more questions than it answers, giving the student the feeling that they don't know how to use what they've learned except in the very few explicit examples given in the book.<br /><br />A very, very disappointing purchase.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is so remarkably honest and unbiased. Charlie has the ability to look at things so simply, in a light that is pure and plain. Not many people have the ability to recognize and express life in such a pure fashion. Leaving it entirely UN-analyzed. I guess it takes a wallflower to show the world what it really is.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|When I first opened the package, I was disappointed in the material.  However, once I began to use the cover, it is very easy to handle, and the folded position actually fits the hand for easier holding...especially when you have hand cramps.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is great, so excited to play temple run 2 now. If you like fast paced games you'll love temple run!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Oh my God best slender game !!! Finally people make real slender games.but I am just telling you if you get the seventh page he's in the mess up house!best  slender game ever made
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is the best one I've found. It offers multiple Bible studies and helps you to remember to read everyday. Also you get badges for accomplishing things. It's a great way to study the Word and a great reference tool!
B0015DROBO|4.0|Lots of twists and turns with both believable and unbelievable characters. A good page turner but won't give you nightmares.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Actually rating this 4 1/2 stars!  Had to continue until the trilogy was completed. Every woman's dream: taming a bad boy who is filthy rich who gives you all of his love and wealth AND makes kinky, sweet love to you constantly!  Loved the characters, especially Ana's alter ego ones.  Can't wait to read more about the Grey's.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would choose another Nicholas Sparks book based on Safe Haven.  I can't wait to see the<br />movie, now.  Just hope it does the book justice.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I think that if the Bond franchise had no history and started with this film, I would have said it was pretty good.  But Daniel Craig does not come even close to having the charm and charisma of Sean Connery.  It's time to look for a new Bond.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Unlike the original cable that came with the device, this new cable fits and works perfectly.  Also, it arrived on time.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Maybe the best Rebus yet! Maybe pushed the envelope at the end, but a great read. Looking forward to having Rebus back.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|It takes me back to X-Files with a lighter edge.  Very enjoyable and suspenseful with good charachters that seem on the edge of self destruction but work reall well together.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|After the untimely demise of the Firefly series this was a really welcome bit of closure.<br />Plus this movie stands alone as a bit of entertainment. Seeing the entire Firefly series makes it better<br />BUT it is not absolutely needed.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love this game, play it all the time on my PC.  I was annoyed when I found I had to ante up $4.99 for the full Kindle version - which I declined to do sine I already own the full version on my PC.<br />But this is one of the most fun three-match games around, addictive and hours of fun, great graphics, even on my non-HD Kindle.  If you have never played this game, try it!<br />Also, nice bonus, when you get  it (free version too!), if you register, you get two free PC games - Brickshooter Egypt and another Fishdom game.
B001EN71CW|5.0|After Farscape this is the best Sci-Fi series I have ever seen. As is the case for so many quality, intelligent series it ended prematurely and with out good reason.<br />This includes all the eposodes in order AND the three that were never broadcast. Thank you. Those have some of best bits of the series.<br />The extra's are good for this. I love deleted scenes and a gag reel which this has. The interviews and commentary are very good as well.<br />If you are a fan of Castle and Nathan Fillion you WILL enjoy this series.
B00006CXSS|5.0|\\"BAND OF BROTHERS\\" IS A MUST HAVE FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN THE U.S. COMBAT SOLDIER IN THE EUROPEAN THEATER DURING WW2.  WELL ACTED, IT TELLS THE STORY OF ONE COMPANY FROM THE ELITE 101ST AIRBORNE, AND THE IMPACT WAR HAS ON YOUNG MEN WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT HOME WORKING AND RAISING FAMILIES.  SPLICED INTO EACH EPISODE ARE INTERVIEWS WITH THE ACTUAL MEN WHOSE STORY YOU ARE VIEWING.  BY THE END OF THE SERIES YOU WISH YOU KNEW THESE MEN PERSONALLY.  THEY WERE THE GENERATION THAT SAVED THE \\"FREE WORLD.\\"
B001F290E4|4.0|You almost but not quite think that James Brown is in the House. He does the Master well who would be proud.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this because it helps pass the time. It keeps you thinking a bit and can help when you're bored.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Excellent book!  A classic.  I read this in high school and did not pay to close attention to the details and the wisdom surrounding this story, but now that I have lived a few more years it makes so much more sense....
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I have same problem and is not updating. I am willing to wait though, it a great game and im looking forward to seeing what new things it brings. Please hurry up and sort out this problem about updating, SOMEONE PLEASEEEEEE
B00AIBZM40|1.0|I was so excited to see this movie...very disappointing!  The \\"good\\" parts are what you see in the ads on tv, the ending is by far the worst ending I have ever seen. There was one, maybe two scenes in the movie that were actually scary.  Overall it was just a very predictable and lame movie experience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game my son thought I needed more games on my kindle so he chose this and I have really enjoyed it.Thanks
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|If it costed money I would say no. It is a very short trial and isn't all that fun. I wouldn't recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is first first time  i got this  game and it is  awesome it is my new favorite game it is better than temple run 1 I could not get this on my iPod
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It was Great!!!!!! I really liked it.all my friends liked it to they'd always steal my tablet to play it! !!!  :)
B005HSL626|1.0|It's a very fun game if it doesn't glitch. Lately every time I go to play it after the third fruit I slice it freezes then closes out of itself. I tried deleting the app then reloading it but nothing helps.
B0007Q6PBK|4.0|An all-star cast, to include Pavarotti in his prime, Scotto equally powerful, and Levine just embarked on his lengthy tenure. Much to enjoy, except Tony Randall's rambling intro--the only reason I don't give this five stars.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This book is funny, charming, and fast. bringing back characters we love plus hilarious new villains. Rick Riordan might be a reader-pleasure, but i'll eat it up. keep em' coming!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Top 3 batman movies undoubtedly and excellent editing, superior image quality, even it takes me a while to come was worth
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book! It is a mix of love and tragedy. I sort of wish I could be a character in The Hunger Game. I am going to read it again in the summer.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Very raunchy and explicit, but got too bored with the repitition. There was so much hype about this book and I found the sex was too over the top.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Beautiful. I need more from Matthew Quick. Like right now. He could even give me more of Pat and Tiffany. I'd actually prefer some more of Pat and Tiffany. Do this, Matthew Quick!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This productiont captives the audience on so many levels.  First is the story itself with so many subplots, all intertwind with each other and the main story or plot itself.<br />The actors bring all of these subplots to life by breathing life into each character.<br />The scenery not only supports each scene but is breath taking at times.<br />I look forward to when I can watch the next season!<br />X
1449320104|4.0|I&#34;ve got mixed feelings about this book. Since it is clearly labeled a Reference, I can't fault it for being just that. It covers a huge array of topics but to me, it reads too much like a bunch of man page. It tells you exactly what each class does but what it's missing for me are the scenarios where these classes and object can be used.<br /><br />In the description of a class or method, the authors give an example that completely demonstrates  the method but I found myself having to study it very hard to figure out what they are trying to show and how I might be able to use it in my own program.<br /><br />I will definitely use this book as the reference that it is but I may look for another that is a bit more of a tutorial for C#.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|It was a humorous way to make one aware that habits can be changed.  Love that Tommy Lee Jones.<br />Okay show.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is the latest in the Mitch Rapp series , and it did not disappoint this loyal reader. Can't wait for the next book. Vince Flynn is a writer for anyone that enjoys fast moving,action packed books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|must try! time consumer. test your skills. just have to open more games. I just want to play. thanks! play on!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this is a very fun/addicting game,at first your like wondering what to do the next your base/army is huge. Also its a very time consuming game and it takes real time to bile the things in the game but still fun all the same
B00992CF6W|5.0|My entire family loves this game, whether on the PC or Android OS it's a blast.  East connection for multi-player support on your WiFi.  Buy this if you find yourself bored with nothing to do, highly addictive.
B006JRIZJG|5.0|Well made and great for storing.  She keeps it up in her room and plays with it every day, reasonable price.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|In light of what just occurred a few weeks ago in Texas this movie seems to take the same path of expertise and ability.  It seems unbelievable that someone could precision kill from over a mile away.  Wahlberg is terrific and the end of the movie - well justice isn't always justice - but you gotta love this justice!
B0030DBGXY|5.0|This is another great knife from Cold Steel.  It's well balanced, had a very sharp edge out of the box and just feels right in my hand.<br /><br />The grips and sheath are just as advertised and I found them very suitable for the task.<br /><br />Not much I can say is wrong with the knife.
0688014291|5.0|I had read this book previously but loaned it out.  My daughter has just taken a promotion at work and asked to read my copy.  I bought her one to keep and she is already using the wisdom contained in its pages.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|Info seems accurate, however I am concerned about how much draw on my device this app usses. Phone seems a little slower.. HTC G2
B004OKFISQ|5.0|Best I've heard this album.  High quality pressing, much more dynamic and natural sounding.  The CD suffers from terrible overload and compression.  I think, despite the lack of extra tracks, this is the definitive format.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I love bubble blasting games and this one not as good as my favorite.  It is a free game but to take advantage of all levels it appears you need to buy 'things'.  Also, you can only play so long before it makes you wait to get more bubbles.  Really more of a kid's game or maybe I just didn't take the time to figure it out.  Maybe it's a bubble blasting game that's trying to be more & I just didn't get it.
B00536OCYG|4.0|Pressing quality and sonics 5/5.<br /><br />The music appears to be remixed as seems really apparent on this issue.  This set was to include a digital download but mine was goofy and the record company wouldn't let me have it (made my own 24-Bit copy of the LP anyway).<br /><br />Definitely recommended, especially for the super-fan.
B00646UU5Y|5.0|Exciting and keep you on the edge of your seat.  Please  keep on making great series, i love them all.
B009E9R1IM|5.0|Already own the CD, DVD set but the LP box-set for me is the definitive version.  Dead silent background, snappy dynamics and wonderful immediacy.  180 gram with high quality production.  (I'm also able to re-up tune the performance to the original album keys for the heck of it.)<br /><br />A must own set, and this is the best of the formats.  Just beautiful.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The first round was rather easy but now I really have to use my brain and being older it takes awhile.
B000WTNDTY|4.0|The album pressings and quality are 5/5.  The music...<br /><br />It's the movie edit with extra tracks.  Sonics are brilliant but Whole Lotta Love, No Quarter and others are butchered as they were in the movie.  I STILL play the original release for what I believe are the definitive Madison Square Garden (Shepperton Studios) versions.<br /><br />I still recommend this to Zep fans but really hope this gets re-visited with Jimmy's current remasterings, getting the love they deserve.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it.  Check scripture every day.  Take my Kindle with me when I am doing chemo and it makes it wonderful to read my Bible and hang onto my faith.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|As far as I'm concerned the definitive version of the series.  Unfortunately, alot of snow appears in the HD re-print of Aliens (2).  Still love the heck out of it and I'm glad it's available!
B000OV85AW|5.0|McQueen plays Frenchman Henri Charriere, sentenced to Devil's Island.  Nicknamed &#34;Pappillon&#34;, (The Butterfly), Charriere was determined to be free and after many failed attempts, he becomes the only known person to escape the deadly prison island.  Dustin Hoffman puts in a fine performance as Charriere's friend, Dega.  Truly a fine motion picture, based upon Charriere's<br />bestselling novel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game all the time. You don't need WiFi either so you can play it anywhere. If you are looking for a fun game here it is.
B000031EGV|5.0|Robin Williams plays it to the hilt in this adventurous tale of a young boy trapped inside a mystical jungle board game, and, remarkably, returned, after 26 years, only to be caught up in the game with a young girl and her brother.  Trying to end the game before anyone dies, it's a  wild animal-filled funfest.  Good for the whole family.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|a jolly Scandavian romp - just don't take it too seriously! I enjoyed it but my wife was not so keen.
B001O7SMRG|5.0|I bought this recording a number of times--LP, cassette, CD, Remastered Extended Version. The latter was my only disappointment, because the \\"remastered\\" CD seemed to be of inferior quality. I just downloaded this digital recording today, and it sounds wonderful.<br /><br />Personally, reviews comparing this self-titled recording to anything else is silly. Music is my passion. I loved this band and their songs will always bring back pleasant memories, just like so many other things written by incredible 60's artists. And although great musicians exist today, nothing has happened like the explosion of talent that hit the stage and the recording studios during those turbulent times of the 60's and early 70's.<br /><br />This recording has much to offer, great songwriting, incredible vocals, stellar instrumental work. It all happened during a magical time, when these three musicians were at \\"the top of their game,\\" when the world needed something to help minds escape the reality of life, when young people needed to make the world a better place.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. I could play this for hours. The only thing missing is the statistics for 3 suits. But when it comes to entertainment value, this is unbeatable.
1400069289|5.0|The Power of Habit is not only enlightening and educational, but extremely enjoyable reading, particularly since it deals with a subject many are loathe to think about - habits, especially our bad and annoying ones. Duhigg lays out a discussion beginning with personal habits, progresses to businesses and institutions, and finishes with cultural / societal habits. Along the way, he provides excellent descriptions of recent cutting edge scientific discovery about the function of the brain and its central role in the development and maintenance of habits. These discussions are easy to follow, but detailed enough to appreciate their role in understanding the basis of habits.<br /><br />For each chapter, he selects several narratives about real people, institutions, and historical periods to provide concrete examples for the lessons in each chapter. The stories are entertaining, captivating, compelling, and rather than sidetrack or bog down the flow, they serve to emphasize the very points he is trying to make in a manner that is natural and unforced. Finally, rather than simply laying out a thesis, Duhigg provides a how-to appendix with specific advice on implementing the lessons outlined in the book. This is a rare treat that is both, thought provoking as well as utilitarian at the same time.
B002KGEORM|5.0|This show is purely addicting. I have just finished season 3 & can't wait to get started on season 4.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Excellent read and quick read.  Kept me interested to the end.  Couldn't put the book down.  Two different mysteries to solve.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|You can't read one without reading all three of them. Once I picked this book up, I could not put it down.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Good book just like the Secret Keeper.  I really like the author Kate Morton.  I will continue to read anything she writes.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|My daughter is addicted to these books. She was only 7 when I bought her this one. She read it the same day that she got it. I ended up buying her the entire set. It is so much nicer to see her nose in a book than on an iPad or some other electronic device.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|Different from the show in some ways. Good. In really liked it. More thought-provoking. I like hearing the authors voice in the intro and the poem at the end
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved all three of these books. Once I began one, I had to read the other two. I read nonstop until I finished them all.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Slow paced, mature sexual content with drug use, expected more from Denzel Washington's movie in action and emotions than this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a perfect book to read over the summer. Be prepared to read all three books if you start reading one.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|After hearing all the bands and people that recorded on that board, and to hear that music is still being recorded, a great movie that is fun to watch and to hear all the stories that is behind some of the people in the music biz
B000I0QL82|5.0|I couldn't believe that among all my discs that I didn't have any of my Christmas movies!  I got busy and ordered a few of my favorites and this is one of them.  I received it in good condition and in good time.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|He never disappoints.  Always a great thriller when you pick up his books, I usually can figure out his plots but he had a good twist to this one
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I have to honestly say, that Jimmy Stewart has never been one of my favorite actors, but he did a good job in It's A Wonderful Life.  The reason I am attracted to this movie is the point behind it as far as how one life really touches another and how things would really be different if you hadn't been there in the first place.  The movie arrived in good condition and it arrived in a good amount of time.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|So many times in life, we search for an external approval.  We do it as children from our parents and teachers, as teens from our peers, and continue to search for approval as adults, if we did not get enough as chidren.  If, at a young age, we only learned that we are \\"unconditionally\\" loved by God, and were sent here with that same love to share, it would be such a different world and incredible life path.  Reading Anita's story has awakened a passion in me to learn my purpose and to accept for myself that I am unconditional love.  With that said, I hope to open my heart to giving unconditional love to others and myself.  Thank you Anita for your incredible story.  God Bless
B003EYVXTG|5.0|the dvd arrived promptly and in great condition,was as described,will recommend this product to my friends,the price was great,the condition great
B007A4SDCG|5.0|For years I've been labeled a ' creative ' by others.  I never knew whether to take the label as a compliment or not.<br /><br />There a times when I am 'in the flow' and times when no amount of effort seems to break thru the block.  I've struggled to understand why it's easy some days, and hard others.  Why some of the work product is good, and other work product isn't fit to print.<br /><br />Now I know why.  It's resistance.  It's a good thing, and there is a strategy to deal with it.<br /><br />If you are a writer, artist, an entrepreneur, inventor or other creative type, and struggle to deliver great product on a consistent basis, read this book.  Apply the simple principles, and your muse will find you.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|great cd,came in perfect condition and promptly,price was o.kay but not that competitive for a new cd,considering shipping cost, a but would recommend to my friends looking to find a certain product
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It was an okay movie, I don't really get all the hype around it. I mean there were parts that were funny but most of the parts were somewhat sick and disturbing. I understand that was sort of the point with having a teddy bear come to life, but i felt like after watching this movie i became dumber. If that even makes sense, the ending almost saved it but still it was a movie that I would never intend on watching again.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I did like the premise of this book, and it certainly has some twists...but too many parts just seemed absolutely unbelievable and contrived. I felt like the ending was just rushed as well. It was almost like the author was trying too hard to convince us what the characters were like rather than just letting the reader discover on their own.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|If you enjoy incredibly annoying music combined with juvenile slap stick humor you will love this wretched game.  It is insidious addictive and often frustrating when you six and eight year old grandkids can do things you struggle with.  In all fairness I really like  the problem solving skills that this teaches kids.  It provides humorous instructions on how to engineer.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I have never read the books, but my fiance loves them and they are his favorite book series that he had read by far.  I was never really interested in either the books or series until he had me sit down and watch Season 1.  I absolutely love it and am getting season 2 today and can't wait.  The acting is just amazing and each actor does a more than wonderful job.  I am so glad HBO picked this up!  I plan on starting to read the books shortly.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|How do you rate an album for your eight year old granddaughter?  She really likes it and does the requisite head bobbing when she listens to it.  I like it because I didn't pick up any disturbing language or references which seem to permeate so much music that is supposed to be targeting teens.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love this show! There is great character development, story progression, and gory violence! Recommended for any zombie genre fan.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like yahoo mail and on a mobile device it allows classification and storage of messages more seamlessly than gmail.  What I dislike intensely is the incessant ads and pop ups that seem ubiquitous to yahoo mail.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't wait for the next. It us exciting and addictive. The author allow s you to just indulge in the story. You h u st don't want to put it down.
B00884GR0W|2.0|Changing the graphics to make it better great. But to make the graphics worse not okay. They were better before the change.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|I have to say of all the movies my kids make me watch I loved this one best. It was just a treat to watch and many many times I was going HEY! I know that game !!!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I've read this twice - it's one of only two books that made me cry while reading it. Can't wait to read it again.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I feel like the graphics were much better in the original temple run. It almost looks like they &#34;skip&#34; or hesitate at times.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book was amazing!  Sparks does a great job hooking the reader in, keeping their interest, and surprising them.  Recommended to everyone! It is great!
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|I love the movie, but the Amazon streaming format is underpowered.  The movie will frequently degrade in quality and then come back to clarity again.  If you are going to download it to a device, it runs great, but if you are going to stream it...consider purchasing it from someone other than Amazon.<br /><br />As to the movie itself, it's wonderful.  The book is better (as always), but the movie stands on it's own as well.  I have heard this compared to The Breakfast Club and the immortal John Hughes movies in this genre; and this certainly has that appeal.  I would add, however, that the emotional aspects of this movie are far more intense.  Emma Watson is spectacular in this movie and is so captivating that you sometimes lose focus on the other actors.  This fits wonderfully with the storyline; making the audience fall in love with her character and ache at the ups and downs of the events that transpire.  If that's vague, then it's meant to not give anything away.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is a phenomenal book!  It takes you to a place few people are able to go.  The author clearly had access and insight that provided a one-of-a-kind opportunity to learn more about North Korea.  It was a page turner and in the end, left me wanting to learn more.  It's fiction, and yet, you just know there's so much factual information/observations ... so where is the line here between fact and extrapolation?  Thank you Adam Johnson for opening up a different part of the world.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am not usually a reader, but after purchasing my Kindle, I saw this book available and thought I would read it.  It was well worth it.  I enjoyed the story and ended up going to see the movie which was just as good as the book.  I think the book should be read before seeing the movie.  The end is spectacular.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I viewed this movie a few weeks ago. It was captivating and realistic.  I am anxious to see it again in the theatre even though it is coming out on video. I would like to have a copy in my film libray.  Thanks Ben for making this movie!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I was a little disappointed in the camera.  You cannot see what you going to take a picture of so you have to guess at what you are aiming at.
B005I0DUMC|4.0|The gritty cop movie from the 90s does well with this Blu-ray edition.  The visuals are fairly well presented without too much softening.  The movie storyline is an interesting one that covers fictional rogue police officers in a small New Jersey town.  Sylvester Stallone stars as a partially deaf sheriff who must confront the rogue police officers  while dealing with the many difficulties of police life.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This was the first book I ever read via kindle and I must say I couldn't have picked a better book!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing amazing can't wait for the next one so excited I'm sure it won't disappoint since the others didn't either!
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|I don't get how to use this app. First I clicked on a song and it played but I clicked on another song and it wouldn't let me listen to it
B0045D3N3O|5.0|Great additional features and booklet to accompany movie. What u buy blu ray for. Pick this movie up for sure
1616550414|5.0|In one word \\"Amazing\\" it has a lot of illustrations, the \\"real\\" (let's say) \\"official History Of Zelda, you're not a fan if you don't have it!!
0812993292|5.0|Well written--Both plot and character development are quite well done.  The author uses imaginative imagery throughout.  the theme of faith is arresting, though simple.
B000YM4I4S|4.0|I'm one of those who doesn't agree that Robert Schumann's symphonies are horribly orchestrated and need improvement, but I'm also a person who's happy to hear what someone else is willing to try in the way of a make-over -- on Schumann or any other composer, for that matter. Such tinkering is harmless in its way, as long as one doesn't lose sight of what's original and what's not, as well as what sounds right and what doesn't. Anyway, in the case of these recordings of Gustav Mahler's revisions of Schumann's four symphonies, my reaction is mixed. On the one hand, the performances are not bad in themselves -- actually, I think the playing is rather good, but then this is the Gewandhaus Orchestra. As to what's being played, it's there that things get a little murky. I don't know that Mahler succeeded in making things better -- there are spots where to me the music seems to have been put through a blender, with some elements seemingly lost amid the re-orchestration. To my untrained ear, the Fourth Symphony comes off the best of the lot, not sounding that much different from it's \\"original\\" form. (I add the quotations because Schumann himself revised the symphony, so there is a final version noticeably different from the original original.) As for the other three, I think that if you take these Mahler renditions conducted by Chailly and compare them with, say, the period instrument versions of Schumann's original compositions conducted by Roy Goodman and John Eliot Gardiner, the latter come out far on top. Even modern big band recordings like Leonard Bernstein's first go round on Sony with the New York Philharmonic or Kurt Masur with this same Gewandhaus Orchestra make the case that Schumann's original orchestration was just fine. So I guess it depends on what you want. Me, I'm happy listening to both sides, though most of the time I prefer the original.
B002YCVX5S|1.0|Dumb, unrealistic and mindless.<br />Few good actors cannot fix this movie.<br />I am sure some people would really believe that the world war ii ended because of some brave American soldiers who killed the top 4 Germans... not.
B000001H03|3.0|In general I like Karl Bohm's vintage Mozart recordings. His set of the (almost) complete symphonies withe the Berlin Philharmonic is in my view the best old style modern instrument one around. This album, a compilation that includes the Mozart concertos for clarinet, flute and bassoon, is however just a bit hit and miss. I think the Clarinet Concerto comes off best, but the other two are a bit flawed. In the Flute Concerto it's the sound, which I found rather thin and screechy, particularly in the first movement. As for the Bassoon Concerto, I agree that the soloist may not have been at his best. In any case, this is one disc in the Bohm catalog that is not in the upper echelons of my list. For these works, my preference lies in the direction of the marvelous renditions by the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Such great twists! Definitely keeps you on your toes and guessing the whole time. Great read! Couldn't put it down!
B0014WSWTY|5.0|Well, I have to say this this is perhaps the best Beethoven symphonic cycle I've ever heard. I know that it is the best set of period instrument renditions of these symphonies that I've ever heard. The cycle of John Eliot Gardiner I have come to view as lacking in emotional fire. Roger Norrington's has an energy that has seemed to me to be more bluster than anything else. The set from the Hanover Band has sound problems, to my ears. Franz Bruggen's was my favorite before this set conducted by Jos van Immerseel came along. Yes, Bruggen is excellent, but Immerseel is even better. The tempos are fast, but details are not lost. There is nuance. There is fire. There's very nice sound. Oh, and there are a bunch of overtures to boot. My only complaint is a packaging one: The discs come in individual paper sleeves that are like envelopes. Sealed envelopes. I don't care for the hanging edges that retain adhesive. But that has nothing to with the recordings, which are glorious, at least to my way of thinking. There is emotion, but it happens in the context of an over-riding sense of Classicism. The early No. 1 is spry and vivacious, while the No. 9 is propulsive and packs a punch without getting top-heavy. From start to finish, there's an almost perfect balance of agility and heft that seems right for each of the nine. Absolutely fabulous, and highly recommended.
B005PK56TA|5.0|in my opinion, this is the best show on since Lost. i watched the whole season in 1 weekend. season 2 is great too, cant wait for season 3!
B001I45UFC|5.0|The Chronicles of Narnia, what can I say, they are all great. I do not know how anyone could help but like this book.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Was a fun game to play. Got it done in one day. Is fairly easy. Background music and noises were annoying so I turned them off.
1250007208|4.0|WOW!  What a read.  I had kept this one of my shelf for quite a while and finally decided to read it.  It was definitely very entertaining and the twists and turns kept my pages turning.  Cinder, a cyborg with feelings, longs to know who and what she is.  And the journey to find out is interesting.  I would have given this book 5 stars, except for its predictability.  In spite of that one failing, it was a great read, and I found myself not putting it down.  Although written for a young audience, older readers can find it entertaining.  How entertaining?  Let me just say that upon finishing the book at midnight, I immediately purchased the sequel and started it.  If you want something to keep you entertained and enjoy fantasy, definitely purchase this book.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Certainly a movie that gives you pause about the government and the powers it can exert.  Wish I didn't believe it.
B009738XXM|4.0|Music is in the eye of the beholder, isn't it? I'm a fifty something mother of 2 young men (more men than young) but I like a good pop song and bought this album for its Call Me Maybe, which I couldn't get out of my head. There are several other good pop songs on it, including Your Heart is a Muscle. At the price ($2.99), it was a good purchase. If it had been more expensive, I might have taken a pass and bought just the one hit but I'm glad it was priced low enough to tempt me to try the whole thing.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This was the best gift ever and all my kids friends ask where they got them!  Perfect unique gift and they want more!
030758836X|4.0|This book elicited quite a conversation among my book club.  Everyone felt it was interesting but kind of creepy.  It's amazing how much detail this author keeps in her head and brings out in her books.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Great Read!!  I could not put the book down....  Really enjoyed the history.<br />Made me want to buy the next book immediately.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I would have loved it more but it crashes on my kindle fire way to much but it helps to reinstall it. I am 11 and I have nothing better to do in my life but to draw!
B004S9AK3G|5.0|I loved this book great even though it was  gruesome in parts.  I loved the characters, story and the history.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It has an excitement/thrilling excitement to it but it is quite difficult and tends to glitches sometimes if your device is old.
B003TSEL7S|1.0|I think that this book was great because it was a thrilling book to read and you didn't know what was going to happen I would rate this five stars.
B002RB7VMA|5.0|I love to listen to Michael Buble music.  It helps relax me and it very easy listening too.  I have several of his albums.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|I watch this trilogy about twice a year and the Blu-ray discs are amazing. The only problem I have is with the packaging. It would have been better if they had made a digi-book like Die Hard or even The Matrix. Universal Studios did a great job on the Classic Monster collection. Maybe they will get it right when they re-release all of the Jurassic Park Trilogy in 3D.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Great suspense, development of characters, page turner. I've read King & Maxwell before and enjoyed. I decided to go back to the beginning & wasn't disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Who doesn't love Downton Abbey?  I love this show!  The great actors, location, costumes, dialogue - all of it is wonderful!  The loss of key cast members broke my heart this season but it leaves me excited and anxious for the future.  I hope we have many more great seasons of Downton Abbey to enjoy.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Great read! I enjoyed the series. Development of characters there interplay and relationships was excellent; as was the description of their environment.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|I bought this book for my husband from the recommendation of our son. Although he hasn't read it as of yet I am sure he will
B0091REZMW|4.0|If you like puzzle/hidden object games you will love this. It is hard to play with this small of a screen but it's still fun.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Absolutely love this movie! A little gross at times, but action packed. I've always liked Kurt Russell. He makes a very convincing bad guy. Loved it when the girls kicked his butt!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Facsinating account of a fascinating life! This will be a book that I will reference for many years to come. Steves Jobs is truly an American pioneer deserving the same level of respect and admiration as Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Albert Einstein, and all  of the other superb innovators, inventors,and thinkers too numerous to mention. I look forward to completing this book and highly recommend it!
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|We should all speak for the trees and The Lorax is a reminder that we share this planet with more than just humans.
B00009R86L|5.0|This pad is incredibly comfortable and grippy. It keeps my messenger bag from sliding around (which would possibly bang my camera gear and lenses into people or objects around me) and also provides comfort and stress relief off of the side of your neck or shoulders. I wear my bag with the strap over my head and the bag pushed behind somewhat. Anyway, it makes a huge difference. Highly recommended!
B009EDZB6C|2.0|As an aviation buff and military history's enthusiast, I hade great expectations for this film.  While some of the flying sequences were interesting, they were pasted together with entirely predictable....and dare I say stereotypical, performances.  Anyone who hasn't lived under a rock must appreciate the struggle minority soldiers, sailors and airmen endured to serve a country where they all to often were marginalized and unappreciated.  However, the acting in this film fails to connect those facts at a gut level at least from my perspective.  Much better in that respect can be found in a film such as &#34;Glory&#34;...but of course just about anything with Morgan Freeman in the cast is pretty much a winner in my book.  The bottom line is that if offered as a rental, it might be worth watching for the flying scenes.  But as history, go read any of the first hand accounts form the original Red Tails themselves....you'll be better served!
0307454568|2.0|Having read the first two books and also having seen the first two films, I wanted to read the third book in the series.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I just couldn't get through it. I almost put it down after about 150 pages, but tried to persevere. After about half way, (Roughly 300 pgs) I finally gave up.<br /><br />It just didn't keep my attention and my mind kept wandering. It just seemed boring, too wordy, too all over the place.<br /><br />Not being able to finish it, I watched the film instead. Quite frankly, I found that boring as well and fell asleep. I guess the third one in the trilogy just didn't do it for me. The first one was the best.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was the first King novel I ever read in its entirety and I must admit it blew me away. Just my kind of book, science fiction mixed with science fact and history.<br />Definitely will not be my last.
1424810493|4.0|The first one was better but you can't get to the third one without it. it was worth the purchase
B00271HAK8|5.0|It's hard to find a movie to agree to watch with your teenage daughters, this was a home run for us!
B001HN697M|5.0|why this franchise wasn't started with this one i will never know. i liked it the best of all. thumbs up
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel really took me by suprise this movie keeps you guessing from start to finish as a matter of fact I was shocked at the ending totally caught off guard. a great movie to invest in.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am obsessed. These books are fantastic. I can't wait to read the next!! No other words can describe it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A very enjoyable pastime for both me and my four year old son...we both LOVE this game...thanks a lot. Two thumbs up.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|This is one my almost 7 year old daughter's favorite games to play on the kindle.  She loves being able to interact with the animals and play the different mini-games.  After a certain amount of patients served (and games played) you earn stickers.  This is definitely a keeper!
0525953728|5.0|Great book, and easy to read and quite informative.  Since i am from the Va Beach area, it was especially informative to learn about the SEALS.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|This game would not download to my Kindle Fire.  Not happy about this.  I love the angry birds but this one can go back to the creators and figure out how to download the game
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Wonderful<br />An amazing story. The language and prose is something you don't see in modern literature. Even though it had many difficult parts to read, I always needed to see how they completed the whole story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book can't wait to see the movie.  Loved Alex and Katle.  They have just great chemistry together.  Loved it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|its ok and really fun but every once in a while it will wipeout on me!!! score coins characters multiplayer....
B009VSW15Y|3.0|With no lens on the front of the kindle you cannot see with accuracy if the device is getting the object you want to take<br />In the picture.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The nudity and language in this movie is excessive in this film.  We got about 1/4 of the way through it and turned it off.  Holywood needs to rethink the way they make movies.  Most people do not want this much junk in the movies they watch.  Movies that are PG or PG-13 outsell R movies by a wide margin.  I don't recommend this movie to anyone.
B00AYDC3CG|2.0|Normally I can sit through kids movies. This movie is very borring and slow. Seems like it was just thrown together.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Yes, Rebus can be  bloody irritating, a Mr. Know It All who lives by his own rules, but he's intelligent and figures out what others haven't and hey, even has a conscience. It's fun it is to go along for the ride and to see those inept pompous publicity grabbers and social climbers are put in their place.
B00005NZBN|4.0|Yep, alot of trolling especially when it comes to reviews on the Bob D. albums. I bought this a few years back in a package that also included time out of mind and oh mercy. Just began to spin Love & Theft again recently. IMO,  have to say that although this isn't as good as Time Out Of Mind or even Modern Times, it ain't bad at all. Contrary to da naysayerz opinions, there's no such thing as a bad Dylan record, folks.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|I used it on the beach, and it's great.  Doesn't get destroyed if anything spills on it, and comes with a clip to hold the cards together.  Using the clip is a little annoying, but possible. Despite being annoying, it's very useful.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a very sweet story of two cancer kids who fall in love. I like this book because it truly depicts the personality of teenagers. I love the fact that it portrays real teen personalities instead of portraying teenagers who are \\"cancer nice\\". The only problem that I have with the book is the uncertainty of the after life, which I guess is also sadly real and common in our society.
B0007SM922|4.0|As a Savoy fan since high school in the early-mid 70's, I favor the era of Street Corner Talking, Hellbound Train, Lion's Share, and Wire Fire..basically when keyboardist/singer Paul Raymond was in the band and gave them depth.  To me, that was their quality peak as a band.  Kim and Paul and the band really boogied live when I saw them a couple times at the old Electric Ballroom in Dallas in '75 and '76.  The only recent one I keep is Strange Dream.  I would characterize this box set as early years precursors and a worthy addition to the fan's collection.  On Raw Sienna, Chris Youlden's gruff voice and inventive songs, including horns on a couple, were very different from what followed.  Then Lonesome Dave sang lead on Looking In, which has a more consistent song-to-song continuity of boogie.  Some have a jazzy feel to them.  Dave's voice had a natural blues feel, and wasn't screaming loud like he got with Foghat.  This is probably the best of their early stuff, before they hit their stride, IMO.  Certainly fun to listen to now and again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What an awesome story! Riveting storyline with characters to match. I had never read this author's work but now I will search out more.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|great price for an easy 2 to use flash ... simple install and good flsh coverage ...  battery good for 100s of pics
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Following Harold Fry on his journey was enjoyable and the hint of the mystery with his son kept the reader engaged.
044024367X|1.0|I am a big fan of Lee Child's writing but this book is terrible.  This is a character in search of a plot.  The situation has no urgency, feels completely contrived and turns the character of Jack Reacher into a mere busybody looking for something to fill his seemingly empty days.  Reacher comes across not as a crusader for justice, but as a mere cranky contrarian, determined to do the opposite of what he is told for no good reason the reader can fathom.  The other Reacher books are very hard to put down but after sixty pages, this one is hard to pick up again.  Never thought I'd say this about Lee CHild, but this book was a struggle to plough through.  In the other books, I cared a lot about what happened to Reacher, in this book not at all.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. He LOVES Led Zeppelin and was totally surprised when he opened it since he thought he would not get it till his birthday.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I loved the Maze Runner Trilogy, so i obviously had to read the prequel.  If you start this book knowing that the story is not going to be about Thomas, Teresa and the other Gladers, then you will enjoy it.  Obviously i would have enjoyed a prequel involving the original characters but that's not what Dashner has given us.  This is sounding like a negative review but it really isn't.  Read this book because its pretty great!
B002VX3RCW|5.0|What can I say?<br /><br />The crinkling hooves made my 6 month old love it!  He also loved holding onto the two rings on the tail and would fall asleep that way.  Lamaze products are great!!
072325804X|4.0|Actually bought this my own son but perfect for Christening present.<br />Lovely well made hard back should last a lifetime.<br />Stunning Potter picture and classic tales a real treat for a child and the adult reading!
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Good book. I like all her books. I really hate reviewing books. I just won't to read them. I can't wait to read the next book.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|a great product that is useful to everyone. i cannot think of a better product for anyone. a truely wonderful product.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|they say the game is free, but after you reach a certain point its a charge. however,  I really enjoyed playing the game after I purchased the remainder of it. I have many G5 games on my kindle fire, and each one has worked fantastically on it. I recommend the game!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The way this gentleman writes is intellectual compelling and beautiful.  I've never  read anything  fantasy related that would  come close to matching this.  I feel quit  sad that I finished this book,if it went on forever I wouldn't object.
B0089XH38M|3.0|because it says the same thing everytime but when I click on the link they want me to open to fix it<br />it says that it is not responding...so I get the same security threat everytime .......
B0016OLC5Q|3.0|The movie was made well: alternating between the last days and the 2 year journey that brought him to the bus. Such a sad story.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Going to this movie was my parents first date, so for Christmas i tried to recreate their date and this movie was just what they needed
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Finished it in two days. Left me shocked, sad, happy, and in deep thought. Felt as if I were standing there watching the events unfold in front of my own eyes.
0316232955|4.0|I've been a fan of Chris for years now, but I would say he still has room to grow. There are some points where I would cringe a little at the writing, but for a budding author, he is definitely not the worst. I would say this book is better than the movie for sure.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Youversion is a nice idea, but when it doesn't work, there is NO support that is helpful. After using the app for just over a year, the program, out of the blue, wanted me to log in.  My login info wouldn't work- not from my Kindle, my phone or my computer.  I repeatedly requested a password change and, in more than a dozen attempts, NEVER received an email with a temp password.  When I contacted support, I was very detailed about the problem and everything I had done and, instead of receiving help, I got a &#34;support&#34; response that said that temporary passwords are sometimes hard to get to work.  I responded with a second email that I wasn't having problems getting the temp password to work; I again stated that I never received an email with a temp password.  Their second &#34;support&#34; response was how to get a temporary password, but I had already explained in my original email that I had done everything that they were telling me to do.  When I responded again saying I'd already done what they were telling me to do, the third &#34;support&#34; response was the exact same text that the second response had been.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that the support team doesn't speak/understand English, and responses are generated, not based on a description of the problem, but screening for key words and sending a canned response.  NO HELP AND VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game.  Play it late of an evening, for relaxation and fun.  Scrat is my favorite one, and trying to get him when he crosses the screen is sometimes a challange.
034580404X|5.0|Fifty Shades is a great trilogy to read!  Brand new condition with box to hold all the three books together.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|A great app. Great music from the series. It is fun to be creative with your town and see your town progress. For those who say gems are a problem follow these steps. 1) Do not spend gems to skip quests. 2) You can get extra gems from the balloon pop game by spending 30 hearts. 3) You get bits and at least one gem everytime you level up. Follow these steps to accumulate gems as fast as possible for free!
B004TI5N38|4.0|I enjoyed reading this. The plot was a little different. Won't make my all tome faves but worth the time.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|When the original Kindle Fire came out, the plug was positioned at the &#34;bottom&#34; if you held it portrait-wise. This caused metal fatigue at the wire-plug juncture. Amazon replaced the worn p,us for free and now they are positioned differently in the new tablets. This one wears like iron!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I should mention that my hands are rather small so keep that in mind. I've had this mouse for over a week now and it's been fantastic so far with no issues with the hardware and only a slight gripe with the software.<br /><br />First the good:<br />- Worked great straight out the box.<br />- Layout works quite well whether you use the normal or claw grip (I tend to switch depending on when I'm gaming or browsing the net.)<br />- Side buttons are far enough forward so I don't have to reach back with my thumb which was a problem I had with my previous mouse.<br />- Custom weight system is always a plus and this one already feels fine without the added weight (for me, anyway.)<br />- Price.<br /><br />And then the bad:<br />- It didn't come with the driver on a disc, but that was easily remedied by an internet connection and Google.<br />- It bothers me how there's no generic mouse button support for the extra buttons forcing me to either map them to keyboard keys or not use them at all.<br />- Only the Anker logo LED is configurable, so you're stuck with bright blue for the other LED's.<br />- Cord was rather short, especially with my desk setup, but I just bought a USB extension cord which fixed this (yeah I know, right? GENIUS!)<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic mouse for the price.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|This is one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made! The movie may seem dated by today's standards, but it's a classic that can be watched over and over.  Walter Pidgeon's role is great,  He's perfectly cast - a little dark, a little mysterious, a little deceptive in the beginning but reveals his true, good nature in the end. I sometimes think they should have made a sequel to this one.
B004WR125O|3.0|It's not bad but to be honest I haven't used it toom uch becuase 1&#62; interface on Onkyo isn't all that great 2&#62; Load up time is slow 3&#62; With Apple products dominating the music scene, it's just easier to plug in  your Iphone, iPad or Itouch to get your internet radio. If I knew how it performed , I wouldn't have purchsed it. Instead I would have put my money towards a nice Ipod stand to connect to my Onkyo amp.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|I had not heard about this series when it first came out, but I'm intrigued about this era decided to check out the first episode. Well, needless to say, I was hooked. I really enjoyed watching all four season's. I would recommend this series to everyone! I loved the cast they used during the season.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched all three seasons in just 2 weeks.  Couldn't stop once I watched the first episode.  Amazing characters and writing!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I do not give five stars very often, this author has made it very easy. What a great plot filled with interesting characters of depth.
B004WR125O|2.0|After carefuly reading the directions, I proceded to install the device and connect to my home network.  Not having a TV capable of connecting to my receiver via an hdmi cable necessitated that I use the readout at the front of the receiver (I was not aware of this at the time I made my purchase...perhaps I overlooked it in the product's description).  Carefully following the directions, which were very difficult to follow, I eventually was able to connect to my home network.  It took a lot of patience and many tries.  Once connected a very strong signal was obtained.  But, when I tried to stream music files from either of my two computers, I kept getting a fail message.  I tried everything I could think of (remember, the directions are relatively useless) over a span of two weeks, with no result.  I searched online for assistance on the Onkyo website but that was no help whatsoever.  I finally bit the bullet and paid the return shipping fee refund deduction of $5.07.  I can't for the life of me understand how Onkyo can provide such poor directions and limited online information.  Nice idea, just didn't work properly.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Just magical.<br />A fun escape and the photos add a fun layer to a good story.  I would recommend to others.
1457514508|5.0|Once again Whitehead gives a reader a reason to quickly turn pages. The book contains great character depth and personal insights of those around him. The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club is a flawless narration of life's characters that spins around all of us from time to time. I heartedly recommend the book and you'll feel better after reading it.
0345803485|3.0|Spring rain, ahhh. The reason why I bought this book was because everyone else was buying it. Ana Steele falls in love with a man who likes S and M, and the book details her infatuation with him as well as a few beatings she takes which didn't sound very sexy.<br /><br />The book was well-written, and if S and M turns you on, it's a great book for you.  If not, it's a bit of a downer because I wonder if men have really become so emasculated in our society they have to draw pleasure from beating up women behind closed door and under the guise of sensuality.
1401233791|5.0|I'm one of those people who was there when this series came out.  I was 14 years old when it started, so it was difficult for me to collect them all.  In fact, I had a few gaps in the independent comics.  Years later, I got the 2-part Knightfall graphic novel volumes and loved being able to finally get the whole story on Bruce's fall and Jean-Paul's rise.  Well, those went MIA years ago (stolen, along with a lot of other stuff) so I decided I was going to replace them.  And what could be better than getting it all in 1 book, as opposed to 2?  Plus, this new collection has an added comic, Bane: Vengeance, which tells the story of Bane's origin.  That was left out of the original Knightfall collections, the rest of the comics in this book were collected previously in the afore mentioned 2 volume edition.  The addition of the Bane: Vengeance story is a nice touch, as it's a good lead-in to the Knightfall series.<br /><br />The series itself is still good after all these years.  This is definitely one of the best story lines ever written for Batman comics, in my opinion.  Though, reading these now, at the age of 34, I have come to a conclusion:  Bane is a wuss.  I know, he seems tough, but how tough is he?  After reading his origin story, he comes off looking like one of the toughest people on the planet.  He survives the seemingly unsurvivable and comes out stronger for it.  Plus, his venom steroid really enhances his natural strength.  However, upon coming to Gotham, he won't even face Batman in a fair fight.  He hatches this seemingly brilliant plan to weaken Batman by releasing the wackos from Arkham, knowing that Batman will run himself ragged hunting them down, thereby weakening him for the strike.  But, the plan isn't even all that brilliant.  I mean, how difficult is it to spring and arm some crazies and then sit back and rest while Batman runs all over hunting them down?  All it takes is some explosives and guns, any idiot can get those.  Then he proceeds to wait (comfortably) until Batman is almost too weak to stand or even think and then he strikes.  While he's \\"fighting\\" (pulverizing) Batman, he keeps spouting off about how Batman is no match for him and how he's superior.  But, is he really?  After all, you're talking about someone who is apparently too much of a wimp to fight Batman in a fair fight, so he had to \\"weaken\\" him first.  If he's so tough, why not face Batman at his prime?  Because he'd lose, that's why.  Batman has faced opponents physically superior to him in the past and won, and Bane knew this.  Plus, Batman has years of training and experience, including dozens of fighting techniques, Ninja training and years of study.  Meanwhile, Bane is a one-trick pony.  He injects some Venom, gets really strong, beats up stuff.  He has no formal fight training, a weakness that Batman could easily exploit.  The other weakness he could exploit was Bane's dependency on Venom.  (even Killer Croc figured that one out)  So, likely, Bane knew he couldn't really take Batman in his prime, so he had to cheat and stack the deck.  Hence, he's a wuss.<br /><br />Though, even after realizing all of that, I still enjoyed reading this again.  It's still a great story arc.  The book itself seems to be nicely bound and printed on quality paper, despite some peoples' claims that DC's bindings and paper have gone downhill (not necessarily on this, but I've seen that complaint on some of their other recent collections.)it (comfortably) until Batman is almost too weak to stand or even think and then he strikes.

B000YJ54DU|5.0|All of the Reacher books that I have read are great. Everyone should read at least  one it's gives you an insight look into the life of a true American soldier.
0739313118|5.0|Enjoyable and suspenseful with an extremely surprising ending.  Would recommend it to others especially my Catholic friends.  They need to be shook up so more

B005VPRF0M|5.0|Bought this for my nephew for christmas, he loves it and is still playing with it.  Would definitely recommend this item.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chose this book because all the other dairy of a wimpy kids were good I new this was going to be good.<br />I liked this book
B007GFDVEE|5.0|I bought this Lego set for my nephew for christmas, he loves it, still plays with it, uses this set with other Lego sets he has.  Very pleased.
1592407889|5.0|I picked up this book at BN on a whim and read it in one day because I couldn't stop reading. Sachi Parker's unusual childhood may have been painful and scary to experience firsthand but it makes for a riveting ride. Sachi outs her mom in this book, which is Shirley's due. In the acknowledgements, though, Sachi thanks her mother for giving her such rich material. And I agree. Nothing bad ever happens to a writer; it's all material. Lucky Me is memoir at its best and worth every penny.
B0043ZDU1E|3.0|The first track is great, but I was unmoved by the rest of the album.  It isn't a bad album; it just isn't as good as some of her others.
B008JFUMUQ|4.0|Watched it at an Imax in Manila. The action scenes are way over the top but it is Die Hard. The acting was good and the humor was not overdone.<br />Willis still looks good and delivers the lines and the action in his usual style. The best Die Hard after the original. Hope they release a 3D version in blu ray
B001G9LVGG|3.0|I usually love anything by McKennitt, and I would have though to be really happy with the Christmas songs, but this album didn't move me.  It's pretty - I will play it during the Christmas rotation of albums - but it's not one I will purposefully listen to over and over.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Everything you've heard is true. Gillian Flynn's story of Amy and Nick grabs you right away and doesn't let go until you get to its satisfying ending.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Good tv is like a good book: you want a great story with great characters. Fringe meets those requirements. The &#34;monsters&#34; are different and original and the characters are people you grow to care about. The picture on my kindle fire hd tablet makes me watch more tv on it then my 40&#34; tv.
0345803507|5.0|There are very strong opinions about this trilogy on either side of the spectrum, but I have to admit that I enjoyed it, not so much for the sex that has everyone hot and bothered, but for the storyline. The Christian Grey character is intriguing from the start; he is an onion to be peeled away slowly and anyone who read all three books knows what I am talking about. None of the characters were wasted; they all fit into this jigsaw puzzle that is the life and existence of Christian Grey. As the layers come off we learn why he is who he is and that all is not as it seems (is it ever?). I generally read more serious subject matter (politics, business, literature), but even I want some brain candy from time to time. This was a most delicious brain candy escape and I hope EL James has a follow up. Memo to all the critics: Lighten up, will ya??
1451695195|4.0|Good book but not as good as some on the same subject. It is worth the time it takes to read.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Such a gorgeous film already, and on our home theater in BluRay it just soars! This is one movie surely worth the upgrade.
0143038583|5.0|This is one of the most interesting and informative books I've ever read.  I would definitely put it on my top 10 list.  It is perfect for anyone who is interested in the history of food in America, health issues, and vegetarianism.  Great read!
B009U9S6FI|3.0|The first half was VERY good. Best insights into the Holocaust ever. BUT I couldn't finish the second half it was so boring!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My kids can't get enough Taylor Swift.  This CD is more mainstream than her music in the past, appealing to non-country fans, too.  Very catchy songs.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|the book is funny but you guys need to write more books because yours books are really funny super funny i need you to write more and more books so i can laugh at the book if it is funny thank you for your time and bye
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Just had to buy this because I couldn't wait for my PBS station to show the season 3 finale. (did the same thing for season2 :o) If you are a Downton fan, you will not be disappointed at all. I will not give anything away to spoil it, do not wait... order it today!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|First time player,  find it very challenging,  more so than solitaire. Love the touch-automatic move feature. Gets harder &amp; more challenging each time another suite is played. Would definately reccomend to family &amp; friends. Thanks for a great,  free app!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I would recommend this app for anyone who cant sleep. in silence! It is also a great app for just relaxing!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|It's all good would tell anyone  to read just hope that he finishes the rest of the books before he done
B009E3EY38|5.0|Since Zep first appeared on the scene, I've gone back and forth many times on my opinion of the band...always positive, but sometimes I've felt like the bombast overshadowed the music. And I always felt that Zep was better represented in the studio rather than in concert---Page's studio wizardry was too difficult to totally pull off live, even with the undeniable musicianship of the band. Now, four decades in, this DVD shows how well they've balanced all that out...this is the real deal. Plant doesn't try to soar into the upper register all the time and he's better for it; Page  really digs into the songs and plays his butt off; John Paul Jones, always underrated, gets to shine here and you can really here just how good a bass player he is; and Jason really does embody his Dad's spirit while sounding very modern on the drums, Watch Kashmir and you can see and hear a band that is totally in synch and performing a masterpiece, Great shot at the end where the band turns to watch Jason on his Rock and Roll solo--three &#34;virtual&#34; uncles proudly watching a nephew shine. Well worth it.
B001608R5I|5.0|A friend recommended this album to me and I have to say I was more than pleased.  And mad props to Jack White on the engineering job.  The sound is incredible on vinyl!  And I have one of the cheap turntables!
0440237688|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />\\"The Giver\\" is one of the most terrifying, cruel, yet hopeful books I've ever read.<br /><br />Twelve year-old Jonas lives in a world of Sameness.  Every need is taken care of, everyone is employed, being educated, or being taken care of.  It's a world of uniformity and plainness.  \\"Family units\\" consist of a set of parents, one boy, and one girl, each assigned to the adults when the children become Ones.  There are no surprises, no pain, and little emotion.<br /><br />Soon, however, Jonas realizes there's more to life than he ever thought possible.  He is chosen as the Receiver.  His training includes learning things only one other person in the community knows.  And that person is the Giver.<br /><br />My 13 year-old son, who had to read \\"The Giver\\" for school, encouraged me and my wife to read it.  It's a quick read, which is why I'm offering very little in terms of plot.  But its brevity is packed with many emotions.
B0017R5RN0|4.0|Another album that was originally recorded in the 70's and it's obvious when you listen to it.  Was never a huge VU fan but I do like a few songs on this.
1780891237|4.0|In a harsh landscape where the environment is deadly, an entire city lives beneath the earth in a giant, 150 level silo. Entire floors are dedicated to specific industries or activities. The society is tightly regulated. Expressing any dissatisfaction or questioning the regime leads to punishment in the form of being sent outside as a \\"cleaner\\". Cleaners are armed with a small woollen pad with which to scrub the sensors clean before succumbing to the toxic air. When the Major needs to appoint a new sheriff, she selects Juliette, a woman whose curiosity will lead her into danger and whose impact will be felt throughout the silo.<br /><br />This is a very clever book. I loved the thought that had gone into the details of this world and how the society operated and I loved the way that it wasn't laid out for us but allowed the reader to figure it out as they read. The characters are also terrific. Juliette is strong and heroic, the villain is pleasingly villainous whilst also being a bit of a loser and there are lots of other memorable characters who come and go throughout the book. I don't want to spell out too much about what happens because the first part of the book in particular is full of twists and revelations and having an idea of what is going to happen would spoil this.<br /><br />For me, the second half of the book was somewhat less involving. The pace slows and it feels like it's getting stuck for a little bit. However the ending sets us up nicely for the sequel, [[ASIN:B00BFUB9MW Shift (Wool Trilogy 2)]] - due in April - and I for one will be reading it
B004D5BMX2|4.0|Sounds great on vinyl!  Haven't listened to it too many times but so far I'm enjoying it.  Really digging Jack White as of late.
B009K6GLM6|4.0|The disc contains two original lp recordings, the first, The Eleventh Hour\\", was recorded in August, 1962, and the second \\"Sandy's Gone\\", in September, 1963. Both were/are on Verve. The Eleventh Hour finds Mr. Hodges with strings turning in twelve lush and rich tracks which may well be appropriate listening at the eleventh hour. Jazz musicians with strings? Well it worked with Ben Webster, Charlie Parker (both on Verve by the way) and with Art Pepper on the Winter Moon sessions. Now the named were all master musicians who seem perfectly at home in this rather unusual setting. Hodges is no exception and provides us with some truly beautiful music. Mr. Ellington would surely have approved. The second recording is, however, rather odd. First of all ,it does not fit with the first set, and secondly it seems to me that this is not music that Hodges would want to play or should be playing, with the possible exception of Blue Velvet. I kept thinking of Lawrence Welk, and those were not complimentary thoughts. OK this is Hodges in a different mood, but is it the right one? There is no bad playing, but there is also no \\"sit up and listen to that\\" playing, unlike, as previously mentioned, the first set. Maybe I am used to Hodges in specific settings, and this one, as yet, does not sit well. Maybe in time. So four stars for the odd combination and not for the musicianship. Strings on The Eleventh Hour are arranged and conducted by Oliver Nelson with production by Creed Taylor - that should tell you something. Claus Ogerman is conductor on the second set, also produced by Creed Taylor - maybe not one of his better production choices. Griping aside, this is worth the price for the first twelve tracks. Soft lights, a good wine - enjoy.
B0033AGPFS|4.0|These do come on 180G vinyl, and it sounds pretty good.  On a more hi fi system, I can imagine the sound would be even better.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|As good as all of the prior Reacher books. I recommend it to all those who enjoy Lee Child's earlier books.
B000057DON|5.0|I know that at some point earlier in my life, I have owned either the cassette or the CD of this album, but have recently started collecting vinyl and decided to add this to my collection and am so glad I did!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks. He is an amazing writer and I have loved every book I have read by him. This is by far one of the best. I cannot wait to see the movie and hope it lives up to the book!!
B009EEFTMC|1.0|cubistry when opened automatically shifts the kindle screen to the left and horizontally.  After playing four or five times, my Kindle got locked into the left horizontal position and I couldn't get my other apps to rotate including reading a book, etc.  I uninstalled but still needed to call Amazon customer service to get the problem solved.  It's not worth it for the stress it caused.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I love this game I do and I had alot of coins I wanted to unlock carmen i went on the game today and it restated EVERYTHING. I have nothing and im pissed I was close to unlocking player and I had alot of money. I'm now at zero again.
B007L6VR12|1.0|This movie is totally inappropriate for family viewing and puts preteens in a situation that I consider child abuse for the actors.<br />Our children grow up fast enough. We do not need to suggest innapropriate thoughts to them.<br />I returned this movie as I cannot support the making of things like this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Best thing I've read in a while.  Couldn't put it down!  Tight plot, beautifully written, full of surprises.  Loved it.
B009MO5G90|5.0|Great movie and even better in 3D. We love all the RE movies, watching in 3D just makes it even better!
B00846F1YW|5.0|This game is  really entertaining and it keeps you up and running. You buy this game and it won't bore you. Get it
B0093LFGMO|5.0|I bought this CD/DVD combo for my wife and she is absolutely happy. Just don't make the mistake expecting too much of the DVD, it is not a live concert but the making of a video clip.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Now, first off, I'm a fairly new fan of T&S. I first heard of them on the game TTR4, with the song Body Work. I fell in love! Granted all of theses songs have a different sound than Body Work did, but they are all absolutely amazing! I listen to the album when I'm doing homework, taking naps, all the time. My favorites include Closer, I'm Not Your Hero, Goodbye Gooodbye, and I Couldn't Be Your Friend. Of course all of the songs on this album are pure gold! 10/5!!!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Tom Cruise has done it again except this time his team has an edge. A comedic edge that it. Aside from the brilliant cinematographic feats of creativity and altitude, gorgeous scenery and a cleverly written and witty script, the actors are the real glue of this film. Jeremy Renner is the next big thing once he gets past this Hansel/Gretel mistake, and works well with Tom Cruise's confident character, Simon Pegg's comedic relief, and that girl from Deja-Vu's beauty and elegance. A winning combination with almost no sappy love drama involved except a little revenge for a fallen agent early on. The last 2 have been good but this is the best one since the original  so far I think.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game! I'm into microbiology and thought it was a fun way to &#34;play&#34; with the different types of pathogens that really do affect the world and consider the different ways they spread. I would say it's even somewhat educational (I probably learned more geography playing this game and choosing countries to infect than I did in high school!). I am currently stuck on fungus and wish there was a way to get hints without actually cheating. Very fun and challenging game ;-)
B0039ZF8D2|2.0|This wasn't ordered and wasn't charged for by amazon. I don't get it, but if they ever want it back it's on the shelf not being listened to.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book helped me get perspective not just for my romantic relationship, but also for all my relationships, and for my own communication style.  It's easy to read, and has great quizes and references that you can go back to. It's been a great help for me!
0060557818|5.0|REVIEWED: Neverwhere<br />WRITTEN BY: Neil Gaiman<br />PUBLISHED: 2003 (first published as a miniseries script, 1996)<br /><br />It's really been a long time since I've read a dark fantasy book as absorbing as NEVERWHERE by Neil Gaiman. Suffice it to say, this novel was fascinating, exciting, funny, scary, and overall simply brilliant.<br /><br />Whatever happens to the \\"people who fall between the cracks in society,\\" The homeless, the runaways, the forgottens? They literally fall into another \\"mirrored\\" world below, composed beneath the sewers of London and built with the magic and lost technology that is forgotten today. In \\"London Below\\" entire villages may have fallen through the world and people from all walks of life converge, in a world of shadows, conspiracy, monsters, angels, and crime.<br /><br />Gaiman's style of writing seems so effortless and natural. It's very warm and conversational, as if he were telling the story to you in person while sitting at a county pub with a couple pints of suds. It's smart and entertaining and satisfying. Gaiman has a talent for world building, and there are a host of background characters who are all just as fascinating as the main characters. This book has been made into a T.V. Series for both BBC and again for A&E and a comic series through DC Comics, so it's really gotten around.<br /><br />Highly recommended for lovers of adventure, dark fantasy, and light horror.<br /><br />Five out of Five stars
B004LWZWGK|3.0|...but I can think of a few better ones. It was not as exciting or as interesting as I had hoped it might be. Ah well. You win some you lose some.
0307476464|4.0|1Q 84 is meant to be read slowly. The translation is idiomatic and precise, and there are only a handful of main characters.  Although the book is Eastern in flavor, Western cultural references pop up frequently.  Reality combines with fantasy and makes for a book that is both a page turner and a quiet reflection on many topics. It invaded my dreams. Ho Ho said the keeper of the beat.
B005MYEPXC|4.0|I am not normally an Owen Wilson fan, but this movie may change my mind. I loved the views of Paris and am going to start plotting a trip there soon! I enjoyed the implausible premise and, of course, the inimitable Kathy Bates. This is now one of my favorite Woody Allen movies, I must say.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Great movies, great entertainment and great stories. Like only Star Trek can give us. Star Trek gives us a vision of what we could acomplish as a species if we work together.
B004JK61K0|5.0|K-9 is far better than the email client that comes loaded on the KF HD.  Email accounts can be quickly and easily added or removed.  No problems with the app on my Kindle Fire HD.  I recommend this app to anyone looking for a solid and well-behaved email app.

067960085X|2.0|Truman Capote’s Breakfast at Tiffany‘s disappointed me. I can’t even say it’s bad because this short novel is too trivial and meaningless to rise to the level of badness. I have absolutely no idea what possessed the author to explore one of the most tired old plots in the history of humanity as late as 1958. Novels narrated by males who are puzzled and attracted / repulsed by a prostitute abound. What is the point of writing yet another one if you can't contribute anything new to the subject?<br /><br />I understand, of course, that nobody is likely to invent a new plot these days. But you have got to bring something new even to the most exploited old theme. Capote doesn’t manage to do that, however. He rewrites Abb&eacute; Pr&eacute;vost, Kuprin, Zola et al. but his incapacity to rise to their level either artistically or ideologically makes Breakfast at Tiffany‘s nothing but a sad, pale parody.<br /><br />The book I purchased also contained three short stories, so I decided to read them in order to give Capote a chance to redeem himself in my eyes. And what do you think? The very first story yet again discussed female prostitution in the same saccharine, cloying way as the short novel. I don’t know what made Capote, a gay man, so obsessed with female prostitution but this fixation definitely detracts from the quality of his writing.

0425263908|3.0|That is a completely rhetorical question...but reading this book makes me wonder if this isn't just a watered down copycat of FSOG...there was much less plot, very little character development compared to FSOG...I bought this book because I wanted more of the same and while it is a page turner and the sex scenes are hot, it lacks the depth of FSOG.  I have read reviews of 50 that pointed out it was her first novel and therefore lacked literal experience, but after reading this book I would have guessed the same for this author.
B000002H6C|5.0|This was released just after Cliff Burton died. It is the first album with Jason Newsted. It is a seriously hard album. One of the best ones in my opinion. This one is seriously meant to be played LOUD.

B00915G6WQ|5.0|My son introduced my wife and I to Dexter with a Christmas present of the first two seasons on DVD a couple of years ago.  Up till then I only recall hearing about the series from the nominations it received and won for various awards.  To say we were blown away by the series is an understatement.  To me this is one of the most original shows ever produced for TV.  The premise is genius - a serial killer hunting other killers.  Try to think of another TV show with a truly original idea.  It's all pretty much been done to death for most formats.  Same old same old.<br /><br />The ensemble cast on Dexter is superb - one and all.  Michael C. Hall is simply amazing and continues to evolve season over season as does Jennifer Carpenter.  Unlike some other who have said they tired of the show during certain seasons I have never lost interest and don't think I ever would.  But, sadly, that is not to be tested as season 8 will be the final for the series. I will miss it immensely but understand the desire by Showtime and the producers to take the show out on a high note.<br /><br />So, season 7?  A great year for the series. It picks up right where season 6 ends - with Deb discovering Dexter is not who she thought he was.  Great villains in this season with two parallel story lines leading up to an surprise climax.  I anxiously await season 8 yet dread what the series finale might hold for Dexter and Deb.  We'll know soon as the final season begins 6/30/13.<br /><br />As others have noted, you should watch this series from the beginning to truly understand and appreciate it.  In fact, I have just gone through seasons 1-6 again and found them as enjoyable as the first time I watched them.  Jumping into the series in the middle would be pretty confusing and I think other reviewers have said as much.<br /><br />Summary - this is a truly fantastic series.  I'm totally hooked and I think you will be too.  Enjoy!

B000007491|5.0|I've often heard that this CD is hard to find; I guess I should feel fortunate that I've had my copy for 21 years now, and will admit that it hasn't been played in several years. Tonight, I decided to play it again, and I will say that I appreciate this CD more than ever, because it's just plain different. I think it's a very strong debut album, which is in contrast to most bands' debut offerings. This album is pure progressive rock, with abundant organs, harmonic vocals, and some songs have a hint of Yes and King Crimson in them. Sometimes it feels like I'm listening to early Yes, which is good, because they're a great band too. This album starts out in unusual fashion, with a chorus from the song, SURELY, which is actually the last track on the CD. A preview of coming attractions? Anyway, the next song is the catchy IT'S A LONG ROAD, highlighted by the organ and a nice steady beat. Another excellent track is the melodic WORDS UNSPOKEN, as is SURELY. For a unique psychadelic piece, check out AUBADE. Overall, this is good progressive rock that's bold and real. Not too many people know about this debut album, because it's been unavailable for many years, and deserves to be moved to the forefront because it's simply good. 8.5/10
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Love the series! Just bought Prometheus! Never been disappointed in any movie! A must have for the true fan! Ripley is the best!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book was another Nicholas Sparks hit!  But more importantly I am now a kindle ebook convert!  It was a great experience to buy, download and read on my iPad.  I also read a few chapters on my iPod touch and the kindle app kept track for me at all times!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great mind exercise and fun to boot ! I enjoy  these and it relaxes me. go figure ! Great Game !
B0029LHW4U|4.0|*All Secrets Known - Good song.  Kind of sludgy, unlike the hard hitting openers of 'We Die Young' and 'Them Bones' from the past.  Definitely sounds like AIC and made me feel at ease of what was to follow.  3/5<br />*Check My Brain - Great single and willing to throw this in my favorite AIC songs.  Great opening riff and chorus.  Most catchy song on the album.  4/5<br />*Last of My Kind - First song I felt that utilized DuVall.  It had good sludgy AIC and a strong edgy chorus.  Definitely a catchy tune.  4/5<br />*Your Decision - Strong ballad and in my opinion one of the best of the album.  Solid chorus and guitars.  5/5<br />*A Looking in View - Good choice as first single.  Definitely had the grungy feel and chorus sounds like AIC.  I generally find myself skeptical at first, but then by the chorus I'm sucked in.  3/5<br />*When the Sun Rose - My least favorite on the album.  Its not a bad song, but just doesn't hold my interest.  It sounds like a B-Side from the Jar of Flies album.  It does grow on me by the end of the song though.  2/5<br />*Acid Bubble - No denying this is AIC.  From a guitar/riff standpoint this is one of the best for the nostalgic AIC fans.  4/5<br />*Lesson Learned - Probably my favorite track on the album.  Hard hitting, very catchy.  Chorus sounds great when they harmonize. 5/5<br />*Take Her Out - This seems like many people's least favorite song, I kind of liked it.  Solid chorus, get to be a bit repetitive.  I'd take this one over some of the other songs though. 3/5<br />*Private Hell - Nice chorus, reminds me of something off of Jars of Flies.  Song had to grow on me.  I didn't really care for at first. 3/5<br />*Black Gives Way to Blue - Nice ballad.  Kind of short and is what it is.  Good way to close the album.  3/5<br /><br />39/55 = 3.5 out of 5<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Sounds like AIC and did nothing to diminish the legacy.<br />*I liked a lot of the songs and 3 years later still go back to the album which is the ultimate test for me.<br />*I think the potential is there for a strong follow-up.  \\"Hollow\\" has me excited.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*DuVall is under used.  The best aspects of the album are when him and Cantrell harmonize together.  I feel it could've been done more.<br />*A lot of the songs had to grow on me or start kind of slow to get into the chorus.<br />*No real \\"hard hitting\\" songs in the mold of 'We Die Young' 'Them Bones' 'Again'.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Definitely a heart felt album that almost felt like a band grieving, which is totally understandable.  There are a lot of good, if not great, songs here.  My final calculations have this at 3.5 out of 5 which I think is a fair grade.  It won't be my favorite AIC album (Dirt), but there is enough good songs that it holds up well in their catalog of work.  Nobody is going to forget the Layne Staley AIC, nor should they, but anybody with an open mind should be satisfied with this AIC album and the future of the band.

B008JMKN4Y|2.0|It's a college setting with a flaky girl who can't make up her mind and falls in love with a womenizing, overbearing, stalkerish bad-boy. Really the man is psycho and she's a dishrag.

B003JJA59K|1.0|I couldn't sleep that night after watching this movie.  The cannabalism disturbed me so much, especially because it dealt with a child.  Terrible terrible  terrible.  I wish I'd never watched it.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|I feel like I just found this artist.  Heard one of these songs on the radio and became curious.  Looked on Amazon and found this cd......it exceeds my expectation.  I will be watching to see what he puts out next, I like it that much!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is such a unique series.  I absolutely loved all three books.  Collins is a great writer who gives younger generations things to really think about in their own government and society.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I wasn't impressed with this book. To mildly put why, too kinky. The mystery behind why Mr. Grey is the way he is is what kept me going. At the end of the book I'm still curious and I will continue to be curious.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is by far the best book in the series.  The author is not afraid to &#34;go there.&#34;  His characters and plot are intriguing with twists and turns and bawdy jests around every corner.

B005I4JG80|5.0|I love this book because it is not a parenting manual, it is a way of life.  I don't have kids yet, but I am a nanny in NYC and this book was so relevant for me.  I recommend it for anyone invested in a child's life.

B005OKTPKC|4.0|Every so often you get a book that you look forward to picking up at the end of a day. This is one of them. Super story line, interesting mix of characters and pace that grabs your attention. Hard to put down.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is so good.  I love the story lines they take.  I love that they follow the lives of the Lord and his family AND the servants.  I love the English humor and how they have such good manners even when saying something that is not so nice.  It is a wonderful show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It going slow sometimes I just go this device last week I hope you can fix it soon because I really like this game_rosie
B001I0T92Q|5.0|This thing is pretty awesome, I bought it with a 16gb microSD card. I use it mostly for music and as such I've had it in and out of my PSP/PC plenty of times and it's still holding up. I have had no problems so far and now if I want to expand I can buy another 16gb card and have 32gb much cheaper than if I bought a 32gb pro duo stick. I use my PSP for music daily for at least 2 hours and I've had no problems yet.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Amazing! Full of action and made me almost cry.Hope Rick Riordan makes many more in the heroes of Olympus series.
1616550414|5.0|This book is amazing. The timeline has info I never knew. I love the beautiful artwork and it even has a manga story in the back.. This should be a part of every Legend of Zelda fan's collection.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Even soapier than ever, but they always earn or almost earn the plot twists.<br /><br />Six more words required. Two more
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the most addicting game ever.a. w e s o m e. Great game worth the money. Great gane
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Clancy and his associate have turned out a fine thriller that hits on many contemporary themes. Well worth the read but the Kindle edition is overpriced that costs one star.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I've loved Pac-Man since I was a kid. I really like this game, but it's really hard to maneuver Pac-Man around the maze.
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|Not that Nick Cave has ever really produced anything \\"terrible\\" but the term \\"this is the best thing he's done in a while\\" definitely is an appropriate statement.  You can actually listen to this on NPR's website for free, but less than halfway through I didn't hesitate to purchase the hard copy version of this, it's simply a fantastic album.<br /><br />It's the type of record you look forward to listening to on your sound system after a long day, the type of thing you'd listen to while driving through the Nevada desert in the middle of the night, the type of thing that you'd imagine hearing when discovering a new woman for the first time.<br /><br />From front to end, the record is consistent and conceptually intact.  The overall mood of this record is somber, haunting, yet completely alive.  Lyrically, he is on par with his overall theme of records past yet it seems like fresh and raw emotion that digs into corners of his soul not yet tapped.  Though he makes many references to modern culture, it still feels timeless and will certainly stand the test of time.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love Bubble Mania!!! I really enjoy this game because I love a game that challenges me to figure out exactly which bubbles to pop in order to win!!!!
B0025KVLT2|4.0|These are all their classic early songs, music that propelled The Beatles to the top of the pioneer rock-n-rollers.<br />The last track on this CD is supposed to be a documentary on The Beatles, but after trying it on four different PC's and MAC's, I realized that it's not there, or it's defective.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I chose this book as I thought it would be a thriller/mystery. I was disappointed - just a teen romance full of flowery prose and weak on plot.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Loved this movie.. My wife and I liked the the entire series. This was a very fitting end. I do hope they don't make more. To many times a good series will get beat to death. Leave  this one on a high.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I will have to read this book again and again. . .it is that well written.  This book is sad beyond belief, had me laughing out loud, and falling in love with each very real character.  A \\"Misremembered\\" man indeed!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I like it because it has so many stages and it is a challenge for myself and my grandkids they. love it too they say it is a lot like mario
B001GXF2YY|4.0|Great story that never really had any dull spots. Good combination of technical stuff and personal/emotional story. I look forward to the next Bosch story.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this box set. I bought it in a local record store rather than Amazon due to the mixed reviews on the quality. I think one of the reasons for the many complaints is that buyers are expecting pristine sound and quiet because we have become so accustomed to CD's. You are putting a needle in a groove. It will never be perfect. Of course skips, scratches, and loud surface noise is unacceptable, but there will be an occasional minor pop here and there. It's just the nature of the medium. I was fortunate enough to only have one problem and that was Let It Be. The title song was extremely noisy and Two of Us skipped right near the end. I had it replaced where I bought the box set, and that one plays fine. The rest of the set is fantastic. The book is phenomenal. No, there is not a lot of new information, but the photographs are interesting and the quality is top notch.<br />My personal opinion on vinyl vs. CD sound of these remasters is there is a warmth to the vinyl that you do not get with the CD. However, i feel the superior  dynamic range of CD's is evident  when played loud. So, when I am listening to the Beatles at normal or lower volumes, I prefer the vinyl. If I am cranking it up on a Saturday, I prefer the remastered CDs.<br />For those of us Beatles fans growing up buying albums, this is a must purchase. If I had to pick the best sounding vinyl, it would be Abbey Road hands down. So, if you are not ready to invest the big bucks in this and only can buy one, get Abbey Road. Wow.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was an awesome book but I with it told more I still recommended this book you might like it
B009IEXKXI|5.0|By using an imaginative combination of wit, humor and, science detail, Andy Weir brings to life the struggle for survival of an astronaut alone on a hostile planet. This is a real page turner! If Arthur Clarke was still with us he might have written a story not unlike this one!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely am in love with this series!  I can't wait till next year to watch Season 4, wonder what surprises we will see!
B00846F1YW|5.0|I enjoy playing this with my 7 year old grandson. I really like that there are different types of challenges in the game. Great free app of the day. Thanks

B000Q9ISSQ|4.0|Bill always provides an entertaining view of history and enjoyed is view of Australia.  I particularly loved the Australian devil-may-care attitude towards its dangerous animals.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|On of my favorite travel sites in the past on home computer  use all the time this App is very very  user friendly and that is a BIG PLUS when in a strange city...Quick simple access to information on everything you could want....and accurate too! Go for it!!
B002Q4TKAO|5.0|If you always wondered what if the killers concert played in my country/state/city buy this DVD. This band never disappoints both in album or live. Great set list. Awesome camera angles both on stage and towards the crowd. The energy never slowed down. It maybe years old, but this DVD is timeless.
B007SGM084|5.0|5 out of 5! Fell in LOVE with Christian Grey :)<br />I feel like I will be reading every James novel.
B003ZJ70W4|2.0|CD has some scratches and stop playing at some parts, but for the price I pay for it, ill keep it.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Great freakin series. Don't really know what to compare it to because its pretty original but I watch this every few months for a good laugh.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love the colors, the matching, can spend hours working the puzzles and screens. It's 5 star game for many hours.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|not as good as the band of brothers series, but still good. important to know the pacific side of the war, which is easily the least known theater of war.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I am not a novice at playing piano - I have played all my life since the age of 7 and am now over 60.  This one just does not<br />get it,  so I usually end up playing my own version of songs I like to play which is way better fun!  Too slow and playing does not match the keys or melody of the songs.....
B00006CXSS|5.0|this is by far the most incredible series on WWII. The fact that it follows an actual company and has interviews with real survivors from that company only makes it that much more powerful. i couldn't say enough about how fantastic this series is and about how emotional it can be when you realize that these are true stories being told.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This bingo game is OK and I like matching up the numbers with the caller,  but I hardly ever get to win!  :(
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I think that Downton Abbey just gets better and better each season. I enjoy this season as much as the other.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|My favorite book of all time. This is a must read for everyone! Elizabeth Bennet is one of my favorite characters in literature ever!
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|this product underpromised but overdelivered.  great folder and filing system that makes searching items easy. well-crafted product.  i  recommend it.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game play is fine, just like with any game.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but the cards are too big, they take up the entire screen with no space between.  If the cards were 'normal' sized or spread out a little, I would enjoy playing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an easy to use & graphically attractive version of the classic card game.  I love it - I hope you do, too.
B00005JM02|5.0|I love this movie,and now so does my only daughter,wal-mart didn't have it.I dont understand why i must have a
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a very good game. Interesting story without being too wordy.  Lots of HO scenes.  Pinch and drag to enlarge.  Doesn't penalize you for touching the screen to move it, as some games do. Puzzles make you work but don't frustrate.  I play a lot of this type of game. This is one of the best
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. I have long been fascinated with the crazy state that is North Korea. This book gave a great insight into what it is like
B007REV4T8|3.0|This is a very classy, well done Bond film... a worthy follow-up to Casino Royale. But I think they can make the story (stick with Bond) and action scenes more compelling.<br /><br />The opening sequence... good but make the action more intense by really keeping us with Bond and make the fight on the train a great fist fight (that happens to be on a moving train). Laziness in action creeps in when they let the set pieces carry the action. Make the motorcycles do more on the Istanbul rooftops, in progressive suspenseful steps, not just race a top them, unless you make the speeds increase so intensely you're waiting for them to fly off, etc.<br /><br />Adele's song... is just ok, though I like the fact a Bond song is now on the radio. But it comes off amateurish or mediocre when she hits the down notes of &quot;we will stand ta'ulllllllll...&quot; Plus I prefer the exhilarating title sequence and song for Casino Royale that sends you off into the movie excitedly.<br /><br />M... great plot line, but at the end of the day, you really want to see Bond's relationship with women his age, that's more compelling. But I guess we won't have to worry about that fact anymore.<br /><br />Pacing... there's a long slow stretch in Shanghai and Macau. It's teetering on boring. When Bond is creeping towards the assassin in the Shanghai building, edit. Yes, the cinematography is beautiful, but we can still see it when the sequence is trimmed down. The shaving scene with Moneypenny is really the moment to speed up the pace. I know it's suppose to be seductive, but it's another slow scene after a whole slow paced sequence. Then comes more of the same (but better) in the casino with the conversation with Severine. Their dialogue relies on some overused Bondian dialogue too, but it's so well executed it glazes over that fact.<br /><br />Villain... Need more with a villain crossing paths and interacting with Bond, learning things about each other and the villain's plan until they collide in the end. When Bardem escapes, his whole plan was to execute M at a government hearing in public display... good, but that could've been bigger and put London in peril somehow with Bond needing to do something more to save everyone.<br /><br />Skyfall... entering Scotland is a tonal shift and I do get less interested when this part of the film is reached. The climax of never-ending explosions and the destroying of the car were pretty yawn inducing. Again, you need suspenseful progression, directly to Bond doing something, not just wiring a (bomb) and things blowing up. Maybe more on the frozen moors or Bond in the house with Bardem in it, scary or intense... something.<br /><br />Mendes is a director of plays and he tends to set up his 'big moments' for actor's soliloquies instead compelling sequences that need tofocus on Bond being awesome and taking down scum bags in entertaining ways. All that said, this is a good film and very entertaining!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show so much! on to season 3!!!!! I'm soooooo excited. :) I hope it just gets better from here.

B001ANYDAO|5.0|Mr Gladwell's intelligence is evident on every page: and he shares it so well! There are so many interesting facts. I just loved the way he tied them together to explain things that we just take for granted. I generally read fiction, but I occasionally make exceptions. I am so glad I did, as I thoroughly enjoyed every word in this book.
B0000048V8|5.0|A delightful video that my grandchildren love. I bougjt this one as a gift for a friend. She loved it too
B000VIHMS4|5.0|I have twin toddler boys who run all over so I wanted something sturdy and warm for our sloppy winters. I was concerned they'd be too stiff, but ordered them anyway based on other reviews and because they're offered in wide sizes (not common for toddler boots-trust me I've looked ALL OVER). By the time Ifound them, the only color available in their sizes was black, which has actually worked out well.  My boys LOVE these and don't want to wear anything else, so next fall, assuming they'll have outgrown these, this is all I'm buying.  In addition to all the wonderful qualities everyone else has cited, I am so grateful they make the toddler boots in wide sizes too.  One boy is actually an extra wide, so I ordered a half size up-the fit is great, and more to the point, he must be comfortable because he demands I put them on.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|wonderful concert, like being there yourself.  love their voices and music.  i hope they keep making beautiful music.<br />hope to see in person someday.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid. Even saw it in theaters. I bought this because I was pregnant and had to have it for my children to watch one day. Also has great special features that are actually interesting to watch. Wonderful movie.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|Really great graphics and I truly enjoyed it until the rooms disappeared leaving the \\"hidden\\" objects totally exposed. This is why I prefer free games. When they malfunction you haven't lost anything. I lost on this.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|please mind the bad ratings please. I don't know about the other people who put bad ratings on here but this is the best game ever made for android-kindle or other devices. a must have for your devices.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|My first Follett book was &#34;Pillars&#34;, been a fan ever sense. Still amazed the way his writing allows - no forces you into a relationship with the leads in the story.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|He's an interesting person and caters to my short attention span with lots of information that I love reading about but in reality will never use, like how to hunt, gut and cook a deer, though I'm sure it'd add inches to my penis I'll pass on that experience and leave the skinning of animals to world of Warcraft enthusiast.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this for all my employees and it was real handy and everyone loved it. Small and compact, I would recommend this sharpener to everyone.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|ok, so I really liked this book there are some parts that I'm thinking \\"really really people\\" but Travis was so in love with Abby, but it was kind of crazy at times. I still liked it that I pre-order the Walking Disaster its his side of the stroy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|AMAZING!!! Every chapter is an OMG moment. Would recommend this book, and have to many people. Enjoyed every minute of it

B00APUQH0W|4.0|Great movie. Clint always make a movie interesting.  It is a movie the whole family can watch.  It a movie about Clint getting old
B008SVS0K0|5.0|I have been waiting for this for ages and couldn't have been more terrified when I ordered it. I was so afraid that they would have moved away from everything that I loved about Billy Talents I, II, & III that I almost didn't listen to it. But lo and behold, they haven't changed a bit. They still have amazing energy with songs like &#34;Surprise Surprise&#34; and [my personal favorite] &#34;Man Alive&#34; but still can get semi-heavy songs with great sound like &#34;Stand Up and Run&#34; and &#34;Swallowed Up By The Ocean&#34;. I love every song off of this album and cannot wait to see what they do in the future.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|The clock alarm works okay if set to go off when you are still working on the tablet/computer!!  But if the tablet goes into sleep mode, or shuts off automatically (as most tablets do, I guess) the alarm does not go off.  I tried several times to get it to work, but had no luck.  I could be failing to hit the right button or something, but have not figured out yet what to do to make it work.

B00AE2J5HI|4.0|this movie was a fascinating period adventure, beautifully acted and a suprisingly involving drama.  I was not expecting to enjoy is as much as i did.
1609611543|5.0|Today's hybridized wheat is a far cry from the wheat of a hundred years ago, and the human body is not prepared to handle it.  Besides, wheat is in just about all processed food, so by eliminating wheat you will also be eliminating processed foods, which are notoriously bad for health.  (If it's good for shelf life, it's not good for human life.)  Since eliminating wheat from my diet, I have effortlessly lost weight, increased my energy, and eliminated dermatitis and digestive issues.  I just declared, \\"I'm having a wheat-free May!\\" and stuck to it.  It makes stare-downs with chocolate chip cookies much easier when you have pre-decided that you're not having any wheat this month.  I think eliminating wheat may be the single best thing you can do for your health (along with getting enough sleep) that will give you the most noticeable results the fastest.  Try it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book that you can't put down. Download next before you even finish this one.. definitely page turner and builds excitement for last book.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great! Way better than angry birds! Definitely worth the purchase, highly recommended. Will check out other games by this publisher.
B0047BXR1W|5.0|In my youth, my favorite dog movie that made ME cry was [[ASIN:B00005RRG4 Old Yeller (Vault Disney Collection)]].<br />There was a very long wait, then MY DOG SKIP came out in 2000. Ten years later, a-n-o-t-h-e-r<br />movie based on a true story (and a Japanese movie)) about a dog that, daily, waited nine years<br />for his master at a rural train station.<br />I cannot decide which I like better:<br />[[ASIN:B0031RAOW8 Hachi: A Dog's Tale [Blu-ray]]] -- also stars Richard Gere.<br />or<br />[[ASIN:B0047BXR1W My Dog Skip [Blu-ray]]] ------------ also stars Kevin Bacon & Frankie Muniz.<br /><br />All THREE of these movies made me cry like a little girl that just dropped her favorite doll in<br />a mud puddle.<br /><br />Excellent entertainment! In fact, if these three movies don't make you cry, you aren't HUMAN.<br /><br />The prices of all three of these films are VERY good right now.<br /><br />I have always prefered CATS, but, if you DON'T cry at the endings of these movies --- you just<br />DON'T have a heart!<br /><br />Add them to your collection.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed reading this book. I didn't  have the pleasure of reading this in school but now that I have I'll recommend it to everyone.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this game! Easy, fun &amp; quick to play a game. Good for kids all the way up to an elderly person. I like the fact you can turn off the sound &amp; timers so you can just play.
0517543052|5.0|This is a great book for self-exploration, meditation, yogic ideas, and just plain fun. The illustrations are entertaining, sometimes profound, sometimes hilarious; the text is psychedelic and intriguing. If you're into this sort of stuff you're going to love it, and it makes a great coffee table book or something to pass around with friends.

B000V63A4G|3.0|I've loved John Sykes since he was in Whitesnake! This is a great CD. The quality isn't as good,since it's older. But it's a great addition to your rock collection!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app has a wide range of sounds that work really well for me and now that you can combine sounds,  I like it even better.  Rain, fire,  train tracks, brown noise,  are all favorites of mine.  Recently I had an opportunity to try the app out in a motel with kids running and screaming in the halls - thanks to rain storm/pine forest at night/violet noise I slept like a baby.
B0094ZJK4O|3.0|I was excited to get the new Richie Sambora CD! He rocks and this is enjoyable, but not as fun as he is with Bon Jovi! Still, a good addition to your rock collection.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|The story of this film is amazing and gets you into thinking about the society we live in and how we are contributing to it with our own actions.  Just to see how one family changed the life of one boy by embracing him and considering him one of their own is just hard to believe it was a true story.  Recommend that you watch it with your family.

B006FK7SZ4|1.0|This app looks good, but when I tried to use it, it needed to send me an email to activate my account, but after repeated attempts and 3 diffferent email accounts, I was not able to access the app.  Maybe it works better online, but it seemed to me they are just interested in getting email addresses.  Do not download this app!!

0345536886|4.0|wasn't my favorite book of John Grisham,  but I still love his style of writing and the gist of his stories.  And I will still buy his next book.
B004JHYRP4|4.0|This is a very interesting book but I am not sure that the story is equal to the concept.  It is really 3 stories - one about scientific discovery, one about aliens in a dim universe and one about moon colonists.  All three have their merit but I enjoyed the alien description the most.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|This is 90 minutes I will never get back<br />unfortunately<br />Usually I love these types of Martial Arts films; especially by Q. Tarantino.<br />But the storyline/s were hard to follow--I don't feel like I ever knew totally what was happening.<br />And the special effects weren't always that &#34;special.&#34;<br />Lucy Liu was great, as was Russel Crowe; they are usually good in anything.<br />Overall this movie was just disappointing, and you're not missing out if you pass over it for something else.
0812550706|5.0|Ender is the third child at a time when that is very unusual. In this near-future, children are bred with the hope that they will be military geniuses who can help the Earth defeat a species that has proved to be a formidable enemy. Ender's older brother is a genius but also a sadist; his sister is a genius, but too gentle to be of military use. So the family is told to bear a third child, Ender, a boy who is picked on by bullies and terrorized by his brother. But is there something there that might be useful? Like other kids, he is monitored and evaluated, and the book begins when Ender is approached by a military assessor. This will determine his future.<br /><br />The story of what happens to Ender is fascinating and well-written. There is violence and cruelty and bullying here, but also intelligence, problem solving, heroics, and a thought provoking ending.<br /><br />First of a series of four books.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A fantastic book, and a must-read for anyone who is an introvert or has an introverted side.  Dispels many of the common myths regarding extroversion and exposes our society's obsession with gregariousness.  The author establishes that introverts are essential to productivity in modern society, and provides several examples from Wall Street and successful businesses.<br /><br />Most claims made in the book are supported by references to academic research, and the author ties this existing body of research together nicely to form a coherent message without coming across as dry.  My only criticism is that the author could have done without the numerous biblical references, which I found distracting and take away from the scientific feel of the book.<br /><br />I also highly recommend the book to managers and educators, as the insight offered in the book is useful for gaining critical insight into others behaviors and understanding how to work with and support individuals of all personality types.  Specific advice is offered to this particular audience towards the end of the book, in addition to a section for parents with introverted children.<br /><br />Insightful and well constructed, this book has an immense capacity to change your outlook on introversion.

B00006CXSS|5.0|THERE BE NOTHING I COULD SAY WHICH WOULD APPROACH THE LAVISH AND DESERVED ACCLAIM WHICH &#34;BAND of BROTHERS&#34; HAS EARNED SINCE IT APPEARED, FIRST, IN THE BOOK, AND THEN IN THIS SUPERLATIVE FILM VERSION.  IF ONE WONDERS WHAT TRUE COURAGE, LEADERSHIP AND SELF-ABNEGATION IS, UNDER THE MOST EXTREMES OF PRESSURE WHICH CONSTANTLY SEEMS VIRTUALLY INESCAPABLE, VIEWING THIS FILM WILL BRING YOU INTO THE PROVERBIAL BALLPARK BUT NEVER WOULD YOU  BE 'ON THE FIELD'.<br /><br />HOW DOES ONE CONFRONT SUCH DANGER AND GRUESOME REALITY WHILE MAINTAINING FAITH IN ANOTHER'S LEADERSHIP AS THEIR ONLY RAZOR-THIN HOPE OF SURVIVING THAT WHICH THREATENS NAUGHT BUT HOPELESSNESS AND THREATENS ALL WITH LIFE-ENDING EXPERIENCES.  THE SUSTAINED COURAGE OF MEN IN COMBAT WHEN THE PROSPECT OF SUCCESS APPEARS SO IMPROBABLE IS, IN ITSELF, PERFORMANCE ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY.... THE SUBSTANCE COMPRISING HEROES.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE SUCH AS DEPICTED IN THIS MOVIE IS REPLICATED COUNTLESS TIMES DURING WAR BUT SIMPLY NOT SO DOCUMENTED AS EXPLICITLY, IF AT ALL.  ALL ARE HEROES WHO PUT THEIR VERY LIVES &#34;ON THE LINE&#34; ESPECIALLY UNDER SUCH SEEMINGLY HOPELESS CIRCUMSTANCES.<br /><br />REMEMBER, EACH FRAME OF THIS MOVIE AND THE EXPERIENCES DEPICTED SO VIVIDLY ARE CONSIGNED FOREVER INTO THE PSYCHE OF THE MEN PORTRAYED AND RESIDING IN THE SUBCONSCIOUS, THEY 'STIR AND STEW' FOREVER MORE AND EMERGE IN DISGUISE TO PLAGUE THOSE IN WHOM SUCH RESIDE.<br /><br />SINCE THE LIVES OF VIRTUALLY ANYONE BORN AFTER 1940 HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO OVER A HALF-CENTURY OF  GHASTLY, BRUTAL AND SAVAGE WARS, VIEWING THIS MOVIE BY FOLKS WHO WILL BE EXPOSED TO THE BRUTALITY AND INHUMANITY OF WAR ONLY VICARIOUSLY, IT WOULD BE WELL WORTH THE EXPERIENCE OF VIEWING &#34;BAND of BROTHERS AS IT MAY WELL EVOKE UNDERSTANDING AND EMPATHY FOR THOSE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE LIVED THROUGH AND SURVIVED WHAT YOU ARE VIEWING.  THIS MOVIE IS AS CLOSE TO REALITY AS ONE CAN GET.<br /><br />JIM
B00B8PQC5S|3.0|I'm writing this as a survival guide for those brave enough to watch. #1, BEWARE the Asian films. All but 2 were beyond perverse and Z has warped my mind forever. #2, All films in Spanish were very good. V, O, W and X were BRILLIANT. P was disturbing but poignant. Overall it was worth it but BEWARE of animal cruelty, pedophila, and EXTREME KINK. You've been warned!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I had to keep reading.....finished it in one day.<br />Very good.<br />Perhaps a bit predictable in certain aspects but entertaining
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A plot summary can't do this book justice.  The characters are wonderful, the dialog and first-person writing is funny and smart (if maybe a little too well-read and insightful to be completely believable coming from teenagers, but I'm willing to suspend belief because it's that entertaining), and the story is beautiful.  Definitely a must read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was thrilling from beginning to end!  You will not regret buying this book. It hooks you in and leaves you enthralled.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|First problem.  This will not run with another program running.<br /><br />Second problem.  The sounds are not the highest quality, clearest sounds available.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is nice to be able to layer the sounds as you want them.  It also offers energizing rather than relaxing sounds, which is a nice option.  I don't think the Fire gets as many sounds as are advertised, though.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved it up until the end, but the ending left me disappointed.  The book was highly recommended to me so maybe I was expecting too much.
B004EFYZ1C|2.0|Not sure why I thought I wanted it and after I downloaded it I decided it was just waste of space.  Sorry.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It is the conclusion of the Hunger Games Series.  Futuristic Look of a society that evolves into elitism and forced labor camps.  The effects of propaganda and lies told to influence public opinion and sacrificing children to discourage rebellion.  Suzanne Collins depicts the use of perverse technology to terrorize and subjugate the inhabitants of the land ruled by President Snow.  This book is wonderfully creative and enthralling.  You can't put it down.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|If you phone has the space I highly recommend this app.  Easy to use and lots of free books to choose from.

B009MF5BXK|4.0|You have Sly, Arnold, Bruce, and Jason, and LOTS of ACTION, and Crewes, Couture, and Van Damme, and LOTS of ACTION, and Chuck, Li, and Lundgren, and lots of bad dialogue, and I loved every bit of it. This was a movie of GUYS BEING GUYS, good guys fighting bad guys, things blowing up... and the only one that was missing in this movie was Clint!

B00821OX98|5.0|I love this show, it is great. I DVR as any shows as I can watch & have missed this show. I am so happy I was able to watch it here. I highly recommend it to all and hope it has many more seasons, looking forward to season 3!
B0027Z5DM6|4.0|It has some stupid parts but overall it is a good message not to fast forward your life to the end
B008NW67E0|5.0|I have been listening to this new CD<br />as I clean house and do laundry.<br />I just love IT! Irish music...yummy!
B005NKGEP2|5.0|I was hooked from the beginning of this book. In what seems a mundane move to Luxembourg, Kate and Dexter are embroiled in a tangle of intrigue...or are they? Are their new expat friends what they seem, just another group of bored housewives and busy husbands? You really don't know until the last few pages what is really going on. It's a well-written, fast-paced thriller that you will find hard to put down. And good luck to those who can guess what's really going on!!!
B0097BTSSS|5.0|Ellie Goulding manages to improve on her last album by delivering powerful beats and darker tones.<br /><br />The album itself is amazing; it delivers a wide range of styles from somber piano-based tracks all the way to hard-stomping beats and dubstep inspired tracks. Compared to her last album &#34;Lights&#34;, &#34;Halcyon&#34; definitely has a darker tone; this is seen not only in the music, but also Ellie's voice and delivery.<br /><br />The LP was very good quality. This album was perfect for an LP format because there is no need to skip tracks... the whole album can be played straight through as each track is amazing and unique.<br /><br />Overall, this album is definitely recommended for those who enjoyed her last album. If you are looking to check out Ellie Goulding, I would definitely go for this album first (if not the LP, just the CD)!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|With gorgeous period sets, a wide range of characters, a lot of feel good moments and a few very sad circumstances, season three of Downton Abbey is still one of the most enjoyable shows on television. When the season opens it's 1920, and the ladies of the house are all wearing updated fashions, Mary and Matthew are finally getting married, Edith is hoping for a romance of her own, Sybil is pregnant and may not make it home from Ireland for the wedding, Mr. Bates is still serving time in prison, and Thomas and O'Brien are no longer plotting evil together--they're now enemies.<br /><br />This DVD divides the show into more segments than the PBS version did, which makes it a little confusing if you're trying to follow American blog postings about each episode, but everything is here, including the Christmas special--so named because it was shown on Christmas day in Britain but isn't set during the Christmas season. Instead of a Yuletide celebration show, the family is off to Scotland, a special treat for people like me who are also fans of Monarch of the Glen.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I gave this a 3 because I really did not like the ending.  The suspense kept going until the end and the whole was twisted enough that I could'nt put the book down.  However, some of the twists were very unrealistic.
B00APJLEGA|4.0|Our three year old loved the monsters because &#34;those are not really mean monsters.&#34;  Hubs and I enjoyed the move as a cute/fun thing... at least we did the first three times.

B003XQM2YU|4.0|Batman, Ironman, Robin Hood.  An unlikely trio? They’re not so different.  To follow a recent revival of Batman (Batman Begins) and the beginning of a series of Ironman films, director Ridley Scott’s Robin Hood conforms to the “beginning” theme.  Batman Begins and Ironman have shown viewers where our super heroes came from, but how did Robin Hood become a sniper with a bow, and why does he steal from the rich to give to the poor? Scott and writers Brian Helgeland, Ethan Reiff, and Cyrus Voris have created an entire film as a Robin Hood “beginning” movie, presenting the story of how Robin Longstride became “Robin Hood”. Scott and the writers, with the help of some excellent acting, do a satisfactory job of making the lengthy, action adventure film into a well plotted “beginning” movie.<br />Hat’s off to the actors, and even more so, to the casting for this film.  Russell Crowe is classic Crowe, a strong and inspiring leader with predictable excellence when the weapons are out and equally expected quotable statements and speeches.  The Robin Crowe plays is not as classic. The plot still centers around the strong, clever, commander Robin, fighting for rights of all Englishmen.  That is exactly what separates this Robin, less stealing from the rich and more fighting for the poor.  Fighting on the scale of “for all England” allows the film to have its large scale war scenes, which are, as usual in large scale productions such as this, full of the anticipated action with focused shots on Robin, his merry men.  These men who have some development and some depth thanks to the actors that play them face some equally satisfying villains.<br />The antagonists Godfrey the traitor; played by Mark Strong, and, even more so, Prince John; played by Oscar Isaac, sell their roles as villains worth hating.  Strong and Isaac impress, but Cate Blanchett’s Marion Loxley is one to enjoy as well.  Blanchett’s acting is quality, but Marion’s role in the storyis more the surprise. Scott and the writers have made Lady Marion much less ladylike than some versions of Robin Hood prior to Blanchett’s more valiant role.  This Marion triumphs in her effort to aid the people of Nottingham, as opposed to waiting for rescue from her troubles. These villains and heroin make the length of the Robin’s “beginning”.  But, impressive acting isn't all that makes this “beginner” entertaining; the crew behind the cameras does their part with equal skill.<br />The talent of the technical crew creates the full circle production that complements the acting.  The large battles scenes are as predictable as Robin’s skill with a bow and arrow, but the scale, execution, and camera work allow a feeling of immersion into the chaos of war.  The camera work fits the action well with fluid movements and frame changes allowing a real feel to the fighting without the dizzy effect some films produce with rapid and shaky cameras in moving scenes.  The orchestrated pieces are fitting and enriched by the original musical styles of Robins merry men. To complete the unconventional crew are the skillfully played Friar Tuck (Mark Addy) and Little John (Kevin Durand), who bring the adventure and comic relief that helps a viewer endure the lethargic plot.<br />Lethargy is one of the only issues with this film. It takes Robin Longstride an excessive amount of time to become Robin Hood.  The plot flows well, but as a viewer, the first thought after stretching out your sore, well used sitting muscles is “that was long”.  The quality acting and entertainment value of the film is the afterthought.  Unfortunate as that is, the movie’s alternative perspective on the characters we know makes it a worthwhile watch.  Its sloth speed; however, is what separates it from Batman Begins and Ironman, in which the “creation” of the heroes only lasts the first hour or so.. This methodic, two hour twenty minute film resolves where the general image of RobinHood begins.  Be good and comfortable for this one when you sit down to watch.  It’s worth its length.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|This reminds you of the mario brother games. You have this figure that has to jump and get objects ect. I liked it. And it's not totally easy either. There are a few places that it takes a little bit to get through. A fun time waster and entertaining game.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever play by me.I have played it sense I got it. It is beast
B006LSZECO|1.0|It's usually the ending that makes or breaks a book. This book was really great, lots of twists and turns, you had no idea where it was going for a while. It has sooo much potential. I mean, this book could have been a *masterpiece.* People could be raving about this book. But it FAiLed HARD. Epically. The ending is not just disappointing, it's stupid and horrible and pathetic and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. You end up right where you started. Why did I bother? Sooooo disappointed because it had so much potential! Don't bother. You'll be disappointed, too.<br /><br />Try again, Flynn.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I loved this book and I think that to my opinion it was pretty good. So go in read it I know you'll love it as much as

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This album rocks. Plain and simple, almost every song is well written with huge memorable riffs and great hooks. The only issue I have with it is that it borrows from Pink Floyd's The Wall to the point where it almost borders on requiring legal action. To the bands credit, they've openly admitted this..but it still irks me as a musician. The quality of the music is beyond reproach though...when that chorus from The Sharpest Lives kicks in, it's undeniable that this is a great album.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Well I was impressed with the book but at the same time I'm not so sure about it either. Just to say my favorite was dog days out of all. But if your really into these books then I recommended this book for the reader who is obsessed with these books. Have fun reading it! ;)
B002ZG980U|5.0|I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE WITH A LOT OF TWISTS AND TURNS. HAD TO WATCH IT TWICE TO CATCH EVRY THING THAT WAS GOING ON.LOVED THE VISUALS. THE END REALLY MADE YOU WONDER WHAT WAS REAL.
B0034G4OYK|1.0|I bought this movie sight-unseen because of positive reviews and because I was craving another worthwhile 3D movie.  I'm normally fairly forgiving of animated features but I can't stand this one.<br /><br />The writers were apparently obsessed with bodily functions and were much more concerned with them than with actual witty and/or reasonably believable dialogue.<br /><br />I'm not someone who hates all things Adam Sandler either.  I enjoy Happy Gilmore and 50 First Dates is a very good movie.  But if you can't stand his ridiculous voices, this movie is downright painful.<br /><br />The \\"comedic\\" situations in the movie are worse than contrived, the \\"humor\\" almost always lands flat, the \\"sweet\\"/\\"emotional\\" moments were completely un-earned and insincere, the \\"lesson\\" is downright wrong for the young viewers it was apparently intended for, and the ending is protracted and annoying.  Also, although the movie clearly maintains the tradition that sunlight burns vampires, it requires the audience to accept that a vampire can spend the entirety of a lengthy pursuit and equally lengthy conversation in broad daylight under clear skies without suffering serious harm, amongst other ideas that strain against the viewer's intellect.<br /><br />Visually, the movie isn't too terrible. The animation is lively but I found it far too exaggerated for my taste. The music (other than the awful musical numbers) is not especially memorable but it's not offensive (unlike the aforementioned musical numbers). The voice acting is terrible, although I'm not sure what they could have done with a script as bad as this one.<br /><br />In short, this is one of the three worst movies it's ever been my misfortune to own. I've watched it twice, each time with different people.  Each time, the movie wore out its welcome with anyone watching in the first 15 minutes and only got worse from there.<br /><br />There are clearly a lot of people who liked this movie and I don't doubt that many children arelikely to enjoy it.  I really wanted to like it and I gave it a second try but it was actually worse the second time through.<br /><br />Unless someone you know, who knows your tastes well, recomemends this movie to you, I'd recommend avoiding this movie.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|I AM CRAZY ABOUT DENZEL BUT THIS WASN'T HIS BEST MOVIE. THE MOVIE HAD SO MANY POSSIBILITIES,AND I BET IF YOU GAVE DENZEL SOME WRITERS LEWAY, HE COULD HAVE MADE THIS INTO A 5 STAR HIT!<br />IT WAS SLOW AND IT REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE ABOUT DRINKING. YOU COULD HAVE MADE IT MORE ABOUT THE MANUFACTURE OR MAINTENENCE. SOMETHING THAT WAS LIKE A COVER UP AND FIND.<br />JUST A THOUGHT.<br />SINCERELY,<br />DEB
111846446X|4.0|The authors are both experts in Linux. As a result, there are quite a few paragraphs that refer to terms unknown to novices like myself. In the beginning of the book there are glossary like lists explaining some of the concepts needed to perform functions in Linux. However, the definitions are written with terms that are not explained. It makes for slow reading as I have to try each item to really understand the concepts. All in all though a good book to have with the Pi.

B0099Y2MYK|1.0|Season 3 of Downton Abbey was the worst I have seen in what otherwise has been an extraordinary series. Lord Grantham turned into an obstructionist at every turn: the doctor for Sybil, fighting Mathew's ideas to modernize, and not supporting Edith's plan to write for the paper. First Sybil dies in childbirth...ok that did happen in that time period. Now Mathew is dead! Really?? Are they hoping people will tune in to see who else gets bumped off in the next season?  The whole thing with Shirley McLane did not work for me either and neither did the time spent on the fact that Thomas was gay, or the young teenage girl staying with them. Why?? The other episodes have taken us into the reality of their lives during war and changing time.  Season 3 has lost the magic and should be deleted. Hopefully, the writers can get back on track and produce to a higher standard again in Season 4.
B009SPUSN2|5.0|After not looking for anything in particular, Amazon suggested this and boy does it know me well. Every song from the game, excluding Exile Vilify, is on here. Bonus that all the songs from the original portal come as well. I actually kept one of these songs in my head while taking a test and its true, they really are songs to test by. If you love the games and  Glados as much as I do, you won't be disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am giving this game five stars.  I think it is a fun game and a great way to pass the time.  I rated it earlier with three stars because of updating issues, only to find out later that it was my kindle not being fully charged. I did not realize that the game would not update on partial battery life.  oh well.  I like the game and glad I got it updated because I am not always able to have connection to the internet and enjoy being able to play it off line  :) *****
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book. I read it all in 5 hours as soon as the package came. The writing is beautiful, the story is heartbreaking. I just loved it. My favorite book of the year by far (and I have been reluctant int the past to change my favorite book from Harry Potter. That's how good it is!). I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't mind mild language and content, but really I got past that and it was wonderful!<br /><br />Best wishes!<br />DFTBA!

B0058M8BGA|5.0|The most brilliant portrayal of a transsexual experience in modern history. Even when Magnus Hirshfield was publishing his treatise on the transsexual phenomenah, Woolf relates an account of the intracies of gender identity undiscovered by social scientists and biologists. Published in 1928, Orlando has been billed as one of Woolf's best imaginative works however, such criticism was never seen in the light of reality but a surreal depiction of the writer's portrayal of a young man who wakes up one day as a woman, as if in the ordinary course of  his life. As Woolf suggests of her character's reaction to the change \\"Orlando herself showed no surprise at it.(Woolf, 139. Modern transsexuals have explained only recently in their writings, their internal thinking stays the same, only the external body appears different to others. ALthough Woolf's work set the precedent for post modernist literature, infusing elements of fiction into biography, she weaves the internal stuggle of her former lover, Vita Sachville-West's life, together with her own perceptions of gender and sexuality, with an historical account of a young transsexual aristocrat's adventures over the span of centuries. Unlike a biography of her time, the action is secondary to the internal story. This is more of an account of how her lover (and as suggested by this author--Woolf herself), struggles with her own gender identity; a thinking so similar to transsexualism and conflict with a Eurocentric binary gender system. Here, the biographer (narrator) describes: the reaction to Orlando's change of sex, as it may appear in a scientific journal today;\\"[b]ut in every other respect, Orlando remained preceisely as he had been. The change of sex, though it altered their future, did nothing whatever to alter their identity. (Woolf, 138). Woolf captures the failure of the general public to grasp the concept of gender reassignment when she has the narrator express dismay in the lack of Orlando's reaction where \\"Orlando was a man till the age of thirty (Similar to our understanding of modern transsexuals who start their transition at middle age) when he became a woman and has remained ever since.\\" (Woolf, 139)'. Woolfe's use of metaphor and foreshadowing is uncanny. The pyrotechnic displays prior to the deep sleep of Orlando depicts change. She puts Orlando on a ship called the 'Enamoured Lady,' and she is suddenly the object of the Captain's and other males' attention and realizes that the sexual fantacies of men creates a dillemma for her as a woman, where she must sheild her own desires as a woman. Woolfe precisely proclaims that '(Orlando) remembered how, as a young man, she had insisted that women must be obedient, chaste, scented, and exquisitely apparelled... (and) \\"Now I shall have to pay in my own person for those desires ... for women are not (judging by my own short experience of the sex) obedient, chaste, scented, and exquisitely apparelled by nature.\\"  Woolfe does not stop at her proclivity to undress Orlando's gender identity but lays bare the confusion of sexual preference. Although a woman herself, Orlando proclaims that \\"it was still a woman she loved; and if the consciousness of being of the same sex had any effect at all, it was to quicken and deepen those feeling which she had had as a man.\\" (Woolf, 161).  Where she gives in to sensual thoughts of a man, the Captain on whose arm she trembles and remembers that she had once been a Duke and Ambassador, \\"that she, who had been lapped like a lily in folds of paduasoy, had hacked heads off, and lain with loose women amoung treasure sacks in holds of pirate ships...\\" Woolfe reveals a metaphoric character, the Archduchess Harriet Griselda of Finster-Aarhorn and Scan-op-Boom in the Roumanian territory, seen in chapter three as a woman, and in a later chapter is shown to be a man, the Archduke, who suddently professes his love for her. Woolfe's ability to produce a character like the Arduke Harry who today would fall somewhere on the transgendered scale, is amazing, for a woman in her time. Yet through all its carefully crafted language and delightful parody, the gender message she professes is much the same today as it may have been then, that \\"Clothes ... change our view of the world and the world's view of us....\\" Orlando challenges the Eurocentric binary gender construct of the world she lived in. Here, the writer's own indictment of the unrealistic bounds placed on women is evident and transposed by her narrator and Orlando's own expository reflections, \\"In every human bing a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place, and often it is only that clothes that keep the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above.\\" (Woolfe, 189). Here, Woolfe appears to challenge more than the unfairness and imperfections of gender traditions on women. She uses comparaisons of the formalities of being a nieteenth century man and woman to make her point. Additionally, the most introspective journey in Orlando, is of a person who is not questioning her own gender identity, but defining it. Woolfe appears to depict, not confusion, but knowledge by the transsexual main character of her own identity, and chosing to adapt to it by changing the way the world looks at her, by changing sex. It is the world that suffers the confusion. Woolfe makes generalities about other persons hiding their sex in the clothing of the other gender, suggesting there are numerous persons in her era that suffer from some sort of gender dysphoria. After reading Orlando, and comparing it with the writings of transsexual, transgendered and social scientists,Woolfe describes so clearly the struggle a transgendered person experiences, that critics should look more closely at this writing. Woolfe's narrator states: \\"Of complications and confusions which thus result every one has had experience;\\" and as though afraid to delve deeper, she leaves this general question to \\"note only the odd effect it had in the particualr case of Orlando herself.\\" As Woolfe so eloquently portrays the posttranssexual eptiome, \\"having now worn skirts for a considerable time, a certain change was visible in Orlando, which is to be found even in her face...\\" and where the narrator wonders, had both the man and woman of Orlando's time.worn the same clothes (in other words, different sexes but same gender) it is possible their outlook may have been the same too.\\" (Woolfe, 188). Yet the most profound statement made in the text reveals Woolfe's secret exposition: \\"The difference between the sexes is, happily, one of great profundity. Clothes are but a symbol of soemthing hid deep beneath. It was a change in Orlando herself that dicated her choise of a woman's dress and of a woman's sex. And perhaps in this she was only exprssing rather than mor openly than usual---openness indeed was the soul of her nature---(Woolf, 189).  Thus, Woolfe explains that Orlando chose to change his sex because he was in fact a woman, a woman's soul in a man's body. This book is highly recommended to all who are ever wonder what it is like for a transsexual to alter his sex, and begin living as the gender opposite of his or her sex. And for those who never wondered, it is a great read, full of insightful commentary on the possibility of a gender continuum and expanding the boundaries of a binary gender system of a phallocentric society.omewhere on the transgendered scale, is amazing, for a woman in her time.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I had heard good things about this book and was eager to read it.  However, it had a slow start,the middle was good, but i didn't enjoy the ending.  Overall just ok for me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book is just as good as the first. I couldn't put it down. Going to buy the third book now!
B002APU580|4.0|If you read the book you'll love it.  If you didn't read the book you'll hate it.  The effects were terrible.  Looks like they used a green screen and they shouldn't have.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As advertised.  Very happy with it.  May read it again later, helps with daily living a little bit.  Thank you.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|This book came out to great acclaim.  Unfortunately, it will not give you a complete picture of who Steve Jobs was. In order to get that you need to read unapproved books about him.  The book was also very repetitive and when I finished it I was glad I was done with it and at the same time disappointed it had not been more revealing.

B007REV4YI|3.0|The film it's self is fine however if you want to be able to watch the digital copy on a kindle fire dont buy it. It will not work on the kindle despite a long process to load it onto it. I have tried to download it again many times but it keeps on giving me the same message &#34;Unable to play video. Sorry, this video cannot be played.&#34; This is after me buying this version instead of the normal DVD version so that I could watch it on my Kindle Fire HD. If you want it on Blu-ray then there is no problem but if, like me, you are buying this version for the digital copy it is not worth it. Just buy the cheaper DVD version.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I would totally buy this game and plus it is free!!! I love and probably everyone else does. I am addicted to this game.
0470913029|5.0|This is science based material, not a get thin quick scheme. It teaches you not only what to eat but why. Tons of information on what happens to your body when you eat certain foods. I warn you it can be horrifying, no wonder so many people are sick and overwieght. All of this is backed by scientific studies. A clear case for giving up the processed abomination that has become the American diet. If you truly want to understand the Paleo diet and have the tools to make this life change you need this book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was impressed all the through it. I didn't really think this book about a game where teenagers are forced to kill each other would keep me interested. I was pleasantly surprised! It was a entertaining read!
B00BESLT6G|3.0|I liked it, I don't regret rending it for 5.45, I only do HD.  The big fight was a chalenge to resident evil, and I enjoyed it.  That's the stuff we look for in movies today, the big fight. What I didn't like was the story line, bad, bad, bad.
B00338QENI|4.0|This book is an extradordinary tale and a science lesson all in one. I found the story of Deborah Lacks' life to be very sad.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|This is the standard man mentors lad who overcomes difficulties movie set against a surf background.  The theme has been done a hundred times and is now pretty stale.  So why did I like this movie and fall for the story line?  The cinematography of an area I am familiar with grabbed me.  I also think it had some good things to say about surfing.  If you are not someone who has ever surfed it does give a picture of how much intelligence goes into the sport.  It shows how it is sport that involves a love of the ocean.  It also show the positive side of the folks who participate.  Surfers are often shown as lazy druggies who are pretty much a drag on society.  Jay Moriarity is far from that portrait in this film.  The characters are a little trite but the acting is first class.  I enjoyed it.  I will probably run it again just to look at the parts with the ocean.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|This was entertaining. I thought it was OK but not a great movie. I would not watch this movie again.
B004TTMYQG|2.0|this is a great app, just don't get it from Amazon. I Already purchased the app I shouldn't have to login to Amazon each time I want to use it.

B0009P5YXO|3.0|My 16 year old daughter thought this toy was fun to pretend and joke around with, however, it is not educational, and pieces keep breaking off. Defiantly not worth the money paid.
B007U8UBGI|5.0|Maybe it was because I wasn't really expecting much but this is the best Bluesy Rock album of 2012 IMHO.  On intro's I hear roots of English rockers past such as The Who and at times faint homages paid to Led Zeppelin but the lyrics and the licks are really something special. When Blunderbuss kicks in and the transitions with the phenomenal piano weave in more predominantly to me this is the meat of the album although Eponymous delivers as well.  Solid start to finish with hints of extra-special in between. I can't say I was a huge Jack White fan prior to this album but Blunderbuss has made me a believer.  Rock n Roll bluesy-tinge that at times will send chills down your spine!  A must for all music lovers.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its nice game. to be distracted.  and I like it because. it has lots of things that you can. do in there.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This review is based on my personal opinion. Some reviews are really based on out of this world expectations and not fair at all. There is no such thing as the perfect TV show so not everyone can be pleased. What i like about the Walking Dead is the fact that it shows the human nature side of the story and not just special effects or pretty cast members. Some things are somewhat predictable but others just kind of take you by surprise. Survival is the key and as you can tell people sometimes will do stupid things trying to survive but is not always the right thing to the do. Rick is as tough as vulnerable but the goal is to keep going and even after all he's been through he is trying to do what's best for the group. I won't discuss details in case you haven't watch all the episodes so just enjoy the show and make your own judgement.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|I enjoyed this CD even though I didn't care for some of the songs, her voice is wonderful. I am glad I purchased it.

B0000640VO|5.0|My favorite movie of all time, very funny, I can watch it over and over again. I Love it, I have also given it as a gift to a French friend that had not seen it and she loved it too.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|I believe Adele must write her own songs as her style is one dimensional. She has a good strong voice. I did not like SKYFALL , the soundtrack for the latest Bond movie
B00004XQ83|5.0|I enjoyed this CD even though I didn't care for one of the songs, I am glad I purchased it.
B004EK6ZZQ|5.0|I loved it!!  It was as good as the others. Loved music, the story and the dancing.  Great movie for the whole family.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|Excellent move. Great sports movie and teaches discipline and perseverance. Great for parents and middle & high schoolers. Elementry schoolers are questionable. My 5th grader loves it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have not seen the movie, so I can't talk to how it relates to that, but as far as books go this was great.  It is a very easy and quick read, but it is also an amazing sotry of self-discovery, passion, forgiveness, and acceptance.  I 100% recommend this to anybody looking for a great read.
0061438294|5.0|This is a very interesting book. It's a fast read and gets straight to the point. The pictures are very good too.
B005CW5E3E|5.0|Some great guests and always great guitar by Johnny. It is so nice to hear something new by this guitar master.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone.  It was very readable for a historical biography.  In fact, I had trouble putting it down. the book gives you a wonderful insight into workings of the Lincoln cabinet. I have a great appreciation now of the responsibility that these men carried during the Civil War. I did wonder at times if the author was somewhat biased in favor of Lincoln which she should not have been as a historian.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|whenever I'm standing on line at the bank or something like that, this is the best game to play. the time flies by and before you know it, your at the front of the line. it also draws an audience too!
0792839749|5.0|Gave this to my daughter, Sheri.  This was always a favorite movie for us to watch when the girls were growing up.  Maybe you never grow up where this movie and others like Wizard of Oz are concerned!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Must own for fans of show. Sometimes CW airs old episodes out of order, so it's nice to  have DVDs to recap this serial series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great series. Can hardly stop from watching them. Many of my great grandparents were nobles and royals and I thought most of them were desposts. This series makes them seem human which I appreciate.
B00932AA5G|4.0|Worth the time. All of the ingredients you would want in a really good flick....violence, plot twists, love gone wrong etc...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is probably one of the best books I have read. I have also read Slammed and Point of Retreat by Colleen Hoover and I think that Colleen is a great writer. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something different. I didn't put the book down until I finished. Awesome book.
0375826742|5.0|This is def. a series all science-fiction loving fans should check out. It went beyond my expectations, it's a great read, I enjoyed all the books in this series.

B00B7805QS|5.0|Downton Abbey is, basically, a period piece/soap opera. Apparently with a penchant for birthing babies to a dying parent, Season 3 was a definite shift from the first two seasons. I've read a few articles that say that those who died this season wanted to leave the show, and essentially killed themselves. I suppose that's better than the producers having a bloodlust, but still left most viewers a little downtrodden. The one criticism I have for this season, and honestly some of Season 2 as well, was that problems always seemed to be solved quickly and cleanly in an almost \\"well would you look at that\\" moment. Bankruptcy? Plop! Here's some money! Branson might go to jail?? BAM! Clemency. To be fair there is drama GALORE in these shows, but I wish in future the writers create a problem that is resolved realistically or even not resolved at all... and in a way that doesn't involve the slaughter of another fan favorite.
0439023491|4.0|Flows well with the series.  It is one of the few books my son has read several times.  Good story.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Drop whatever it is you're reading and read this book now. It will quickly change your perspective on a lot of things, not the least of which being the role and importance of IT within the greater context of business operations, as well as the imperative to more tightly align business priorities with operational risk management.<br /><br />The book walks through \\"The Three Ways\\" as it describes a fictional company transitioning from a badly broken and dysfunctional old school IT and dev environment into a newer-than-new-school DevOps model. A sage guides the new IT director through this transition, with one of the big lessons in the end being the point that IT is so central to all business operations today (and forever more) that the COOs of the future will have to be extremely competent in technology operations, and may just come almost exclusively from an IT background (offset with business school training, or comparable).<br /><br />The book is written at a level that is highly accessible to everybody. It is *not* a technical book. This is an important point to understand, because the book will not only greatly benefit those in IT, security, risk management, and development roles, but it will also very much benefit business leaders, including the C-suite and board members.<br /><br />It's hard to understate how well this book explains the concepts contained therein. Security, IT, and Dev teams should no longer exist as standalone silos, but should instead be all part of one cohesive, optimized unit designed to rapidly evolve and function with great agility.<br /><br />I could go on, but will spare you... go read the book! :)

1616550414|5.0|This book came clean, fast, and highly intact. Dark Horse did a good job bringing this into the states from overseas, and really puts good effort into not only translating the japanese equivalent into english, but rearranging the text and pictures a bit in the book to be more aesthetically pleasing, if at all (most of the content is the same). Would buy this again, if i didn't have so many other Dark Horse comics to buy still

B00B5HQLMI|3.0|What can one say?  In Bond films, a fist fight will never do if heavy machinery, fast moving vehicles and high powered weapons are available.  Nothing is ever knocked over, it's blown up.  &#34;Skyfall&#34; is a bit excessive even by that standard.  Adele sings one of her worst songs at the opening of the main part of the film, and I believe the title is &#34;The End&#34;, which it is, as it turns out.  But not for Bond---who seems to die a Sherlock Holmes death at the opening fight sequence.  They're not going to kill off the lead character in one of Hollywood's most successful franchises ever.  No, they're cleaning house.  Dame Judy Dench has come to the end of her run, to be replaced by a younger, sexier, darker skinned version.  A new &#34;Q&#34; is introduced, a very young, and very geeky version who works quite nicely.  The old Bond car----the Aston---is reintroduced, and then blown to bits.<br /><br />And, in the steady parade of exotic places where Bond goes to fight people, kill them, and blow things up, they end up in Scotland (not my idea of exotic, but then again, I imagine Shanghai isn't exotic to those who live there) where we find Bond's childhood manor house, where his parents are buried, and they blow that up.  The whole house.  Apparently, there's room for only one Downton Abbey, and not in a Bond film.<br /><br />Fly off, fight, blow things up, fly off, fight, blow things up.  Ho hum.  Daniel Craig's Putin-esque Bond is aging fast, but he still has a chest made to titillate the women and gay guys, and you see more of him than the women, which can't be good for the franchise.  Still, we live in odd times;  After fighting the nazis for five years, and the communists for thirty---without building a wall along the border, now we're fighting a handful of Arabs that have us so scared we're building that wall, and the Liberal president is proposing using drones to kill American citizens in America....so Daniel Craig's  Bond is the Bond for a world so screwed up we no longer remember what we're fighting for, or who, or why, or what's even going on.  I'm not really comfortable with this dour, rather savage Bond.<br /><br />Thank heavens for affordable large flat screen tvs, because nowadays we don't have to pay to see this junk in the theater!<br /><br />I hope you didn't waste the money to see this in public, and if you're going to watch it at home, there are worse ways to waste the money it will cost, so why not?
B005KH928E|3.0|Wynton Marsalis is a genius and Eric Clapton is one of the top guitar players in the world. In total these two musicians have won 26 Grammys(!) so far let alone all other accolades. Therefore, no surprise this album was accepted by the public with applauds.<br /><br />But what we have in reality, what is the core of this album? Let's start with the title: \\"Wynton Marsalis & Eric Clapton Play The Blues\\". Difficult not to disagree with an exaggerated definition. They play blues songs but they do not play the blues. It is a Dixieland/jazz music although of highest caliber. All songs have been rearranged to sound like 1920s jazz songs. To dig deeper it also has a solid ground to say that such adventures represent danger to the foundation of the roots.<br /><br />Rendition of Howlin' Wolf's \\"Forty-Four\\" is more or less acceptable as a blues, but things go on contrary direction with every next song. Hardly recognizable \\"Joe Turner's Blues\\", jazzified \\"Careless Love\\" and Clapton's own \\"Layla\\" etc. Another Grammy winner Taj Mahal's efforts to turn the process have a little success.<br /><br />Any person in the world has the right to sing the song he likes and how he likes provided that performance does not leave legal boundaries. Exactly this is done by Wynton Marsalis & Eric Clapton and the album even burst into first position of Billboard Blues charts. No comments.<br /><br />pastblues.com

B005D1IFUS|4.0|From the very beginning till the end Sticks And Stones is a high-quality Blues Rock that will send shivers down your spine.<br /><br />Expressive, inspired, heartfelt, raucous etc. You find an epithet. This album deserves highest assessment, where there is no weak point through eleven tracks delivered with deepest emotion but still album has its peaks and among them should be emphasized \\"Through The Horns\\" with extremely dangerous guitar playing, \\"Ratchet Blues\\" with bone-deep acoustic guitar, and all-instrumental \\"Behind The Flight\\".<br /><br />Obvious thing is that Mr. Sardinas never gets tired during the set, you can't see him relaxed, this is the world of up-tempo, downbeat, burning, rollicking, lowdown Rocking Blues.<br /><br />Mr. Sardinas keeps his music within the boundaries of Blues which many acclaimed contemporaries of him are unable to do. Thus, big applaud.<br /><br />Excellent album from one of the finest acts on the world's Blues Rock scene.<br /><br />pastblues.com

B00000293E|5.0|Nothing is ordinary about  Willie Dixon, neither his versatility as a composer nor his virtuosity as a performer, and curiously enough a person who is considered architect of Chicago Blues recorded much less than his contemporaries whom he paved a way with brilliant songs nine of which, all Blues classics, are presented on this album recorded for Columbia in 1970.<br /><br />He could do everything, write a song and lyrics, perform that song collecting a band best fitting that specific set, arrange music, and record it and give a live performance and produce it, and so on...<br /><br />All these features of Willie Dixon are revealed on this album where his songwriting, performance, and arrangement capabilities are demonstrated in full and it is true, all are perfect. Nothing is unnecessary here or, vice versa, everything is necessary, one more instrument or one less would spoil the whole thing, one more or one less note would make his music sound easier. Yes, Willie Dixon's music is perfect to that extent.<br /><br />When one listens to Willie Dixon, one thing is clear - nothing matters.<br /><br />Personnel: Willie Dixon (vocals, bass); Johnny Shines (guitar); Walter \\"Shakey\\" Horton (harmonica); Sunnyland Slim, Lafayette Leake (piano); Clifton James (drums).<br /><br />pastblues.com

B004RSCWZ2|3.0|We finally got much anticipated debut album by married couple duo of Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi titled Revelator. The first questions after listening are: why revelator, who is revelator and what is revealed? If we take a look from Blues fan's point of view, questions are extinguished, because it is more than obvious that album has very little to do with the Blues. Overall atmosphere here is cozy, kind of big family gathered at sitting room during a cold evening. There are some designations of Blues with short and rare riffs, but that's it. What makes this album being treated more or less Bluesy is guitar solos by Derek Trucks. Yes, I should confess: Derek Trucks is one of the finest slide Blues guitarists today and Susan Tedeschi is deeply inspired singer with soulful vocals but she's far from the Blues on this effort. Perhaps more accents on non-Blues attitude was what authors intended? Perhaps they intended something new and this is why 11-piece crew worked on twelve-song album and even that was not enough?<br /><br />It is a very good album, honestly. It's tasteful, intelligent, masterfully produced, designed and promoted, but it is not a Blues album. Mix of soul songs and ballads can't be called a Blues. And I just wonder how this album reached top of the Billboard Blues chart.<br /><br />Personnel: Susan Tedeschi - vocals; Derek Trucks - guitar; Oteil Burbridge - bass; Kofi Burbridge - keyboard; J.J. Johnson - drums; Tyler Greenwell - drums; Maurice Brown - trumpet; Kebbi Williams - saxophone; Saunders Sermons - trumpet; Mark Rivers and Mike Mattison - harmony vocals.<br /><br />pastblues.com

B005CW5E3E|4.0|Johnny Winter's first studio release in seven years offers eleven Blues classics covered by such luminaries as Muddy Waters, Elmore James, Jimmy Reed, Robert Johnson, Gatemouth Brown etc. It is no surprise since the album is titled Roots.<br /><br />The notable thing about this album is how Johnny Winter plays or, more accurately, how he does not play. Burning and protracted solos are forgotten, although guitar playing is as high class as always, with new, softer and milder sound, slightly different from what Mr. Winter delivers during live performances in recent years; voice acquired kind of warmth, which comes only with age. In one word, this is an album of settled musician.<br /><br />Plethora of artists from Jimmy Vivino to Derek Trucks assist Mr. Winter on this fine release and all contribute their best to the quality of the music, as well as does backing band.<br /><br />Not to be treated as an album discovering Johnny Winter's roots but the one asserting Blues legend's origins.<br /><br />pastblues.com

B004ZQRFGM|4.0|This young lady from Serbia plays and sings the Blues with a devotion of Blues originators' direct descendant and this album should first of all be considered as a message admitting she is a true Blues lady.<br /><br />Although not in its entirety but in much success of an album is dependent on opening track and \\"Fearless\\" is the right choice: vigorous, exceptional song of unexpected structure starts fifty one-minute adventure in Ana Popovic's Blues planet and then it goes, every next performance is better than previous, (mentioned should be roll-call between Ana Popovic and one of her heroes, Sonny Landreth in \\"Slideshow\\"; exceptional slide dialogue, for Blues gourmets only), every guitar solo is more vigorous than previous. This album simply leaves you breathless.<br /><br />Ana Popovic feels the Blues! If someone still has a question, just listen to Unconditional.<br /><br />pastblues.com
B0071U3KCW|5.0|I love this musical! I love the songs so much, that I feel the story takes a back seat. It's just the way I see the movie, it's like I'm always looking forward to the singing and dancing!
B004LSJCJM|2.0|Turning point in acclaimed musician's career? One has a ground to put up a question after listening to Dust Bowl notwithstanding praised reviews by majority of European and American critics.<br /><br />The character of the music all throughout the album is hindered which is so unlike Mr. Bonamassa although listener can hear lengthy and technically perfect guitar solos. But technical performance is a physical thing only although very important. What is crucial here is that Blues have been vaporized and this might've happened because hopefully Mr. Bonamassa is in process of searching new style. Blues has gone; even those Blues tunes that can hardly be found on this album sound languid.<br /><br />Obvious example of Blues extinguishment is black lungs, matadors and whales Mr. Bonamassa sings about. Opponent could argue these are new attributes of new Blues Joe Bonamassa is trying to embed and I would agree if not just one \\"no\\"...We could not hear a Blues. One can change theme of the Blues song but nobody can change its musical essence.<br /><br />This work could be best described as mixed genres album with Blues elements to a lesser extent thus marking probable change in direction of Bonamassa's musical liking.<br /><br />Personnel: Joe Bonamassa - vocals; guitar; Rick Melick - keyboards; Tal Bergman - drums, percussion.<br /><br />pastblues.com

B004DK5CYM|5.0|As friends, I had invited her to join me for an advance screening of this film at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, CA. I also brought my mom and aunt as guests (because I had a +3 ticket.) We all had fun and after the show, we were talking and she put her arm under mine, and I took it as a sign that she wanted me to hold her hand, so I did and she got excited. She told me later that she was just doing an elbow hook as a chummy-friendly way of getting warm because it was a cold night. But after I held her hand that night, now we're almost at 3 years together. All because of Secretariat. And we loved the film and I got to ask the director and producer some questions after the screening.
B00A8LYYI0|5.0|This movie has some of the BEST use of 3D I've seen in a movie in quite a while. Its so good that its worth it to purchase this just for the 3D alone. There is constant depth throughout the entire film (3D on par with Avatar and Hugo) and more than half a dozen pop-outs, some that come a couple feet out of the screen. When you combine the amazing 3D with this type of movie, it makes it a very enjoyable popcorn flick.<br /><br />I was really contemplating on how many stars I should give the movie. If I was going by the movie itself I would have probably only given it 2 or 2 1/2 stars. Its has a pretty good story, its acting is mediocre at best, and it does a good job at being pretty scary, but its very gory and quite disturbing. I'd put it exactly on par with the first film. But when you take the average horror movie that this is and combine it with some of the best 3D I've ever seen, it turns it into a very exciting horror film experience. Which is why I gave it 5 stars because it does this perfectly.<br /><br />If you have a 3D setup you really owe it to yourself to check this movie out for the 3D alone.<br /><br />(If anyone is wondering how why I'm reviewing a 3D Blu-Ray before its released, Best Buy has had this for sale since February 12.)

Hugh Jackman is GREAT as Wolverine and Liev Shcrieber is Great as Sabretooth! Ryan Reynolds is GREAT as Deadpool, and Will.I.Am is kind of a rookie actor and seems surprised to be there.
B009M4KTEM|5.0|I don't know about you-but oftentimes I am somewhat disappointed by archive releases because of poor sound/recording quality.  This tends to be true of some of the releases of shows by jazz performers. The music may be memorable but you have to listen past the limits of the recording medium. Not the case here.  These shows, according to the notes, were mixed from 24 track tapes done under the auspices of the radio station which was broadcasting the shows.  These discs have wonderful sound. You are there with Jerry and his band on that night for two shows.  Jerry's long-time writing partner, Robert Hunter, puts in an appearance for two songs in the second show( Tiger Rose and Promontory Rider). Garcia has his wonderful way with a diverse range of material and styles here in this show, as he always did over the years with his own band apart from the Grateful Dead. Generally Garcia band shows are more relaxed, less expectation heavy than Dead shows, and this one is no exception, but don't let that fool you-the playing here will astound you with its depth of creative brilliance.  I can't imagine any fan of real music not enjoying what Garcia and company can do to a soul, reggae, folk, rock or showtune.  Irving Berlin's \\"Russian Lullaby\\" is simply amazing in this show. There are several other extraordinary standouts( have a listen and see which ones) but all the performances are worthy of repeated listening. Now that Jerry Garcia is no longer with us here in real time these releases become a way for older fans to relive those days when we saw him perform and they give younger listeners a chance to see what all the fuss was about. The best archive releases should be of shows that are significant and these two shows were definitely significant. The amazing sound is a plus.

B005S9EKCW|3.0|Hugh Jackman was an awful Valjean. Yeah, I said it. And I'll keep on saying it. He sounded like he was being strangled. The man may be a seasoned Broadway singer but, well, he tends to sing through his nose rather than from his diaphragm. I can bear his voice for the most part, but \\"Bring Him Home\\"? I wanted to shout at the screen, but I didn't. It was more bearable the second time around because I knew what to expect, but still.<br /><br />I've been in love with this musical since my grandma showed it to me when I was 7, and I was ecstatic when I heard it was finally being made into a movie....and then my heart sank when Hugh Jackman was announced as Valjean. Valjean is a tenor role, Jackman is a baritone - the hell were they thinking? Okay, yes, I confess he did give it his all, but I was ready to walk out while he was singing \\"Bring Him Home\\".<br /><br />Okay, moving on...the visual style, was also rubbish. I don't need to look at someone opening and closing their mouth while they belt out a sad song. It gets boring. I love the music, but staring at Anny Hathaway's face while she belts \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" for four minutes gets old and it gets even older when the director uses the same trick in On My Own and Empty Chairs at Empty Tables. I'm sure there are others, but I can't recall them right now.<br /><br />Minor nit-pick, I don't like how the Bishop of Digne takes over Eponine's lines after Valjean dies. I get why, though, as in the movie Eponine and Valjean never meet because Eponine died before she could deliver a message to him (Gavroche gets the message scene instead). I don't think Colm, who has a terrific voice, sounded good trying to harmonize with Hugh and Anne.<br /><br />Okay, now to the GOOD points.<br /><br />Samantha Barks - she's GORGEOUS. (Okay, vanity over.) She's a gorgeous singer too. When Taylor Swift was announced as a contender I was like \\"NOOOO!!\\", they they announced Samantha Barks got the role - JACKPOT! Faith restored in this movie. \\"Atleast we'll get a decent 'On My Own'\\" I thought. I was right, it was as beautiful as she is.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway - surprised me. I didn't think she's be a good fit, but I do find her rendition of Fantine to be honest and raw and her singing isn't awful.<br /><br />Dog Eat Dog - it was cut! This is my least favorite song from this musical and I was glad to see they left it out (feel free to disagree with me, but I feel like this song is just unnecessary). Although, I do hope this is a deleted scene of sorts, I'd like to see Sacha Baron Cohen attempt this.<br /><br />To sum it all up, I feel like they dumped more money into star power than decent sets. The barricade was a dinky little thing. In the stage play, it's a big and grand, but here? No. It could be climbed over with minimal difficulty. The movie could've been so much more. It wasn't what they hyped it to be, but it's worth watching. Just...feel free to skip over \\"Bring Him Home\\".

B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's Downton Abbey!  If you haven't seen the series, you should!  Fantastic and intricate story of a Victorian estate set in the early 1900's.  The photography is beautiful, the acting superb and the story addictive.  Once you start watching this series, you won't be able to stop!
B005LAJ16I|1.0|Watching the first episode meant giving the producers a chance to insult me with a pile of cliches, stereotypes and telegraphed answers to what might have been questions that would keep the story interesting. This show piles implausibility on implausibility. What a waste of time.

B005EY2XFC|4.0|\\"The Crow\\" flawlessly blends the genres of film noir and the comic book superhero. While the special effects are starting to show their age the themes of revenge and undying love are timeless. The way this movie blends genres makes it rather hard pin down into one and with that being said this isn't a superhero flick to watch with small children.<br /><br />The movie is based loosely on the myth that crows are the shepherds of dead souls. The movie kicks off on Devils night with the brutal murder of a betrothed couple. Then flashes forward to a year later when the husband (Eric Draven) is resurrected and so begins and his anti hero quest for revenge and redemption.<br />  Set in a dystopian Detroit, the city is dark and bleak. The colors add a lot to the tone of the film. Certain paranoia grips follows this film. Everything in the movie looks broken and neglected. This film takes a lot from the film noir genre in this aspect.<br />  The cast characters is typical of most superhero movies.  There is the haggard beat cop trying to get to the bottom of a case.  The quick witted innocent child lost in an imperfect world without the power to fit it.  A gang of arsonists reeking havoc in their own version of halloween Top dollar, the crime boss and main antagonist,  is the Achilles heel of this movies acting corp. He is a man lacking focus. He craves discipline and order, while Crime boss and his supernatural sister seem out of place. How would he be an effective mob boss?<br />  Brandon Lee who plays Eric Draven is the typically 90s era anti-hero but his performance is such that I quickly forget about the cliché and are entranced with his role. Like any superhero,  Draven has super powers,  but his abilities never really take control of the plot.  Rather they play second fiddle to his rampage through the underbelly of Detroit. He bounces around the emotional spectrum in a way that makes it hard to pin down the kind of person he is. Laughing at the impotence of his adversaries, deeply caring for the loved ones still alive, and rebelling the status quo. This ceases to matter very quickly as I couldn't help but root for him. It is that caring that makes this movie worth watching.<br />  The special effect are dated, but that is forgivable because the movie almost 20 years old.  I like all good uses of CGI it's only invoked to further the plot and aid in immersion. With that being said, a child of the 90s will have no problem, but I could see how someone raised on CGI would see it as almost a distraction.<br />  Exposition comes in the form of flashbacks, and are minimal.  This left me guessing as to the extent of Draven's powers. It is rather exciting not knowing exactly what will happen next. The dialogue seems natural and quick, and at no moment in the movie did I think that movie was stagnating. Every scene moves the plot forward, and all at a pretty fast pace. Clocking in at only an hour and 40 minutes the movie's end is in sight less than an hour in.<br />  \\"The Crow\\" will probably be on my list of movies that I will recommend to my friends. Special effects aside the movie is a good on, and my only regret is that I waited twenty years to see it.

0670026603|5.0|Twenty-seven-year-old Louisa Clark is a simple girl, living at home with her mum and dad, in the shadow of her small town's castle and not minding a bit.  Thirty-five-year-old Will Traynor is a successful businessman who lives life to the fullest, including traveling the world and engaging in extreme sports activities.  Who knew that these most disparate individuals would find each other and fall in love?<br /><br />When we meet Will, he is suddenly and tragically hit by a speeding motorcycle, rendering him a quadriplegic...and a very unhappy one at that.  Meanwhile, Louisa loses her job at The Buttered Bum tea room, a simple and sweet job that made her happy.  But since neither of Lou's parents is employed and her sister intends to go back to university, it is incumbent upon Lou to find a job -- and fast.  She is told about a well-paying position as a caregiver.  That's when she meets the surly and unapproachable Will, who clearly has no need for Lou in his life.  But, Lou reacts to him in ways that no one else in Will's circle does: with a jaunty sense of humor mixed with a good dose of sarcasm.  Oddly enough, he begins to find her engaging, with her nutty way of dressing, her caustic sense of humor and her growing love for him.  As the relationship grows between the two, Lou takes it upon herself to show Will that, even though he's a quad, there is a reason to keep on living.<br /><br />I did not know what to expect when I opened this book but I was completely and totally riveted from the first word. I could not put this book down, it was that compelling. I loved the way the author depicted these two damaged souls -- Louisa and Will, each damaged in his own way -- and how they came to fal in love.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I laughed and cried while reading and, in this case, those two emotions sometimes occurred within paragraphs of each other.<br /><br />The thing I liked most is that the author didn't take the easy road with her characters, plot or theme. Her choices were not always easy but she made them with confidence.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this more more highly. It was wonderful.theme.

B00008BXJG|5.0|The ULTIMATE rock album.  More or less the album that put the nail in disco's coffin.  Those of us who needed a new power rock band in the late 70's got it with HTH.  This album will run up your blood pressure and make you want to go wild. Always put this album on when I used to get ready to go out to party worked just right.  Now older but stills gets me going again!  Few albums in rock stand out over the years and this is one of them for sure.  To bad we lost Bon Scott so early on.  Brian Johnson a good replacement for sure, but Bon is the one.  An album misunderstood by the title but so good on the music and every song is a keeper.  If your a AC/DC fan this is the must have to your collection even more so than Back in Black which is a good album.  HTH in the car full blast on a sunny day nothing could be better !!!
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Viktor Frankl is a Phychologist and Jew which gives him an amazing insight into Hitler's Death camps during WWII as he tells of his first hand experiences. This is a great book for those who are interested in learning more about the human spirit and how it reacts to such extreme conditions and despair.
0345803507|5.0|Very good story!! Loved every bit of it! My husband has started to read them and he is not a reader!!!
B0019IB0II|5.0|I purchased this book shortly after my mother had a major stroke.The author of this book is a brain scientist who had a stroke and shares her first hand experiences of the stroke and recovery from a patient and doctors perspective. I was able to learn so much about what my mom was going through and how I can best help her. I would recommend this book to anyone who has had a family member or freind experience a stroke. It would also prove to be helpful for health care doctors and nurses that may be caring for stroke victims.
0810989956|5.0|My son has read all of the Wimpy Kid books.  He got this book for Christmas and absolutely loves it.  It was such a big hit that I had to purchase my daughter one the next month.  They really enjoy getting to write their own comics and getting autographs.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I don't have a lot to add to what nearly 700 people have already written.  I thought that a stranded astronaut on a barren planet couldn't be that exciting but the author proved me wrong.  If NASA does not buy the rights to this book and hand it out in each press release, they don't understand public relations.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't liked anything King has written in 20 years but this one held me and lead to long nights of not bring able to put it down. The first few chapters are slow but necessary so hang in there--it's worth it.

B000JMKNV0|4.0|Decent story with a nice twist. I knew the end from the movie just wanted to clear up some stuff that did not translate to the movie real well. Overall a good drama but not great.

B003EI2EH2|4.0|So I've been on this health and fitness kick and I've have picked up quite a few books. I'm finding common themes in many.  In Ferriss' book I found that he offered some great ideas for weight loss and exercise and I also liked the idea of mind of matter.  His style is a little less mainstream than most.  I guess I have an issue with time management and motivation.  Because of my job I'm forced to skip gym sessions and cheat on my diet regularly which I hate to do.  What I am really looking for is that step by step guide to finding my own little path to success.<br /><br />I recently read Jillian Michael's book Slim for Life and found that to be a good read and had more of the info I was looking for.  I would recommend that in addition to this book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:038534922X Slim for Life: My Insider Secrets to Simple, Fast, and Lasting Weight Loss]]<br /><br />And finally I read Fierce Abs by Jessica Kiernan (i thought the name sounded cool and the reviews seem positive) and that too offer a step by step with food, nutrition, and motivation.  Plus all of her free bonus material she discusses in the book made the purchase worthwhile.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00BFWY80A FIERCE ABS: Your Jump Start Guide To Sculpt, Tighten & Tone Your Abs]]<br /><br />My journey has been difficult but I feel that these 3 books compliment each other very well and I would encourage everyone to buy a few books on your topic of choice and not just rely on one point of view.  It has helped me greatly.<br /><br />Good luck in your journey!

B002NUULNG|5.0|This is one of the best films of all time.  The blu-ray looks and sounds great although the &#34;2.0&#34; part is kind of confusing.  This is original Ghost in the Shell, not Ghost in the Shell 2. The only major difference between the original release and 2.0 is that scenes that feature only the Major, are redone in 3d modeling. It looks good but not great and I prefer the original style.  Fortunately the original version is also included on the disc.

People in my school are dateing and I don't care. Well let's just say it s an ok book
B009X01C64|4.0|PRO: Good quality. Fits well. Seems like a fair price but I have nothing to compare it to. The Kindle HD definitely needs a case where you can stand it up. Being able to rotate landscape to portrait is a must-have.<br /><br />OTHER: Good thing the mount can rotate 180 degrees. The instructions say to install it with the HDMI/USB ports facing down where they sit at the bottom. I was a little skeptical about this until I discovered you can rotate it 180 degrees so the ports face up and are usable when &#34;standing up&#34;.
B00170KA0C|5.0|My daughter was required to watch this movie for a communications class. Glad that Amazon had the movie. It was a very good movie. I had not seen it before and I am a Julia Roberts fan.

0316069434|5.0|I enjoyed listening to this book so much, I hated for it to end.  Michael Connelly has just nailed what makes a detective thriller fun to read.  The character of Harry Bosch as the consummate, relentless detective on the trail of justice for wronged victims and to rid the world of scumbags -- a daunting pursuit.  He is constantly beleaguered by mean-spirited, short-sighted authoritarians like Lieutenant O'Toole, so in addition to the endless challenges of the case itself, he has to figure out how to save himself from being derailed and fired by idiots. I loved this story entirely, the pacing, the true-to-life colorful characters, the realistic dialogue, the constantly building suspense, the exciting denouement.  Even though Connelly basically revealed who the villains were by about 2/3 of the way through the book, there was still so much of an interesting story to tell.  My favorite Bosch novel now, even surpassing The Last Coyote.  He can't write these fast enough.  I've read all of them.<br /><br />Only a couple of minor quibbles I must point out, which don't detract from the 5-star rating I gave this book.  In the scene where Bosch and his daughter go to the shooting range simulator, (it's 2012), I can't see how the bad guy could have gotten a knife past airport security.  Also, isn't there a rule against shooting on an aircraft by anybody (except onboard security??) or it could puncture the skin of the plane , destroy the pressurization and even bring the plane down.  Also, files and photos can be easily sent as pdfs and jpgs.  You don't have to mail originals anymore.  Why is Harry Bosch still a computer illiterate?  It degrades him as a professional.  Minor quibbles.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|What can I say? It's John Mayer......his voice is amazing, he's magic on the guitar and what can be better than seeing it live. If you are a JM fan and you don't have this dvd already......then shame on you........BUY IT NOW :)

B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I finally made it to 50%, but I just can't finish this book. the characers are just rolling along doing whatever they think of, all while bantering endlessly. After a while, it's not cute anymore. If the main characters got killed off, the story might have been better. I liked Simon and Alec a lot more than Jace the jerk and Whiny Clary.<br />Oh, and let's go chase a kidnapped rat for three chapters, because really, not much else is going on!<br />I hate to be snarky, but this book was annoying.

In this books, I just love how Gus's and hazels relationship develops throughout the story and really gives us time to get to know them. This book also contains some outstanding quotes and thoughtful thoughts. Love it.

0345803507|1.0|Oh my. This book actually has sex scenes about every three pages instead of every two pages. Still written very badly. The editor of these books should not have a job! Really? Nope....
B0067EKY9K|5.0|To like this movie you have to be very intellectual to understand the meaning.  I am an avid movie watcher and found the previews for this movie to be interesting.  I didn't see it advertised at any of the theaters in my area but when I heard that it got Oscar nominations, I ordered it on line.  It was nothing like I thought it would be.  I absolutely loved it but you'll have to see it to understand.
0345803485|1.0|Wow! I read the entire trilogy. Books two and three are just as atrociously written. Remove the unrealistic sex, all the repetitive words or phrases, and you get one small novel that might actually be okay. Run on sentences nearly a full paragraph long, misspellings galore, the F-word in nearly every paragraph. Did this book get edited? Or was the editor too busy enjoying the sex scenes to really pay attention and edit this lousy excuse for a book? I read it for the sake of being able to say I read the book, similar to those who say they read the &#34;Grapes of Wrath.&#34;
0307346617|3.0|I just finished reading World War Z. I didn't actually read the whole thing, but I am definitely finished with the book. I should say this was a real \\"out of my zone\\" book for me. I almost never read horror; I haven't even picked up a Stephen King novel since college! But I do love a good action/adventure story, and the upcoming movie is getting lots of hype. Plus the book jacket used the word \\"pandemic.\\" While I don't like horror, I do love stories about global medical mayhem.<br /><br />I loved this book at first. It starts in China, then goes on to chronicle the outbreak of the \\"Zombie War,\\" focusing on reactions from people throughout the world. But then all that excitement stalls rather quickly about halfway through the pages. There is another type of writing that I just don't like, and that's anything that uses a lot of military jargon.  I'm just not an acronym kind of girl. While the book was supposed to give the reader a more \\"human\\" reaction to the war, there was just too much talk about battle techniques, and weapon schematics and reconnaissance missions. I started skipping some pages, which is never a good sign.<br /><br />I did learn something from this reading, though. As a rule, I never read other reviews before I read a book. So when I dubbed this project completed, I started looking at what other people thought. Almost everyone liked it, and most agreed that the book got boring toward the middle. But more intriguing, I also discovered that a lot of people actually believe in zombies! Who knew? Apparently it has something to do with the toxoplasmosis parasite and cat urine. (Interesting, since pregnant women are warned to never, ever, change the cat litter box for the rest of their lives-okay, I added the rest of your life part.) Zombologists (real word) agree that there is a form of this bacteria/parasite that makes it's host want to eat flesh. It's only a skip and a jump from that to being filled with black-goo for blood, living forever and walkingaround, well, all zombie-like. Just another reason to raise outdoor cats.<br /><br />If you like war tales, and/or zombies, I'd go for World War Z. Otherwise-I'd wait to watch Brad Pitt try to save the world in the movie.
0345803493|1.0|Just as bad as book 1. Even more words and phrases being repeated over and over...and over... and over... and over. Apparently the editor was &#34;on holiday&#34; while this book was supposed to be edited. Overly ambiguous sex scenes that could possibly have been written better by nerds that have never had sex before. Utterly ridiculous!

0393343405|5.0|This book is written from the viewpoint of man who was secretary for 5 Popes.  This was at the time of the schism with three popes, about 100 years before Martin Luther.  Also at this time, the collection of ancient Greek other cultures manuscripts was just beginning.  We get to see the joy and the difficulties in collecting these from the ancient monasteries that had them stored, oft not knowing what they had .  We get to see the politics of the Catholic schism.  We get to see the greed, manipulation,  and depravity of many of the major movers of that period.  We get to see a personal glimpse into the persecution of heretics.  This is not a pretty history, but is in fact rather ugly.  This was just at the earliest stage of humanitarian thinking.  And we get to see how it was accepted or rejected by the movers of the time.  The name of the book actually refers to the change in thinking style that was occurring at that time.  This change in thinking is well described.<br /><br />Rome was just a collection of small villages set in a midst the ruins of ancient Rome.  Rome was not truly a leader in the world at that.  So the history is not that usually thought of.<br /><br />The book reads very well, keeping the interest of the reader well.  For those interested in that period, this is an excellent book.  I would consider &#34;Name of the Rose&#34; a piece of fiction by Ecco to be a companion book.  &#34;The Swerve&#34; is history.  &#34;Name&#34; is a novel that also describes the changes in thinking at that time, or perhaps just a little earlier.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this show! The costumes are beautiful, the characters are really interesting, There is always something going on, either upstairs or downstairs with the house help. If you haven't seen it from the beginning, I would recommend that you buy the first two seasons and catch up before watching the third season. I started watching with the third season and while you can still  enjoy the show, you will understand what is going on much better. I don't know the difference between the American version and the UK version, but after reading the other reviews, I bought the UK version.  I would definitely recommend this edition of Downton Abbey.

B001JIFYSA|3.0|Was just ok nothing special. Expected more than what it was, so it is just ok nothing special at all.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|Let's see - who might that be? There is no denying that this visual extravaganza is entertaining - perhaps not for  the interminable 132 minutes, perhaps, but turn off the brain and turn on the special effects monitor and the movie has its merits. After making it through this SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN it is rather appalling to see that there is in production a Part II coming.  That bit of information deserves and OMG - why?<br /><br />The story as adapted by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock, and Hossein Amini from the Brothers Grimm sounds rather straightforward in its altered state: Snow White, imprisoned daughter of the late king, escapes just as the Magic Mirror declares her the source of the Evil Queen's immortality. The Queen sends her men, led by a local huntsman, to bring her back. But upon her capture, the huntsman finds he's being played and turns against the Queen's men, saving Snow White in the process. Meanwhile, Snow's childhood friend, William, learns that she is alive and sets off to save her.<br /><br />Bad dialogue for a cast that includes Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Sam Claflin, Sam Spruell, Ian McShane , Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Eddie Marsan, Toby Jones, Johnny Harris and Brian Gleeson (all fairly obscured by the lack of light and gruesome makeup) just doesn't allow this treacle of a story to get off the ground.  Add to that the flat monotone Twilight girl Kirsten Stewart as the lead and the spectacular special effects become the focal star. Despite the silly lines given Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna she still manages to be the only character about whom we care - or even notice. This is a great way to spend a cooped in rainy evening when the other choices for On Demand are negligible. Stay awake for the special effects and you'll get you money's worth.

B008OCTMRS|4.0|I felt compelled to write a review for this 25th anniversary edition of Bad on vinyl due to a rather unfortunate experience with it. This is a great collection on vinyl containing the original album remastered along with two additional LPs with demo tracks and remixes. Everything sounds fantastic, though it does seem at times the mix isn't quite right with a few songs sounding louder than the rest (mainly &#34;Just Good Friends&#34;). Despite that, the whole package still looks and sounds phenomenal. I would say this is a must have for any fan of MJ or Bad.<br /><br />However, there is one VERY important thing to mention concerning this collection which everyone thinking of getting it should be aware of. There is a flaw in the first LP which seems to be present on EVERY copy of this. I went through three copies myself before giving up and realizing they all had this flaw. On the song &#34;Dirty Diana&#34; towards the end of the track there are two very audible pops about a second or two apart. They appeared in that same spot on every one of the three copies I tried. So be warned when getting this, those pops will most likely end up on your copy as well. Having said that it was a small gripe on an otherwise fantastic package, I just wish I knew how they could have screwed this up without anybody noticing this prior to release especially considering it was delayed over a month from its intended release date. Too bad (no pun intended).
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|Good product, easy to use. It works with new Macbook Pro Thunderbolt connector and I didn't need to upgrade the firmware.
B002361MLA|5.0|As our world becomes more and more mind dominated, more scientific and rational, so must spiritual teachings.  The thousand-year-old teachings of Christianity, Buddhism, etc. are so full of arcane symbolism that modern men no longer can relate to, much less practice.  While the methods of Zen, vipassana, and some others are still very powerful; with recent progress in psychology and better understanding of the mind-body complex, modern men demand a more reasonable, explainable approach to spirituality.<br /><br />Eckhart's teachings, along with other recent developments, such as the Conversations with God series or the Untethered Soul, form a set of contemporary spiritual discourses that appeal very well to our logically minded population, especially the skeptical intellectuals.  These books are making great strides for spirituality.
B003PBB4ME|1.0|Does what is intended but I am a little unimpressed with the quality control. Mine arrived with a slanted handle/grip that is not centered over the base so when holding the handle the camera will cant to the left.<br /><br />Spend more money and get better quality.<br /><br />I can NOT recommend this to anyone.
B009KKLQVS|5.0|I understand that quite a few people have complained about the length of this film, and lamented the fact that it did not delve far enough into the catalogue as compared to the actual concerts. I say that what IS here is well worth the price. Pair this set with the previous &#34;Doin' It Again&#34; disc and you have yourself a lovely souvenir of what had previously seemed like the impossible. For everything else, stop complaining and go to YouTube and watch free.
B0053O89IS|2.0|This reminds me of M*A*S*H where by the later seasons everyone had blow-dried hair and every episode made a social commentary.  No oily hair, no out of place clothing, even the gore on Bones now looks pleasing to the eye.  No one is genuinely stressed out by the ugliness of human nature, or the converse -- burnt out and not caring.  Everyone's chipper and helpful to each other.  This is not a detective show, things get wrapped up too neatly.  This is not a science show, the teams' capabilities have become too easy and at the same time far-fetched.  The comedy isn't funny.  All that remains is relationships that women would like, all about sensitivity to each other.  No grim professionalism that marked the characters early on.  No mis-fits among the misfits.  This has become a soap opera and a not-very-good-one either.  The only \\"up\\" side I've seen (and this is contrary to some other negative reviews here) is I believe the acting -- not the character writing, but the acting -- of Booth is better.  I can't even explain why so perhaps it seems that way because everything else has become so inane.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Rick Riordan's Demigod Files are helpful to understand Greek and Roman Mythology better with a high entertainment value. Excelent Book!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I am a really busy mom who is often out and about doing something with or for one of my two kids.  It is such a blessing to have my Yahoo account on my Kindle.  Both my boys have ADHD so I am in contact with their teachers and coordinators a lot.  It is so nice not to wait until I get home, when they are already gone for the day. to sit down and answer and read their emails.  I would recommend this to anyone who is on the go.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I needed earphones which would stay put while running, and these looked the part. However, they tend to bounce around a little, and so don't exactly match what I need. I will use them until I find a better alternative, these work good enough for now, especially at a $10 price tag.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love this little tool.  very easy to use. it does what I need it to do for my daily challenge.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I adore this game! It is always a challenge! Never the same! If you love a challenge get this app!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Loved this series, bought the books after watching it. Looked forward to watching other two seasons. Will definitely watch them.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|great communication... would do business again, was very calm and patient and we had open communication. Thanks again I appreciatate it
B0026772N8|4.0|Deep. Deeper than I had originally guessed or planned. I feel accomplished to have read such a text, and thankful to the author for sharing it with me.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a very, very, very, VERY, EXTREMELY addicting game. I, unfortunately, sit for a couple hours every day playing this game....lol.  even my daughter loves to play this game. I give it 4 stars.  :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|the writing made feel i was there. I walked outside of the silo with J, I was underwater with her. I could feel Lukas pain when he killed someone. A great book
B0091REZMW|3.0|I have to agree with the other reviews...you do run out of diamonds quite fast and end up only being able to play for minutes at a time as the price to purchase diamonds is a bit steep. The game itself is entertaining. I like to play after a long day of work as it is an easy and fun way to relieve some of the day's stress.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|but everyone is raving about season 3 so I guess I better get busy.  I have seen portions of this so I know I will enjoy this once I get to watch it.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The colours and quality are excellent. The disc is very interesting and informative. A must for children (and adults). Definitely worthwhile.
B0037B6QSY|4.0|I work with at risk youth and and their families, its a good tool and resource to own. Give good insight.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|overall the movie was o.k, I would recommended to a friend or family. stream movies was awesome  through my PS3
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Would definitely recommend this book to a friend. Just plain stunning. Don't know how else to put it.<br /><br />Signed, Greatly Inspired
B0087HT36U|4.0|finally a cute little game I was interested in till the end. please bring out the age of cowboys. graphics were great. the physics were actually quite good and the levels were unique. I loved it.
1616550414|5.0|I just love the design on the front! My bf has it as a background on his computer! lol Very awesome for big Zelda fans like us!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like to get the information I need quickly and be on my way. When it comes to the local weather, this app is great.
1780721676|5.0|Great information about the body.<br />I started immediately and I love the<br />routine of The Fast....everyone should<br />read this book...if they did...there would<br />be no more obesity in this world!!!!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Great family movies lots of laugh you wont' regret, Adam Sandler great acting would watch again, I highly recommend with friends and family
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Very entertaining, humorous, not far fetched, absorbing problem solving episodes, human survival and ingenuity at it's finest. A great read.
B0058VW36U|4.0|SOOOOOOOO CUTE AND AWESOME! I EVEN HAVE THAT LITTLE PLUSH TOY THING. ! . you just have to get this game! coming from a 12 yr old girl....THIS IS AWESOME!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I enjoyed ever minister of this book. I had a hard time putting it down. I would definitely recommend this to others.
B002BWP49M|4.0|Great sears love it.  the quality of the blue-ray and the excitement of the movie makes you want to watch it over and over.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|This is one stark and forbidding story. Knowing that the plot is lifted from actual events added a sense of urgency as I progressed through the book. A novice to the life style under a communist regime will experience an eye opening moment. The descriptions of a snow covered land full of hungry, persecuted people is presented with vivid detail. The writing style, bare, minimal and immediate, supports the heavy tone of the story. In writing, less is often more but at times, some moments seemed rushed and mechanical. Also, unbelievable. Dropping out of a moving train and surviving by covering oneself with a dead body? Don't know about that. Still, it's a hard book to put down. The tracking of a serial killer will keep you on edge. There's also several major gottcha moments which I didn't see coming. Read the first chapter as I did and if it doesn't grab you, maybe there's no pulse.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game. I mean some of them seem corney to be honest, but they are easy and I have been having a good time with them. Love this app a lot.
B006L7RDOC|3.0|A good classic book but a tough read with the terms and english speak. Very enjoyable humor and story telling.
B00992CF6W|5.0|girls like mine craft to u know!? I really. ( would ) like playing this game. Omg but my friends just hate it! I wish this was free. lol. but ya I didn't by this game but really want it. I'm going to get it when I get more money. oh and if u don't want to pay this much then just go get world craft or idk. I would buy this game. :)
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I remember when you couldn't get a self wind Seiko for less than $300!  This watch is well made, accurate, and a bargain. I don't think you will ever have to replace the band due to wearing out.  The metal strap holders solve the problem of this strap element from ever breaking.  The only improvement might be to have an interior leather design on the strap, for additional comfort.  For the price you can't beat it, period!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, however I would have liked it better if it did not jump from one part to another. I really enjoyed the story. Now there just needs to be a continuation of what happened at the end.
B009P12GQ6|5.0|This album starts out with the endless enigma, and into from the beginning and.ending with hoedown.  This album stands out as one of the best of its genre,and is as alive today as it was on the day of its release! I highly recommend it!
B004EPYZSU|3.0|The title says it all. And I loved it for it. Though a story is practically non-existent, and parts of the film make no logical sense, the brilliant acting by Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde and the awesome special effects make it definitely worth at least on viewing. Aside form some pretty horrible plot holes, the film is shot beautifully. Director Jon Favreau and executive producer Steven Spielberg bring some really amazing visuals to the screen. All in all, a really fun and entertaining film to watch when you just want to see cowboys and aliens fighting. Its definitely a good time.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This is an excellent movie that can viewed by the entire family.  It's one of those movies you fall in love with because it will make you laugh and cry.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome book! The movie is also great! I love Nicholas Sparks books! Great love story and unexpected ending that leaves you smiling!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I believe in my perspective of this book that it should be more popular. Also I think the reason it doesn't have as much fans as it can because when my friend told me Percy Jackson wasn't in the lost hero I didn't think it would be that good but it was amazing and I can't wait to get the next volume.
B0076DELIG|5.0|amazing how michael connelly can keep a charater so interesting. the end of the book was compelling. keep him coming
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My 5 year old loves this game!! :-) He made me download it on every device we have. lol  lol
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I've grown up watching the Planet of the Apes franchise since I was a little kid. And as I huge fan of the series, I was dubious about a new addition to the universe. But when I actually watched Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I was blown away! Fantastic acting by both James Franco and Andy Serkis (portraying the co-leading role of Caesar, the ape the starts the whole rebellion), lend a realistic and touching weight to the story. The effects and motion capture acting are astounding, and the timing, and story narrative is well written. On top of all of this, the multiple references to other events and characters from the franchise, and other wink-wink moments in the film that would only be caught by fans of the franchise added a really cool element for me. All in all, a really well done film as a stand alone, or as a reboot. Actually proves that it deserves to be part of such a long-running franchise. I highly recommend. On a side note, the bluray looks really good too.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|It was easy for a 4year to figure out and the old grandmother.  It was a fun time for both of us
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a good game And you can play with any ages and you will enjoy this game with other people.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First of all, I don't usually write book reviews.  However, I feel I must make an exception for this one.  I wondered whether I'd enjoy this book for about the first 50 pages.  After that, I was so engrossed by the characters that I stayed up half the night reading!  Ms. Hoover certainly has a way of making you care about the characters she is writing about.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and will be reading others by this author.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very entertaining. However, it often needs to be force closed because of some issue. I recommend this game to anyone that enjoyed Temple Run.
1451673442|5.0|Definitely 5 stars.  ALL Secret stuff is 5 stars!  The Author continues to build on the initial Secret stuff that was originally written about in the original book/movie.  Some of the information is repeditive but is a good reminder too.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Robin Hood was a highly anticipated film for me personally. The combination of Russell Crowe and Riddley Scott...again (lol) was very intriguing. And ultimately, the movie fulfills what one would expect from the pair. I really enjoyed Robin Hood, except for the fact that he is only the beloved criminal for around the last two minutes of the movie. But the film was done in the expected massive scale, brilliant acting, and killer action sequences that Scott and Crowe bring to their movies. All in all, I do highly recommend, even if it does feel exactly like Gladiator haha.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I think it is fun but I don't understand the craze.  Why does the survey require 40 word. I rate 40 word as &#34;as I don't like it&#34;
B006X5L6VS|1.0|i should have read the review before i wasted my money... wont work properly on kindle fire and it keeps closing on me. just on its own went back to my kindles home screen. did that about every 2 minutes. I am very disappointed in this app
B007PFD90G|4.0|I enjoyed reading about Salman Rushdie.  I have read many of his books and have always considered him a wonderful writer who has led a very interesting, if controversial life.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Lzzy has one of the best rock voices to ever grace this earth.  I am glad to see this band finally getting their due.  Now, they even have a GRAMMY for &#34;Love Bites...&#34; .  Just more proof they are the real deal.  Fans of hard rock form the 80's through the 21st century should dig them.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I read his first in the trilogy two years ago and couldn't wait for this one. Had to pay attention to who was related to who, but easily followed the story line. Would recommend this to anyone who likes &#34;epic&#34; historic fiction. Only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that a few things felt a little too contrived.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I loved the first Sherlock Holmes, and this worthy sequel is no different. The absolutely lovable and brilliant portrayals of the dynamic crime fighting duo of Holmes and Watson, played by Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, completely draw you in to the world of the story. The comedy is hysterical, well written, and well timed, the action is top notch, and the story surprisingly true to the beloved spirit of Sherlock Holmes. I loved it. Highly recommend!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Fast paced page turner, characters easily empathetic, leaves you looking forward to the next book. You will feel like you lived the seventy fourth Hunger Game.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|The CD doesn't measure up to the original sound track of the British production, but its OK. I didn't really expect it to be as good.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|We can wide our library with this app. I have a lot free books that I can enjoy, besides its free.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|intriguing. Story line kept your interest going, My husband & I could not wait to watch and made it a special night
B004T2QZL8|5.0|this game is well...THE MOST AWSOME FLIPPING GAME EVER!  well besides minecreaft...obviously.  how far am I?  Allmost done!  ha ha!  this game is tarific!  buy it for unlimited fun!  really worth it.
B004GBIDVW|3.0|I have been waiting for this movie since I was a little kid watching the television series on saturday mornings. The story is just okay, but the action is what we all care about in this movie. And it is done fast, explosive and fun! Heck, people actually getting shot by the millions of bullets that are fired, was enough to make this fanboy happy. lol In addition to the way over the top action, the acting is actually pretty good too. Especially by Liam Neeson, who is pretty much perfect as Hannibal. The rest of the cast is okay, but Neeson delivers an brilliant, and expected, epicness to his role. All in all, a fun, crazy, completely implausible (but thats the fun), movie that doesn't disappoint the expectations of this long time fan of the series.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game for horse lovers!  My five year old loves it too.  Helps teach her all the things that go with taking care of them.
B009POCFTG|4.0|I'll just say this up front... These characters have little in the way of redeeming qualities, the two main female characters are shown fully nude, there are scenes of sexual violence, and the movie gets fairly bloody. If any of that bothers you, stay away!<br /><br />There have already been some very good reviews written, so I won't bother going into much detail here. I thought the film was exceptionally acted and well made, with McConaughy's Killer Joe an exceptionally menacing and unpredictable villain. Initially, his good looks combine with his smooth and relaxed manner paint a big contrast with the \\"trailer trash\\" caricatures of the family that hires him, but McConaughy does a great job of letting the crazy out later on. Emile Hirch as Dottie did a great job portraying a character who could at times be adorable, but was clearly not playing with a full deck.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Another unique concept, well written and a joy to experience. I can only wish Brandon a long life so that the we may experience more of his genius.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I have always enjoyed her work and this is no exception. Very good from the first word to the last
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was everything I thought it would be! I'm a sucker for romance so when I saw this book in the kindle store I knew I had to read it, and also with the highly anticipated movie following the book I knew it would be a great opportunity to read a good book and see it unfold on the big screen. When I first started reading the book I was impressed with the ease of how each character was introduced but still how full of life and how important each of them were to the story. I was hooked from chapter one and finished the book in only 2 days, not once wanting to stop reading. I felt each emotion of all the characters and was beyond curious to see what would happen to them further into the story. I believe anyone else who reads this book will feel the same way I did. This book has every emotion needed took make a great romance novel, love, trust, commitment, and trust issues. And what's a good romance novel without a bad past haunting one the main characters! To anyone else who reads this book I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B001FB55I0|4.0|Some people hated Salvation, others loved it. I lean more toward the latter. Christian Bale brought a good, if not a little stiff, weight to the role of John Conner. And McG brought his expectedly awesome style of action and story progression to the film. Not the greatest movie ever, but definitely a good flick, and, in my humble opinion, a deserved place in the Terminator franchise (way better than 3...by far lol).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game and I like horses. It's really fun and amazingly-amazing. Omg I could care less about this review scrap I just want the stupid gems
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game was &#34;like .....&#34; in the reviews I read.  I didn't know what that game was either.  This is today's version of Mario Bros and the younger set will love it.  There are things to jump and do here!  Enjoy!
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|If you like SUPERNATURAL, the eighth season will not dissapoint. New monsters are introduced, and ultimate forces of good and evil continue thier epic battle. The show retains its sense of humor and fun pop culture satire, and Sam and Deans characters are deepened and developed. I recommend this show for anyone with a slightly dark sense of humor or an intrest in the mythology of angels and demons.
630438551X|5.0|i bought this as a replacement vhs tape and the quality was everything i was expecting. totally satisfied, thank you
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I love the app,but when I do the free crop...I try to put it on other pictures but that background for the cropped picture is black.Please fix it!!!!!
0345803485|1.0|Other than the author's poor grasp of facts and grammar, it's a travesty that this garbage is being passed off as romance. Christian Grey is a psychopath and his relationship with Ana is abusive. By the first eight chapters he has installed tracking software on her cell, used said software to track her down, and takes her unconscious to a hotel room without her consent after having met her like two times. That's not romantic. It's kidnapping and stalking. This isn't even an example of BDSM. The BDSM community is rightfully upset about this book. Think what you will of people who practice it but conflating a trusting BDSM relationship with the sex acts in this book is wrong. Worst of all, the heroine is a vapid twit. Her \\"inner goddess\\" was even more obnoxious than she was.<br /><br />Honestly, as a therapist, I suggest getting help if you think this is an example of a healthy relationship. Romanticizing abuse is irresponsible and dangerous. How many people stay in relationships like this because they think the jealousy is endearing or that the man is just \\"devoted\\"? Shame on EL James!
0375842209|5.0|What a beautiful story.  The book is artfully written to draw you in to this extraordinary story of love and hate, right and wrong, and simple pleasures.  The first few pages were a little confusing to me at first, but with each page the book had a stronger and stronger pull on my heart strings. This is one of the best books I have ever read. When I finished this wonderful book I held it in my lap a long while and had a good cry, not because parts were sad, but because the story is so beautiful and so wonderfully expressed.
0425252868|4.0|Have begun this book after hearing about the story recently.  An inspiring story for sure!<br />I especially appreciate the way the author speaks of the evolution of his own view of &#34;the Enemy&#34; and his reluctance to even listen to the story of a German fighter pilot, before meeting and hearing from Charlie Brown, the American pilot.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|As a fan, I am disappointed in this shallow account of MM's story. Manson is an intelligent, insightful, and creative individual, but that does not come through at all in the book. While he does occasionally share fleeting moments of insight, it's mostly the same old rock-star whining: I had a messed up childhood, my record label screwed me, I did way too many drugs, I had lots of weird sex. Skip this book if you're looking to connect with the more intelligent and pensive side of MM. If you're looking for gross-out stories of self-destruction with only cursory glimpses of insight, have at it.
B002XHNMVM|5.0|Such an insightful and encouraging book.  Have been indoctrinated by the current education system and set value towards career options and what to do and what not to do in my whole life, I think I have missed out too much. But like what it says in the book, it's never too late. It's always a good thing to actually realise that everyone is talented in ways and you just need to discover it and do not let other people put you down. Love it. Thank you Sir Robinson.
0060775858|5.0|Not only have I read this to my own children and my grandchildren, I also give this book to expectant parents as a baby present.........a must have....
078322933X|5.0|For those of you who were teenagers in the 90's, you probably saw this movie, Fear.  It's not a great movie, but it brings back memories of when I saw it with a group of girlfriends in H.S. That's basically it, if you don't like it, don't watch it; if you enjoyed it for what it was in the 90's, then watch it again.
B0011UJMK2|2.0|I am not squeamish, normally, but this book starts out with hunting a cat for food and doesn't get easier.  I had to stop reading it and that is a rare thing.  I love  dark and twisty stuff but I think this was very well written and perhaps too real for me.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was sceptical at first thought it would be a teen drama but this trilogy captures you and never lets go
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great fun, although I wish that updates would change the scenery of the track.  I would assume that my son and I have played this game hundreds of rounds, and a different track would be a breath of fresh air.
0345803507|5.0|I recently purchased this boom for my daughter and I was very happy with the condition considering the other ebooks were uses and not in Herat condition.
1849386684|4.0|the book I have is the first edition, works well if you also use the website. Only wish the pages where larger and it was spiral bound.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A page turning tale of kings and nights. Wolves, realms, and mythical beasts. You'll love some of the characters, and love to hate the others.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I loved the music and different artists in the duets with Tony. He is one of a kind for sure. Got here promply and undamaged.
B00932A66Y|5.0|The story grabs you immediatley and keeps you interested with many twists and turns.  One surprising  development after another.  I also thought it was quite funny at times in a very dark sort of way.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It can be frustrating in a fun way.  I love that it teaches my son problem solving.  We very much enjoy this game.
0345803485|2.0|I could only get through half this book because the writing was so poor.  Unfortunately, this is not my cup of tea.
B00BF2UKDE|5.0|Nick Cave has always been about wild contrasts. Recall that after the brutal Murder Ballads came the most beautiful Bad Seeds record, the gorgeously meditative \\"Boatman's Call\\".  Setting aside the naked aggression of the Grinderman records, the Bad Seeds last full album was 2008's electrifying whacked out blues of  \\"Dig Lazarus Dig\\" so there is a quiet inevitably that the great man will take a tangential turn. Coming in the shape of 15th Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds record \\"Push the sky away\\" sees him return with a melancholy beast that is contemplative and measured. This is not the fiery Nick Cave but the one who reflects on the human condition and uses the sea as a metaphor for a cast of subjects leading to the production of a stunning album which is as quietly powerful has any thing they have done to date.<br /><br />The departure of Mick Harvey has impacted and into the vacuum he has left steps Cave's soundtrack collaborator Warren Ellis, whose slow instrumentation and ghostly keyboard parts establish an ominous often soured mood. The nine songs here range from the gently rolling \\"We no who U R\\" which oozes a sultry almost Portishead style atmosphere to the albums absolute standout of the near eight minute \\"Higgs Boson Blues\\" so wasted it could have be happily located within the grooves of Neil Young's \\"On the Beach\\". It's a burningly strung out powerhouse saga that name checks an eclectic list that includes Robert Johnson, the Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King was shot in Memphis, Hannah Montana and Milly Cyrus. When at one point Cave sings \\"Well here comes Lucifer/With his canon law, And a hundred black babies runnin' from his genocidal jaw/He got the real killer groove\\" it is almost scary. In between there are great songs like \\"Wide lovely eyes\\" with its scratchy guitar backdrop and sea motifs see Cave heading \\"Down the tunnel that leads to the sea/Step on the beach beneath the iron skies\\". The threatening \\"Waters Edge\\" continues the aquatic theme has Cave watches the mating game of young local boys with the \\"thrill of love\\" for the girls from the capital. Yet all that Cave can do is ruefully reflect that \\"But you grow old and you grow cold\\". Jubilee Street is perhaps the most superficially conventional song in the set, yet its lyrics tell a harsh tale of a red light district  where Cave throws out brilliant images of a man who states that \\"I am alone now, I am beyond recriminations\\" as the song builds to a huge conclusion. The waves returns with \\"Mermaids\\" a superb haunting ballad and one of the most gorgeous things that Cage has committed to vinyl. This is juxtaposed by the talking dark blues of \\"We are cool\\" with its pulsating bass line, and the return of an earlier theme in the rather odd \\"Finishing Jubilee Street\\" where Cave reflects on the experience of writing the previous song. The album is capped by the undiluted beauty of the almost church like title track, a dark hymn where Cave reflects and painfully questions what \\"If you're feeling/You've got everything you came for/If you got everything /And you don't want no more\\".<br /><br />Cave is now one of the great modern renaissance men. His ventures into films, books, writing and music are all defined by a vision, which is deeply intriguing, and utterly compelling. In \\"Push the sky away\\" he has recorded one of his best albums since \\"Boatmen's Call\\". It begs the question whether it is the best album of 2013 thus far? And the answer is that there is no contest.ve watches the mating game of young local boys with the \\"thrill of love\\" for the girls from the capital.

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|It was one of the best 007 movies yet.There was nonstop action and a good story line. I hope the next one is as good.
0385344333|2.0|this book was a big disappointment. I have read all of Child's books and this one seemed to be written by someone else. Such a waste of money and time!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|You have to read the final book to know what happens, but this third book takes forever. Of all the books this is my least favorite.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I'll admit that the price is a bit high, but once I sucked it up and bought it I never regreted it. If you currently have any doubt trust me. Just buy it. You wont be sorry at all.
0793563836|5.0|A complete book augmented by CDs for the person learning the bass guitar.  It starts with the very basics such as how to hold the guitar and right/left hand positions, but progresses through everything you need to know.  Also teaches you to read music not just tablature.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Doesn't necessarily agree with the latest news developments.  Still, very good book.  The author's attention to detail was very educational.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What an amazing story of survival and the will to live at all costs.  Luttrell's story never stops with one escape, evasion and experience after another.  His rescue and the stubborn resolve of his captors / rescuers to keep him alive and under their protection is amazing even though all of their allegiences did not necessarily lie with Luttrell.<br /><br />A great story of a survival and the will to go on and whatever cost.  You won't want to put down the book.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Threat Vector is a great and timely installment in Tom Clancy's techno-thriller series.  It starts out fast, does a lot of backstory building, and then concludes with a typical powerful finish.  I have only read a few of Clancy's books, but I have always found them to be edge-of-your-seat good reads, and this is no exception.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|This is a great box set. They get rid of the senseless papers and 8 different blu-ray cases to give you an easy-to-access, bare essential package. The first 5 movies are presented without a menu (hence the 4-star rating). Menus are one of my favorite things about Blu-Ray and DVD's, so having the movie automatically start was kind of lame. Even worse when I noticed the &#34;Menu&#34; text is barely readable and the awful yellow color hurts my eyes when watching on my smaller TV.<br /><br />Movies 6, 7, and 8 have menus. The special features for all three of the final films are quite lackluster in comparison to what was offered with 1-5.<br /><br />1-5 Special Features consist of interviews with cast and crew, behind the scenes shots, cool interviews and character profiles.<br />6-8 Special Features consist of watching the movie with &#34;Maximum Viewing Mode&#34; or something. It basically plays the movie in the background and instead of commentary, you see actual actors, producers, directors etc. talking about the film. It's okay, but not as interesting as straight commentary would have been.<br /><br />For what it's worth, the collection is great. The movies look crisp and visually pleasing when viewing on my 52&#34; Plasma TV. The sound for the films is great, except for the last 2 films which tend to have louder action scenes and quieter dialogue. If you're a fan of Harry Potter this is the set to have.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very well acted. A lot going on to keep you interested.<br />I do think, however, that it would have been difficult to come in without having seen the beginning episodes.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|I've loved the Muppets since I was a kid and the fact that I have all their movies is AWESOME
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Slow reading, but so far I love it!  Hugo wonders off track a lot, but I understand that was his style.  Just now got to the Battle of Waterloo description.  I am learning a lot.  We loved the movie, but haven't seen much comparison yet.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I loved this game. I was doing awesome. I had about 10,000 dollars saved up to buy a new character. then I went back on this game one day and all of my progress was just gone. it took away all my money and my score multiplyer was at 22 but it went all the way down to 0.
B00973902K|4.0|Its one of those catchy pop hits of today, shes got a soothing voice and melody, this one also wound up on a CD for the grand baby.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great box set.<br /><br />The little 30-page art book is really neat, featuring a lot of images from shooting as well as some concept images. There's some text explaining how Chris Nolan kept the Batpod at his house, which is quite neat.<br /><br />Each film looks great in blu-ray format. The sound isn't even that messed up like other movies where the action scenes are disturbingly loud compared to the dialogue scenes, which are sometimes inaudible.<br /><br />The films themselves are masterpieces. The dark and gritty Gotham City that Nolan creates is immersive. Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is fantastically creepy and sinister. Tom Hardy's Bane is scary and convincing. Overall the final film seems to fall short, being a bit too convoluted and slow in parts. The &#34;reveal&#34; was also kind of underwhelming.<br /><br />Overall the first two films outweigh the final installation, but the entire journey is worth it. Nothing quite measures up to the Blu-Ray quality of the films when viewing on a nice TV with a great sound system.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I absolutely loved it and would watch it again and again.  They became my family.  I missed all the episodes except the last two of season 3 so I watched, through amazon Prime, on my Ipad.  Exceptional and Maggie Smith is so believeable...they all are.
B00755MHXG|5.0|Excellent book, would recommend this book to teenagers and adults...had a great storyline. Is easy to read and is one of those hard to put down books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this app. Keeps me from boredom. Not only that, but entertains the kids I babysit. Just wish it was easier to get gems and things. Other than that? I love it!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is very good for its price! And glad the diamonds are free. BTW love 3D! Wish there where more horse breeds to buy.
B008KEQM3W|1.0|Its not that I hate it, the problem is I simply cannot play it in my DVD player as it says the DVD has the wrong country code for my DVD player.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|This seems very simple to do, but it isn't. The hardest part is that you have to look inside and find out what is disturbing you before you start to request anything. hmmm - want to change your life experience... change yourself. It's not about anyone but you.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun game.  Sometimes it's easy to connect, but others you really have to think.<br />Once you start playing it's hard to stop.
B0031Q0XCA|2.0|I'm a big fan of Zooey Deschanel in &#34;New Girl&#34;, the genius comedy by Liz Meriwether. So I thought I&#34;d check out another of Zooey's works. Unfortunately &#34;500 days&#34; is a rewrite of the age-old &#34;belle dame sans merci&#34; with a few strokes of color and music for added interest. &#34;Summer&#34; is a cold, distant, yet exciting young woman who easily captures the misguided passion of Gordon-Levitt's character. As she sends him mixed signals, he becomes more smitten, until she suddenly breaks up with him. The end has a  redeeming twist in which Tom realizes that he wasn't exactly the attentive lover that Summer needed, and their chemistry wasn't all that perfect either. Save for that flash of clarity, the rest of the movie is a sickening ride through the angst of unrequited love, which I didn't particularly enjoy. I'll be sticking to Deschanel's more flesh-and-blood, lovable character &#34;Jess&#34;!
B0098VXMNE|5.0|I loved this season! The entire show is amazing. The new actor playing Spartacus, does a great job as well.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Every single song caresses my heart & soul. A must-have album! Tegan & Sara's voices make each song a piece of art. A wonderland.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I would love to see more variety in the horses the fantasy one's are neat. Also the monogrammed are to easy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game there's always something to do. I like the different horses to choose from<br />So realistic<br />Very fun game<br />Easy to learn
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If I could give this book more than five stars I would.  I am an avid reader and this is the best book that I have read in a very long time.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about this book and this author.  I could not put the book down.  Everyone needs to read this book.  I cannot believe anyone would not enjoy this novel.  Very entertaining.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|For those of us who cut our teeth on the likes of &#34;The Hunt for Red October&#34;, or &#34;Red Storm Rising&#34; or the early Jack Ryan Stories, this book is decidedly lacking.  A good story with great potential but it felt rushed.  This isn't even quite as good as &#34;The Bear and The Dragon&#34;.  It's not bad but has a not quite done feel to it.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|To be honest, I wasn't stoked for this pre-quel, I wanted to watch more SPARTACUS, but once I began watching it, I couldn't stop. It's awesome, great characters and story, watched all of them in a couple of days - and have watched them again since.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|A love story with a bite I couldn't put it down.<br />Great good fantastic book so enthralling it takes you on a fantasy ride.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book made me laugh and cry...the range of emotions i felt reading this was incredible. I just couldn't put it down. If i wasn't reading on my kindle, i'd  pull up my laptop, then if i wasn't near either of the two, i'd pull up on my phone. I want more of this inspiring couple!! They made me feel like a teenager again with the refreshing taste of young love.  ADORED IT!!!
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel never dissapoints. The movie was better than expected and had a feel good ending. My husband and I both enjoyed it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent read.  I had trouble putting this book down.  Very entertaining.  I wish I could find more books like this.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Arrived fast and in perfect condition. The box was in its original packaging and all the discs worked flawlessly. Very happy with the price.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|A classic 80's movie!  How can anyone not like this movie.  The actors with the story line go hand in hand.  They each play their own character 100%.
B007V65R54|4.0|Well posed arguments, well cited. Enjoyed the book as an easy read. Good for a quick vacation or a flight.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|the game is good but is really scary. To be honest with you I simply erased the apps from my kindle because this game gives me the creeepsss. ....
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I love David Baldacci but this book was exceptional. It had me engrossed the entire time right from the first chapter. Could not predict the outcome, which I enjoy. It is worth the read.
0786856297|5.0|My grandson loved it and is reading more by the same author.  Anything that encourages reading is great in my book!
B003L77G6A|5.0|Arrived fast and in perfect condition. The box was in its original packaging and all the discs worked flawlessly. Very happy with the price.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Great book! I'm in the final semester of my undergraduate career -I stumbled across this book at the perfect time!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It gives you just the information want you want all in 1 screen.<br />Additional features are there if you want them.
B0051XQI84|5.0|this movie is a great to watch movie with your family and even with friends. The movie itself is good and the point they are trying to give you is lovely,,,
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded it for my kindle and have found it to be a good game highly recommended I play it for hours.
0345803493|3.0|I read all three--Halfway through the second one I got a little bored with all the stuff in the secret room.  The story was good though, so I kept going.  I would just scan those mommy porn parts!  What a great idea the author had--wish I had thought of it--she made mega bucks!  I donated my books to the library because my thee daughters were coming for Christmas.  The male librarian got a kick out of that when I told him why I was donating them!
B003J27WFW|5.0|This is the must-see back story of Canada's second best contribution to the world, the first being hockey. The individual histories of the Geddy, Alex & Niel are woven brilliantly into the fabric of history that explain the great band. I almost wonder if the release of this movie was the final push to get these guys into the Rock Hall Of Fame. What a shame that Rush was not celebrated and recognized at this elite level about 20 years ago. They are without peers in all music genre's. Their musical intellect and composition style can intimidate and embarrass most any current musicians alive today. They are the gold standard.
0446547573|5.0|I've read most of Nicholas Sparks' works and enjoy his style and character-building qualities. Safe Haven was different because it wasn't your \\"typical\\" whodunit mystery.<br /><br />The subject matter was quite exciting, different, and was entirely a worthwhile read.<br /><br />The protagonist, a woman \\"on the run,\\" manages to stay one step ahead of her pursuer. This concept was exciting, but more important were the twists and turns she went through to remain anonymous.<br /><br />Its socially redeeming qualities were the result of a \\"strong statement\\" against spousal abuse and the effect that this condition can have on individuals and entire families.<br /><br />It was very sensitively written, while retaining its exciting flavor.<br /><br />It was a big surprise to me to find that Nicholas Sparks has qualities enabling him to create meaningful fiction with sophistication.<br /><br />Loved the book and recommend it highly!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|GREAT SHOW IT REALLY GRABBED ME AND WOULDN'T LET ME GO WAITING FOR SEASON TWO TO COME OUT SO I CAN GET BACK INTO IT
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think this is a good app because of all the texture and landscapes of the running course but the game crashes and doesn't turn back on after like 30 games
B0067R0APK|5.0|I use it every day to see what kind of weather we are going to have.I like to be able to see the weather conditions days advanced.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|We really have enjoyed it!  We keep staying up late to watch more!  I wish Season 2 wasn't so expensive...
B0090O07S2|5.0|The songs reflect the true talents of Jim Morrison and the band members.  I would recommend it to all Doors fans.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A good final book that wrapped it all up and answered all the questions. Full of action and gory images. I'm sad that I'm finished with the series.
B000NDEXOI|5.0|Excellent compilation from Skid Row that has many of their hits.  Was purchased for an '80s headline event and the cd did not disappoint.
0761171703|5.0|Great book and makes a great gift to a dancer. Even non dancers enjoy it!<br />Worth the money! The photography is great.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|It has been 17 years since I have read the book “The Hobbit” so to do a comparison to the book is next to impossible so I will go with what I have seen from the movie itself.  I saw the 3-D version, which is pretty good graphically, but I hate wearing glasses.  OK, onto the movie itself.  It started off as Bilbo narrating it to Frodo where he told the story of the dragon Smaug overthrowing the dwarven kingdom.  We even get to meet with Frodo at the beginning of the movie, likely the setting just before Frodo meets with Gandalf in the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring.  Once this introduction is done they take us right into the story of Bilbo 60 years prior.<br /><br />The story actually takes a while to get going and is slower paced in the beginning than The Fellowship of the Ring, perhaps because they are trying to extend one book into 3 movies whereas the Lord of the Rings was 3 books into 3 movies.  However, it does seem that they use some good humor to keep us entertained. In the beginning  the dwarfs basically intrude Bilbo’s home driving him crazy.  Humor is spread throughout the movie, I would say in slightly more quantities than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.<br /><br />Once the movie gets going it gets pretty action packed.  We actually get to see cave trolls have conversations and other beasts of Middle Earth that were not in Lord of the Rings are presented here, some pretty big and nasty ones.  We also get to meet one other quirky wizard who rides a sled pulled with super fast bunnies.<br /><br />If you liked the Lord of the Rings Trilogy you will like this even if you find the beginning slow at first.  It’s a very different story (although Bilbo’s finding of the ring is told here) but it is still based in J. R. R. Tolkien’s middle earth.  One of the meanings I derive from this story is that we all would like the simple life without challenges, but sometimes those challenges can come into our lives unexpectedly.  Sometimes it is better to face the challenge as Bilbo reluctantly did than to ignore the challenge.  The challenges we face in this life help to build character, which can have a positive effect on others around you, which was the case in the story of Bilbo.  I look forward to the second part of this Trilogy and am glad to see the return of having to look forward to a few Decembers of seeing some of the greatest fantasy movies ever.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I liked this book.  It had some suspense and some very funny parts.  I laughed out loud!!  When a book can provide me with that much fun what's not to like?  I liked the characters as well.  The author did a good job with development and follow through.
B0026NWBY2|4.0|Very good singing and a good cd .  I didn't realize what a good singer George Harrison was as a soloist.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game keeps ur interest all way through plenty of levels but could of done more but really enjoyed it anyway
B0068LYEHA|1.0|very unpleasant waste of time. author seemed self indulgent really, was all this detail necessary.  didn't want to finish this one
B004L03B3S|5.0|This movie is so beautifully filmed, so well acted by every single person in it, that I didn't care it was about half-brothers in love.  At least a third of the movie is about their childhood, their relationships with their Mother and two different Fathers, and this makes their developing relationship seem so natural you wind up cheering for them to stay together when the movie reaches the end.  There are a few times when the Portuguese dialogue moves so fast the subtitles are faster than I could follow, but over all one of the most beautiful and touching Gay-themed movies I've seen in a long time.
B00000FC5H|5.0|What can you say about Earth,Wind and Fire.  This is a oldie but a goodie.  Earth, Wind and Fire was always one of those groups that can never be forgotten. Their music is wonderful, because some of this new music they're making isn't worth listening to.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|All I have want to say is that anyone and everyone will love this book. Couldn't put it down.<br />Phenomenal
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. It is so much like the real thing. It is so fun! Very addicting. Very happy that I purchased.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|amazingly like being out with my own horses. l am having fun trying to cut corners and doing the training myself. l am not wanting to feed as much grain as the game suggests.  ln real life my horse would ha e foundered...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting and skillful. My reflex`s have gotten a lot better ever since I began playing this game .
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game, easy to play. It arrived on my Kindle within minutes after I ordered it. I would recommended to any card lover.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it completely hooked and speeding through the second book now. It kept me on my toes the entire time and made me want more when i started on the second book.
B002VD5S42|5.0|Excellent copy and hilarious, as always.  I hadn't seen it for years but it really holds up! Seems like every actor was born to play the character he plays as they fit perfectly and Bourvil vs de Funes is an over the top comic combination.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|I loved the tv show when it was on and I'm happy that I can finally watch it in quality HD.  Buy the set, it's worth it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I cannot believe that Mr. Howey is an indy writer!  I am just worried that he will be signed and cause the price of the books to skyrocket.  This book was fantastic, better than I had ever expected. The first book in the series caught my attention and I never put it down. I am now reading Book 6 (yes there are more :)) in the series and it is just as good.
0439023491|1.0|The book I bought has a huge rectangle cut out of the first 96 pages. What kind of business sends something like that in the mail?
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Although, I have yet to get very far. I must admit this Temple Run 2 is much better than the 1st one. The adventure route is much more exciting and intriguing. This Knocks the socks off the first one. I have to give the first one props because if it wasn't for Temple Run, we wouldn't be able enjoy Temple Run 2.
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|It was well paced throughout, and while there was a moment in the last book where I got concerned about whether she had gone a bridge to far, the story righted itself and came to a great ending.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|without wi-Fi connections, I can not used my Zeki tablet. are i just do not how to download it. i was told i need a , 3g or 4g to connections.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I would recomend this book to anyone! And I have! This book made me cry, laugh and gasp! When the book was finally over I felt like I had climaxed and was satisfied. I rarley give 5 starts but this book had everything I needed (except a good sex scene) but it so good I didnt need one. The book had just the right amount of twists and turns to keep you guessing and enough love and laughter to keep you coming back for more. I really liked how it wasnt all about some boy, she did have more to her life.
1451695195|4.0|Certainly kept my interest even though I found myself making snide comments in the margins like &#34;sure, couldn't be the mind playing tricks...hallucinations...etc.&#34;..Until the Neurosurgeon explained how those things could not happen sans cortex...I can't say I 'm a true believer....but I can't say I'm not either..more reading is imperative..<br />Good read though....<br />However, the delivery of this book is rated as 1....Very Late with a bent book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game and really enjoy playing it..my review could be the thousandth review and ppl would never see this because the majority first few that commented said pretty much the basics as to why you should download this app(lol), plus i needed 20 words..hahaha
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is really cool I LOVEE it so much the first time I played it I lost like for the first couple times but then I got a hang of it n a shout out to my God sister who taught me how to play this game its like whoeva invented this game must be really smartt but 1 thing I notice is that it's like temple run I think that game is pretty cool 2 n shoutt out 2 all da. People who played temple run 2 when I first played that game it wwas very fun it only changed a little but it was still fun just as the 1st temple run I really put a thumbs up on subway suffers!!!!!!!! #TEAM SUBWAY-SURFFERS
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This game is so cute and fun and a lot tougher than I expected it to be. I really enjoy it and it passes the time when I just need to veg for a bit.
B007456DSW|4.0|Ordered this for my grandson's birthday.<br />Lately he has begun to get hooked on legos.<br />He saw the LOTR movies and the recent Hobbit movie and now a Lego birthday surprise.
B003I55BIA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a good read of two very different people. One form the rich side of the tracks and one from the gang ridden side of the tracks. My only draw back of the book is that it was a little kiddish. But being that it is a YA novel then it is what it is. I still liked the book and would/will read it again.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is an amazing story.  Not much is known about N. Korea and this book in an eye opener into a reclusive regime.  Anyone interested in learning about Korea or Asian affairs should read this book.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My fiance and I are getting ma be week an  this book shed some light on how to communicate to each other. Very good book!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the trilogy. I didn't expect to like it this much. It was a nice surprise for me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator. It is much better than the calculator on my phone. Makes balancing the checkbook much easier! I will be using this from now on.
0545265355|3.0|While I purchased this to understand the hype around the movie (Still haven't seen that). Its a good read. But that's it. I don't see this becoming a classic. The darker tones of this story of kids killing kids and the bleak future they all have is a premise that's been done several times in better books. (Harry Potter anyone?)<br /><br />** Warning, I have vague hints for spoilers below **<br /><br />I had a hard time even liking Katniss as the story progresses. After the first book I totally despised her. She didn't seem real. Even with the whirlwind of activity going on around her and the faster pace of the later books, she just comes across as... A whiny bitch. I was actually rooting for her death several times, hoping that maybe one of the minor characters that I empathized with more would come to the front to finish the story.<br /><br />A story should never disinterest its readers from the main character. While I may have lost some interest in other books (more from getting interested in other things than losing interest in the books) The hunger games trilogy is a set where I read it once and I won't be reading it again. If you are a fan of the movie and you want to read the books, enjoy, but its not kid material. While not detailed in its graphic of people dying, it is graphic enough that some kids may have nightmares.<br /><br />I'm selling my trilogy after one read, Now i wish I had just been able to get it from the Library.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was a free book I got on my kindle and it was worth every cent. It was a nice easy ready, although it did get kind of boring in parts. She never did accomplish her goal. Things that I didn’t care for was how accommodating he was and how everything was laid out for her in a pretty package and then all of a sudden it changed for the bad and just as quickly it turned back.

B00006LFGD|4.0|I have to admit, I love Barbra and always have in movies and as a singer. I love to listen to her voice! My only complaint is that there are only 4 or 5 songs on this album I enjoy (probably the more popular ones). Others were &#34;interesting&#34; but I could have done without them.

0811874192|5.0|This fantastic pop-up book is a must for any pop-up book lover. It is also an excellent gift book. The 2-page spreads may be kept open by the use of 2 elastic bands attached to the front and back covers. What a great idea! Most of the pop-up bouquets can be easily viewed from multiple angles, so it is a perfect coffee table book.<br />I highly recommend this book to any pop-up fan, floral lover or paper enthusiast.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I feel that my kindle is secure and safe. I DO NOT have any over heating problems. One thing the stand isn't super solid. But it works great for what I do.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|It was OK but not great, story line was so so and action the same.  I expect more from 007 after all he has been around forever.
1449410243|4.0|I loved it also!  Laugh out loud.If you have a cat you will reall appriciate this book. I think if you dont own a cat you will still be amused
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great. I love how the graphics show the truth of horses. The only problem is the cost of game stuff like horses; happiness; and boots.
0470638842|3.0|Do not buy if you already know anything about social media. Its only for very begginers. Is not a book that reveals anything important, so it does not talk about economy.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I am a self-admitted Big Fan of Susan Boyle. I loved her in her first audition on Britain's Got Talent, and continue to look forward to future albums that she will be offereing.<br />That said, this is not my all time favorite Susan Boyle album, but still well worth purchasing. Maybe it's just my taste, I simply prefer her other albums. I was very glad to see one of my favorites - Somewhere Over The Rainbow on this one, and she hit it just right.<br />Many of the songs are 'moody' so you do have to be in a mellow mood to listen properly.<br />Susan, I look forward to your next album!
