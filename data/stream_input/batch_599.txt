0316168815|3.0|This book is a based on a unique point of view; that of the murdered Susie Salmon observing the lives of her friends and family from heaven.      The premise is fascinating and I thought the author did a very good job of creating the initial viewpoint and narration.  I enjoyed her writing style; I felt it was fresh and accurate (coming from a pre-teen girl) and helped to further the story.  The writing was compelling and I found myself yearning to read large chunks in one sitting.  The experience was akin to a car crash on the side of the road....you know you shouldn't keep staring as you may see something horribly disturbing you really don't want to, but you keep craning your neck to look anyway!    That being said, the book is extremely moving, as you would initially expect after the depiction of a brutal murder of a child.  But instead of slowly improving, the lives of everyone around Susie seem to remain stagnant and then take turns for the worse!  While the ending was an improvement as the author did begin to describe the repair of some relationships, overall this book was really depressing.  Though I realize this is likely an accurate portrayal of what families must endure after a tragedy such as this, honestly, I see enough of that depression and heartache on the news everyday. I read for enjoyment,fulfillment, and imagination - not to be bummed out for the entire week it took to read this book!    It's not that I wouldn't recommend this book, but be warned - it's not for the faint of heart!
6305297207|5.0|first off reviewer stephen states his version is widescreen, well mine is full screen so maybe he got a bad one or something but don't let that stop you from getting this horror classic! <br /> five friends go to a cabin in the woods for the weekend and find a tape recorder and a book. the book is an evil spell book and the tape is the translation of the book and once played the group is assalted by demons of all kind and turned into zombies! <br />   this was sam raimi's first movie(darkman and spider-man would come later) and shot on 16mm film this is one huge scary ride. the chills start fast and never let up. if you like horror or gore movies you'll love this one!!!!!!!
6305090564|3.0|I would second everything the other reviewers have said about this film being a lot of fun and excitement. It involves a boat for hire captain (Treat Williams) that takes his crew and guests into trouble in the ocean. Turns out his guests are pirates and the thing they paid him to do is take them to an ocean going cruise ship, so they can rob its guests.<br /><br />Little do they know that ship has been invaded by a sea monster or two or 10! The monster(s) is (are -- I could never tell if there was 1 or 100) a computer creature that is quite bizarre and unique. Its idea was probably based in the octopus but it goes way beyond that.<br /><br />The thing(s) ends up killing a lot of folks and setting off a lot of explosins. It (they) puts everyone into a situation where the last remaining good guys have to escape the ship that is blowing up on a Ski-doo.<br /><br />The special effects are probably the star of this film, which is routine in terms of its script, sets and acting. There is plenty of violence but little that is egregious by 2006 standards. Look for a funny twist at the end!<br /><br />I'd say this is one of the more entertaining movies I've seen recently. It kept me involved all the way through, something I can't say about a lot of big budget Hollywood blockbusters I see. If you like action or adventure flicks, you'll enjoy this one.
B000FGGE68|3.0|It's hard to write a review about this movie without mentioning Director Kurt Wimmer's previous film Equilibrium, a movie which is vastly superior to this one. Perhaps it's because fans of the movie feel like we owe it to Mr. Wimmer, as he delivered one of the most underappreciated action films of our time, and to bash this movie would be a great traversity against his abilities and potential as a great filmmaker. In its own right, Ultraviolet is not a \\"bad\\" movie per se, but it's not really a good one either. Wimmer draws not only on his own Equilibrium, but also on vampire movies and basically any generic sci-fi-esque thriller, and combines them all together with Milla Jovovich, who does a decent job at selling her character and looks pretty darned good too. Sadly, this film is missing much of the suspense and, perhaps more noteworthy, the INTELLIGENCE that made Equilibrium such a cult classic. Even so, Ultraviolet still dominates most (if not all) of the \\"girl power\\" action flicks of late, and is at least worth renting.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|to be honest i bought another movie at blockbuster on a late night trip to return movies and when i got home i found that they had put this movie in the case instead of the one i bought. well they were closed by the time i returned so i was stuck with it till they opened,so i figured why not watch it. boy am i glad i did! this is a very funny horror spoof and it had me laughing so hard that i had to stop it twice and review parts again because i would miss things! the makers of this movie really outdid themselves with this. <br />    shaun is a english loser(he still works the job he had is high school, lives with a pot selling,although most of the time he just smokes it roommate named ed,and another roommate pete who hates them both,he never remembers anything important like mothers day,dates with his girlfriend,and he drinks to much,WOW!!!!!) who just walks through life in a daze,so when his girlfriend breaks up with him he and ed go to the pup and get lit,so lit they don't notice that zombies are walking the streets. the next day in one of the funniest walks ever shaun walks to the store and back never noticeing the zombies or dead in the streets. <br />     this is just a fun movie and if you can get into the story i think you'll have a great time with this one(yes it is very gory also)!!! get it a look!!!!

B000BM6AVA|1.0|=( I REALLY DONT KNOW WAT TO SAY......OK, I FIRST SAW SOAD AT A PRIMUS SHOW. THEY ROCKED THE HOUSE DOWN. THERE WERE VIOLENT AGGRESIVE AND MOST OF ALL, A WAY FOR ME TO VENT A LOT OF ANGER I HAD. THERE FIRST ALBUM WAS NEARLY FLAWLESS. HEAVY RIFFS, AWESOME MUSICIANSHIP, AND SOMETHING NEW TO EXPEIRENCE. THEN THEY BLEW UP WITH TOXICITY, THATS WEN A LOT OF POSER FANS SHOWED UP ON THE SCENE. STEAL THIS ALBUM WAS A JOKE, THEN MESMERIZE CAME OUT, WICH WAS SURPRIINGLY GOOD. I ENJOYED THAT ALBUM VERY MUCH. HYPNOTIZE IS A COMPLETE JOKE OF WHO SOAD ESTABLISHED THEM SELVES TO BE. IT APPEARS THAT THEY TURNS THE BAR OF ACHEIVMENT AND EXCELLENCE IN A LIMBO BAR BECAUSE THEY ARE SO BENEATH THIS. NO REAL SOAD FAN WOULD BUY THIS ALBUM, WELL, MAYBE U WOULD, BUT NO REAL FAN WOULD PLAY AS MUCH AS THE SELF TITLED ALBUM WAS PLAYED WEN YOUR FIRST GOT THAT ONE. <br /> <br />simply put, SERG REALLY MAKES ME MAD BECAUSE AT ONE TIME THIS GUY HAD US ALL SCREAMIN,  <br />\\"I sit, in my desolate room, no lights, no music,  <br />Just anger! I've killed everyone <br />Run away forever, but I'm feeling better, <br />How do I feel, What do I say, <br />F*** you, it all goes away!\\" <br />AND NOW!

B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day are great. Warning, Minority, Give Me Novacaine, and Holiday all rock!!! Don't listen to the 1 star reviewer because <br />Green Day are great. Go get an album from them, Dire Straits, Nirvana, Foreigner, and Guns N' Roses and avoid The Beatles. <br />

B00005JO1R|5.0|Whenever I see so much \\"Oscar worthy\\" tags/blurbs in an ad campaign I get nervous, see Cinderella Man. Usually you look closely at the fine print and see that the esteemed critic lauding the film is Joe Schmoe from the One Stop Light Bugle Press in Buttcreek, Illinois or a low level flunky who just happens to work for the media conglomerate that is distributing the film. So my heart sank a little when a film I have been eagerly awaiting was swaddled with such praise when the ads hit the air. <br /> <br />But they're right for once. <br /> <br />Joaquin Phoenix wears Johnny Cash like a suit. He isn't doing a Rich Little impersonation, you don't rub your eyes in disbelief, but he channels a man so distinct in appearance and voice to a level that is beyond admirable. One of the traits that made Johnny Cash a legend was that nobody sounded or looked like him. Short of a computer generated Cash walking around in his own bio-pic like one of those John Wayne beer commercials this is the definitive representation. <br /> <br />And yet Phoenix may not give the best performance in the film. <br /> <br />Reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clichéd bumpkin. Witherspoon portrays the on-stage June in the way June portrayed her own \\"character\\", the stage persona that people adored, while giving her the resolve and inner strength to be the woman who tamed a hell-bent, grizzly bear of a man like John. <br /> <br />The chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene, but their on-stage duets in particular, are truthful in a way that resonates long after the credits. I know that unless you have been living in a cave for the past week you have likely been bombarded with the word that the actors sing themselves without use of lip syncing. I have never been a fan of musicals, or even musical performances in a film. They generally seem forced and uncomfortable to me, the moment when I stop experiencing the story and feel reminded that I am watching a movie. I never felt that in this film. I never felt that their singing took the focus of the film, but the performances work with the story like no other music bio I have ever seen. I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog, the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative. <br /> <br />This film far exceeded my expectations and afforded me the first trip home from a theater with a true feeling of satisfaction in a very, very long time. Highly recommended.
B000002N25|5.0|Wow!! THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST SONGS IN HISTORY, IMELDA. I CAN'T BELIEVE ONLY 60 PEOPLE REVIEWED THIS. IMELDA ROCKS SO HARD, YOU NEED TO GET THIS ALONG WITH ON EVERY STREET <br />AND FOREIGNER 4. MARK'S GUITAR SOLO ROCKS, LISTEN.

I KNOW HE WILL. <br /> <br />WHIRLIGIG.
B00003CXFV|4.0|There have been emblematic films that plainly, justifies its success based on serious denounces that attempt against the environment. But few times, we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness, constancy and dedication like this one.<br /><br />We should be back to the times if Silkwood or The China syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health; that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions<br /><br />On the other hand of the coin, (and I must confess I have never been a special fan of Mrs. Roberts) she displayed by far,  the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the Academy Award that year.<br /><br />One more thing: in order to the fairness, I would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance: Ellen Burstyn and \\"Requiem for a dream\\". And that I keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between Barbara Streisand and Vanessa Redgrave in 1967, where the difference in what acting concerns was even major.<br /><br />Excellent edition and magisterial direction of Steven Soderbergh.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I love Dire Straits. How could you hate them? Sultans of Swing is one of my favorite tunes, but you need to start loving other <br />Dire Straits not just that one and your stupid Brothers in Arms <br />songs. If you should, why don't you just F@#K OFF AND DIE YOU LAME B*TCH. Mark Knopfler ROCKS!!!!! Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd <br />are horrible! <br />Whirligig.
B000002UZ4|5.0|Like many of the highly talented and innovative groups of the 1980's, The Pet Shop Boys were ahead of their time.  This album was purchased mainly for \\"West End Girls\\" and \\"It's a Sin.\\"  Play this album from beginning to end without interruption - it's fantastic.  \\"Loves Comes Quickly\\" emerges for me as the best of The Pet Shop Boys remarkable and unique sound - a composition reflecting orchestral complexity and pulsating energy.  The great contributions of Great Britain and Australia to music in the 1980's in my opinion comes largely from their composers and performers effectively combining the power and harmonic complexity of some classical music compositions of the mid 1920's to the early 1950's (no doubt the origins of some great movie scores) with the emerging sophistication and always present upbeat effect of rock and roll.  You will love The Pet Shop Boys.
B00004Y6NX|4.0|To The Dumb Retarded Led Zeppelin Idiot, <br /> <br />What is your problem? You act like you should leave the site with <br />your stupid f@#ked up recommendations of Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Beatles, and The Stones. The bands you hate are really good such as Dire Straits, Foreigner, and Guns N' Roses. And I love Guns N' Roses too, how could you hate them? Go to hell and <br />spend your whole life there you lame B*TCH.  <br /> <br />Anyway, I love a few of these songs like Tunnel of Love, and Expresso Love. Dire Straits are great, Lede Zeppelin are horrible.  <br /> <br />Whirligig
0446530573|5.0|The Sopranos Family Cookbook is authentic!  Having grown up in an Italian family I know first hand that these are the dishes that are served as basic fare and Artie Bucco's approach is as authentic as it gets. Every recipe is made exactly the way my grandmothers made them and taste exactly like theirs, too. <br /> <br />My husband and I haven't even put this book on the bookshelves with the other cookbooks - we keep in out on the coffee table for quick and easy access.  We use it more than any other cookbook and we're not tired of it yet.  It's genuine comfort food, both for the body and the spirit. <br /> <br />If you want authentic Italian fare on your table, this is the book to get. Nothing too fancy - just good, basic family style meals that have been around for generations. <br /> <br />There is also good fun reading in here.  Get it - you'll enjoy it!
B00004Y6NU|5.0|Dire Straits are one of my favorite bands period, and Love Over Gold is one of my top releases from them contains great songs in Industrial Disease, and It Never Rains.

0790729407|4.0|Anyone who knows the story of Michael Collins can appreciate this film. While it is not all inclusive to the trials he faced in the establishment of the Irish Republic, as well as the war against the British Occupation, it does cover the main players in the movement up to his assasination. I was rather disappointed that they did not elaborate more on the treaty talks with the British and the key players involved in the Irish envoy to London, as well as the people involved in the treaty talks for the British. Overall, the movie was very moving and very entertaining, however understanding the Irish movement will require further study by the individual.
B0002OERI0|1.0|How come people love this band so much? For some reason, they are so overrated and Punk Rock is just weak. Even Boulevard of <br />Broken Dreams is bad! Don't listen to this as it sucks!! Listen <br />to these bands insted, GREEN DAY SUCKS!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Aerosmith,Beatles, Bruce Springsteen, Dire Straits, Foghat, Foreigner,Guns N' Roses, Joe Walsh, Led Zeppelin, Neil Young, Nirvana, The Rolling Stones, & Tom Petty. <br /> <br />Green Day, Ramones, and Metallica all suck!!! <br />
B000002UTY|3.0|Where is the extensive booklet. Can you say false advertising? Otherwise a great album , I highly recommend it based on the music.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|ok. i got this album yesterday night, and i listened to it first,u know just to skim over the songs. then again. then again. then again. and have been doing the same thing since lat night. i friggin love this. its so fresh and happy and upbeat and somewhat deep at the same time.<br /><br />she is the acoustic jill scott meets sade with almost a 50's billie holiday feel at times. she's just goodness. all the songs have unique, fresh beats and their own little stories. as a whole, this album's lyrics talk of a love that i think everyone wish they had. and she has a nice, raw voice that compliments the music very nicely. she has splashes of trumpets and alto sax in the music to add to the earthy feel.<br /><br />everyone should have this in their cd collection. go buy this album now. =)
1400079179|5.0|Ok, I am just now reading this book, long after the hype began.  I don't usually read mystery.  To put it bluntly I am reading this book because it peeved the Christian Right and that in and of itself has value for me.  I have driven past Christian book stores and seen \\"cracking the da vinci code etc\\" and wondered...then I heard a little about the content of the book.  The book's actual story probably would have gotten a 4 (an albino monk with prenatural killing powers?), BUT I am definetely on board with the idea that most Christians have not a clue about the real history of their religion and the historocity of jesus christ's life.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the book was extremely interesting.<br /><br />PS-it seems that if you have the courage of your convictions and faith in your god a stupid old book shouldn't even faze you, there are lots of books out there that are much more controversial.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I was a bit disappointed when I heard they were making this movie, considering I'm a bit of a gamer and have played the original Silent Hill, and perhaps everyone else noticed but movie adaptions of video games aren't always spectacular(Take Resident Evil for example) but of course I decided I would stick it out and see if it was worth it. <br />It was, granted they changed the lead to a woman(which was better suited due to the motherly nature of the male lead in SH1)and of course they added a more descriptive back ground to Silent Hill, but they were not changes so drastic that it ruined the film, in fact this is one of the best films adapted from a video game that I have seen recently.
B000002S4R|5.0|The sound quality is so great in this recording; I hear extra parts in the orchestra which are usually not heard in other recordings.  In particular, the lower woodwind, like the cor anglais and bassoons come out clearly with really interesting little things. <br /> <br />For the singers: I think van Dam is superb; nice clear singing, good legato style, and no harshness.  Vejvovic and Moll are fine; Hoffmann was never great, but is bearable here.  The chorus is very clear too. <br /> <br />So of the 9 Dutchman recordings I have, this one ranks near the top (with Sinopoli/DG and Nelsson/Philips).
B00005JMX6|4.0|The Girl Next Door is a lot of fun. It concerns a shy, \\"stay-indoors\\" scholarship student whose life gets turned upside down when he falls for the girl who has just moved in next door (the gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert). You see, it turns out she's a porn star. He's looking to \\"break out\\" a little bit, and she's looking to be respected, and they each help one another to do those things, with some wacky hijinks in between. For instance, the attack parrot. (!) <br /> <br />A lot of these sorts of films are kind of \\"paint-by-numbers\\"--they just go through the motions and don't really have anything new or interesting to say. This movie is deeper than you might think. The performances are all really fun (especially the best friend whose goal in life is to be a porn director, and the insane porn producer) and ring true to what I remember of High School. While it might be offensive to certain audiences, at heart this is a sweet romantic comedy about being true to yourself and enjoying life.  <br /> <br />Not bad at all.
B000CNFC76|5.0|This movie gives you the same \\"feel good emotions\\" SeaBiscuit, Chariots of Fire and Rocky inspired the first time you saw them. <br />The cinematography was beautiful. And if you are a golfer, this movie is a must!
B0000CAXIC|5.0|This is the CD that made me fall in love with the Foo Fighters.  It's great to listen to on a long commute because you can sing along with every song and forget about the traffic!

B00005JKJA|3.0|Great movie, dubious DVD.  I thought my disc was defective until a friend told me David Lynch didn't want chapter divisions on this DVD, which is very annoying for those of us who want examine a scene more closely, or show a friend.
1421506270|5.0|Quick note, if you haven't read the previous five volumes then don't read this review, as it will spoil those volumes for you. However, if you have, then this is an entirely spoiler free review for you and by all means, read on...<br /><br />The tension and suspense of Death Note only continues to deepen with this volume. Light, L, Misa, and Light's father are all working toward the same goal, and that is to catch what is seemingly a third Kira. At the center of all of this is the Totsuba group, a committee of seven men who meet regularly to discuss who must die next in order to further the Yotsuba Corporation's power in the commercial and financial world. Yet what isn't clear is who within this group is actually Kira, and Light and L must go about solving this mystery. All the while, Light, without his memories of being the previous Kira, must battle the suspicions of L, who still believes that Light is the main source of the original killings, and Light must do this while being perpetually hand-cuffed to the shoeless mastermind L.<br /><br />I felt that the previous volume slowed down a bit toward the end, and the same is true for the beginning of this volume. But soon into it the action picks up as the mysteries are unraveled surrounding the Yotsuba group. By the end, you'll be hungry for even one more chapter of Death Note, as it leaves you with one massive cliff-hanger. This is yet another great addition to the Death Note series and I highly recommend it to anyone who is enjoying the series to this point.

B00082IJ08|4.0|When I bought the CD, I was familiar with their three releases - Feel Good Inc, Dare, and El Mañana.  And the first time I listened, I was disappointed that the album didn't sound more like the releases.  I waited a few days and gave the album another shot and some of the other songs started to build a rather peaceful and hypnotic attraction to the volume that gives it a real coherency.  It's not just a collection of songs - it's an overall production intended to be heard as it is.  The other songs that started calling to me are Dirty Harry, Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head, and then Kids with Guns.  They broke the ice and now I can just enjoy the volume in it's entirety.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This is one film that I have been looking forward to for a very long time, an without hesitation I can honestly say that this is exactly what I have been hoping for.<br /><br />First of all, we will think back during the release of 'Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within'. Before its release, this was a big excitement for Final Fantasy fans at the time, but the result was a huge disappointment. To be honest, if you think about it, it wasn't actually a Final Fantasy film. Sure it had great CGI throughout but the story lead to nothing but a so-so, pointless sci-fi.<br /><br />Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, however, is a much greater achievement for a Final Fantasy film. The story takes place two years after the events of Final Fantasy VII on the Playstation. The ruins of Midgar stand as a testament to the sacrifices made in order to bring peace. The world faces a new menace. A mysterious disease known as Geostigma is spreading through the children around Midgar. Three new enemies, Kadaj, Yazoo and Loz, intend to start another reunion: to revive Sephiroth and unleash a total destruction.<br /><br />Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is an action packed fantasy experience and the action is spectacular, with probably some of the best battles I've ever seen in a movie, I couldn't take my eyes off it for a second. The animation is superb, while taking the characters from a video game into a film of CGI has been done exceedingly well. And the CGI visuals itself, throughout, are quite simply beautiful, containing absolutely breathtaking scenery. And also as a great fan of the Final Fantasy soundtrack, Advent Children really lived up to the highest standards. Really gets you into the Final Fantasy atmosphere, bringing back old memories of the FFVII experience.<br /><br />Another thing id like to mention is that, \\"is this just for the fans?\\" Well it definitely will be more respected by them and understanding.. But you cant actually say that this is a fans film only. Think about it....This is a top-notch entertaining 'film', not a turn-based RPG. Non-FF fans should at least check it out. Even though this is a sequel to something non-FF fans may not have experienced, but there is definetly something here that you will find deeply impressive.<br /><br />Within a beautiful world of Final Fantasy through CGI, containing absolutely stunning scenes of sword battles, magical scenery and the stunning event of Behemoth-Sin, this was an incredibly  magnificent Final Fantasy experience throughout, and without a doubt one of THE greatest animated movies I have ever seen. A stunning achievement for the continuation of Final Fantasy VII. Absolutely Breathtaking.rtaining 'film', not a turn-based RPG. Non-FF fans should at least check it out.

B000F5GNX8|5.0|Excellent.  A very, very funny good time.  I highly recommend it.  We liked it so much that we watched it twice in direct succession. And loved it both times! <br /> <br />The chemistry between Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. is wonderful.  RDJr - keep it up.  You're fabulous.  <br /> <br />Oh, and by the way, you get a preview of RDJr's new album...which is also excellent.
B000002UAR|5.0|I knew when I saw the cover back in '66 things had changed a bit, just as the cover of \\"Rubber Soul\\" heralded something different from the Fab Four. An actual artist's rendering of the boys in black & white (by band friend Klaus Voormann)? Strange song titles like \\"Yellow Submarine\\",\\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\"- what was happening here?<br /><br />As it turned out, a new sophistication and experimentalism in the the songwriting was beginning. Nearing the end of their touring days, the Beatles began to find the time to discover how the studio (with the priceless assistance of producer George Martin) could be utilized to create whole new sounds and textures to compliment their wonderful but still growing songcraft expertise. The seeds of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" were planted here as conventional rock instrumentation was replaced by strings in songs like Paul's lovely and haunting \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"For No One\\", horns on his gorgeous \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" and the 'plastic soul' (Paul's phrase) of \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\"; sitar and tablas on George's terrific \\"Love You To\\"; tape loops on John's weirdly amazing \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (with lyrics inspired by \\"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" and title suggested by Ringo) and their trademark backward guitar parts (first heard on the \\"Rain\\" single) on songs like John's dreamy \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\".<br /><br />As for the rock songs with more traditional backing, George's rollicking satire \\"Taxman\\" kicks things off with a bang. It's amazing that George could find so much humor (albeit dark) in something as irritating as the tax system. Interestingly, the lead guitar on this track is played by Paul. Perhaps that's why he and John let this 'Harrisong' start this incredible album. John's \\"She Said, She Said\\" has some subtle references to the LSD experience and the country-tinged \\"Dr. Robert\\" is another satire, this time a comment on a real life Dr. Feelgood whose 'patients' included some of the Andy Warhol entourage as well as the Beatles themselves. The other gems on this disc are Paul's uplifting, piano-based \\"Good Day Sunshine\\", John's remarkable \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" with a killer guitar riff grounding it and George's other rocker, \\"I Want To Tell You\\" which features a nice, kind of off-kilter piano figure. The harmonies on this album are sheer perfection. For me, the weakest link on \\"Revolver\\" is the childrens' anthem \\"Yellow Submarine\\" sung by Ringo. I'm not saying I don't dig this song- it's just that the rest of the album is so strong this track pales a bit in comparison. For the tricky time signatures on most of these tunes, Ringo's drumming is magnificent- flowing and organic, strong and steady.<br /><br />A couple of parting notes on a personal level- my own music has been tremendously influenced by this record. I use backward guitar and tape loops pretty frequently to add textures to my songs and God knows Lennon has been a huge influence on my lyrics and poetry. Though \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" is my favorite album of the Fabs, this one is an extremely close second. So \\"turn off your mind, relax and float downstream\\" to your record store and pick up one of the crowning artistic achievements of the sixties, \\"Revolver\\"!cluded some of the Andy Warhol entourage as well as the Beatles themselves.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I just watched the movie and felt like I wanted to watch it again!! It is so romantic.... one of my favorite movies ever!! Do not miss it, for sure you'll love it
B00003CXSP|3.0|I liked this movie. Most of it that is. Several things bothered me, one a lot: <br /> <br />(a) no Jodie Foster <br /> <br />(b) where's the part with the group home kid - we could have had an even sicker feeling about Mason. <br /> <br />(c) where are Margot Verger, the cattle prod and the eel?  <br /> <br />(b) the rewritten ending! Having read Hannibal before seeing the movie, I was totally PO'ed at the (poorly) rewritten ending that to me completely disemboweled the original premise. I was left feeling short-changed.  <br /> <br />So I enjoyed the portrayal of the parts true to the novel, but was very bothered by the changes to the storyline, which were NOT for the better IMHO!
B000EQ47GS|5.0|For once, I feel no need to go over each song on the album in detail.  You've heard them all.  You love them all.  That's why you're here, trying to decide either to upgrade from cassette tape/album/eight-track/original 1985 CD release/any combination of these to the new remastered edition, or whether to finally buy your first copy of all those songs you know and love.  I'm telling you now, DON'T HESITATE!  Get this album, along with Don't Look Back (1978), in its newly remastered glory right now.  Oh, and if you don't like Boston and, more importantly, don't own any of their music, please don't waste your time or the band's fans' time by badmouthing the band and its fans in a review.  We don't particularly care what you think, and you just look rather immature doing it.  Pick your favorite band and review one of their albums.    Since the songs need no introduction, the important point to discuss here is the quality of the remastering.  The one word that describes the difference between this release and the 1985 striking is subtle.  That might not sound particularly inviting, but it really makes all the difference in the world.  Tom Scholz, as you may have heard, was personally involved in the remastering of the first two Boston albums.  He never felt satisfied with the original 16-bit digital transfers made in the mid-1980s.  When he heard that his work was being remastered and re-released without his involvement (or indeed his knowledge at all), he put his foot down, presumably the one attached to the leg of Scholz's legal rights.  He was eventually awarded the opportunity to make a 24-bit digital transfer from the original master tapes (not the second-generation, re-equalized tapes usually used for digital transfer) and conduct the entire remastering job with the help of a favorite fellow sound engineer.    Tom's work is supurb, albeit not an immediate departure from the original (especially if you tried to correct for the substandard quality of the 1985 releaseyourself, as I did).  It's a bit like watching high definition television for the first time.  Certainly you notice the difference, but is it really as good as everyone says?  But once you've been watching that hi-def TV for a month, I challenge you to watch a standard television again without noticing just how bad it really is in comparison.  That's how these remastered Boston albums are.  The difference seldom jumps right out at you, but you'll certainly hear it.  Just listen to it for a week, then put in the original Epic release and see just how bad it really was.    Allow me to describe, from my perspective (and from the standpoint of having listened to both Boston and Don't Look Back literally thousands of times each), just what has been changed.  The first thing you will notice is that the volume has been drastically raised, after the fashion of all new remasters.  Somehow Tom found a great deal of unnecessary material in the signal to remove, thus freeing up amplitude for the audible portion that made it on the disc.  Obviously compression was used, but unlike the lamentable remaster of Kansas's Point of Know Return (1977/r. 2002), it isn't oppressive.  It could be that (with no offense intended) Boston's music intrinsically includes little dynamic contrast, unlike Point.  But back to Boston; this increase in volume alone makes it worth it.  But that's not the only thing that has changed.  The bass is tighter and more consistent throughtout the album, the midranges are more present yet tighter as well, and the treble is much more focused and warm.  The horrible, tinny treble of the original transfer has been replaced with warmth approaching that of an analog copy of the signal.  It reminds me of the one time I heard a snippet of the album on eight-track (in the Henry Ford Museum, believe it or not! That says something about eight-tracks...); the warmth of that sound struck me even then.    I tried to fix the original release by running a drastic cut in treble, which made the vocals even muddier and more indistinct than they were before the alteration.  Tom, having access to the original master tapes, was able to make Brad Delp's vocals sound full and warm, yet clear and understandable, all while preserving a natural timbre in the instrumentation.    In addition, Tom was able to remove some of the rather piercing standing waves in various places.  You know, the points in the music where you had learned to brace yourself against aural assault.  All the siblants, painful cymbal crashes, and too-hot organ attacks have been ironed out, leaving the flow of the music smooth and rich.  The sound is more open and present, and if you're expecting a \\"sound stage,\\" fat chance.  And that's the point.  One reviewer said it perfectly: Boston isn't about reality; it's all rock and roll fantasy!    All in all, the Boston (r. 2006) release is a must-have, whether you've never owned the album before and are finally capitulating, or if you've owned it on album, eight-track, cassette tape, and on the original CD release in 1985.  This piece of work is a classic rock treasure and a milestone.  I listen to quite a bit of progressive rock (and I don't particularly care for some of the over-glossy, over-produced corporate rock that came in the 1980s), but I still listen to Boston and enjoy every minute of it.    Why are you still reading this?!  Get out there and buy Boston (r. 2006)!
B000ETQRCM|1.0|These guys must hate music.  Because they are the worst.  And they have paved the wave for awful bands like Nickleback.  Pearl Jam is for people who just stopped listening to Jimmy Buffett and Bearnaked Ladies.  And then they decided to move on.  These songs contained here are the worst ever.  And Pearl Jam is the worst ever.  I laugh when I listen to these songs...are you seroius.  Yes.  They are and that is what makes it even worse.  All of the songs seemed forced.  Like an eighth grader wrote it for the talent show at summer camp.  This music is detached from nature and is false.  Even 10, looking back is some pretty gawd awful stuff... <br /> <br />But there are Pearl Jam fans.  And they love thier Jam.  And who am I to say.  I know some of them and they are nice people.  But when it come down to music...There is just no talking to them... <br /> <br />Check out some other \\"rock\\" bands out there...and explore your world. <br /> <br />Don't sit in the mud... <br /> <br />
B00015YVD6|1.0|We rec'd the Splash dvd and were quite a way into viewing it when it just went digital garbage -- all our other dvd's seem to work alright and we have a laser disk cleaner and try to run it through regularly -- i already threw away the container -- we will run the cleaner thru again and see if it clears up the problem - this is the first time we've bought a dvd that had a problem - we've always been very satisfied with the amazon service -- and products as well. <br /> <br />thanks for asking <br /> <br />pgammons
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood is an amazing show from season 1 all the way to its sudden end.  It is a well-written family drama that shows real life situations.  I can't beleive the CW has taken it off the air for next season.  The first season DVD is great... one every home collection should have.  I am looking forward to the release of the rest of the seasons when Warner Brothers comes to their senses.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|The original King Kong was one of my all time favorite movies and I still love it, but I must say that I actually love this remake more.  The spectacular special effects, characters you care about (I love the relationship between Jimmy and Mr. Hayes, Denham and his assistant) and of course the wonderfully poignant and tender friendship of Ann and Kong.  Another thing I love about this movie is Jack Driscoll's bravery, he is relentless in his pursuit of the woman he loves and after she loses Kong she realizes that Jack has gone to enormous lengths to find her, how could she not reciprocate his love.  Adrian Brody is great in this role as is the beautifully expressive Naomi Watts.  I love everything about this movie including the opening scenes of 30s NYC, the shots of the vaudeville circuit and the animals, I didn't feel it dragged the film down, neither does the ship's journey to Skull Island, the scene where the fog surrounds the ship as they near the island is extremely creepy.  All of the prehistoric creatures are amazing and frightening and the island/jungle itself is remarkable.  My favorite scene probably is after Kong's triumphant battle with the T-Rex's and he sort of shames Ann into running after him, he finally picks her up and puts her on his shoulder, it's as though he's thinking, \\"after all I've done for you, you try to escape from me, hmmmph!\\"  This is a wonderfully engrossing film with characters you care about.  And the musical score is lovely too.  As Ann and Kong would say, King Kong is beautiful...
B0009A40ES|5.0|the 2 separate commentaries by Harron and Turner were very insightful.  The several featurettes were great.  I definitely recommend this movie
0375707972|4.0|I admit it. This book sat on my shelf a while, and was almost doomed to obscurity when I found out it had been chosen as one for the club by Oprah. But once I picked it up, I whizzed through it.<br /><br />At first, I wondered if the style of writing- distant, reserved- was a function of the translation from the original German. But in retrospect, I don't think so. The reserve that Michael and Hannah have through much of their relationship- the withholding of information from each other- and the somewhat clinical catharsis that Michael claims for writing the book, are well served by the coolness in language. This is not a novel of passion, though it does have passion in it, but a novel of exploration and examination. It is to the author's credit and to his translator Carol Brown Janeway, that the book reads so easily and so well.<br /><br />The story explores extremely difficult subjects, including the Holocaust. But it is also about coming to terms with guilt. And there are so many types of guilt and so many reactions explored in the pages.<br /><br />I imagine this was a book popular with bookclubs all over the place.
6305744793|5.0|The movie which probably brought Christina Ricci, probably the most talented post World War 2 actress, to the attention of a wider audience. The strange antics of the famous Addams family are known to most people from both the TV series, this film and its successor - Addams Family Values. It is a classic and, judging my the number of remakes of famous films of that era, due for a remake

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Great CD...it was worth the wait.  Excellent messages in the lyrics.
B00005JA2B|5.0|Kansas is an anomaly in American rock.  They are probably the only truly progressive rock band in American history, and a damn good one.  They can stand with any of the great British progressive bands (and I love progressive rock).  This album is definitely the one I dig the most.  While Song for America and Point of No Return are excellent too, this one is the most consistent with not one bad track in the whole album.  My 2 favorite songs are Miracles Out of Nowhere and Magnum Opus.  I love the intricacy of both of them, especially the latter.  From their debut through Monolith, they were putting out great album after great album.  Their arrangements and songwriting was some of the best American rock ever produced.  It's a shame that they splintered in the 1980's, and ended up in so many different incarnations.  But we still have their 70's output to hold onto...

B00005YU1O|5.0|An insightful look into the abstract human mind.  The movie basically consists of the main character moving throughout a dream, discussing theories of all of life's complexities and mysteries with random people.  This is not a movie for the narrow-minded, thinking outside the box is a prerequisite for enjoying this movie.    In addition to heavy abstract intellectual themes, the visual technique, called rotoscoping, creates a dreamlike, \\"other worldly\\" feel to the movie.
B00005JM02|5.0|Excellent film.  I appreciated how there were moments that illustrated the threats to sea life that industrial fishing poses.  Fishing giants like Tyson utilize massive nets that can hold 14 jumbo jets.  The trawlers also drag metal contraptions along the ocean floor, and destroy everything in its path, like coral.  Then there is the issue of the coral reefs dying due to slight increases in water temperature.  It's really a sin what's being done to the world's oceans.  Hopefully, Finding Nemo will spark some interest in youth to become ocean biologists or environmental activists like those with Greenpeace.

0385336691|5.0|I always think of Superman when I read a Jack Reacher novel.  Whenever Reacher enters a dangerous situation, we know that everything will be all right.  Reacher gets involved in helping find a kidnapped woman and child, and much of the time he acts in good faith--trying to find them. After while, he realizes that things are not as they seem, and now he has to go about undoing the damage that he has inadvertently done.  There is a great deal of tension in this thriller, and it is a compelling read.  If you are not familiar with Child's series, you are missing some great reading. Look on Amazon.com for a list of his other books about this great character.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|with all the R&B songs today talking about my hoe or my b...es, or some other nonsense,  St. Elsewhere is exactly what the doctor ordered.  It has a very funky dance beat and is socially concious without sounding preachy.  The non-dance songs(which I'm sure will be remixed into dance songs) are easy to listen to and with the words included even more fun to sing along with.  I have told all my friends to purchase this cd and so far all are very happy they did.
0684803356|1.0|I hate not finishing a book that I've started, but in the case of this incredibly long, drawn-out, and boring novel, I had no qualms whatsoever. The characters are as unsympathetic as they come, with the 2-D Maria who has probably never entertained a thought in her head, she is so stupid and empty, except to please Robert Jordan, who spends hundreds and hundreds of pages just thinking random thoughts, and walking from place to place. I thought that Anna Karenina was long and drawn out, but even at 800 + pages that book was less drawn out than this wprthless piece. It was completely unnecessary for it to be so long--one of Hemingway's short stories, about an old man on a bridge during the spanish civil war, at less than 3 pages is ten times more movign and poignant than this book. And it doesn't even really paint the Spanish civil war all that well--if you really want a glimpse of what it was like, go rent and watch the classic movie \\"La lengua de los mariposas\\" or \\"Butterfly\\" in English, which will give you a better idea and much mroe enjoyment at the same time. This book also isn't really that action-packed at all for a war book--I'd say fighting and battle takes up maybe two-fifths fo the book at the most, it's mostly just talking, long stories, long ten page thought streams of RJ, or just walking from place to place, describing things with some of the longest run-on sentences I've ever seen (anyone who tells you that Hemingway's style was just short and simple sentences is full of it in regard to this book). <br /> <br />In short, this book is not worth your time--read one of Hemingway's short stories if you must, but not this long, drawn out, boring yarn.
B000301YY8|5.0|This album is not something you'd expect from a guy who studied engineering, was a part of the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo, rode horseback for the Queen and watched over the Queen Mother as she lay in state. Colorful background aside, it's hard to imagine his reedy falsetto warbling through the streets of Serb villages or recording music in his landlady's bathroom, but that's exactly the way it happened for James Blunt.<br /><br />His voice takes a little getting used to, but the track \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" brings to mind Supertramp's \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" from the Breakfast in America album. Most of the other tracks display a lot of raw emotion. Drawing from personal experience, he sings of love, heartbreak, pain, relationships and unattainable romance.<br /><br />The first single \\"High\\" asks:<br /><br />\\"Will you be my shoulder when I'm grey and older?<br /><br />Promise me tomorrow starts with you\\"<br /><br />Other prime tracks are \\"Wisemen\\" the second hit single; \\"You're Beautiful\\" about a love that can never be; and \\"So Long Jimmy\\" and \\"Billy\\" which up the tempo just a tad.<br /><br />As the emotionally charged track \\"Cry\\" begins:<br /><br />\\"I have seen peace, I have seen pain,<br /><br />Resting on the shoulders of your name.<br /><br />Do you see the truth through all their lies?<br /><br />Do you see the world through troubled eyes?<br /><br />And if you want to talk about it anymore,<br /><br />Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder.<br /><br />I'm a friend.\\"<br /><br />After you listen to this album, you'll feel you have a friend in James.<br /><br />Amanda Richards
B000002AS3|5.0|I didn't get into Oasis until the latter part of the '90s, but I can readily imagine how revolutionary their debut sounded to British audiences when it first came out. Combining a pummeling guitar surge with the melodicism of the Beatles and the psychedelic sensibilities of the Stone Roses, \\"Definitely Maybe\\" still sounds like a world-beater. From Britpop touchstone \\"Shakermaker\\" to riff monster \\"Supersonic\\" to the melancholy yet anthemic \\"Slide Away,\\" every track is an era-defining classic. Simply put, this is one of the landmark British debut albums of all time.
0143039830|2.0|Mr. Auster's Trilogy is strong in stylistic innovation but sadly lacking in imagination. His themes, plots and characters reveal a writer with a broad exposure to European literature, but the sum total of the work feels repetitive, impoverished and too smart for his own good. I lost patience for his empty characters devoid of specificity. At times, it seemed like endless, nonproductive navel gazing on the life of being an artist/sleuth. It reminds me of a much weak version of Martin Amis' Times Arrow, which I rather liked, for all its flaws.
076781326X|5.0|This timeless musical is one of our children's favourites.  They sing the songs, play them on the piano, and act out parts of the movie.  The lyrics of the songs are much better than some of the 'music' out today.  The movie has spawned a lot of healthy discussion about material goods and feelings.
B00004XMV6|4.0|this is the best example of the genre. quality wise very different from the other erotic-thriller-psychological etc stuff. watch this movie as Kim will take your soul away. definitely one of the most beautiful women of all time.
B000EULJLU|3.0|before i say anything, imagine there was no tool therefore no reputation for tool. i would say, this is a good album, i wonder what theyll do next. but, the sad truth is tool does have a reputation and they do exist and they are one of my favorite bands and i cant take it away from them. this is a good album i can listen to it and enjoy it, the first 2 tracks are amazing. but, i could not help but anticipate so much more for a period of 5 years!! they have these 3-d goggles that you can see cool trippy images in the booklet, and i think they spent 2.5 years on that and 2.5 years on the music to tell you the truth. tool were always musicians to me, bands that were always gonna surprise you, and this album is the first time i can say that it sounds like theyve merely repeated themselves. this album sounds far too similar to lateralus and its hard to get over that because after 5 years of extreme anticipation (im talking checking their website every 2 weeks to hear something) this album just doesnt cut it, i was expecting a fresh, new, exciting kind of sound with some hints of old tool, but i got vice versa with some hints of new sound and mostly old tool. i feel like this review is completely bashing it and making it seem like i dont like it, but i do, i just expected a hell of a lot more.
B0000C1HLF|3.0|The story is pretty good, but it's a little boring, and I skip a few parts sometimes. The last action scene in Hollywood is okay, it's not that good, either. I think the first part was much, much better, but this one wasn't so bad.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This album is exactly what the title is...elsewhere. Cee-Lo continues his eclectic ways from his Goodie Mob days, while Danger Mouse still is hooked on Fruity Loops. The drum patterns are unorthodox and may be offensive to some pure drummers. Personally, I enjoy the electronic sound this album has. My favorites are Feng Shui and Who Cares?, but Dance is a great way to close the album. It kinda has a 60's groove to it, reminding me of a disco hop (don't worry...you only hear it through a song or two). Those who liked the Grey Album (a Mash up between Jay-Z and the Beatles) should listen to this one.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|the movie is good and thought provoking. very moving and funny in parts.well deserving of its 2 oscar nominations.would like to mention the song \\" travelling throu\\", one word to discribe it is awesome!!!!!! one of the most inspirational songs i have heard for a long time.the theme song fits the message of the movie really well. listen to the song and you will see what i mean.dolly parton wrote the sond and recorded it.parton and huffman deserved the reconition that they received. well done!!!!
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I'm not really a rock fan in particular...I choose hip hop first. However, I'm a RHCP fan ever since Blood Sugar Sex Magic. They did a great job with this LP, and I always am relaxed when I play it. The lead single and Hey are my favorite tracks. I think they didn't stray from their sound in this album, so loyal fans should be alright with it. The bass licks are unbelievable...I only wish I could do that.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Is this a dream?  Boston' first album finally remastered.  This is one of my top ten favorite albums of all time.  I grew up listening to this album and it so captures the essence of those summers without being cheesy.  The lyrics are so positive and the music so grand it is great to see this recording get its due.  There really is nothing else that sounds like this album. Get out your tennis rackets and try to keep up!  The solos are still truly sweet after all these years.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I'm sure I sound like every other person jumping on the bandwagon after buying \\"Sing the Sorrow\\", But I remember being 16 listening to \\"The Art of Drowning\\" thinking, How could this get any better?  This album isn't horrible or disappointing like most critics are saying, it is just different.  This is what makes a great band great, the ability to expand their sound to different levels and capacities.  For a real fan of any band, they can appreciate the fact that they do not want their current work of art to mirror the last.  AFI has exposed us all to a different angle of their genius and we should all be thankful for it cause I am pretty sure the reason so many people hate this album is because the're to f**king slow to understand and interpret the deeper meaning of each track.  Quit acting like a detective with a fine-tooth comb and just lose yourself in this album.
B000AA305M|4.0|David Gray has always been a favorite of mine. Very mellow songs but great for work or just relaxing.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|When the first version of the Dvd trilogy came out, everyone complained that there were no original trilogy dvd's available (except bootlegs), now that they are available, you complain about something else..    I am glad they are finally available on dvd, because I couldn't take having to watch Vhs if I wanted to watch the originals.    While it is a bit unfair that we are getting both the changed versions and the originals seeing as most of us already purchased them, and now we have to own them twice, we should all just accept that for the most part we are all suckers and will buy them anyway..!

B0009A1AS2|5.0|Octavarium is Dream Theater's 8th full-length studio album and it shows the band stripped down in terms of song length, playing tight, muscular 5-8 minute songs in their own style.  And it's great! <br /> <br />The album starts off with part 3 of Mike Portnoy's AA suite, The Root of All Evil.  After an atmospheric beginning, it launches into a brutal riff that moves from point to point during the song, leading to an excellent chorus.  It's followed by a very nice ballad-type rocker, The Answer Lies Within.  These Walls is another favorite of mine.  An all-out metal assault, slow and burning, with once again a really great chorus.  Never Enough and Panic Attack are two of the heaviest songs Dream Theater have ever committed to disc, and they're EXCELLENT.  I Walk Beside You is pure DT pop, the poppiest song they've ever recorded.  It is, however, catchy and enjoyable. <br /> <br />Which brings us to the last two songs on the album, the first being the 9/11-related Sacrificed Sons.  It starts off hauntingly with excellent singing from James LaBrie before going into a really powerful and emotive metal section.  It returns to the haunting beginning as it ends.  11 minutes of pure emotion. <br /> <br />The last song, the title track, Octavarium, clocks in at 24 and is the most \\"prog\\" sounding long song DT have written since the title track of Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  It's 24 minutes long, the one song going against the pared-down song lengths on the album.  It's also one of DT's finest moments.  Moving from section to excellent section seamlessly, and recorded with an orchestra(!), it starts off very atmospheric before kicking in around the 4 minute mark.  The overriding theme is the circular nature of life, the world, the universe, etc (as far as what I can tell from the very cool lyrics).  Throughout it all there is metal riffing, Rush-like rock, acoustic sections, and snarling vocals from LaBrie when he wants to be \\"out of this octavarium\\".  A rollercoaster ride of a song that leaves you breathless when it ends 24 minutes later.  Genius. <br /> <br />Octavarium shows that Dream Theater, nearly 20 years on, is still evovling and changing, not rehashing old ground yet retaining their signature songwriting, level of musicianship, and signature sound.  We can only look forward to their next offering knowing this!
078681859X|5.0|The Amulet of Samarkand is the first book in the Bartimaeus Trilogy, which was recently completed with the publication of Ptolemy's Gate.  It weaves in and out between two stories - that of Nathaniel, a pitifully neglected magician's apprentice, and Bartimaeus, a quick-tongued djinni (genie) that the gifted Nathaniel manages to summon.  The story is set in the London of a different world, in which Britain and all its extensive territories are run by magicians.  After a particularly nasty incident with a magician called Simon Lovelace, the shaken Nathaniel begins to spy on Lovelace in hopes of finding a way to exact revenge.  Quite by accident, he stumbles upon a plot to overthrow the government by very violent and murderous means.  What follows is a high-speed chase through the twists and turns of the government that will ultimately lead to Nathaniel's (and consequently Bartimaeus') death or rise to power. <br /> <br />What makes this story so readable, is Bartimaues' intellect and smart humor.  He talks back, jibes, and pokes - making the audience laugh with gusto at Nathaniel's expense.  The Amulet of Samarkand is a very enjoyable read for all ages.  The trilogy's later books meet the high expectations set by this one.  Readers will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />5-stars and a good laugh.
0884271536|5.0|Face it, everything that happens in a business is either a process or a project.  Even companies that manage projects for a living (e.g. construction, software development) often are lousy at managing internal projects (working ON the business). If you have anything to do with projects, you need to read this book.  It will change how you look at projects forever.  This guy is brilliant.
B000067CPX|5.0|By The Way is the 8th studio album by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and one of their best.  Although many regard it as the \\"big change\\" that so many bands seemed to be going through, change is not always a bad thing. In fact, musically By The Way is superior to their other albums.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the old Chili Peppers and the intense funk and punk fusion they created (there's still some left), but after loving and devouring this album, I can proudly say I love the new Chili Peppers with their noticeable musical growth and unstoppable talent. <br /> <br />I always feel that reviews are helpful in deciding whether or not to buy an album, or just to truly understand an album you can't quite figure out.  So I've written my own track-by-track review that I hope will prove helpful. <br /> <br />1 The title track \\"By The Way\\" is the first taste of the new album. It begins with a guitar and bass harmony and mellow vocals, but quickly jumps into a new energy with Flea's rumbling bass, John's rhythmic muted guitar, and Chad's explosive drumming. It's enough to get you up and jumping. Anthony's single-word and rapping verses are an interesting combination, but you soon find yourself rapping along.  I love the rockin' sing-along chorus and the harmony we often hear between Anthony and John.  An instant classic. <br /> <br />2 \\"Universally Speaking\\" was written by Flea (I discovered this while watching an interview with John) and is an upbeat song with a constant snare hit.  I don't particularly love the verses, but then enters the magnificent chorus.  The sweetness of Anthony's voice and John's catchy ooohs save the song for me.  There's also a very simple guitar solo on the outro that's definitely worth listening to. <br /> <br />3 A haunting song about drugs, \\"This Is The Place\\" puts Flea's bass in the spotlight. I like the spacey guitars on this one along with the almost spoken vocals on the prechorus. \\"Can I isolate your gene, can I kiss your dopamine...\\" Great lyrics. Nice and different song. <br /> <br />4 \\"Dosed\\" begins with a dreamy 4-guitar part that is beautiful, catchy, and the perfect background to this romantic song. Built around the melodic vocals, Anthony does a wonderful job singing his heart out that you forget how long you've been listening to this relatively lengthy number.  Dosed ends with John playing his own variation of the vocal melody on his guitar: a great way to end a pop gem. <br /> <br />5 Flea introduces \\"Don't Forget Me\\" by playing chords on his bass, a technique I have never heard up until now. Chad has some impressive drumwork on this song too. A combined effort of Anthony's echoing vocals and John's fast picking/scratching technique give the song a strange and dizzy feel.  The chorus has some pretty heavy drums, and it's almost sounds like the Peppers are screaming, but not in a harsh way.  This is a concert favorite of theirs. <br /> <br />6 \\"The Zephyr Song\\" features a great catchy and memorable guitar riff that John delivers with emotion. Anthony's vocals really capture me and are set perfectly to the guitar rhythm.  To be honest, at first I absolutely hated the chorus. It has grown on me a bit, but it just seems a little too poppy/cheesy to fit in. Chorus aside, a great put together song. <br /> <br />7 \\"Can't Stop\\" is my favorite song on the album, one of my favorite songs by the Peppers, and one of my favorite songs in general.  When listening, it gives me such an energy rush it's unbelievable. The fun and funky guitar lick is only matched by Flea's outstanding basswork.  Anthony provides a funk feel to his rapped verses, and out of nowhere comes John's backing vocals that somehow work with everything that's going on. Then the chorus breaks in and the instruments suddenly change direction. And it's good. It's really good.  The ending is superb too.  Hardly overrated by any means, this is what the Red Hot Chili Peppers are all about. <br /> <br />8 \\"I Could Die For You\\" brings out the moremelodic and calm side of RHCP.  A charming love song with sincere vocals and a true melody makes it a worthwhile listen. The prechorus is what gets stuck in my head the most though. Overall a nice softer song.  <br /> <br />9 \\"Midnight\\" begins with a collection of strings and you think, what are they possibly gonna do here? But when they end and you hear a spooky combination of wind and feedback along with John's beautiful chords, you breathe a sigh of relief. Anthony's vocals once again are the song's strongest aspect. A unique and uplifting song. <br /> <br />10 \\"Throw Away Your Television\\" brings back the funk that was missing on the last two songs with a little bit of a tribal feel.  Flea's bass as you might expect is constant and what really makes the song. Chad's drumming also shines through and is a perfect accompaniment to the bass. Nothing too strong vocally here, but what's there works enough.  John's bleepy \\"Tom-Morello-anti-guitarish\\" solo at the end is good too. <br /> <br />11 In \\"Cabron\\" the Red Hot Chili Peppers live up to their spicy name and go latin! I never would have guessed how well they could pull it off.  John's acoustic guitar is just as fun and impressive as his electric, and Chad's drumming provides most of the latin feel.  Anthony's vocals are distinct and feel new and different (Rolling his r's in Cabron is a real treat). A song that definitely grows on you and becomes an album favorite. <br /> <br />12 \\"Tear\\" the slowest song on the album still stands strong as Anthony's sad vocals create the emotion.  It's long, but with the help of a great guitar solo, and even a trumpet solo, the songs feels complete. <br /> <br />13 \\"On Mercury\\" puts the Peppers in ska mode and a new instrument is played throughout the song (harmonica maybe?). Nothing too impressive Flea-wise but Anthony puts his funky vocal style to work here.  The backing vocals on the chorus are a little spooky. A very weird but cool track. <br /> <br />14 \\"Minor Thing\\" is an incredible song that has everything it needs to be another favorite track.  Beginning with a nicely rhymed verse by Anthony, the song is graced by John's beautiful array of chords and Chad's perfect drumming.  Flea at one point has a buzzing bass line complimented by a funk verse that Anthony never fails to deliver. The one line chorus \\"It's just a minor thing, and I'm a minor king\\" is still pretty and filling.  <br /> <br />15 \\"Warm Tape\\" is the perfectly awkward title to this perfectly awkward song. It opens with Flea providing the melody, Chad with short drum fills, and a strange but almost annoying effect in the background. This song however contains my favorite harmony between Anthony and John in the second verse, and boy do they sound perfect together. The chorus doesn't really fit in with the verses, but its good anyway. The harmony is what you should really look for, and makes this track meaningful. <br /> <br />16 The last track \\"Venice Queen\\" I think of as two separate parts, due to the sudden change in music at around 2:45. The first part has an incredibly catchy and rhythmic guitar lick.  The weird but cool affects in the background give it a surreal feel. Anthony's voice matches the guitar flawlessly and John helps vocally too. Too soon, the music suddenly changes as John strums an acoustic.  A good rock ending and G-L-O-R-I-A is fun to sing along to.  You can hear this stunning album come to its end.
B0009H1CK6|5.0|This is the most amazing music DVD I have ever seen. This DVD is worth ten times the price. The talent that is on display left me wide-eyed. Whether you are a fan of Chic or not, if you love real music, this DVD is for you.
0783226845|4.0|Al Pacino (The Godfather, Looking for Richard) won an Oscar for Best Actor for his outstanding performance as Lt. Col. Frank Slade. I have bought the tape through Amazon and have watched it a bazillion times. I have seen many other actors playing a blind man but Pacino outwits them all. I have watched it closely just to watch his eyes. He is terrific! Every time we watch the movie we spend at least two days going: \\"Oo-rah!\\" I like prep school movies and I have two movies where Chris O'Donnell (Circle of Friends) Charlie Simms is in a prep school. I guess it goes with his type. I like the part of Charlie who is doing the best he can with the weekend he has to face. One of the most difficult things for people is to feel is useless. That is how Lt. Co. Frank Slade feels. He also has a cynicism about life that in a sense is funny because of its irony. He meets Charlie and has everything planned out. The Colonel has extremely good taste. Meeting young Charlie, who is in a very difficult situation, the outspoken Lt. Col. found a reason to live and to feel useful again, even enjoying the smell of the perfume of Charlie's teacher. I did not see the 1974 Italian film \\"PROFUMO DI DONNA,\\" but would love to see the performance of the late Vittorio Gassman, one of the most well known actor of the Italian Theater and Cinema. My Favorite Scenes: Lt. Col. driving in New York city, dancing tango, and giving a speech before the student body, to clear up Charlie's name. This is a great movie! My Favorite Quotes: Lt. Col. Frank Slade: \\"Oo-rah!\\" ...\\" But there isn't nothing' like the sight of an amputated spirit, there is no prosthetic for that..\\" \\"There are two kinds of people in this world, Charlie. The first group are the people that face the music; the second group are those who run for cover. Cover is better.\\" <br />  <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed this series when it was on commercial television the first time around.  Was home sick one day when SciFi Channel ran the series, and was immediately hooked.  I only add the best to my collection, and this definitely fits the bill!  It's scrappy, intelligent, campy, and comfortable.  Check it out!  You won't be disappointed!
B000F3TBIO|5.0|This is a good cd if you're looking for something different. The beats kinda reminds me of the Gorillaz records but with Mike on vocals it's more interesting. The cd grooves and sounds good in a car or on headphones. Not really a pop record IMO, but compared to other stuff Patton's done I see why ppl say that. Also, this cd has longevity. I've listened to it all the way thru at least 20 times. I still luv it! <br />
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Honest, liberating, humorous and embellished take on being single in fabulous NYC. SITC shows NYC at it's best. The characters are endearing. Laugh, cry and enjoy a vicarious trip through the lives and loves of Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte. <br />As a fan of the HBO series it is a special treat to watch the episodes back to back.

B00008YJHC|5.0|It seems like when it comes to the Pixies, the talk is generally \\"Surfer Rosa this\\" and \\"Doolittle that,\\" and while those are certainly good albums I've never figured out why Bossanova got so much less attention than its two predecessors.  With the exception of Trompe Le Monde (which I plan on getting around to eventually, I swear) I've heard pretty much the Pixies' whole output, and out of of everything this album keeps me coming back the most often.  Bossanova turns down the noise assaults from the Pixies' earlier career down just a bit, but in their place is a more arty, spacey effort that throws some heavy surf-rock influence into the band's already wide-ranging sound.  Sure, there may not be anything that completely matches the sheer visceral immediacy of Broken Face or Tame, but for track-by-track excellence and diversity Bossanova is difficult if not impossible to top.<br /><br />After the blistering, hard-rocking instrumental opener Cecilia Ann sets the tone, Bossanova immediately commences careening all over the musical map in a way the legions of alternative imitators that emerged in the 90's wouldn't even dream of.  With Black Francis screaming his head off at full volume, the angry, assaultive Rock Music sounds like Debaser on steroids, but from there the album takes a turn into more diverse and overall compelling territory that sounds little like previous albums.  Songs constantly veer off in unpredictable directions, making Bossanova more of an acquired taste than its predecessors, but it's one more than worth acquiring.  This album represents the Pixies' peak as musicians (at least to that point); the rawer edges from Surfer Rosa and Doolittle had definitely been toned down, but those albums didn't contain anything quite like the complex, Talking Heads-like rhythms of Dig For Fire or the dense, proto-grunge sheets of guitar noise of Down to the Well.  The Pixies' legendary use of dynamics was also honed to perfection here: just check out the way the whiplash guitars kick in at the perfect time in the soaring, etheral Velouria, or the way Black Francis's eery vocals and Kim Deal's crawling bassline give way to the headbanging chorus of Is She Weird.<br /><br />All Over the World is one of the strangest things the Pixies ever did, a sprawling epic (by Pixies standards, anyway) filled with spacey lyrics and searing lead guitar lines from Joey Santiago that seem to come out of nowhere.  And is that a falsetto Black Francis is doing with his voice?  Well, yeah, most of the time, but it works perfectly for the song's trippy, drug-like feel.  Even when they're plowing ahead at full speed, as on Allison and Hang Wire, the band's more tuneful, surf-rock direction is apparent, but it's even more evident on pleasant, literally pacific tracks like Ana and the closing Havalina.<br /><br />My enduring favorite from this album, though, would have to be Happening.  It doesn't start off all that unusually for a Pixies song, with Black Francis screaming his bizarrely imagistic lyrics on top of some slashing guitars and atomic bass riffs, but over its running time it just gets progressively eerier and more demented, with lots of surfy breaks popping up in the mix, culminating in Black Francis's stream-of-consciousness, half-spoken-half-sung mantra as the song fades out.  It's a total classic, just like this album, and essential listening for those who want to hear alternative rock from back when the label meant something.he whiplash guitars kick in at the perfect time in the soaring, etheral Velouria, or the way Black Francis's eery vocals and Kim Deal's crawling bassline give way to the headbanging chorus of Is She Weird.   <br /> <br />All Over the World is one of the strangest things the Pixies ever did, a sprawling epic (by Pixies standards, anyway) filled with spacey lyrics and searing lead guitar lines from Joey Santiago that seem to come out of nowhere.

0316172324|5.0|If you're interested in finding out what researchers know about the unconscious mind and discover hints into reading others unconscious thoughts, Blink is a must. I'm thankful to my friend who reccommended it to me, but I'll charge him the eye drops I used because this book kept me so interested that I hardly blinked during reading it.
0380789019|4.0|This book was my first read of Neil Gaiman.  It was highly recommended to me, and couldn't put it down for long.  I would have given the book five stars if I could have related to the main character (Richard) more.  I didn't like him much, too weak for my taste, however other characters were very rich and unique.  The things I liked best were Neil's writing, the humor, and the unpredictability of the story.  I laughed out laugh several times.  I would recommend this book to those who enjoy reading a fun story where anything goes.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|I was expecting a Queer As Folk kinda drama to happen in this film and also was ready to walk out of the movie theatre but boy was I wrong. I mean these guys had, what they think was one night stand and nothing more. Years later, they met and the feelings they have for each other became stronger and hard to break, even it had to be that way at the end in order to follow society's policies and procedures and save their marriage. I believe and know that there are some people out there in this same situation(DL, as some will call it) but the thing is love comes in different forms and shapes. I love the moive and will watch it over and over again. Wonderful flick
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|First things first, I have never seen the Colin Firth version of \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" which has gotten such rave reviews, and I have never read the book by Jane Austen.  With that said, I think I came into the movie unbiased and had nothing to compare it to.  I loved this movie and felt that it had several key aspects to make it a great movie.  First, Keira Knightley does an amazing job as Elizabeth and she has a face that is so captivating that you cannot keep your eyes off of her.  In every movie she is in, she steals the scene.  Matthew Macfayden does an excellent job as Mr. Darcy as he transforms himself in the movie from one type of character to another.  When you're supposed to dislike him, you do.  When you're supposed to like him, you do.  Simon Woods as Mr. Bingley also does an excellent job and is very likable throughout the movie.  \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" has great pacing, beautiful cinematography, and conflict which kept you involved in everyone's lives.  Plus, it has Donald Sutherland as the father who plays each line to perfection.  One suggestion I would make to somebody watching is to what I did.  Put the Subtitles on the DVD so you won't miss a word that is said.  It is most helpful!  So I would probably give this movie about 4 1/4 stars as it had all the elements of a great movie.
B00004U680|4.0|My first concert back in about 74 was suzi quatro and alice cooper in downtown detroit. suzi came on first and damn near stole the show. She rocked from start to finish and live, her sound was much harder than came across on record. As for this cd, I got it and it is almost perfect except for the missing song\\" can the can\\" which I have on another cd luckily. The second cd I have read negative reviews on. I don't know what the reviewer was listening to but I thought it was almost as good as the first cd. Good old fashioned rock and roll influenced by chuck berry, little richard, and jerry lee lewis. Get this cd, it is well worth the money
B000C20VRS|1.0|I bought this film because I'm a fan of good gangster movies. There's no better way to understand how capitalism and the American Dream really works. I'd never seen Scarface and the reviews here made me feel I must be missing a classic. Nope. This really is unredeemably awful - and I could watch Al Pacino do cat food adverts he's that good. Brian de Palma, with a couple of exceptions, (Carlito's Way, The Untouchables), makes bloody awful films. This has a great cast, a mediocre script, truly bad direction and a soundtrack so awful that if you tried to pass it off as a pastiche of bad eighties music, it just wouldn't be plausible. I think my personal lowlights from this film come early on - the riot scene in the detention centre has no sense of menace or chaos, but consists entirely of dodgy looking extras standing on the spot, hopping from one foot to the other, waving sticks or bricks and grimacing unconvincingly. It's pathetic. And Tony Montana's first job in Miami is wonderful - he has to negotiate a deal with a Colombian coke dealer who's briefcase has two compartments - one for the coke, one for the chainsaw he uses to torture people. Isn't that fantastic? The shops must be full of stuff like that in Colombia, probably the only kind of equipment any self respecting dealer would travel with.... As for the final bloodbath - it is incredibly silly, but to get there you have to sit through two hours of a shapeless, boring tripe. If you've never seen this film, really, don't worry.
B00005JO20|2.0|Watch the 1933 original -- great movie, right? Now sit down and watch this one. Who the @#$% cast Jack Black? Let me make this brief, this movie was an enormous disappointment WITH THE EXCEPTION of the brilliantly acted and shot scenes on the ship as it arrives at the island and gets hung up on the rocks -- I loved it! The actor who played the captain was excellent. I also thought the visuals of the biplanes at the end were extraordinary, but I'd turn the air blue if I described what I thought about the rest of the movie. WAY off target, not worth viewing, honestly, and I expected a terrific movie. I left the theatre really genuinely angry, it's not as bad as \\"Alien 3\\" but it's in that league, when even little kids were leaving the theatre talking about how they'd have told the story... better.
6304458355|5.0|Just about every film you will ever watch (with a few acceptions) will have been influenced by another film, and may seem very similar to that film in more ways than one. However, Jumanji is a complete acception to this rule. It is a completely original and fantstic idea for a film, which has become unsuprisingly succesful. <br />When Alan Parish finds an old game in a building site and begins playing it with Sarah, a girl on his street, he dissappears and she is chased out of the house by a swarm of bats. Twenty Six years later, Judy and Peter find it in the attic of there new house, (the old Parish house) and they also begin to play. They release Alan, along with a hoard of unimaginable nightmares, their only hope being to finish the game, if they live that long! <br /> <br />The special effects in this movie, in there day were excelent, however they do look a little bit dated now, especially the lion. It still works well though. The acting is also pretty ok, especially from Robin Williams, who in my mind is on top form here. <br /> <br />Although this film was promoted as a family movie, some parts are pretty intense and scary, especially the beginning where the previous two children are burying the game. Therefore you may want to watch it before you show it to very young children. Having said this, it really is an excelent film and most of the family can enjoy the solid entertainment. <br /> <br />If you buy this film then i guarentee that you will be gripping your seat,and will be thinking of nothing else until the end. Well worth buying.
0765315246|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  It was a really nice love story.  Now all of you are saying \\"love story?\\"  Well, yes, a love story between the protagonist and his wife of many many years.  It is also excellent military science fiction.  The battles are well written and you get to know the soldiers and the other characters.  There is not much non-violent alien to human interaction but this is not the point of the story. <br /> <br />The point is human relations, the friendship and comaradery of the soldiers, the love between a man and his wife.   <br /> <br />The technology depicted is interesting and reasonable.  There is not too much \\"magic\\" to just push along the plot.  All of it is plausible.  I thought the neatest thing was the \\"brainpal\\" that each soldier had.  This was essentially a WiFi network in your head with instant messaging.   <br /> <br />I found this a fast and fun read.
B000AARKW6|5.0|The very fact that Brian De Palma directed this film is a signal that this film is of a very high standard. Before Carlito's way he'd already directed Scarface, Carrie, The Untouchables, Casualties of War, and many many more, but this film with the possible exception of Scarface is, in my opinion, his best work. <br />The film depicts the life of a former Puerto Rican drug lord Carlito Berganzi (Al Pacino) from the moment his appeal is succesful and he is released from a 30 year prison sentence after serving only 5 years. Carlito pledges to keep his hands clean of any criminal activities...but Carlito sitting at home watching Trisha and drinking tea simply didn't cut it with the filming commission so instead he gets dragged down into the underworld yet again, mostly by his cocaine-addicted lawyer David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn), whilst the opposing force in Carlito's life, Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) tries desperately to pull him back to a normal, crime-free life. <br /> <br />The film is beautifully shot and there is no moment in the film, ever, when you think \\"oo I'll just pause it so I can go and make myself a coffee\\"...I have the attention span of a goldfish, and can rarely watch a 2hr 24mins movie without having a break in the middle for coffee, but this movie was non-stop and kept me completly engaged, 100%, from start to finish. <br /> <br />I don't need to tell you that Al Pacino does an awesome job...you already knew that, but Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller compliment Pacino's incredble acting skills perfectly. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of gangster/mob films (Scarface, Casino, Goodfella's, The Godfather Trilogy, etc) then you absoultely must see this film, NO gangster film collection can ever be complete without this momentous film. <br /> <br />This film is fully deserving of each and every one of the five stars I've given it!
B00005JOWF|3.0|After the reviews and lukewarm (at best) box office, I wasn't expecting much from Ultraviolet, but it wasn't bad as a \\"popcorn\\" action movie.  Somewhat confusing in parts, the movie has an interesting basic idea - a highly contagious virus set loose on the population - those infected become stronger, faster, get night vision (and light sensitivity), get longer \\"vampirish\\" teeth, but only live 12 years from infection.  The government rounds up those who are infected (called \\"hemophages\\") into internment centers and experiment on them.  Soon there is a resistance movement and \\"Blood Wars\\".  That's where we find Violet, a hemophage who is transporting a secret weapon stolen from the humans.   <br /> <br />The action is over-the-top violence with excellent (and sometimes bizarrely unnecessary) special effects.  Violet consistently defeats hoardes of opponents, usually armed, with her variety of guns, swords, and fighting skills.   <br /> <br />This movie was a fun watch for a rainy Sunday afternoon.  There's no sex and not much, if any swearing, but the violence would make it probably inappropriate for smaller kids. I won't be buying this one, it was worth a rent and if it's on TV I might watch it again.
0609610570|4.0|The only caution I give the reader is that this book is geared toward the upper management (CEO) level.  Pieces of this can be used an any and every level but the majority of this book is not applicable to all levels of management. <br /> <br />This book opened my eyes to things from the perspective of the highest offices of an organization.  It also let me know that most of my bosses have not been very good leaders.  I already knew this but this book pointed out their faults in great detail.

Wonderful rhymes, nice pictures-you can't go wrong with Boynton's books. (Moo, baa, lalala was another hit in our house too).

Of course, after the awesome 2nd track, \\"weak and powerless,\\" I hoped that the first track was no indication of how the rest of the album would turn out, but to my dissapointment, the rest of the album really was kind of \\"boring.\\" I'm sure there are all these 5 star ratings here on Amazon because of the creativity and talent of these guys, but the music, for me at least, was just plain not enjoyable. A Perfect Circle's first album was much more to my liking.
B000EZ7ZYA|2.0|Either this was not filmed in HD, or it is a very poor transfer/encoding. Appears to be dvd quality, at best.
B0006VU3ZA|3.0|As the previous commenters have stated, this copy is obviously a bootleg. However, considering that the two albums together come to over $27, and I got this for $9 (including shipping), the deal really isn't that bad, especially since the audio quality is decent. (Aside from volume issues, the overall quality seems as good as an original copy, although I don't consider myself to have a very discerning ear.) I guess it just reaffirms the old addage that you get what you pay for.
1400032717|5.0|This is one of the more original novels I've read -- the format includes little drawings and diagrams (including floor plans of railroad stations!) as well as an appendix that proofs a mathematical statement! <br /> <br />This English novel is written by a first person character who has Asperber's Syndrome (similar to autism but functioning at a higher level).  The main character, Christopher, is a young teenager living with his father in a small town and attending a school for special needs children.  His mother is no longer with him -- she disappeared one day and his father explained that she died of a heart attack.  The story begins when Christopher, out wandering at night, discovers his neighbor's dead dog -- and of course the neighbor's first thought is that this strange child has killed her dog.  The police are called, etc. and then Christopher -- who knows he didn't kill the dog -- is intent on finding out who did, although his father is very much opposed. THis does not stop Christopher. What makes the book stand out is the portrayal of a person whose mind works very differently from that of most people.   He has to puzzle out stuff everyone else takes for granted, like understanding metaphors or facial expressions, since he is extremely literal. He will obey to the letter, but if someone doesn't spell out a possibility as forbidden, he doesn't regard it as forbidden.  If he's told he can't ask about the dog, he reasons he can pursue the mystery as long as he doesn't ask about the dog. Christopher has a special gift for math, so math plays a fairly prominent role in the book. <br /> <br />I hope anyone who reads this review and decides to read the book will enjoy it as much as I did.  I can hardly wait to see what this author writes in the future (this was his first adult novel).
B00000IGGA|2.0|Long-time Waits fan here, with several of his albums being on my all-time favorites list. I owned this album for nearly a year, before I traded it in. It took me a while to figure out why I always wandered out of the room after a few songs and forgot about it--because it s--ks. The lyrics  either are incoherent, just strung together (eg Get Behind Mule), or veer off into the cringingly sentimental (eg House Where Nobody Lives, Chocolate Jesus). The music mostly drags, when it's not downright grating. He's lost it. You can't blame him for not knowing it, I guess. But it's long past time to write him off--since Bone Machine. (The stage works Black Rider, Alice, and Blood Money, show a consistent weakness--a lack of focus lyically as well as musically, not to mention a lot of low fi recording. I had a similar experience where it took me a few years to realized why I kept skipping tracks on Black Rider--because it mostly su-ks--and treaded it.)  <br /> <br />He peaked with the Island trilogy. My personaly favorite is Frank's Wild Years. Before the far-out sound, he also produced a lot of real poetry along with his jazz-club shtick. Now his writing seems almost like senile mumbling. And his thematic concerns hvae descended/ degenerated into the likes of loving family life. Is there any chance of a renascence? (Not as yet based on a sampling of Real Gone.)  <br /> <br />All the kids who have caught onto the Waits thing need try to think a lot harder about these songs and compare them to songs on Rain Dogs and Swordfishtrombones. Back then even when the references and language were oblique, or obscure, they developed a story or an image or a sentiment. It built from line to line--developed an idea, with continuity.  Now it's mostly a string of stylized cr-p, using the vocabulary he developed all his life but to no end.
B0000UJL96|5.0|\\"Only Nixon could go to China.\\"  Seems like an odd way for me to start off a review for a movie, especially when that movie is an entry into the venerable `Star Trek' franchise.  However, here is why this quote is appropriate, it happens to be a quote that Spock (Leonard Nimoy) uses in the film, and also serves as the inspiration for the basic storyline for the film, in which Kirk (William Shatner) must lead the Federation in an historical moment in the universe, when the Klingons and the Federation make an effort for peace.  Though the story seems intriguing enough, can this latest effort in the franchise overcome the disappointment left over from \\"Star Trek 5:  The Final Frontier\\"?  Apparently the executives over at Paramount felt the franchise was still strong enough to survive, and the gamble paid off many times over as \\"Star Trek 6:  The Undiscovered Country\\" redeemed the franchise in the eyes of the fans and at the box office. <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek 6:  The Undiscovered Country\\" finds the Enterprise and her crew fighting for peace in the galaxy between the crumbling Klingon empire and the Federation.  After years of war, the Klingons are left in a weakened state and have nowhere else to turn except to the Federation, however to make the peace the Federation must send the one man whose presence holds such respect and power that he could lead the two factions to peace.  That man is Captain Kirk (William Shatner), but can Kirk put aside his hatred for the Klingons after what happened on the Genesis planet, when a renegade Klingon murdered his son.  Agreeing to put aside his differences, begrudgingly I might add, Kirk sets out to be the ambassador for the Federation by meeting with a high-ranking Klingon official.  All goes well until the Klingon ship comes under attack, and the Klingon official is murdered, and Captain Kirk is left with the blame.  Now, not only is Kirk on trial for his life, along with that of Dr. McCoy's (DeForrest Kelley), but he must also try to prove his innocence and still ensure that peace reigns between the Klingons and the Federation. <br /> <br />After a dismal outing with the William Shatner directed \\"Star Trek 5:  The Final Frontier\\", it wouldn't have been all that surprising if Paramount had decided not to proceed with any further adventures of the starship Enterprise, at least not with the current cast.  But, thankfully Paramount thought better of letting the current crew die out, and instead brought them back for a proper farewell adventure that deals with, in a very mature way, the ramifications of the events in \\"Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock\\".  Forcing Kirk to deal with his hatred of Klingons, and demanding he lead the Federation to peace with the race he despises most, this was a true stroke of genius on the part of the writers.  The writing is another improvement in this installment, after skipping out on the previous movie Nicholas Meyer reunited with Harve Bennett to craft this perfect ending to the adventures of the original crew of the starship Enterprise.  Not only did Nicholas Meyer co-write the film, he also found himself in the director's chair yet again, he previously directed \\"Star Trek 2:  The Wrath of Khan\\", and even though it had been some time since he directed this type of film, it was clear he hadn't lost a beat, instead his directing ability had substantially improved.  The cast, which is comprised of the usual suspects from the previous films, are all very solid in their roles, and there is a distinct feeling of relief and closure with this being the final film for this particular cast.  On a side note look for a cameo of Michael Dorn (Worf on \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\") as the Klingon lawyer defending Kirk and McCoy, just a little bit of trivia for those that may not have noticed. <br /> <br />If you were one of the many fans who were turned off by the previous installment in the franchise, and was leery about this latest film, have no fear \\"Star Trek 6:  TheUndiscovered Country\\" puts the franchise back on the right track, and serves as a terrific finale for the original crew of the Enterprise. <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek 6:  The Undiscovered Country\\" is rated PG for violence and language.
B000002NE4|2.0|Sometimes a record, book or movie comes out that seems to get everybody excited but me. For some reason I fail to see what's so good about it. The critical praise amazes me as much as it irritates me.  <br />Nick Cave is my idol, icon and favorite mad preacher. I've tried on amazon.com here to express my feeling toward most of his albums. Most of them I liked, liked very much actually, and there really are just a few things Nick can do wrong.  <br /> <br />But with \\"The boatman's call\\" he does menage to completely disappoint me. A range of twelve introvert ballads are offered here, and there is not one I really care about. Not one that moves me, and believe me, Nick Cave has sung some ballads that really got underneath my skin. \\"Mercy\\" on the \\"Tender prey\\" album, \\"Stranger than kindness\\" on \\"Your funeral... my trial\\", even with his former band, the punk act The Birthday Party, he offered some really moving low-key songs like \\"Jeniffer's veil\\" and \\"Several sins\\".  <br /> <br />In 1994 Nick came with the sublime \\"Let love in\\", which would be the album with the most perfect blend of manic burst-out songs and paced ballads like the sing-along title track and the beautiful and echoing \\"Do you love me (Part 2)\\". <br /> <br />Next output was the inky black \\"Murder ballads\\", and although it was very tongue-in-cheek, it still offered us some catchy slow songs like \\"Song of Joy\\" and the P.J. Harvey duet \\"Henry Lee\\". <br /> <br />But is was in 2001 that one of Nick's most marvelous albums saw the light of day: \\"No more shall we part\\". All ballads, no rock songs. But the songs here all had something unique and harsh. <br />Deeply rooted blackness and anxiety were made into songs of everlasting beauty. <br />Nick Cave surprises with each song, like with the rainy piano-guided opener \\"As I sad sadly by her side\\", with the Godfearing whisper on \\"God is in the house\\", the female choir during the coda of  \\"Hallelujah\\", the tender but haunting \\"Sweetheart come\\" and with \\"The sorrowful wife\\", on which he does loses his temper for a brief moment and cries out in vein. <br /> <br />For some reason every song hit the bull's eye and therefor I cannot understand why \\"The boatman's call\\", released between the gem \\"No more shall we part\\" and the other two winners, \\"Let love in\\" and \\"Murder ballads\\", is such a let down. <br /> <br />But hey, everybody else is cheering, so maybe, just maybe, it's just me. <br /> <br />
B00078XGRO|5.0|This film, \\"Star Trek:  First Contact\\", being the first official `Next Generation' only `Star Trek' movie, the creative teams behind this picture had their hands full with trying to come up with an original storyline that would be exciting to audiences, both `Trekkies' and non, while still maintaining the quality and tone of the TV series that this crew hails from.  To solve this problem, the writers came up with a brilliant story that would serve as a closer to a few episodes that occurred during the series that were held as fan-favorites, of course the episodes I'm referring to deal with the deadliest villains this crew ever faced, the Borg.  The Borg are cybernetic beings that are linked into one another in a sort of hive, in their society there is no individuality, everyone is the same, and their collective goal is to assimilate every being in the universe, adding their characteristics and culture into theirs, therefore making them the ultimate beings.  In the series, the first appearance of the Borg was a 2-part episode arc titled \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\", in the story the Borg capture Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart), assimilating him and all his knowledge into their collective.  This leaves the rest of the crew of the Enterprise-D in a massive dilemma, do they stage a rescue for their beloved captain, or do what is right for Starfleet and destroy the Borg cube and their captain along with it.  In the episodes, the crew led by Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) led a rescue to get Captain Picard back, and after successfully removing the Borg influence from him, gained some very helpful insight into the inner-workings of this new villainous species.  So for the story in this movie the writers chose to force Captain Picard and his crew to face that terrible time yet again, and this time the Borg are much more powerful, and have some new tricks up their sleeves. <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek:  First Contact\\" as I stated above finds the crew of the newly commissioned Enterprise-E coming face-to-face with the Borg yet again.  However, the difference this time is that the Borg has learned a new trick, time travel.  During a conflict between the Enterprise and a Borg cube, the cube launches a Borg sphere in an attempt to escape before the destruction of the cube ship.  However, this sphere contains the capability for time travel, so with the Enterprise in hot pursuit the cube travels back in time with the Enterprise close behind and transporting both ships into the past.  The specific moment in time that the sphere picked to return to seemed random at first, but instead held a much more sinister reason, the sphere returned to the past to stop a scientist from conducting the first warp drive test.  If the Borg succeeds in stopping this warp drive test, two things happen, the future that the crew of the Enterprise knows ceases to exist because without warp drive there is no Starfleet, and the second thing is that if the test doesn't occur, first contact with the alien race known as Vulcans will not happen.  So, not only does the Enterprise-E and her crew have to save the people of the past from the assimilation of the Borg, but also save their own futures before its too late. <br /> <br />In their second adventure on the big screen the crew of the Enterprise-E were forced to tackle their deadliest villains, the Borg.  Many fans that were disillusioned by the previous `Star Trek' movie effort, \\"Star Trek:  Generations\\", were very pleased to learn that the Borg were being chosen as the villains for this film.  With the expectations for this movie very high, the stage was set for `Star Trek' to once again be number one at the box office.  The problem with hype is that most of the time the hype overshadows the movie, and though the movie may still be successful, it would still be considered somewhat of a failure if the film even remotely disappointed any fans.  This problem was easily bypassed by this movie, the creative forces behind \\"Star Trek:  First Contact\\" crafted a terrific story of intense drama, fast-paced and energetic action, and some bits of humor, and needless to say audiences were not disappointed in the least.  In fact, many `Trekkies' hold \\"Star Trek:  First Contact\\" in high regard, and view it as possibly one of the best `Star Trek' films ever, and definitely one of the best for the `Next Generation' crew.  The actors were all very solid in their performance, which was expected since these are characters they portrayed for 7 seasons on the TV show, and in the previous movie, so by now their characters are instinctual to them.  The special effects were top-notch, some of the best effects work in this series can be found in this movie.  In truth, there isn't one single negative comment I can make regarding this movie; this film is definitely top-notch for this franchise! <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek:  First Contact\\" is rated PG-13 for violence.

B00005JOVH|3.0|...and the Storm/Wolverine show burst onto the scene.  Yeah, yeah, I know that Wolverine is quite possibly the most famous X-man out there, but this is supposed to be the \\"X-Men.\\"  Rumor has it that Halle Berry was throwing fits over having such a small role in the other films and refused to do this installment unless her character was given a bigger piece of the pie.  Unfortunately, director Brett Ratner gave in to her request, leaving us with an another uninspired performance by Berry.<br /><br />The story goes like this:  Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) returns as Phoenix, dispatches some major characters and, guess what, Magneto (Sir Ian McKellan) is still trying to raise that blasted army of mutants.  Oh, and the feds seem to have created a \\"cure\\" for mutants by way of Leech, played by that freaky little boy that always plays the freaky little boy (Cameron Bright).  The plan is that mutants can \\"voluntarily\\" take the antidote and be \\"cured\\" of their mutation.  Naturally, Magneto takes this as a threat and rounds up Pyro, Mystique, Callisto, Multiple Man, Juggernaut, and others to recruit a mutant army to storm the island where the cure is being manufactured (that island being Alcatraz).<br /><br />The special effects are wonderful for the most part, but Ratner seems to have depended too heavily on these effects to move the story along.  Where the first two films actually tried to deal with the discrimination of mutants, this flick tosses all intelligence aside and goes into full-yet somehow boring-action mode.<br /><br />As stated before, Storm is given a huge amount of screen time.  She becomes the unofficial leader of the X-men and has somehow lost that weird accent she had in the first two flicks.  She is very annoying to watch as the film develops.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is also given a large amount of time onscreen, but haven't we seen plenty of him in the first two flicks?  Colossus showed up, but he was nothing more than a hood ornament.  Iceman  (Shawn Ashmore) does develop a little better than he did in X-2, but he doesn't get much screen time.  Rogue (Anna Paquin) is almost non-existent in this film.  Her little love triangle with Iceman and Kitty Pryde never really develops.<br /><br />Mentioning Pryde, there are a couple of new additions to the X-men in this flick.  Kelsey Grammar does a wonderful job with the minute role he has as Dr. Hank McCoy, better known as Beast.  Ben Foster flaps on and off the screen in a brief role (it could almost qualify as a cameo) as Angel.  The villains include the aforementioned Multiple Man, Shadowkat, a number of needless little thugs and Vinnie Jones who almost single-handedly saved this flick as Juggernaut.<br /><br />The language in this film was senseless.  I have no problem with fowl language in films where necessary, but it seems as if most of the cursing in this film was thrown in just to give the characters a little more of an edge.  The \\"B\\" word was tossed around non-chalantly, even used for humor's sake.  I just believe that the language could have been patched up a little more.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />Okay, I've covered the flick fairly well, now let me get to a couple of really bad gripes I had with this flick.<br /><br />First of all, two major characters are killed off very quickly:  Professor X and Cyclops.  Professor X is given a little bit of respect and his death was pretty decent, but it was as if poor Cyclops never even existed once he was offed.  Rumors are that James Marsden was written out of the script quickly when it was found out that he was part of the new \\"Superman Returns\\" flick.  I hope he does well.  Cyclops was treated horribly this time around.<br /><br />Also, there was absolutely no explanation given for the absence of Nightcrawler in this flick.  Fans of the comic might know that he became a priest for a time, but we weren't even told that.<br /><br />One last thing, did Rebecca Romjin do anything to tick off the folks at Marvel?  Her character, Mystique, was critical to the development of both of the other films in this series.  She was one of the best villains in the lot.  Full of intrigue, sly wit, and even a little heart, Mystique is tossed off unceremoniously in this third go-round.  Granted, they try to make her a little important by having her help the feds, but she's wasted in this installment.<br /><br />In all, this is the worst of the \\"X-Men\\" flicks so far.  Hopefully this signals the end of the story, though even that is in question if you watch through to the end of the credits.  I'm almost positive that there'll be a \\"Wolverine\\" movie soon, but, to be honest, I've grown somewhat tired of the character.  Hopefully, if there is another \\"X\\" movie, Storm will get offed as early and unceremoniously as Cyclops.er films in this series.  She was one of the best villains in the lot.

It has been years since Ive been to see a movie and it is still all I can think about three days later (I know that sounds over dramatic but this film really makes you think), I also think it gives you hope and dispare at the same time, the a love like that is so precious and so difficult to find. <br /> <br />A captivating film, with excellent performances from  Reeves and Bullock (what chemistry), and an honorary mention to their co-actor 'Jack'.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|When I was watching \\"Silent Hill\\" in theater I wished sometimes I could rewind and watch certain scene again for it was rather hard to understand from the first time. Generally the film left a good impression but I wasn't thinking of it as of some kind of a masterpiece. But the next day I felt an urge to watch \\"Silent Hill\\" again. I have to say here that the last (and only) time I watched some movie in theater twice was when I decided to see \\"Die Hard\\" one more time in the beginning of 90s when it was one of the first big American films to hit our post-Soviet screens.<br /><br />So I watched \\"SH\\" again and liked it much more as well as understood better. The next day my brother said he's going to the cinema to see \\"SH\\". I said I'd go with him. So I watched it for the third time in a row. I guess I understood everything I had doubts about although some mist still remains. And now I can only say \\"SH\\" is one of the best films I've seen in life and I mean not just within a horror genre.<br /><br />First I thought it was some kind of a \\"Hellraiser + The Cell + Dark Water + Nightbreed + In the Mouth of Madness\\" mix, but then I realized it's quite unique in its style, manner and pacing. It's impossible to tell what \\"SH\\" is about because it has lots of meanings, lots of subplots which you can interpret whatever you like, and first you have to think a bit just to interpret it somehow. Among all recent horror films I immensely liked \\"The Descent\\" for example and that movie was pretty simple - an understandable story, no hidden agendas. But here you are given enough food for thought for I don't know how much time. \\"SH\\" is good for the second and the third and many more viewings because everytime you watch it you'll find something new and discover previously unnoticed layers.<br /><br />Visually \\"SH\\" is just beautiful. It's sinister, apocalyptic and picturesque like paintings of Goya and Bosch. And yet it's so enchanting. \\"Silent Hill\\" world is very tactile and substantial I can't remember any other movie that would be so real. You can really sense this town, smell the coal-burning, feel ashes on your hair, feel the darkness coming with every fibre of your skin. And its dismal and tenebrous mechanical inferno with all the hellish creatures just exists right here - around you.<br /><br />There are many different things to think about on \\"Silent Hill\\": it has a theme of revenge and justice. It's about personal hell and hell in a general meaning. It's even metaphorical about alienation when members of a family live close to each other and still lose connection, they almost literally don't notice the person next to them.<br /><br />It's even a bit embarrassing that \\"Silent Hill\\" is made out of a video game - it's so good it should've been separate, individual work. But now it's obvious to me a good film can be shot based on a game, after a deadborn \\"Doom\\" and abysmal \\"House of the Dead\\".<br /><br />I'm anxiously waiting for the DVD to be released, I'm sure I'm going to watch it again and again.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maiden.  The two words that practically defined heavy metal during the eighties.  And the two that practically defined disappointment a mere decade later.  And the two that hopefully will define comeback in the 2000's.  If you're reading this right now, you probably already know the long and tumultuous history of the band, so I'll spare us both the effort and eschew that particular aspect of the group so as to shed more time and light on the music here.  And music it is; innovative while true to Maiden's roots, insightful while heavy, progressive while still arena-ready.  There has been some debate over whether or not this album ranks as a Maiden classic.  This reviewer's answer is a resounding yes.  Sure, it's no \\"Powerslave\\" or \\"Number of the Beast,\\" but then how could it be?  Those albums were great and well-suited for their time of release, and so is \\"Brave New World.\\"  Kicking off with \\"The Wicker Man,\\" one of the strongest tracks here, the album showcases a more mature, and dare I say creative Maiden than has been displayed in the past.  Of course there are a few dime a dozen riffs thrown in here and there, but I can forgive that given that Maiden basically wrote the book on metal riffs (or at least proofread it).  But I digress; the majority of the material here is superb, and Bruce and the boys really step up to a plate that was all but abandoned in recent memory.  As stated before, \\"The Wicker Man\\" is a great song, and more oriented with the Maiden of the past than most of the album.  In this regard it could be considered something of a misnomer, but since even the lighter, more delicate material here reeks of Maiden in the best possible way, it is a pretty good representation of the quality to expect for most of the album's lengthy playtime.  Among the more progressive, ethereal works, \\"Ghost of the Navigator,\\" \\"Dream of Mirrors,\\" and the stunning title track stand out.  In addition, one simply cannot forget the poignant ballad \\"Blood Brothers\\" pennedby bassist Steve Harris after the tragic death of his father.  One of, if not the best song to be found here, it is also one of the most un-Maiden like, insofar as its execution.  But for all the introspective, emotion-driven pieces on \\"Brave New World,\\" there are counterparts that reflect the Iron Maiden's lyrical and stylistic themes of old.  \\"The Mercenary\\" and \\"The Nomad\\" in particular hint at the mid-80's output of the band, and are even complete with monikers in the same vein as \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"The Prisoner.\\"  Without a doubt, the former is the better of the two, if only because it doesn't drag as much.  This is a recurring problem on the album, but since many of the songs clock in around or above seven minutes, I suppose it is to be expected.  Still, there are some bland moments.  \\"The Fallen Angel\\" is one of my least favorite Maiden songs, mostly because it's just so damn forgettable.  The same can be said for \\"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate,\\" although Bruce's signature take on the title line is a bit of a saving grace.  As for \\"Out of the Silent Planet,\\" it might have been a good song had not the band repeated the same riff over and over, until it was driven so far into the ground that it began to protrude out of the other side of the Earth.  Despite my oh so egotistically clever slings and arrows, \\"Brave New World\\" is a thoroughly solid effort, full of energy and promise.  The lyrics here are vastly more personal and affecting than anything the band has penned in the past, and the arrangements of the songs are very complex.  And yet the band pulls it off almost seamlessly.   Bruce is a key component in the album's success, and while I cannot really tell the difference since the addition of guitarist Janick Gers, things seem to be moving just as fluidly as they ever have.  One can only hope that Maiden can maintain their rediscovered vitality.

B00005B36H|3.0|Dont get me wrong, this is a very good album but it just doesnt compare with Aenima or Undertow. Those albums were piercing, fierce, yet reflective and just plain brilliant, completely original. In Lateralus there are some amazing moments but I think there are others who have done this kind of thing before, and have done it better. The new album 10,000 days is similar as well, but for some reason I enjoy it more. Both great albums, certainly I recommend buying them, but don't expect the perfection achieved in Undertow or Aenima...
B000002J09|5.0|To me, Robert Plant is simply the best frontman of any band that ever was in Rock and Roll. Besides his hauntingly and distinctive vocals, his stark and flowing blonde hair and his ingeniuous and sensual ability to move, sometimes in an imperceptable way with the music; Plant is the emperor of in your face pre heavy metal rock music that will remain with us forever. Examples of selections on Led Zepplelin lV that are timeless and endearing examples of the sheer quality and unique power of this band are Rock and Roll, Going to California, which happens to have a charming and catchy folky quality to it, and the inimitable Stairway to Heaven which usually wins best rock song ever on beach radios each summer.What I also find pleasant are the typically English references like  \\"hedgerows\\" in Led Zep material.Led Zeppelin, with Robert Plant on vocals and one of the most respected and versatile rock guitarists in the business, Jimmy Page who I have followed since his Yardbird days backing him, fans and critics worldwide inevitably applaude this seminal supergroup raucously-and ofcourse, if you do not have this CD, get it for sure.<br /><br />Jay Adler, Massapequa, New York

0316174483|4.0|I purchased this book to use in two art camps.  One was focused on printmaking and the other on cartooning.  Once students open the book they were eager to try out the fingerprint illustrations and began looking for particular animals they wanted to illustrate.  The book is colorful and appealing and provides a good starting place for kids to draw with ready success 'at their fingertips.' The only problem we encountered was the need for fine line marker for details as their fingerprints are small and their drawings were less successful if the marker they used was too thick or bled.

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />It seems like every time we turn around these days some filmmaker has been hard at work producing yet another adaptation of Jane Austen's most beloved novel \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  And even though some of the versions have been quite good actually, one can still wonder if this glut is really all that necessary.  The book's two most recent incarnations came in the form of miniseries produced by the BBC, the first in 1980 and the second in 1995.  However, since 1940, there has not been a \\"straight\\" (i.e. set in the proper time period) version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" designed specifically for the big screen.  Well, now we have one, written by Deborah Moggach, directed by  Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley in the lead role.<br /><br />This latest version is distinguished from the earlier efforts primarily by its grittier, grimier and grungier depiction of life in early 19th Century rural England.  With its peeling paint and dusty furnishings, the film certainly has a less prettified and more lived-in look than we are accustomed to seeing in movies based on Austen works.  Yet, perhaps because we have been spoiled by the marathon lengths of those earlier miniseries, this film, at a mere two hours and seven minutes, feels hurried and rushed as it attempts to cope with Austen's complex tale of the five Bennett sisters and their mother's frantic efforts to marry them off.  We are moved so quickly through the story that some of the more subtle details of character and theme get lost along the way.  Still, it's quite remarkable just how much of the plot Moggach is able to cram into a little over two hours, so that even the staunchest of Austen purists will have little to complain about on that score.<br /><br />What they may have reason to complain about is the fact that the film fails to capture much of the unique humor that distinguishes the novel.  For the most part, the scenes are played much too seriously and \\"straight,\\" particularly those involving the odious Mr. Collins and the insufferably condescending Lady Catherine de Bourg, who together supply some of Austen's most bitingly witty commentary on the superficiality of England's class-conscious society.  Tom Hollander gives a spiritless, leaden performance as the sycophantic minister, and Judi Dench plays Lady Catherine as if she were taking a stab at Lady MacBeth instead.  The same goes for Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett, whose pivotal role as the droll, dry commentator on the absurd Mrs. Bennett's matrimonial obsessions seems to have been lost on the actor.  Matthew Macfadyen fails to make an impact as the haute Mr. Darcy, although Brenda Blethyn hits the right notes as the grating mother driven to despair at the prospect of her daughters ending up old maids.<br /><br />In the coveted role of the high-minded, strong willed and extremely judgmental Elizabeth Bennett - certainly the most brilliant and fully realized of all Austen's creations - Knightley clearly means well but doesn`t seem quite up to the task.  Her annoying giggle and epicene expression make her far too silly and modern to successfully portray the rational but often misguided 19th Century heroine Austen intended Elizabeth to be.<br /><br />Yet, despite all these weaknesses, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" makes for a reasonably entertaining film, thanks, primarily, to the strength of the original source material and the liveliness of Wright's direction (the ball scenes are exceptionally well done).  The film moves quickly and does a decent job telling its story.  Perhaps if we didn't have better versions to compare it to, this \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" would stand up better on its own.  It's far from a failure, but watching this condensed version instead of the two BBC miniseries is a bit like reading the Cliff's Notes instead of the actual novel.  You may be able to get the general gist of the thing, but not that wonderful flavoring that makes the original so special.s and the insufferably condescending Lady Catherine de Bourg, who together supply some of Austen's most bitingly witty commentary on the superficiality of England's class-conscious society.

B000002TQV|5.0|I love this album, and it continues to be my favourite Radiohead CD  out of their entire collection.  It's not really out there, but it does take a concerning listener to appreciate the musicality.  Highly recommended.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|I have only heard the clips of this interesting chanteuse, but I plan to buy this latest album.  I am very interested to hear what she would sound like with some musicians that really challenge her - perhaps in some uptempo \\"le jaz hot\\" swinging pieces. <br /> <br />Or even better, I'd like to hear her with some of the real expatriate (or former expatriate) cats like Donald Byrd.  Guys like him are the very foundation of what makes the modern french jazz sound (other than those folks who are no longer with us).  I think she would prove her self (or not) and would most certainly grow and develop a more unique sound singing with those musicians.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|Jameson Thottam with some thoughts on Syriana <br /> <br />Oil, is perhaps the most precious natural resource on the planet and also one of the most controversial. It powers industry and the economies of many nations, yet the regions that contain the largest amounts are often the most unstable, and this instability often results from the influences of the very nations that purchase the oil.  <br /> <br />It is a tenuous situation where buyer and seller are wary of one another and at times regard the other as a necessary evil. The money paid for the oil has made suppliers and handlers rich and powerful, but many on the outside of this privileged circle believe that greed has caused both sides to lose focus on what is most important for the people of their nations.  <br /> <br /> <br />Back to the Film (Jameson Thottam) <br />In the film Syriana viewers follow the paths of different people from various walks of life who for the most part do not know one another, yet are all linked by the same cause, oil.  <br /> <br /> <br />The Characters (Jameson Thottam) <br />There is the C.I.A. agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney), who spends time in locales such as Iran and Beirut eliminating threats to national security.  <br />A lawyer, (Jeffrey Wright), who is caught in the middle as he attempts to find, and if need be eliminate damaging material that can prevent a pending merger between two oil companies.  <br /> <br />There is the grieving energy analyst Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), who deals with his loss by siding up with a powerful Prince, (Alexander Siddig), even at the alienation of his family.  <br /> <br />There is also a displaced Pakistani worker who after losing his job when a Chinese company acquires the refinery where he worked, falls in with a group of radicals with a militant agenda.  <br /> <br />The above is just a small sampling of the characters as there are numerous business, political, and Middle Eastern citizens who all play very prominent parts in the story.  <br /> <br />The Key Focus ( Jameson Thottam ) <br />The main focus of the film is not only to illustrate the connectivity between the characters but to show how politics and big business influence policy in oil rich nations and how through secret deals, political intrigue, and treachery policy in and towards the same oil producing nations are set into place and maintained.  <br /> <br />While this is not much of a shock to people who follow the news, it is the way that director Stephen Gaghan uses ordinary and in some ways unremarkable people to tell the story and how it affects those who deal with oil.  <br /> <br />The Complexities ( Jameson Thottam ) <br />Even those who are supposed the big players are often simply being played by forces outside their control in a world where reality and perceptions are often miles apart. The complex nature of the story is actually a model of simplicity as cause and effect, as well as the ability of big business to influence lawmakers is what drives the film.  <br /> <br />The cast is strong especially Clooney and Siddig who make their characters sympathetic while at the same time captivating. The contrast of the men who are a Prince and an agent, yet whose destinies often cause them to walk along the same paths is amazing.  <br /> <br />Closing (Jameson Thottam) <br />Syriana is an amazing film that is so complex in its simplicity. The basic message is very clear, yet the layers that must be uncovered like a tangled web of lies in telling the story is a far reaching journey that will shock and anger most viewers.  <br /> <br />Some may find fault with a so called liberal agenda to the film, but politics aside, \\"Syriana\\" is a very captivating and entertaining film that makes you think.  <br /> <br />Review End <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam

Stephanie Leonidas, who played Helena, was fabulous; she's a lovely girl & I hope we see more of her.  I 'm no good at reviewing so I don't really know what to say.

B0006399FS|5.0|This album is infact better then the Joshua Tree. But, it doesn't beat Achtung Baby. This album will probably go down as one of the top 20 best of all time. Rightly so because it is a more mature sounding album that doesn't give you goose bumps first listen. Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby did that for me, but they wore after a while. This album hasn't worn one bit. Plus, in an interview when bono was asked about the negative criticism, he said \\"people that see our music as different only have a different heart, they don't see things the way they used to, our music is still U2!\\" well he's absolutely right because music is about reaching out to your heart. Old school U2 fans need to get over themselves about this ablum. It really is better then what they grew up listening to. Period!:)
B000024C7W|5.0|Between the period of 1971 - 1976, few could argue that brilliance of Stevie Wonders musical output.  A period that saw such groundbreaking releases such as: \\"Talking Book\\", \\"Innervisions\\", \\"Fulfillingness' First Finale\\", \\"Songs in the Key of Life\\"....all albums that took driving funk & Motown Soul, and mixed them with warm keyboards, and lyrical content that touched upon: Politics, Love, Social injustice, Joyous Good times, and religion, and self-belief....to conquering effect.  Which is what made this release of after 1976's \\"Songs in the key of Life\\", all the more curious and bizarre.  Because instead of following on, from the ambitious wide-ranging arrangements, exuberant synthesizer, and tightly sequenced funk of \\"Songs in the key of life\\".  Stevie instead bucked all current convention, and released this...a meditative mostly instrumental album of quietly intimate sounds, Precious moods, and reflective arrangements.  Gone were the finger-pointing political statements, Biting Funk, and celebratory grooves.  This was an album that was a decidedly much softer proposition, with an overall sound, that was considered, too intimate and inward-looking to suggest Radio air-play, and a cycle of loosely themed (semi-linked) songs, that were too downtempo, to be really considered hit single material (although \\"Send One Your Love\\" and \\"Outside My Window\\", were released as singles).  What followed was mass confusion, on the radio/Critics part....with most, simply baffled by Stevie's musical direction, and large-scale indifference on the part of consumers.  And so, this left the album, largely ignored by the general public, and quickly lead to Stevie reverting back to type, with 1980's upbeat soul/funk workout \\"hotter than July\\".    Looking back on \\"Journey through the secret life of Plants\\", and giving the album a much need re-evaluation, it's not hard to see why, it was so off-handedly dismissed on its release.  This was such an unusual release from what had gone before, it's a soundtrack to a film (that may or may not have been released) and at the time it was like throwing a musical `Curve-ball', to the record buying public.  But, that doesn't mean that it deserved to be largely passed over.  No, in fact it's quite the opposite....looking at this album now, long after his most recognised work, has become familiar to us all, highlights what (with hindsight), is a massive mistake on the critics/buying public.  What was tight and edgy in his previous albums, has become a softer, more reflective sombre mood, the instruments take the centre stage here, with the few vocals tracks that are contained throughout the album, mostly limited to assisting the instrumentals (rather than being at the forefront).  \\"Voyage to India\\" is probably closest to a regular Stevie track, \\"Ai No, Sono\\" features a lovely children choir, and \\"Power Flower\\" has the vocal pushed firmly into the background, and sounds like a vocal instrument that complements the instrumentals.  I defy anyone to not be moved by the sheer elegance of the arrangements, the contemplative mood, and gentle lush keyboard work, that runs throughout this album.  For a rough idea of what to expect, if you are familiar with the track  \\"You've got it bad, Girl\\" from Stevie's \\"Talking book\\" album, well imagine the warm electronic arrangements, sentimental template, and innocent conception of low key R&B, without the vocals.  Then that will give you a rough idea of what to expect.  I don't know if it's because it's a (mostly) instrumental soundtrack album, but it sounds like Stevie worked long and hard to get these arrangements, up to such a highly proficient level.  This is probably because, seeing as this music would be judged on a purely musical level (with no lyrics, as such to fall back on).  That this release really had to be able to stand up on its own, without Stevie's lyrics to fall back on, and it is arguably some of the most gorgeously expressive (instrumental) music that Stevie has committed to record.  With such stylistic exercises in composition, and a beautifully subtle kaleidoscope of contrasting textures, this is a unique, and peerlessly melodic sounding record, that stands on its own, as something vastly different, from anything that Stevie had attempted before (and probably one, of the reasons, for its commercial failure).  But looking back on the album some twenty odd years on, it's a truly remarkable sounding record that, rewards each listen with little sounds and glistening moods, it's a soundtrack that sounds unlike anything else (although how well suited to the film, is hard to ascertain, as nobody seems to have seen the film).  And if that sounds like something you'd want to listen to, they you really owe it to yourself, to give this a listen.  Sure!!...there will be those that think this album is a pointless exercise, like listening to a \\"Marvin Gaye\\" album minus his singing.   But it'd take a cold, cold heart not to acknowledge that Artistically, Stevie has taken the bold step of creating something that pushed his music into an entirely new (although unsuccessfully commercial) direction.  And listening to it today, without having judged it, after having come off the back of an incredible run of albums, this is one of those albums that will rope in new fans, that are prepared to put any preconceptions to one side and meet the music on its own terms (rather than what came before it), and although it probably can't quite stand up as well as his peak-period albums, this is arguably, deserving of almost as much recognition of any of Stevie's other landmark releases.
B00005AREQ|5.0|Blow By Blow has been among my top 10 guitar albums since its original vinyl release, and yes I have purchased a copy in each of its incarnations (including the Mobile Fidelity release). <br />I didn't think it could get much better than that, but thanks to advances in digital mastering technology, the 2001 remaster does offer noticable improvements. The separation of different instruments seems more pronounced, and the increase in the overall levels causes the music to virtually leap from the speakers. <br />I wish all remasters delivered the satisfaction that this does (for me anyway). <br />What's next? Perhaps an extended 2-disc remix of the entire session? I'll set a few sheckels aside, just in case.

B00000DI2T|5.0|Most buyers aren't in the market for a complete Mahler cycle from one conductor, but if they were, the two from Bernstein contain many great performances. I've reviewed the contents of the Sixties cycle on Sony and this later one from the Eighties (contianing many live performances) on DG, taking them one symphony at a time. But it's worthwhile to give a sense of the strongest and weakest parts of each set.<br /><br />Cycle #1:<br /><br />By general consensus the performance of Sym. #3 is one of the glories of this cycle and perhaps the most inspired Mahler condcuting Bernstein did on disc. It has all the freshness of discovery--LB was new to Mahler in 1961. Sony's 20-bit remastering makes the original analog sound quite good--in fact, there's no need to comment on the sound quality of these NY Phil. recordings, none of which are bad. Expect the deep sound stage and wide stereo separation that Columbia Records favored at the time.<br /><br />Bernstein also put his stamp on Sym. #7 in such a way that no one would ever hear it the same again. 'The Song of the Night,' as this work was dubbed, had almost no life either on disc or the concert stage (Mahler champions as prominent as Bruno Wlater never performed it). Not only did LB prove that this was coherent music, he made an unforgettable drama out of the Seventh. This is his signature recording of the work.<br /><br />Two other great performances stand out: Sym. #2 and #4, each rendered with amazing imagination and a huge range of emotions. The accusation that LB went over the top in the Second is unjustified--he is often tender and delicate--but there's no doubt that he takes an apocalyptic view of the finale. Whatever you think about his approach, he single-handedly revolutionized the way that the Resurrection Sym. was played. In Sym. #4 the classic recording was by Bruno Walter, but LB added more depth, imaginaiton, and excitement. Lyric soprano Reri Grist has come in for a good deal of criticism in the vocal finale, but I think she fits beautifully into LB's overall conception.<br /><br />In the middle of the pack, as it were, we get LB's readings of Sym. #1 and #9. He went on to conduct greater readings of both works, especially the Ninth. In person LB's First was a real showpiece, but somehow Sony's sonics are not up to the conductor's vision. In the cse of the Ninth, the NY version would qualify as an outstanding performance if there weren't so many truly great ones from Karajan, Bruno Walter, James Levine, and Barbirolli, among others. Bernstein himself would add two of the greatest, both on DG.<br /><br />I find a few problems wiht Sym. #5, #6, and #8 in the first cycle. For many critics all three are great recordings. For some reason, I have never warmed up to either of LB's versions of Sym. #5, where for once he does manipulate and exaggerate to the point that the spirit of the work seems lost in histrionics. Sym. #6 is too brisk in the first movement to let the music expand to its visionary potential, and in the other movements Bernstein seems less expressive than he could be. The Eighth is unmathced in the excitement and joyousness of Part 1, and for some listeners the whole symphony remains on that exalted level. I find that LB is too studied in Part 2, and my attention wasn't held. He does elicit very beautiful singing and playing, however. It should be noted that this performance is with the London Sym. and a host of fine English singers.<br /><br />To the end of his life Bernstein resisted Deryck Cooke's completion of the Tenth Sym., agreeing to conduct only the shattering Adagio. which Mahler had essentially finished in full score.  Bernstein's reading with the NY Phil. is one of the  most searing accounts this magnificent fragment has ever received, equaled by his later live reading with the incomparable Vienna Phil.<br /><br />Cycle #2:<br /><br />It should be said right off that DG's digital sonics are in a different league from what LB got in New York. Eventhough several venues were involved (Vienna, Amsterdam, New York), and many recordings were under live concert conditions, the DG engineers triumphed. They favor closer mike posiitons, solo highlighting, and a vivid sound stage compared to their predecessors in New York. As to the interprettions, with a few exceptions--the most prominent being Sym. #6--Bernstein did not drastically change his views from the first cycle, and in some cases the readings feel almost identical (Sym. #2 and #7, for example).<br /><br />The most interest centers on the works where LB clearly outdoes his younger self. At the top of the list I would put Sym. #6 and #9. In the former he achieved one of the classic Mahler reacordings of the modern era. His Sixth has slowed down by 2 min. in the first movement, giving the music room to expand properly. The Andante is heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. The finale is an explosion of genius on Mahler's part that LB resonates with perfectly. Almost the same can be said of the Ninth, where the conducting reaches deeply moving areas of expression.  The finale is drastically slow (as is Levine's, to similar devastating effect), which some critics find excessive. But it's a truism that no tempo is right or wrong; everything depends upon being drawn into the world of the music. LB achieved a great Ninth but would surpass himself with a live performance from Berlin in 1979, also on DG.<br /><br />Almost as great is Sym. #1, which on DG receives a flawless performance packed with excitement. I'm not sure that LB's reading actually changed, but the superlative sonics and the spine-tingling playing of the Concertgebiuw weren't matched in New York.<br /><br />The next thing to ask is where Bernstein fell short of his earlier versions. The Sym. #2, #3, and #4 from New York were  one of a kind, representing LB's early and most exciting explorations of Mahler's world. Their counterparts on DG are also strong, but I don't think they rise to the heights he achieved earlier. The only sharp criticism I have is with the use of a boy soprano in the finale of the Fourth; musical as he is, a boy is too undeveloped to capture what Mahler intended. It should be said, however, that if the earlier NY versions didn't exist, these would be outstanding performances.<br /><br />I feel much the same about Sym. #7, where LB's first recording set a standard that only two or three rivals have come close to, but his DG remake, which was a return to the NY Phil. in oncert from Lincoln Center(as are Sym. #2 and #3), feels fractionally less overwhelming. It's in better sound, however. The one symphony I can't compare is the Fifth, which doesn't satisfy me in either cycle. The DG version with the Vienna Phil. convinces many listeners, and some critics call in unsurpassable, but I am not on its wavelength.<br /><br />That leaves Sym. #8, which Bernstein didn't live to record for commercial release. DG reached into its vaults for a live 1975 radio tape from Vienna, and although it has flaws in execution, including some rough singing in Part 2, LB's conducting is superlative, more ocmpelling than his version from London. Paired with this symphony is a 1974 reading of the Adagio from Sym. #10, also with the Vienna Phil. As you'd expect, it's an inspired, searing reading, just like the NY version.<br /><br />How ot sum up? If money were no object, I'd own both cycles for the pleasure of Bernstein's unqiue inspiration. If I had to pick and choose, I'd take Sym. #2, #3, and #4 from New York, Sym. #8 from London, and the rest form the DG cycle.though several venues were involved (Vienna, Amsterdam, New York), and many recordings were under live concert conditions, the DG engineers triumphed.

B00005JOX6|2.0|At one point in \\"Click\\", Michael Newman (Adam Sandler), a workaholic architect struggling to juggle family commitments with his job, uses a new remote control to keep repeating a scene in his life. Play. Rewind. Play. Rewind. He doesn't want the memory to end. I wish I had been able to do this, been able to just keep playing the funny parts over and over again, bypassing the \\"dramatic\\" second half of the film.<br /><br />Let's take a look at the Universal Remote Michael receives from Morty (Christopher Walken), a strange scientist working in the backroom of Bed, Bath and Beyond.<br /><br />FF to Story...<br /><br />Michael Newman and his wife, Donna (Kate Beckinsale, \\"Pearl Harbor\\", \\"Underworld\\") live in suburbia with their two kids, Ben and Samantha. Michael has a difficult time juggling commitments to his family (he has to cancel a camping trip on 4th of July weekend) with the demands of his boss, Ammer (David Hasselhoff), who keeps giving him more work as he dangles the promise of a promotion as a carrot in front of Michael. Almost at his breaking point and fed up with the proliferation of remotes in his house, Michael sets off to find a Universal Remote. Stopping at Bed, Bath and Beyond, he finds Morty, who promises Michael he has something that will \\"rock your world\\". Returning home with the new gadget, Michael finds he can turn down the volume on his dog, fast forward through arguments with Donna, boring family dinners with his mom and dad (Julie Kavner and Henry Winkler) and fast forward through the (dreaded) massage part of sex with his wife. He can also pause his boss while he takes out his aggressions, hitting Ammer repeatedly in the face, before resuming the discussion. But the Universal Remote has some awesome powers and Michael doesn't heed Morty's warnings.<br /><br />ACCESS Special Features: Actors<br /><br />Adam Sandler is a funny guy. In limited doses. Much of the comedy in \\"Click\\" comes from grumbled responses under his breath, slipping in an insult or note of exasperation. And much of this humor is funny. He rushes to his son's swim meet and arrives just as it is ending. He runs to the side of the pool, congratulating who he thinks is his son but is actually an Asian kid. When the kid wipes the water out of his eyes, he says \\"You're not my father\\". Sandler responds, in a lower voice \\"At least as far as you know.\\" As Sandler walks away, the kid anxiously asks his parents \\"He's not my Dad is he?\\" It's a funny moment, and there are more of them, all involving Michael getting pissed off at a neighbor kid, or bad kids at the park, and similar types of situations. But there are two problems with this. All of the jokes are concentrated in the first half of the film. And because Michael is such a jerk towards people outside of the family, he sometimes has difficulty turning this off when he interacts with his family.<br /><br />As Michael plays around with the new remote, the filmmakers have a field day allowing Sandler one opportunity after another to make fun of or comment on his current way of life, which is very similar to how many of us live. He changes himself into different colors, he makes Ammer change sizes (widescreen, zoom, pan and scan, etc.). While these are funny, they are also rather juvenile and don't help advance the plot or have any connection to the story.<br /><br />But about halfway through the film, everyone and everything takes a dramatic turn. It almost seems like the filmmakers felt they had to make the film `substantial' in some regard, so they decide to make it dramatic, moving completely away from the comedy.<br /><br />SKIP forward to Chapter 10.<br /><br />As Michael uses the gadget to control more and more of his life, the film suddenly takes a turn to high drama; Michael begins missing events in his life, there is a divorce, a heart attack, death, obesity, a wedding and more. Is this the same film? The two halves are not blended well. Everything would be a lot smoother if there wereelements of drama during the first half, interspersed with the comedy and vice versa. As it is, there are two definite halves of the film, which don't blend.<br /><br />Sandler seems to realize he won't always be the star of multi-million dollar comedies. In the last few years, he has been making more family centered big-budget comedies while occasionally venturing into \\"dramedy\\", comedies with more dramatic themes. Unfortunately, few people saw \\"Punch Drunk Love\\", the film directed by P.T. Anderson (\\"Boogie Nights\\", \\"Magnolia\\") featuring a pretty good performance from Sandler. On the other hand, it is very fortunate very few people saw the dismal James L. Brooks' film \\"Spanglish\\" co-starring a shrill, completely unbearable Tea Leoni. But making films like \\"Click\\" isn't going to help Sandler sustain a long career because it doesn't show off his ability to work in either genre well. If he wants to make a drama, he needs to make a good drama. If he wants to make a comedy, stick to the hijinks. This film doesn't blend the two elements well and only points to the deficiencies in his ability as an actor. For each film, he needs to commit to the genre and give it his all. If he does this, we might actually see him give a good performance in a drama at some point.<br /><br />FF to Supporting Cast<br /><br />I have never been a fan of Kate Beckinsale. In each of the films I have seen, she seems to play characters that are so devoid of any interesting features or traits that any actress could play the role. She brings absolutely nothing to these performances. Why does she keep making films? Donna in \\"Click\\" is no exception. Yes, she's pretty but there are dozens of pretty actresses currently working in films that could bring something, anything to this role and make it more interesting. \\"Click\\" was written by the same guy who wrote \\"Bruce Almighty\\" and both films share a similar problem. The films are all about the main character and a sidekick, with some funny supporting characters thrown into the mix. In each film, the female co-star is basically a blank canvas giving the actress a unique opportunity to create an interesting character. In \\"Almighty\\", Jennifer Aniston did a better job but Beckinsale seems uninterested in gaining our interest.<br /><br />Christopher Walken, as always, is good for a few laughs; he basically is just playing a caricature of himself at this point. But his character mirrors the tone of the story and halfway through, he becomes a different entity all together.<br /><br />FF to Jokes not about Body Functions...<br /><br />Searching. Searching. Still searching....<br /><br />Okay, there are a few. But when the comedy begins to concentrate on these, it reverts back to Adam Sandler's early days, his goofy, more juvenile films. At one point, Michael pauses his boss, gets up on his desk and points his butt at his boss' face then farts. A couple of times. Yawn.<br /><br />Throughout the film, there is a running joke involving the family dog. It is funny the first or second time we see it, but when the filmmakers keep returning to this joke, even after the family has two more dogs and those dogs keep doing the same things, you have to wonder if the majority of the film was written by drunken college frat boys.<br /><br />There is so much they could have done with this concept that farting in your boss' face and watching a sex-crazed dog seem sophomoric at best.<br /><br />ACCESS Special Features: Documentary about Special Effects<br /><br />\\"Click\\" has a lot of special effects. This is both an interesting addition and a hindrance to the story.<br /><br />Soon after Morty gives Michael the Universal Remote, the `mad scientist' shows him how to use the menu. The remote transports Michael into a 3-D Menu, where he can listen to a commentary about his life (provided by James Earl Jones), skip back to other chapters in his life, access special features and more. This is represented by a flowing grid which looks like the2-D menus we have on many DVDs, but the elements circle around him. It is a nice touch and well-done. And the filmmakers seem to like it because they use it repeatedly, showing off the special effects at their disposal.<br /><br />Throughout the film, as we see people in various stages of their lives, we also see a lot of make-up. It is pretty good make-up for the most part, but it is still make-up. At one point, Julie Kavner and Henry Winkler look like they have been given facelifts by a computer and then later, we see them under pounds of make-up. Again, the make-up is good, but you don't ever forget it is there.<br /><br />ACCESS Special Features: Review by thornhillatthemovies.com<br /><br />There is an abrupt shift halfway through the story, which doesn't work.

B000007T2Z|5.0|Upon hearing \\"Dead Flag Blues\\" for the very first time, i knew that i had to own this album. The monologue given by a prophetic, deep-voiced man at the beginning of this song about made me piss my pants and have an aneurism (in a good way).  <br /> <br />In fact, he was barely finished with his first line when i stopped the music and immediately yelled at my brother to come listen to this. After the haunting monologue, comes the lugubrious, contemplative violin portion of the song. Violins are  becoming more commonplace, but upsettingly, are rarely employed effectively. GYBE! is one of those few who can actually make you   <br />feel something without it seeming overdone or contrived.  <br /> <br />Following this is one of my favorite parts of the album; The bass comes in, dull and boomy followed by some of the most breathtaking and beautiful guitar work you'll ever hear. <br /> <br />After buying this album i found out to my huge surprise that there are only 3 songs on the album. however, considering that this album has over an hour of music, i definately got my money's worth in that respect.  <br /> <br />My biggest fear was that the other two songs would be mediocre filler to support their one masterpiece, but i couldnt be any more wrong, East Hastings has some of the greatest string arrangements ive ever heard. I was also blown away about how tight the group is. The guitars and strings have never sounded so \\"right\\" together. <br /> <br />This providence is a bit hard to describe, Plus im feeling lazy, but lets just say the end is here, both for the album and for the world. <br /> <br />I was exaggerating about the infinity score. This album has one flaw, but bear in mind im being extremely nit-picky. Ive never been fond of \\"secret songs\\" that present themselves at the end of an album after 3-5 minutes of silence- it just irritates me. That isnt to say that the extra bit at the end isn't worthwhile- the way it was presented is just a bit flawed in my opinion. Another thing thats worthy of note is that this album is not for everyone. I have a feeling that many people would be bored with the slower bits of the songs, as well as the copious intrumentation and lengthy songs. But if you love beautiful guitar work, then you must own this album. If you love meaningful string arrangements, then you must own this album. If you are tired of the same old thing then you must own this album. If you love post rock then you DEFINATELY must own this album.
0679720200|4.0|Albert Camus himself termed The Stranger, \\"The nakedness of man faced with the absurd.\\" I'm not sure that's my immediate perception of this book, but it's an accurate enough depiction of one perspective of it. When Camus was in his early 20's, he wrote A Happy Death, which is apparently a precursor to this idea that murder ultimately leads to the murderer's freedom. At face value, the idea is absurd. After thinking about it more, it's still absurd. <br /> <br />Granted, my agreeing with this sentiment neither makes this book better nor worse for it. The book is intriguing, written in a direct & simple style that Thomas Pynchon and David Foster Wallace would do well to copy. There is little which the reader needs to assert for himself, at least regarding what is said and what is meant, since there is little need for interpretation. What lies beneath, namely the main character's fragile and fractured psyche, is another story altogether. <br /> <br />In this we are led through a life, an unfeeling and direct life of mild observation and little action. Observations are made through a pane glass of unfeeling, that nothing matters. Clearly this reflected a lot of Camus' own opinion on life, as his books often explore the theme of life's uselessness. The main character is an epitome of that opinion, which we see flood through in the book's final pages. <br /> <br />This flood is one of pent up emotion, a flood which I did not anticipate. Through this release we see the freedom that Camus refers to elsewhere, that the condemned is the only one who can truly be free. Conversely, he intones that all of us are condemned. Thus the question is begged, are we not all capable of this same freedom which the imminently condemned grasps? <br /> <br />These are questions in a vacuum. Perhaps the Camus scholar has been through these questions and surmises that he or she knows the answers already. Or perhaps Camus suggested the answers in other books. I offer these thoughts in ignoranceof alternate studies and sources. I offer these thoughts in my own space of having read this book - not as a scholar nor a Camus expert, but as someone who reads and came across this book through a book store clerk years ago. <br /> <br />The book is good, not great. The themes are dark, mired in the head of the depressed. It's not a book anyone can enjoy. There is no happy ending, and little laughter. It's a morose treatise on the pointlessness of life. Regardless of your agreement with it, it's still a good read so long as you keep a certain perspective.
B00000F6LQ|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The movie became a hit at my school, even though many people only understood only parts of the humor. The funniest thing was you could always tell who had seen the movie by who said and who understood quotes from the movie. This is British humor at it's best and some people don't get it. My fther and brothers are british, so I understood all of the movie when I first watched the movie, but when my nephew tried to watch it he didn't understand a word. <br />     This is a great movie but if you decide to watch, make sure you have a good sense of humor. if you don't then you'll never understand it.
B00005JOUM|4.0|First thing on a weekday morning, a van makes its way through the streets of New York, picking up people in painter outfits, before parking in front of a bank downtown.  Without really being noticed by anyone, the \\"painters\\" enter the bank, neutralize the camera system and lock the doors before revealing themselves to be bank robbers.  They herd the customers and employees downstairs to the vault area and settle in for a siege.  Police and others with a personal stake in the contents of the bank respond, negotiations ensue and the suspense begins to build...who will end up triumphing in this cat and mouse game?<br /><br />I enjoy a good thriller, even a B-grade one like Hackers or Deceived, to name two 1990s examples of the genre.  I also love a good heist flick, and this had the potential to be both.  I found myself enjoying the opening scenes as the ducks were lined up and the various interested parties were drawn into the story.  What made me just wiggly in my theater seat, though, was the top-notch actors who appeared to be enjoying themselves as much as I was--Denzel Washington as the hostage negotiator, Clive Owen as the robber leader, Jodie Foster as a damage controller working for the bank.  Even second tier roles were well cast--Willem Dafoe, Christopher Plummer and others show up in those.<br /><br />Others have called this a \\"Spike for hire\\" movie--Spike Lee making a standard issue thriller rather than some big personal vision of his own.  Know what?  That may be but I didn't care.  Some of Lee's personal visions have left me cold, but the man has real skills as a director in the way he manages action and characters, and the fluidity of movement from scene to scene, and he brings all that to bear here.  Plus there are the Spike Lee touches of the look and feel of New York with its giant melting pot population, in the background instead of the foreground, but adding texture to an otherwise standard issue movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie very much, even though at the end I had some questions and I felt the denouement dragged out too long.  Some plot threads seemed to dangle (what was the point of that hole they dug in the floor in the bank vault?) but for the two hours of the movie I was thoroughly entertained and that was all I asked for.  Worth checking out on DVD when it comes out.
0743424425|3.0|Warning: some spoilers ahead <br /> <br />I'm sure it's been said by countless other reviewers, but this book does in fact provide a far more nuanced and compelling portrait of the main character Jack Torrence than the famous and unforgettable 1980 Stanley Kubrick screen adapatation would suggest. <br /> <br />  I like what King said in his own recent comments on the book-what made the book truly interesting was the idea that Torrence goes insane from a combination of factors-not just a haunted hotel but his own inner demons.  That is suggested in the movie, but my impression is that in the movie Nicholson plays Torrence as someone already on the edge and there is no implication that he had deep love for his family, also no mention of his own abuse at his father's hands.  It's hard to feel that he suddenly went from loving Shelley Duvall to hating her-he seems to have hatred toward her in the beginning of the movie.  The movie works, of course, and has become so iconic it is hard to read this book without thinking of it, but it is very different from the book, enough so to be someone else's story.   <br /> <br />  This is a major problem with the movie and what makes the book so much more effective, moving, and tragic-in the book Torrence truly loves his wife and son and that makes his descent into madness more frightening and depressing. <br /> <br />This is really King's gift, to tie horror to recognizable reality and family life, to express some of our own deepest fears through terrifying metaphors, and he does it very well here.  It's also, like most of his books, very exciting and a good page turner.  <br /> <br /> I especially appreciated his character Dick, the African American cook, for some reason in the movie this character was far less important or appealing.  In the book he has real warmth, compassion, intelligence, and a sense of humor-and he doesn't die, unlike in the movie (I wanted to point that out, that's why I warned of spoilers). I think that's important-he's a survivor, like Danny. <br /> <br />  His story makes the entire novel more interesting and I'm not sure why they made him sort of an idiot in the movie although I could speculate.  I'm sure this isn't true of the 1997 Stephen Weber/Rebecca DeMornay version, since it is said to be closer to King's original vision, but I have yet to see that.  Another positive point of the book is that they give more background to the ghosts, whereas in the Kubrick movie they just show up (e.g., naked elderly woman in tub).  It's scarier if we know their stories, and King tells us them. <br /> <br />It was a good read, but if I had some criticism it would be that it dragged on at times and sometimes got too verbose. King is a very talented writer and very interesting to read but he does tend to veer off into certain overly verbose passages that make my eyes glaze over.  But it's a 600+ page book, and about 400 pages are great, so who are we to complain?  Definitely worth the read even if you've seen the movie, is the point.
B000FGGE68|4.0|Great action and special effects. I really enjoyed the comic book, dream-like colors and graphics. And of course Milla always looks great in any movie.
0767834739|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Mindless garbage with no substance whatsoever.
1577314808|4.0|This is one of those hokey pokey books.  It is intriguing but then if you think about it, it doesn't really make sense.  The author is very spiritual and so the writing follows like it is a never-ending prayer.  The Power of Now is quite simply about doing things now and staying in the present.  No news here.  It is, however, important, since, no doubt, everyone needs to be reminded of that.  Having said that, the author advocates the removal of time (past and future).  That is a little bit extreme since who we are is dependent not only of now but of past and future.  A person that only knows now is somewhat like a patient with Alzheimers.  There is a lot of merit in focusing on the present but I'm not sure about obliterating the past and future.  The author seems to be extremely negative which is of no surprise since he once suffered from depression and wanted to kill himself, but the past is not always horrible.  There are past moments that are pleasant and are nice to reflect on now and then.  The future provides hope and faith.  Totally focusing on the present is just living blindly.  The other concept of which I found important in this book is the act of surrendering.  By surrendering, you will never react but act which I do agree is quite different.  Acting is a more positive thing than reacting (omitting reflex actions) because usually reacting involves emotions that may betray you.  But if think about it, even this idea makes the assumption that all reactions are bad.  Reacting to a lover's embrace is a good thing.  But the basic idea is still important in that reaction implies dependency (bad).  Independency; the state of being free, living in peace: this is good.
B000AL730O|3.0|After all the glowing reports about Paul McCartney's \\"Chaos and Creation in the Back Yard,\\" I thought I'd give it a listen.  Turns out -- it's  apropos that the CD's cover shows a young Paul with a guitar; in many ways, his genius seems to have been arrested at that particular time.  \\"Chaos\\" reminds me of his first post-Beatles attempt (\\"McCartney\\"); again, he's trying too hard to impress someone (then, it was John -- now who?).  \\"Etudes\\" would make a better title for this disc, as many of the melodies sound merely like snippets of Paul trying out a style:<br /> -- \\"Fine Line:\\"  What if Philip Glass wrote pop songs?<br /> -- \\"English Tea:\\"  Let's take the chord progressions of \\"For No One\\" and change the refrain to a MAJOR key!<br /> -- \\"Friends to Go\\": Even Paul himself has acknowledged this sounds like his version of a Harrisong.<br /> -- \\"Riding to Vanity Fair:\\"  Hey, I wonder if I can write like Pink Floyd?<br /><br />As for his lyrics, McCartney still needs an iconoclastic collaborator like Lennon who would add ironic touches, or at least phrases more inventive than the constant repetition of the refrain words.  The nice ballad \\"This Never Happened Before\\" is marred by the repeated use not only of the title, but also of \\"sure, before, see,\\" and \\"be.\\"  Zzzzzzzzzz.<br /><br />To be fair, perhaps Paul MEANT this to be a retrospective (\\"Looking through the backyard of my life...\\"); if that's the case, he succeeded.  Perhaps the best part of \\"Chaos\\" is the beginning of the explosive riff at the disc's end.  Please understand -- I really WANTED to like this CD -- but the highest praise I can give is \\"it's OK,\\" and definitely for only the most rabid McCartney fans.<br /><br />By the way, Paul, give in to the glory of your age (how many of your contemporaries didn't make it to 64??) and give up the hair dye.  Trying to look younger than your most loyal fans isn't attractive, and perhaps all those chemicals applied to your head are stunting your creative growth.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|The best horror films have a very simple formula and that is have a sustained build up to the shocks, so that they can work effectively. Hostel starts off promisingly enough and shows the sexual adventures of a group of young lads, amidst the clubs of Europe. Hearing of a town in Eastern Europe where apparently anything goes, they head off there in the hope of even more gratifying sexual experiences. Characterisation of these guys is fairly good and when they get to the town, they indeed find the adventure that they are looking for. Unfortunately for them, the town people are also into kidnapping tourists, hikers etc and selling them to an operation being run in a deserted factory where wealthy psychopaths pay for the pleasure of being to able to torture and kill these captives.<br /><br />The initial shock of going from Rites Of Passage film to an out and out Horror flick is a strong one. The drill torture sequence in particular is horrible to watch..... Unfortunately Roth then throws too much gore into the pot from this point. In fact this gore overload goes beyond being gratuitous to actually being boring at times. The audience has no time to catch their breath but instead is bombarded relentlessly by intensely gruesome imagery, all the way until the end of the film.<br />Any shock value has become meaningless because of this gore overkill. It is a shame that Quentin Tarantino who oversaw this film, did not edit the end result.<br /><br />Basically to sum up, a good build up in the first half but then spoilt by a completely OTT and non stop gore fest in the second. At the end of this you have just stopped caring about the characters and the film, and that totally detracts from the revenge sequence at the end. Shame because with better plotting and editing from midway, this could have been a much better film.
0756603749|3.0|Bought this book for my course library (I am a wilderness instructor for Outward Bound).  Realized too late that it does not include the taut line hitch or the trucker's (wagoneer's) hitch, both of which we use a lot.  I would have thought those would be included in any good knots book.  Ultimately replaced it with \\"The Book of Knots: How to Tie 200 Practical Knots\\" by Budworth & Dalton.  Good illustrations a better selection of knots.
B000FGGE68|3.0|The subject of very bad reviews, I was not particularly keen to see this film. Having actually seen the film, I agree that there are too many fight sequences, to the point that you could be in a PS2 game. These sequences are at times too drawn out and some become predictable and tedious....<br /><br />Also the plot could have been better developed too.<br /><br />So what is good about the film?<br /><br />Set in the future, the world is in the midst of a war between humans and people infected with a vampire like virus which gives them superhuman skills.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is actually quite good in the ambiguous lead role. She has fled the laboratory that infected her with the Hemomphage virus which resulted in the death of her unborn child. Now embittered and angry with Humanity, she has become a lethal assassin for the Hemophage movement.<br /><br />However, her stance is turned upside down when she encounters a laboratory bred, nine year old boy. Well played by Cameron Bright, he is a vessel for a virus that could threaten Hemophages or Humanity. Both sides want to get hold of him. In scenes reminiscent of John Cassavates 'Gloria', this boy's plight cuts through Ultraviolet's cynical exterior and awakens her maternal instincts, and she goes on the run with him, trying to protect him from her fellow Hemophages and the security forces of Humanity's dictator.<br /><br />She and Bright develop a convincing and sympathetic relationship while on the run, and just like Gloria, this enhances and underscores the moments of danger and peril<br /><br />The sets are superb and give the film real atmosphere at times, I believe that Shanghai was largely used as the location.<br /><br />See the film for what it is - undemanding but entertaining Sci Fi.

B00005JOX6|4.0|I was happily suprised with the way that \\"Click\\" turned out, to be honest I thought that the first 45 minutes or so of the film was just like any other comedy, especially a comedy starring Adam Sandler. It seemed to focus only on beeing funny and did'nt and didnt appear to be making an effort or concentrating enough on getting the audience fully involved. I thought that near the middle and ending though, you could really start to get engrossed as well as involved in the conflicts of the man's life and the deep problems that he gets himself into with the \\"Universal Remote\\". I think that the major reason for that is that Adam Sandler has progressed as an actor, he finally is starting to stop looking like an awkwardly old teenager and has settled down. He is still the funny Adam Sandler that we have all grown to love but he seems to be deeper than that now, Ever since he stared in the dark-comedy \\"Punch-Drunk Love\\" I have noticed that he takes his roles in movies alot more seriously. <br /> <br />I thought that \\"Click\\" had a very good message and I was actually really getting involved in the story. I thought that \\"Click\\" managed to get the humor packed into the film as everyone expected but also added a more dramatic side to the film which really helped it out alot. <br /> <br />Christopher Walken, Kate Beckinsale & David Hasselhoff join together in what was overall a very solid supporting cast. Especially on Christopher Walkens part. <br /> <br />Everything in the end managed to fit together really quite well, but honestly the first 45 minutes were absolutly nothing interesting or new.  <br /> <br />Grade: B
B00004Y6NU|1.0|I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT DIRE STRAITS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A TREMENDOUSLY OVER RATED BAND.THEY ONLY MADE ONE GOOD ALBUM IN THEIR DEBUT.MARK KNOPFLER IS A REALLY BORING SINGER AND THEIR GUITARING WAS ALWAYS BLAND AND UNINSPIRING.I WOULD REQUEST YOU TO AVOID THIS BORING ALBUM AND GET ALBUMS FROM GREAT BANDS LIKE LED ZEPPELIN,AC/DC,BOSTON,QUEEN,THE WHO,THE ROLLING STONES AND BLACK SABBATH.
B0002IU988|5.0|First of all, for all the reviews that say it sounds like Creed...IT IS Creed! - But, with a much better singer, Myles Kennedy, who blows Stapp's range out of the water. Mark Tremonti is a pioneer in guitar riffs and anthemic post-grunge rock he makes and I will continue to follow him wherever he goes.  Scott Phillips, who is one of the best drummers (as one myself), of any band out there.  Brian Marshall (bass) - who I think is the most underrated bassists in rock today, this guy really doesn't get enough credit. <br /> <br />On to the album review... <br /> <br />I have listened to this album day after day, for a year... As you listen, Alter Bridge immerses you in its throaty and hard rock with somewhat of a pop feel, then it eases to wholesome, peaceful music on the lighter tracks such as 4. Burn It Down, 7. In Loving Memory & 10. Shed My Skin. Track #9 is a Metallica influenced song, Watch Your Words written by Tremonti (as, in fact, all the tracks are) <br /> <br />My favorites: <br />100/10 (no typo)!!! - 5. Metalingus: THE BEST song to come out in ages, if you talk about and all out 'ROCK OUT'. <br />10/10 - 6. Broken Wings: Put this track on repeat and find yourself singing along! Great song, enough said. <br />10/10 - 8. Down to My Last: \\"My personal favorite\\" Creed fans will adore. An anthemic tribute to the fans who have supported them through Creed until present. Myles blows the roof off with his range and Tremonti solos for all to see that he is the most advanced guitarist of his generation. <br />10/10 - 11. The End Is Here: In my opinion, the best pick for an outro jam, its catchy guitar melody and impacting lyrics show off this amazing band. <br /> <br />Wind-Up Records: Alter Bridge's now \\"former\\" label SUCKS!!! And this is why AB split it off. WHERE WAS THE PROMO FOR THESE GUYS?!?!?!?! Wind-Up does (and always has done) a sucka** job of promoting their bands. They stick their money in just one headliner and hope for the best...Examples: They pulledout a greatest hits album for Creed when there wasn't a Creed. Evanscence, !NO NAMES! who popped out of nowhere, but became mainstream because Wind-Up promoted them so well. <br /> <br />Alter Bridge: wish the best for continued success.

B000HEWEE4|4.0|I've only been going on about this film since I originally heard about it, probably before they started filming, when it was announced, and was called \\"Il Mare\\". I loved both actors in Speed, and have since been a fan of both of them, although they can be forgiven for some of their film choices (hello, Two Weeks Notice!) They had such great chemistry in Speed, but I was actually doubtful about the renamed Lake House, as from the plot, it didn't sound like they spent much time together in the film. In fact, it sounded quite similar to Sleepless In Seattle. I was pleasantly surprised, as though the storyline keeps them apart for a fair chunk of the film, they do end up talking.<br /><br />The whole storyline is somehow, Keanu's character Alex, and Sandra's character Kate, both lived in the same house, but at different times. Alex is in 2004, Kate is in 2006. Yet they manage to correspond, each disbelieving at first that they live two years apart. Then through various letters, somehow, they fall in love. (Or lust, whatever, bearing in mind they haven't physically seen each other.) They try and figure out a way to be together, they work out a date they're going to meet each other on, but Alex doesn't turn up. (You need to pay attention to the beginning of the film to understand why he doesn't turn up.) Then they both realise they've met in the past and various other incidents - Kate left a book at the train station, and she tells Alex to go and get it, and when she forgets it, she sees him picking up her forgotten book.<br /><br />The plot can sometimes be a bit far fetched, I'm still not sure about the ending. Not only was it a bit too Hollywood - although I think I would have cried if it had been any other way and that would have been embarrassing - but I think by the end it was actually set in 2008! But then it would have meant Kate's character was in 2010 - oh I'm confused!<br /><br />The only thing that really bugged me about this film was Sandra's hair. What possessed her to get her hair cut that short?! Dear God. But thankfully, now she seems to be putting on a little weight, marriage must be suiting her. She's still skinny, she always will be, but she's looking better.<br /><br />Suspension of disbelief is a really wonderful thing. It's quite good that's it's used in a romantic film. The plot is about connecting with your soulmate, the one that is right for you, especially when you feel isolated. Who hasn't felt they've waited too long to find the perfect someone, or felt alone at a crowded party.<br /><br />The reviewers who claim \\"bad acting\\" - shut up. There's always gonna be someone out there who slags off Keanu for his acting skills, but why are you watching it if you're just gonna write a review and slate his acting?<br /><br />See this film with someone you love. It'll open your eyes to what could possibly happen, what would happen if you never met them, and will make you look at them differently. It's an excellent, magical film, and I will be definitely preordering it when it comes out on DVD. And it's good to see Keanu & Sandra lighting up the big screen again. They make a good team.air cut that short?! Dear God. But thankfully, now she seems to be putting on a little weight, marriage must be suiting her.

B000ETRCMQ|4.0|I very much enjoyed this movie, and am hoping that there is a sequel in which Bree returns to New Mexico and lives happily ever after! <br /> <br />I guess the reason that I enjoyed this movie so much were my own difficulties in learning how to acknowledge the past while embracing who I am.  All transgendered men and women must confront what part of the past to bury or deny, and what part to carry forward into the new existence.  So many of us would rather supress all that comes before the transition, and try to start fresh.  It is like starting a new job in a new city; we think that we can bury all of the bad things that we did or are, and somehow begin anew.  But we can't, and that is what Bree's therapist tries to teach her.  The movie is about Bree's journey (the metaphor of the road trip), from the \\"stealth\\" life based on denial, to the healthier life, birthed through much pain in confronting herself, her parents, her son.  The movie is non-judgemental in terms of gender identity, but very much on the side of personal honesty. <br /> <br />I particularly enjoyed the ending in which Bree's son has not become a saint, but rather someone who few would approve, and yet their love and bond is strengthened. <br /> <br />The acting was great, but I was left wondering why they couldn't have had a genetic male play the role of Bree.  It almost offended me as I would think that a white man in black face playing a black man would have offended a true black man 70 years ago. Don't misunderstand me; Huffman did a great job, but somehow, I would have preferred a real transsexual or at least a man (think Steven Macintosh in \\"Different for Girls\\") to have played the role. <br /> <br />Paula
B00070DK1E|3.0|Like a lot of innovative 70's bands, Jethro Tull hit some hard times during the 80's. And, in a way, Tull's earlier massive success was a bit of an albatross: in order to keep playing the big venues & getting radio play, Ian Anderson had to play the game. Conversely, unlike most bands, Anderson also had a loyal core of fans who expected him to keep pushing the musical envelope. These facts explain the paradox of Crest of a Knave.<br /><br />The album starts off with a pretty pedestrian rocker, \\"Steel Monkey\\", with some fairly forgettable lyrics. The only really interesting aspect of this song is Martin Barre's guitar playing, but Anderson's new-found gruff voice (due to a throat complaint), the drum machine, and the subject matter make this a fairly tedious listen. To be honest, this song doesn't really sound like Tull at all.<br /><br />Things look up immediately with Farm on the Freeway. This is one of the great Tull tunes, and a song that continues in the epic tradition of My God, Heavy Horses, and Dark Ages. Ian's voice sounds really good on this one, and Martin Barre's guitar playing is immaculate.<br /><br />Jump Start continues in this promising vein, with intelligent lyrics (Anderson's speciality), great guitar-playing (Barre's speciality) and a more sleek sound than the Tull of old.<br /><br />This album came under a lot of flak for sounding like Dire Straits when it came out, and it must be said that this is an entirely valid criticism. Said She Was A Dancer, Dogs In The Midwinter, and The Waking Edge are all forgettable hard rock in the Dire Straits/Foreigner mold; this NEVER would have happened from Tull at any time during the 70's.<br /><br />The hardest-edged piece here, Mountain Men, is a moving anti-war song about Gaelic Scots, but I'm not too wild about Martin Barre's strat sound. It's a pity that he didn't use a Gibson for this tune, so that there could be some Minstrel-era crunch to it.<br /><br />To end on a good note, we also have Budapest, which is one of the best songs of the 80's, by any artist, and one of Anderson's most amazingly intricate compositions. Weaving folk, Bartok-like melodies, flamenco, hard rock, and a hint of jazz to the mix, Ian Anderson's Budapest is unquestionably the work of genius.<br /><br />The bonus track, Part Of The Machine is actually better than a good half of the songs on this album, and sounds much more like the Tull that I adore.<br /><br />With Crest of a Knave, when it's good, it's VERY good. But when it's bad, it's pretty boring. Things dipped even further with Tull's next release, Rock Island. Fortunately, starting with Catfish Rising, and continuing through to the present, Ian Anderson stopped trying to compromise, and kept producing the quirky, intricate, lyrically astute, and majestic music that made Tull what it is, and which is why I continue to salute him.have Budapest, which is one of the best songs of the 80's, by any artist, and one of Anderson's most amazingly intricate compositions.

B000FMGTTE|5.0|Rhino and Warner demonstrates with this latest release from John Ottman - \\"Superman Returns\\", just how varied this composer can be. Do not restrict this talented man of music with his past achievements - \\"The Usual Suspects\\", \\"The Cable Guy\\", \\"Urban Legends-Final Cut\\", \\"Apt Pupil\\", \\"Goodbye Lover\\", \\"Lake Placid\\" and \\"Portrait of Terror\\" --- Instead of a classical approach, the producers decided the score should be more contemporary with interweaving of the John Williams original themes from the first \\"Superman:The Movie\\" film, well our composer took on the challenge and wrote a strikingly unique, emotionally deep score with a choral blend --- There are layers of underscore, infusing complex moods with passages of modern themes, very effective and wonderfully original.<br /><br />Ottman always brings the necessary emotions to a film through his music, which could explain why this composer is always in demand. And as a bonus, Rhino has included selected Enhanced Content: \\"Superman Returns\\" Trailer #1, \\"Superman Returns\\" Trailer #2, Behind the Scenes:\\"Superman Returns\\" Score, and \\"Look Up in the Sky\\": Amazing Story of Superman Trailer --- this is worth the price of admission, as three cues from the original master, unretouched and exactly as John had intended.<br /><br />The cast of \\"Superman Returns\\" (2006) is Brandon Routh (Clark Kent/Superman), Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane), Kevin Spacey (Lex Luthor),  James Marsden (Richard White),  Parker Posey (Kitty Kowalski),  Frank Langella (Perry White),  Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen),  Eva Marie Saint (Martha Kent),  Marlon Brando (Jor-El (archive footage) Kal Penn (Stanford),  David Fabrizio (Brutus),  Ian Roberts (Riley), Vincent Stone (Grant),  Jack Larson (Bo the Bartender), Noel Neill (Gertrude Vanderworth)...great job by the director Bryan Singer, screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, with story by Bryan Singer, Dougherty and Harris...and Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster the creators of the comic book character Superman, made his debut on June 1st, 1938 in Action Comics No. 1 and heralded in the 'Golden Age of Comics'. The original issue only cost 10 cents then --- Max Fleischer film series is where Superman \\"learned\\" to fly, prior to this he was only able to \\"leap tall buildings in a single bound\\". It was deemed that leaping would not look right on film --- and even when superman flies it looks as if he needs to make a jumping start rather than just taking off.<br /><br />In the endless reaches of the universe, there once existed a planet known as Krypton, a planet that burned like a green star in the distant heavens --- their civilization was far advanced and it brought forth a race of \\"supermen,\\" whose mental and physical powers were developed to the absolute peak of human perfection --- but there came a day when giant quakes threatened to destroy Krypton forever --- one of the planet's leading scientists, sensing the approach of doom, placed his infant son in a small rocket ship and sent it hurtling in the direction of the Earth just as Krypton exploded --- the rocket sped through star-studded space, landing safely on Earth with its precious burden: Krypton's sole survivor --- a passing motorist found the uninjured child and took it to an orphanage --- as the years went by and the child grew to maturity, he found himself possessed of amazing physical powers --- Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound... the infant of Krypton is now the Man of Steel, SUPERMAN --- to best be in a position to use his amazing powers in a never-ending battle for truth and justice, Superman has assumed the disguise of Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper.<br /><br />Must say that my hat is off to Bryan Singer for making so many important right choices --- staying with the original John Williams score and having Ottman build from it --- bringing back and re-working of Brando's archive footage ---but the real clincher is casting of Brandon Routh as the Man of Steel, an amazing performance that Brandon Routh has turned in... moments that you relive Routh's portrayal into Reeve's performances, such as the half cocked smile and the timbre of his voice, the Clark Kent mannerisms perfected by Reeves are echoed here in Routh's delivery...but this would not work if it wasn't for the theme from John Williams and and the score by John Ottman...must say tis' perfection for all \\"film score buffs\\", just as it should be.<br /><br />Total Time: 55 mins on 15 Tracks ~ WEA/RHINO 77654 ~ (6/27/2006)age --- but the real clincher is casting of Brandon Routh as the Man of Steel, an amazing performance that Brandon Routh has turned in... moments that you relive Routh's portrayal into Reeve's performances, such as the half cocked smile and the timbre of his voice, the Clark Kent mannerisms perfected by Reeves are echoed here in Routh's delivery...but this would not work if it wasn't for the theme from John Williams and and the score by John Ottman...must say tis' perfection for all \\"film score buffs\\", just as it should be. <br /> <br />Total Time: 55 mins on 15 Tracks ~ WEA/RHINO 77654 ~ (6/27/2006)
B0006399FS|1.0|When they released ATYCLB II (better known as HTDAAB) obviously their heyday (which was with their 80s and 90s albums) was already vanished in the haze of corporate mainstream music. <br /> <br />Except for City Of Blinding Lights this copy-paste effort does not contain any song that can fascinate me. <br /> <br />With this album the band went totally wrong: After the most overrated and overplayed of the 00s (ATYDLB) clearly U2 were not going in a direction the fans liked, quite the opposite. Now the fans have discovered that Zooropa and Pop were fantastic and innovative records, and this sellout direction sound already dated, predictable, boring, weak, unworthy, cheap and commercial.  <br /> <br />From their former fantastic career U2 passed better periods, absolutely, the glory of their early years, the artistic and commercial jump from 1984-1992, the remarkable and overlooked avant garde era 1993-1997... and that's all. U2 died in 2000 with the release of ATYCLB, their biggest artistic step down.  and this one testifies their rotten status as corporate music corruption. <br /> <br />How come Bono can still claim for end of poverty, justice, human rights, etc while the band charged the highest tickets ever seen on their Vertigo Tour? (what an original Tour name, by the way!) How come Bono pretends to be with the third world while in Chile, for example, U2 charged higher ticket prices than in United States?. Hypocrisy and its most repulsive. <br /> <br />Back to HTDAAB, this album is, without a doubt, the most  uninspired, dreadful, predictable and disposable of their catalogue. Remember when everybody asked back in the 90s how would going to sound the next U2 album?. U2 used to be an indefinable style band, U2 were an style themselves!. Their indecible world of sounds, lyrics, compositions, textures, colours, and concepts was simply what the other bands must do in order to stay relevant. <br /> <br />Now this wrinkled kinda by act is no more relevant by any means.Their live performances have shown the passing of time, their DVD's are among the worst ones I've ever seen, and the most important thing: Their albums and their songs have become in a pitiful excuse for new tours. That's all. <br /> <br />The now unquestionably lack of decent music songwriting has put the band downhill, and the most critical aspect about that is that the band still pretend they're the \\"biggest band in the world\\", with arrogant, close minded and selfish attitude. After all, what U2 release is less important than the event itself, you know \\"The new U2 album!\\", \\"See U2 live!\\", etc <br /> <br />Now it's clear why the music industry is so corrupted by money machine bands like U2. If HTDAAB weren't have been released by U2, the album wouldn't have passed the \\"demos\\" form, because music labels would have thought that they were completely unexciting, heared before, just 11 songs that went nowhere except for making bucks and keep accumulating excess, avarice, greed, lies, cheap promises, lame albums and DVD's, robberies and overweight. <br /> <br />How long... how long must we sing this song? (Bono, 1983)
1594200823|5.0|I'd like to give it maybe 10 stars.  It's the best written and most intelligent book I've read in a long time.  It takes a very complicated subject and makes it simple and interesting, approaching it from many points of view and different directions.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Many words have been written, sadly, most of them blindly influenced by the stupid band's behaviour of bashing Pop and prasing ATYCLB as a \\"return to form\\", \\"classic U2\\", or whatever. <br />Don't let the commercial machine fool you. Both in ATYCLB and HTAAB you can feel the painful hurry as to take away the name from Pop. Pointless radio hit numbers, dreadful songwriting, canned FM pop oriented (emtpy, predictable, cheap and unimaginative) production, selling out attitue, truly unnecesary and albums which the band failed in copying the Joshua Tree formula, really. <br /> <br />Well, let's go back to POP. This album is genius. Dark and conceptual, Pop delves into the vast regions of the human brain leaving lots up to the imagination of the listener.  <br /> <br />Pop is the last U2 album with outstanding lyrics, aggressive and innovative sound. Unlike the twin albums ATYCLB and HTDAAB, this work is indispensable and unique. Please is the last best song the band wrote. Also cuts like Mofo are quintessential U2 at their most experimental and exquisite. Staring At The sun, Gone, Discotheque, Last Night On Earth, etc. EVERY single song is unique and totally different than the others, but the album displays an awesome union and the most orgasmic marriage between electronica, dark and sublime rock. <br /> <br />Guitars are the heaviest Edge has ever played, saturated loops and rythms dominate the first 3 songs. Consistent balance between hard songs and soft ones. By the way, this is by far the most rocker U2 album since their early days on Pop or War. Beautiful and deep songs are presented here as well, like If God Will Send His Angels, Please or Wake Up Dead Man <br /> <br />Pop is definitely their finest creative suite. As Radiohead will never make any better than OK Computer no matter how hard they'll try, U2 won't release any better than Pop, the most haunting and indisputably U2 album ever.
B000F39MAQ|5.0|Anyone who gives this DVD a bad review does not understand the true meaning of Opera. The sets are absolutely beautiful, the acting is supurb, and the orchestra/voice balance is just right. Not to mention that the singing is acceptional. Thomas Hampson's voice is still in top shape and his dramaticism is excellent. Rolando Villazon's tenor is very resonant and very dramatic. Netrebko's voice is reminiscent of Sutherland and the Callas early years. She is very dramatic and very sexy. This production is of the highest quality and gives a ray of hope to the future of opera.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Bought this on cassette so many years ago when it came out. Came back to it so many times feeling it become a part of me with every new listening. So well written and performed  it actually needs no endorsement. It stands out for itself in the new museum of pre-post-whatever ART.

The movie is entertaining, Tom Cruise is cool, so is the soundtrack. Yeah, going out to fight and die is soooo exciting and you don't have to look at any of the mutilated corpses of civilians, errrh, I meant collateral damage those missiles and bombs produce on the ground either, nor do you have to deal with any of the moral implications of being a paid killer for the government. It's all about boys having fun! <br /> <br />If you turn off your brains before watching this film it makes for great evening entertainment.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Boston is amazing. Period. You really need to buy this album, as it is awesome. My favorites are More than a Feeling, Peace of Mind, and Rock and Roll Band. Please don't listen to the 1 star reviews, as most of them don't know what they are talking about. Take whirligig for example. You may see a trend of me bashing his character, but he deserves it. He is the most contradicting and just plain confusing people I've ever seen. You can see some of this on my Led Zeppelin IV review, but I'll add onto it. For one thing, he makes the statement that Boston's lead singer \\"just screams.\\" I've listened to many Boston songs countless times and have yet to find any example of \\"screaming.\\" Boston's singer does what his title says he does-he SINGS. Just because he holds notes for a long time and uses a suprising spectrum of notes does not mean he \\"screams.\\" Sorry if you enjoy the same boring note over and over again such as any singing done on Kurt Cobain's part. His claim of \\"screaming\\" can be found on many other reviews like ACDC and Led Zeppelin. Those are at least a little more accurate, but the mention of it here shows that he's never heard a Boston song in his life.    In his Boston review he makes the claim that \\"EVEN Green Day is better than this. Go buy a Billie Joe Armstrong album as he's at least talented.\\" So if the lead singer of Green Day \\"is talented,\\" then that implies that you enjoy listening to him, a conclusion certainly not supported by \\"EVEN Green Day is better than this. On his Zeppelin IV review, he initially had a 1 star, saying they sucked, but shockingly changed it. (not sure if it was because of my post or someone elses, but whatever) He also added \\"remember, as I agree with that reviewer, Green Day are horrible.\\" First of all, that's not even correct English because Green Day is a singular noun, despite having multiple members. There is only one Green Day, so say \\"Green Day is horrible.\\" Secondly, he changed his initial post to remove the band Green Day from his \\"recommended bands\\" (which also included the familiar \\"Dire Straits, Foreigner, Nirvana, etc.\\")    Now I was skeptical, so I checked his other reviews. This is what I found, which made me even more confused. The first time I checked, I found a 5 star Green Day American Idiot review (one of my most despised albums ever) giving excessive praise to a talentless bunch of misfits. When I returned, I found a 1 star review saying the sucked. He hasn't, however, changed his Green Day Warning review, and has carelessly left it a 5 star review saying \\"Green Day are great!\\" (once again incorrect English.) Am I the only one who finds this kid to have no idea what music he even likes? I hope not... I did enjoy his overly pompous statement that makes him think he's superior to the rest of us \\"Believe me kid, Whirligig has a better opinion than any of you.\\" It gave me a good laugh. It seems to me that Whirligig doesn't even have an opinion because he's so screwed up. I love his mundane, asinine way of trying to lengthen his posts... in quite a few of them you can find \\"(insert band name here) Sucks!\\" over and over again because he doesn't know enough about the music to do an actual review. (by the way, I just found on his Queen review another list of bands that \\"are the best\\" and guess who's on it? GREEN DAY!     If this kid doesn't know what he himself likes, how the hell can he recommend anything to anyone?! I keep using \\"kid\\" because I sincerly hope that a grown up wouldn't use so many childish techniques in his reviews. Any civilized person wouldn't give the reason \\"because they suck\\" as why you should avoid a certain band. I also sincerly hope that an adult would be able to make their entries as error free as possible. (i.e. avoid mispellings-common in his reviews-and avoid breaking so many grammer rules.)    I sincerly hope that this know-nothing hasn't turned anyone away from this album through his nonsensical review. This is a great rock album, and I highly recommend it. All in all, however, I can't guarantee that you'll like it, just like he can't guarantee that you won't. Take a chance and buy it-you might like it. (besides, $10 won't break you)    P.S. In the future, avoid any 1 star reviews that list the bands \\"Dire Straits, Green Day, Nirvana, Foreigner, and Guns N Roses,\\" or some deviation of that. I'm not saying these are bad bands, but if they are linked in the same review as being \\"the best,\\" they are most likely from this reviewer either under this name or another. As I have shown in countless ways in this review and my Zeppelin IV review, he's not very credible, so don't trust his judgement.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|But by no means their best album, it is their most accesible yet, but i prefer the previous, Agaetis Byrjun. Don't get me wrong this is a great album, full of allucinating moments according to your emotional state. Every sigur rós album is a different, enjoyable expierence. I of course recommend this one.
B00005EAXF|5.0|This DVD (and also CD with abt. 75 % of songs) was recorded live in Portuguese monastery more or less \\"unplugged\\" (bass guitar was mostly electric though). New acoustic arrangements gave old classics a new life, plus there are 2 or three new songs and three cover-versions: Dust in the Wind (\\"Kansas\\" original), Drive (from \\"Cars\\") and Love of my Life ('Queen', of course). Total of 21 tracks, and I should say that 17 or 18 of them are played real good. Five members of the band plus one (Brazilian?) percussionist, one extra ac. gtr. player, a keyboard/orchestrations/arrangements wizard, three background singers and a girl with cello (unfortunately, we can hear her only accasionally - thanks to Mr. Soundman). Ah, and last but not the least: great audience and fantastic dancers!  <br /> <br />There are some interviews also, and I recall talking to Messrs. Meine & Schenker during Moscow Music peace festival in 1988 (or was it 1989? - I should check, I still got memorable T'shirt from the event :-)) and singing \\"Wind of Change\\" together. <br /> <br />Picture is exellent, but the sound - well, PCM Stereo is real good, 5.1 Dolby is not bad, but 5.1 DTS is really something: thanks to Mr. Soundman again I've had unforgettable experience - vocals from central channel (OK), gtrs from left and right front speakers (too quiet!) and very loud keyboards from left and right rear speakers!!! A real fly in the ointment, because on CD the sound is OK. <br /> <br />But anyway, this is a really good live DVD with different acoustic sound from the band of endless hits. <br />Try it and you won't be disappointed.
6305313687|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever. It came out in a year of cinematographic redefinition, that year (1999), along with this film, came others as great as this one, like fight club (also with Edward Norton), and on a lesser level, the matrix. Of course these are very different films, but the point is, they all offer not just great entertainment value but also they make you think in a whole new level, not just about the problems portrayed. This film sets a precedent in the way violence and intolerance are portrayed in films. Great film, at a great price, and i of course recommmend it. I'd wish only it had more features, but in the end the movie is the most impotant feature of all, and it is presented in great image and sound. Buy it.
6305127646|5.0|The average viewer rating herein should be proof enough that editorials like the one posted above and movie critics are in the minority.  Val Kilmer did an excellent and believable job in this role.  If you want a 1960's version of the Saint, watch the B/W version with Roger Moore.  I liked that, but loved this movie. <br /> <br />This modern day version is on target.  Elizabeth Shue (who steals my heart) is also awesome in her role.  Val's character portray's Templar younger.  Great addition!  Simon not only changes his appearance but personas as well.  This adds depth to Simon Templar's character.  He is realistic. Totally believable.  Bruce Willis did similar in The Jackal but was not called \\"quirky.\\"  Obviously the critics could not get past their own personal bias. <br /> <br />Remember, Star Wars received thumbs down from critics when it came out.  I hope someone follows this up with a Saint II with Kilmer and Shue.  Hopefully someone will look past the blind critics and to the people who matter...us and do this. <br /> <br />Buy this movie, you will not be disappointed.   <br /> <br />Val and Elizabeth, if you are reading this these years after the movie which has withstood the test of time for a decade...Excellent Job!  Thank you!  As you can see from teh ratings, we love the movie! <br />
B000002LJA|5.0|How is it that Quincy Jones manages to make such good albums even though he does not play or sing a single note? Or for that matter, write any of the material?<br /><br />This album is good from start to finish and spawned a number of hits that charted. You can sit down and listen to it from start to finish any day of the week and have a good experience.
1878424505|2.0|Although the actual 4 agreements make perfect sense, the author presents it in a ridiculous way.  It's an easy read, if you can ignore the arrogant voice of the author, and the poor use of the English language.  He'll make a valid point in his book, and spend the next 3 paragraphs swerving into some area that had no relevance whatsoever to what he was trying to prove.  At times, it read like a bad high school paper. <br /> <br />I was looking for a way to explore personal freedom.  This was nothing more than what is discussed on any Oprah Winfrey Show.  Yes, the 4 agreements were good, but was it worth the time to sift through the garbage to get it?   I didn't think so.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|I don't actually own this movie; I came across it for the first time on TCM about six months ago, and watch it whenever it's on.  I've never been a big fan of older movies, but \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is one of those rare films that holds my attention from beginning to end.  Joan Crawford is at her movie-star best as the title character: an ambitious, hard-working woman willing to do ANYTHING to gain the love and respect of her self-centered daughter.  Ann Blyth is sinfully wonderful as uber-snob Veda Pierce, but Joan's Mildred is the one that steals the show.  You can't help but feel sorry for her as she conquers one next-to-impossible goal after the next, only to be cut down repeatedly by the impossibly ungrateful Veda.  The ending, where Veda gets what she richly deserves (and anyone with an ounce of compassion prays she'll get), is both the most heart-wrenching and satisfying moment of all.  \\"Mildred Pierce\\" has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time.  Say what you will about Joan Crawford's off-screen demeanor, but as an actress the woman was most definitely in a class all her own.
B00000IZOR|5.0|I didn't think I would find an old style rotary phone. I was happy to see that Fisher Price still made it! I wish it was  wooden like the one I got my oldest child 30+ years ago. That phone lasted through both of my boys. I hope this plastic phone holds up as well. I bought this chatter phone for my grand children to play with when they come to Grama's house. I want them to see a real telephone and learn how to dial up numbers. I noticed the only other difference was that the receiver cord is shorter than I remember and you have to hold the phone when you talk into the mouth piece. This is a must have \\"old style\\" learning toy...thank you Fisher Price!!!!
B000FQVY2C|5.0|I couldn't be more excited than if George Martin announced that more previously unknown parts of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" had been found!    The 9 track original LP is just about the best LP to be released in the early 1970's (it was released in 1973) and the lousy sounding Warner Archives CD has remained a good catalog seller after all these years.    Now, UK Rhino has released a 20 track CD (US Rhino is too damn stupid to put it out here....).  Even tho at the time of this review, Amazon has not updated their listing.  Here's the extra tracks:    10.Burned Out Affair (amazing outtake....slightly flat vocals...could've used another take)  11.Child's Christmas In Wales (alt version)  12.Hanky Panky Nohow (drone mix)  13.The Endless Plain Of Fortune (alt version)  14.Andalucia (rehearsal)  15.MacBeth (alt version)  16.Paris 1919 (string mix)  17.Graham Greene (rehearsal)  18.Half Past France (alt version)  19.Antarctia Starts Here (rehearsal)  20.Paris 1919 (piano mix)  21.HIDDEN TRACK; Macbeth (wild unissued backing track!)    .....wow these are just plain fabulous....early versions, rough rehearsals, alternative versions of 9 of the greatest pieces of serious pop music ever!)    Anyone who like this classic album needs this reissue.    Wouldn't it be nice for Amazon to update their listing?
B00005JOX6|5.0|Note: NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW <br /> <br />Most people agree Adam Sandler is a \\"love him or hate\\" him kind of guy. This film finally takes him into the mainstream. Sandler has mostly convinced people he can act in films like \\"Punch Drunk Love\\" (of which I am NOT a fan) and \\"Spanglish\\" (over-rated). He has shown to be very funny in films like \\"The Waterboy\\" and \\"The Wedding Singer.\\" He now finally finds a film that is funny and also touching. This movie is being marketed as just another Sandler film, implying juvenile humor and over the top humor, but this movie is far more.  <br /> <br />Much of the film IS funny and there ARE fart jokes, but the final act is brilliant. A lot of this film is as heartbreaking and as endearing as any of the films it is being compared to such as \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\" A more appropriate comparison would be \\"Bruce Almighty\\" or Cage's \\"The Family Man\\". And, in fact, this film is far superior to both of those. Sandler is very believable as a guy caught up the getting ahead and losing sight of what's really important. Beckinsale is beautiful and smoking hot and plays the wife perfectly. Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner play the grandparents great, and the kids are excellent as well. You believe these people are a family. There are a few wasted characters that waste valuable screen time, such as Jennifer Coolage as Janine. I could have done without her, since she added little to the plot. Walken is good as always, but he is subdued and doesn't make any effort to steal the film, say in the way he did in \\"Envy.\\" This film has a lot of heart. I expect it will continue to get a lot of bad reviews and that's a shame since it really has a nice message wrapped in a funny film. I suspect that the studio was aiming for teens with this film, but the target audience that would enjoy this most are 30ish family men (you know the big kids trying to be grownups yet still cling to sports, Xbox, and fantasy football).  <br /> <br />I'd like to point outagain my frustration with films that make little kids swear... and this one has children saying a few bad words. I'm no prude, but it's unnecessary and degrades an otherwise great film. Most seven year olds I know don't say the S word, so why does Hollywood or Sandler think we find this funny?  <br /> <br />Depending of your parenting style, I wouldn't allow anyone under 15 to see this, mostly for language but also for some tense scenes of death and loss.  <br /> <br />If you liked Groundhog Day, The Wedding Singer, The Family Man, heck even Forrest Gump, take a shot at this movie. It's touching and funny and might inspire some people to make different choices in life.  <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B00003CXDV|5.0|If you ever watched Star Trek, this is a classic parody.    This movie has fun with the fans without ever being mean spirited.
B000EGDC14|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this cream filled pie. It's very filling,very innovative, w/that retro 70's glam stomp beat thing, driving your feet crazy. Ms.Goldfrapp could sing the telephone book and I'd listen to it. She's very hypnotic and energizing at the same time,kind of like acid on a clear spring day. But she's legal! The DVD is very informative and gives you the goods on the songs and their intent. The videos are surreal, beautiful and very strong. I can't recommend this disc strongly enough. Take a chance on something different.
1592401791|1.0|I was so disappointed with this book I can barely find the words to describe it.  I thought it would be all about what the author did to create the sounds that revolutionized rock and roll recording -- and make no mistake, Geoff Emerick deserves plenty of credit for innovation and fearless experimentation -- but that's not what we get with this book.  Sure, he tells us a few choice details, like how he got Paul's huge bass sound on \\"Rain\\" and \\"Paperback Writer,\\" and how he managed to make John sound like something from your greatest acid trip on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" but this book isn't about recording The Beatles so much as it is about slighting everyone Emerick feels didn't treat him with great respect from the word go.  The more you read, the more you suspect that even the best intentioned person would become cannon fodder for Emerick's pen if he didn't smile warmly and say something incredibly kind during their first handshake.  The ratio of people he dislikes to those he likes is way out of whack.  My theory has always been that anyone who can't seem to find anyone to talk about in a positive way is probably the problem himself.<br /><br />Very early in the book Emerick lets us know that George Harrison didn't give him the time of day.  Uh oh.  He spends the rest of the book mercilessly trashing George with accusations that are certainly easy to make now that George is dead and therefore unavailable to demand a retraction.  According the Emerick, George Harrison was a mediocre guitarist at best.  Interesting, then, that he should become so influential.  Hell, there's a whole branch of the power pop genre that owes everything to Harrison.  But Emerick says he couldn't play, so I guess it must be true, right?<br /><br />Except... wouldn't the greatest band in the world have kicked him out if he wasn't a killer player who was bringing important stuff to the table?<br /><br />Ask Pete Best about that.  You remember Pete, right?  He wasn't good enough to make it to that final rung on the ladder of success, so they brought in Ringo Starr, widely considered the best drummer in Liverpool.  Ah, but Emerick doesn't like poor Ringo, either.  Makes him out to be a shoddy drummer and a blithering idiot who reads comic books and plays checkers because... well, that's his level of intellect.  He also says he hasn't much of a personality.  Ringo.  The guy who was #1 on all the best party lists in the 60s because<br /><br />As for John Lennon, well, Emerick seems to have been fascinated by John, and he certainly thought him greatly talented, but he paints a picture of an unpredictable guy who might be gentle or vicious, depending on the mood, and it might be both in the same hour.  In short, he got Lennon right.  Hey, he had to get SOMETHING right.<br /><br />That leaves Paul, who came up to the little room Emerick was restricted to in the early days and spent his break times talking music, comparing notes on the latest records on the radio.  They became friends, and more importantly, Paul showed Emerick mega-respect.<br /><br />The result of all of the above is an entire, long book with repetitive comments belittling George and Ringo, wondering over John and being sentimental about Paul to the point of nearly being romantic.  It wears thin very fast.  Sometimes it is creepy.  And when it gets to the point where you cringe every time he starts to write about a session because you know he's going to make George out to be a non-musical, hostile, bumbling fool, you start to ask yourself why you're still reading the book... and why so many people, people you would have to assume are fans of the band, are giving it five stars.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|I'm giving this movie three stars because it held my interest.  That's the single most important thing a movie must do.  It has to hold the audience's interest.<br /><br />Now for the flaws.  The directing sells sizzle rather than steak, and belongs to the school of Fake it til you make it.  What it does is shoot the action scenes in a purposely confusing way, obfuscation, sort of like a football tv director deciding not to show you the runner evading tacklers and crossing yard lines but rather just showing you things too close up, just a blur, and then he crosses the goal line.  The theory is apparently to keep you on your toes trying to find out what the hell is going on, assuming that this technique will impress you.  I'd rather not play that game.  I'd rather see what is going on.<br /><br />Another major flaw is that the star \\"never makes a mistake\\", as one of his opponents in the CIA puts it.  That's nice.  Nice little super hero.  Always does exactly the right thing, never makes a mistake.  That only happens in movie scripts, dummy.  That turns this story into a comic book.  Nothing human here.<br /><br />Actors are too good looking, too acceptable looking.  Give me an ugly lead.  Give me overweight women, plain looking women, women you will actually see on this planet we call Earth.  We as a film audience have accepted the Lala Land these idiots have been painting for us for decades.  Give me some reality.  All this perfection has gone beyond boredom and into the realm of stupid.
0618001905|5.0|This is a terrifying story beautifully written that faces the reader with a reality hidden behind a humanistic propaganda
0316172324|3.0|I will keep my review brief as others have covered my critiques fairly well. Malcolm Gladwell presents a series of interesting topics, but there isn't a strong theme tying them together. Inconsistencies of interpretation between the stories is one of the most frustrating aspects of this book. Gladwell will make a claim to support his conclusions on one topic, but assume its contradiction in support of his claim in another topic. <br /> <br />The most frustrating aspect of this book is its lack of a thesis, though. Gladwell sets out a thesis consisting of three points in his introduction, but you would never come up with those theses simply by reading the book; I was left unconvinced he tried to make a case for them even though I actively looked for supporting evidence while reading.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|How can a person like slipknot or any nu metal band and still have the nerve to call themselves metalheads !!! It is because nu metal and hardcore music that power metal is not as popular as it should be !!! They are not metal they sound like morons !!
B000002UEB|5.0|\\"Operation:Mindcrime\\" is, without a doubt, one of the Top 4 rock albums of all time. It ranks up there with \\"Tommy\\" by The Who, \\"The Wall\\" by Pink Floyd, and \\"Master of Puppets\\" by Metallica. You'll notice that 3 of these 4 albums each have a plot. It takes incredible talent to mix incredible vocals (Tate and Daltrey), excellent music writing (Queensryche, Waters, Townshend, and Metallica), and intelligent lyrics (Queensryche, Waters, Townshend, and Metallica). The one without a plot, of course, is \\"Master of Puppets\\", but that's another review. <br /> <br />This album was created at a point in the band's career in which Geoff Tate's voice was at its peak. His range was second-to-none for its time. (I reject the notion that Tate and Bruce Dickinson had similar vocals. The latter possessed neither the range nor Tate's ability to alter his pitch in mid-note.) The unbelievable vocals mixed perfectly with the music and the plot. All three united to portray exactly the message the group intended-a grim tale of a progressing revolution by a militant brainwashing organization. <br />  <br />The protagonist is Nikki, a meek and naive drug user disgusted with Reagan-era politics and religious hypocrisy. He joins Operation:Mindcrime and begins asassinating politicians, priests, and anyone else he's ordered to by Dr. X, a kingpin in the revolutionary cause. He is united with Mary, a prostitute-turned-nun and they fall in love. The plot begins to spiral into betrayal and murder until Nikki is caught by police and he is faced to hold himself accountable for his actions. An underlying message parallels Nikki's actions with that of the U.S. government's inability to account for it's own illegal activities. <br /> <br />If you enjoy rock music (that is, not of the Poison or Elton John variety), you have to listen to \\"Operation:Mindcrime\\". If the heavy metal sound seems too \\"old school\\", take into account when it was produced and the social environment surrounding it. Catholic or Protestant, Conservative or Liberal, the plot is appreciable by all (although maybe not by the elderly or the very young). Also think to yourself, \\"Are the attitudes and actions of the characters too far-fetched even by today's standards?\\" The bottom line is that truly outstanding music makes you think. Listen to it and and you'll love it.
B0001D0FTW|5.0|This disc hellfire club is edguy's first album for nuclear blast and i feel while not their best easily in my top favortie 10 metal albums of all time! While the 10 min epic the piper never dies is not so good the album is on the whole great so i would recommed to any power metal fan or any real metal person !
B000F7CMRM|3.0|I have just watched the DVD version of this movie and must say that its well acted and directed. Other reviewers already explained the story line and they did it well, so I will pass on that.<br /><br />What was not done well in this movie was the Arabic dialog.<br /><br />For us Arabs, we know that the language was spoken in a broken manner.<br /><br />Also the story is mixed between the Saudi's and the emirates(UAE).<br /><br />While the father of the Emir was set to look like a Saudi, the Emir and was set to look like a prince of United Arab Emirates.<br /><br />Come on Hollywood ! Next time you want to make a movie about Arabs, get a real Arab who know how to set up the language,the dialog and even the story line correctly.<br /><br />I am free for hiring.
B00005JMAH|5.0|In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry, Ron and Hermione, now teenagers, return for their third year at Hogwarts, where they are forced to face escaped prisoner, Sirius Black, who poses a great threat to Harry. Harry and his friends spend their third year learning how to handle a half-horse half-eagle Hippogriff, repel shape-shifting Boggarts and master the art of Divination. They also visit the wizarding village of Hogsmeade and the Shrieking Shack, which is considered the most haunted building in Britain. In addition to these new experiences, Harry must overcome the threats of the soul-sucking Dementors, outsmart a dangerous werewolf and finally deal with the truth about Sirius Black and his relationship to Harry and his parents. With his best friends, Harry masters advanced magic, crosses the barriers of time and changes the course of more than one life. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron and based on J.K. Rowling 's third book, this wondrous spellbinder soars with laughs, and the kind of breathless surprise only found in a Harry Potter adventure.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Finally, an installment to the Batman film franchise that takes seriously the idea of what the graphic novels of Frank Miller and Alan Moore had in mind. When this originally was released in the theatre, folks asked me what I thought, and I told them that by comparison, the previous 4 movies WERE comic-book compared to this - a graphic novel on screen, quite literally. This is the perfect vision of what The Batman is designed to be: DARK. How Bruce Wayne as a character is meant to be portrayed - the rich playboy on the outside, and a benevolent monster on the inside, something those closest to him would ever see. How Gotham is portrayed - very gritty, very dangerous, and made to look very real.  <br />     The story is basically a marriage between a few different graphic novels, respectfully \\"Year One\\" by Frank Miller and \\"A Long Halloween\\" by Alan Moore, and it works quite well. The only difference in origin was the part when Wayne was a boy, which if you're not a die-hard fan, makes no difference (that is - in 'Begins' the theatre event they go to is an opera, and in the actual origin it's a Zorro movie, but probably due to copywrights they couldn't expound on this). The plot line is brilliant in that it covers several neccessary points such as how he is inspired by the bat, how he gets some of his training as well as his evading the police. Well done indeed. The way this is filmed is remarkably different too. Even with the Burton films, you see a well-groomed set, but here's where 'Begins' stands apart from all the other four films. It's filmed in such a way that it makes everything look HUGE, which is what Brian Singer took notice of when he directed Superman Returns. Go figure. The environment you see them working with isn't just an obvious set, it looks completely real. Too real, if you've ever been to NYC or Chicago. All in all, if you want to see a serious film on Batman, this is the one. Ignore the other 4 unless you're showing them to your younger children. This one is much darker and more for an adult to be able to comprehend and relate to. There is now word there is going to be 2 more sequels in the works to boot. Currently, no titles yet, but thus far, everyone that was in this, save for a few faces, are, in fact, contracted for the next 2 films as well. They involve the joker & Two-face, and they are going to be even more gritty & gruesome than this film. Finally, the Batman franchise grows up and is something to be taken seriously now. I look forward to see what else happens in this version of Gotham...

1592401791|5.0|I bought this book some months ago and have already read it cover to cover twice, enjoying it thoroughly each time.  \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" really DOES provide a new perspective on the Beatles and sheds a tremendous amount of light on both their individual personalities and group dynamic, as well as revealing the secrets behind many of their greatest recordings.  Emerick is not shy about sharing his opinions as well as so many great anecdotes and I can't imagine what more anyone could want from a memoir -- especially one with a subject matter as fascinating and compelling as this.  Beyond all of that, it's beautifully written, both literate and a fast read (not an easy trick to pull off). <br /> <br />Which is why I have to shake my head in wonder at how some Beatles \\"fans\\" (like the last reviewer) don't get the essence of what this book is about.  Are they really so close-minded, so married to their personal conception of what the four Beatles were like as people (shaped, no doubt, by the media and promotional machines that have been grinding for more than 40 years) that they aren't capable of accepting new ideas, new concepts? <br /> <br />Apparently so, because there seem to be more than a few that are up in arms over Emerick's alleged \\"slighting\\" of George Harrison and Ringo Starr, viciously attacking not just Emerick's book but his credibility as a human being. <br /> <br />Scary! <br /> <br />To set the record straight, Emerick does not attack anyone in this book; he simply calls it as it is/was.  When he first met George Harrison and heard him play, Harrison wasn't even 20 years old and was obviously still learning his craft.  Anyone who's ever heard any Beatles bootlegs from their early days knows how awful some of his attempts at guitar solos were, so I find it perfectly believable that there was \\"much eye-rolling\\" when it came time to do his solos, and that both George Martin and Paul McCartney (himself an estimable guitarist, probably as good as Harrison if not better, even in the early days) found their patience sorely tried during those moments. <br /> <br />There are also plenty of other books and interviews that describe Harrison's personality in those early, pre-Eastern, pre-spiritual days as sullen and brooding... and focused on money.  Emerick takes things a step further by describing the young Harrison as \\"suspicious\\" and \\"dour\\", but even these descriptions seem fairly bland, especially in contrast to the angry, almost vicious responses from some fans. <br /> <br />One of the most joyous things about this book, to me, is the way that you see Emerick's opinion of Harrison shift as the years roll by and as the young guitarist matures both personally and professionally.  In many ways, \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" is not just the story of Geoff Emerick's life but the story of how George Harrison finds himself, first through Eastern music, then through Eastern spirituality.  Emerick talks with great respect of how \\"Within You Without You\\" (Harrison's contribution to Sgt. Pepper) grows into a beautiful song as it is crafted meticulously by the two Georges (Harrison and Martin), working in close concert with both Indian and Western musicians.  And by the time you get to the chapters about the making of the \\"Abbey Road\\" album, Emerick happily reports that Harrison's songwriting had risen at least to the level of Lennon and McCartney, if not surpassed it.  You can sense the delight in his writing as he describes how a newly confident George refuses instructions from Paul for the first time... and even issues a few of his own to the often bossy bass player, now taken down a peg.  Emerick also makes a point of stating repeatedly that Harrison was an excellent producer, and relations between the two men couldn't have been all that strained since Emerick was asked repeatedly by Harrison to engineer many of those sessions (i.e. Jackie Lomax's \\"Sour Milk Sea,\\" etc.) <br /> <br />As far as this nonsense about \\"poor George\\" now being unable to defend himself, I suspect that, were he alive today, George Harrison would be the first person to chuckle over all this controversy... and probably the first person to admit that he was still very much growing as a musician and composer during his years with the Beatles. <br /> <br />Regarding Ringo, I have read a few reviews from \\"fans\\" who grossly exaggerate Emerick's point of view.  Nowhere in this book does he call Ringo an \\"idiot\\" or an \\"incompetent\\" or anything close to those words... those are the words of reviewers with an axe to grind, those who are trying to turn potential readers against the book.  All Emerick really says about Ringo as a person is that he was quiet, didn't offer much input on sessions, and spent a lot of time playing checkers and chess with the roadies while waiting to be called upon.  (Something Ringo himself talks about candidly on the Beatles Anthology DVD.)  He also offers the view that Ringo could be very sarcastic and sometimes even cynical.  To which I say, so what?  That's something you could say about almost anyone.   <br /> <br />But in terms of his drumming, Emerick is never less than respectful, pointing out repeatedly that Ringo was a good timekeeper and had tremendous stamina, slamming the drums hard (to get his signature sound) for hours on end.  Yes, he sometimes got guidance from Paul (who was not only a bit of a control freak -- something we all know -- but also a pretty good drummer himself), but that certainly doesn't make him an \\"idiot\\" or \\"incompetent\\"... and, again, Emerick never says or implies that. <br /> <br />Yes, for the most part, he has nice things to say about McCartney -- hardly surprising, since they developed the closest friendship and shared a common interest in making recordings as perfect as they could be (something which Lennon apparently had little patience for).  But I never found it got the point where it was cloying or overstated; you simply see the man's admiration for McCartney -- someone who is, after all, one of the greatest songwriters and music legends of our time. <br /> <br />If a \\"Beatle fan\\" is simply someone who uncritically and unquestioningly idolizes these four men from Liverpool to the point where they are viewed as gods up on a pedestal, then, okay, maybe some of them won't like this book.  To them, I say, go back to your fantasy land and don't let reality intrude. <br /> <br />To me, a true Beatles fan is someone who admires and appreciates the group's music and is interested in knowing who they were as people and how they accomplished all they accomplished.  With that definition in mind, I cannot imagine any true Beatle fan taking offense at this book.  More to the point, I can't imagine any true Beatle fan not enjoying this book thoroughly.

He returns to Gotham and unveils his alter-ego: Batman, a masked crusader who uses his strength, intellect and an array of high tech deceptions to fight the sinister forces that threaten the city.
0316234753|5.0|I had this book as a child, and remembered drawing all the animals over and over again using the step by step provided by Ed.  I had loved this book so much that I just bought it for my son who is 5.  He has been complaining that he can't draw as well as his dad (thanks to Ed E.) and this will give him the edge up on old dad.  I have told him about this book, and he has been asking about it over and over.  Can't wait till he starts to outdraw his dad!
0743216385|5.0|Lordy, Lordy.....I don't know which is better the book or the 10 part, 5 CD series!! I watched the HBO series at least twice before reading the book. Amazing as I read the book, how the film would come to mind and actually create a picture to visualize the words of Ambrose. Watch the film first then read the book, OR read the book then watch the film. Either way, you will enjoy, and be horrified that the human race has such destructive skills, anger, and stupid stupid leaders. That said, congrats to Ambrose on his penmanship, rest in peace. Congrats to Tom Hanks and David Frankel on directing a very indepth almost documentary like film, that followed the book almost page by page! David in California

B000FGGE68|3.0|If you want to know what ultraviolet is, think if Trinity from the Matrix had the personality of the bride form kill bill and stole the clothing of elektra and moved next door to aeon flux.  This movie has alot of eye candy and action, with not a whole lot of plot.  But really, its not like the studio wanted a oscar for this, this is just a summer blockbuster type movie, so everyone chill out.  In all reality, its not that bad.  its a fun movie with a ok cast and just ok acting but in the end, when it comes to movies like these, its all about the fun factor and let me tell you that movies like this have a higher fun factor than crash does.
B000F1IQMS|5.0|In an age where terrorism and war are daily realities, where the appropriate responses--violence or pacifism?--are debated, \\"Munich\\" steps in as a morality play from recent history.  Although never answering the questions directly, it challenges us to consider the consequences and the individuals who play roles in the drama.<br /><br />Spielberg established himself as a director with an eye for thrills, then took more serious turns with \\"Empire of the Sun,\\" \\"Schindler's List,\\" and so on.  \\"Munich\\" is perhaps his best and most complete amalgam of his abilities.  It is a thriller, but with the soul and mind and moral ambiguities of a John le Carre novel.<br /><br />The movie starts with an overview of the terrorist attack during the 1972 Munich Olympics, then unfolds the details of that attack through later flashbacks and nightmares.  The driving heartbeat of this film is Israel's Golda Meir (played to perfection) and her landmark decision to stand against violence with violence.  Her political stance leads to teams of assassins moving across Europe to hunt down those responsible for a number of terrorist activities.  These teams become aware of their own shortcomings and of moral questions; they gain in proficiency, yet struggle with the laws of their own homeland and those written through the generations in their own hearts.  Ultimately, success and failure become gray areas, and each man discovers himself to be nothing more than a pawn in a much larger, ambiguous game.<br /><br />Murder, sex, betrayal, and double-dealings are all part of the scenario, though Spielberg never uses them gratuitously.  The acting is fantastic, the scenes are tightly wound and effective, the cinematography is suitably drab and seventies-ish; but it's the cohesive direction that pulls it all together into a masterpiece.  In its final seconds, \\"Munich\\" points us to the present state of affairs and challenges us to consider the cost.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's first 2 cds were super baby pop.  Little kid music if im being honest.  her 3rd one kinda poked around the idea of having a R&B/Hip-hop sound but only a few tracks actually were.  this one is all R&B/hip-hop besides 2 balleds and Breath on Me which is a little techno sounding.  britney is trying for a edgy soun on this cd.  i have to say i get a little scared when i hear artists wanting to go edgy because most fall flat on their face but britney does a good job of it.  i mean its not like this stuff is super edgy but compaired to you drive me crazy, songs like (ive got that) boom boom show off a more mature sound.  her voice is weak and baby-ish, but for some reason its never bothered me at all.  My personal feelings are that britney went through 2 stages:  stage 1: the cookie cutter britney.  this is the opps i did it again britney that was forsed to make bubble gum kids music.  after she took creative control she became (stage 2) real britney: the one that does music that she actually likes.  if you like her older stuff only i would say you dont like more grown up music.  like one reveiwer said already on this site: \\"My 5 year old niece wanted this, so I bought it for her. She doesn't even like it, prefering to listen to Oops! I Did It Again.\\"<br /><br />point made.
0553573403|5.0|If you enjoy reading fantasy books then do not buy this! It will ruin all books you've read and nothing will ever match it. I have read the first 4 books in this series after years of trying to avoid it because I hate the fact that everyone else mooned over it so much. Now I must say that everyone was right, and that this is the best series by far that I have read or will probably ever read. I will only write a review on this first book and not the other 3 because once you read this one, you will not be able to stop and wont need any reviews to get you to buy the next. If you like your fantasy all fluffy with fake swear words and good guys that always live, than this is not for you. If you like a little blood and guts to your story than this series is incredible. The characters are very complex the good as well as the bad, wich distorts the lines of good vs. evil. BE WARNED: There are slayings, rapes and swear words a plenty in this series, so if your not into such vivid reading than this is not for you. My favorite thing about this series is Martins ability to completely shock the reader. Things happen suddenly that you never saw coming but should have and he's not afraid to kill off main characters. Nothing better than spending 2 books getting to know someone just to have them flayed suddenly and unexpectedly. This series will keep you turning pages, and dying for the next book to be released.
B000000XBE|5.0|My first introduction to CCR was \\"Cosmos Factory,\\" released in the dark ages of 1970. What a great introduction to CCR. Fully 7 of the 11 songs from that album are represented on this collection of greatest hits. CCR released 7 original albums, and though \\"Chronicle\\" includes 20 songs from those albums, someone later decided to release a \\"Chronicle II\\" that included another 20 CCR songs, including two more of the \\"Cosmos Factory\\" songs.<br /><br />CCR had a very unique sound, owing in part to John Fogerty's unusual, yet very listenable, voice. CCR has been called rockabilly by some, but I prefer to see CCR as part of the diversification of rock music that led to the popularity of groups such as The Eagles. Yes, there is some influence of what was once known as Hillbilly or bluegrass, but there is just as much influence from rock and roll and country. There may even be a flavor of folk music.<br /><br />Sometimes the music sounds almost like classic rock and roll, as you listen to songs such as \\"Proud Mary.\\" Other times the sound is almost contemporary with the early 70s in songs like \\"Who'll Stop the Rain.\\" Other times the music seems to transcend all genres in songs like \\"Up Around the Bend,\\" which starts out like a hard rock song, and then reveals a country base in the harmonies and the lyrics.<br /><br />Then there are blues-influenced songs such as \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\\" and \\"I Put a Spell on You.\\" \\"Run through the Jungle\\" has influences that might remind you of Jimi Hendrix, yet blues are also evident. The lyrics will recall images of the Viet Nam war. Another Viet Nam war related song is \\"Fortunate Son.\\"<br /><br />Occasionally CCR's lyrics create odd mixtures. \\"Looking Out My Backdoor\\" has lyrics that would fit well with many of the psychedelic songs of the era, yet is played with a country-rock style. These contradictions are part of what made CCR a great and novel group.<br /><br />There are a couple of versions of this CD available.  This version is a gold CD that some fans prefer when available.  You may want to survey the versions available before selectin the one that best meets your needs.<br /><br />I enjoy music that creates a trend without trying to do so. A true artist is one who does what they want to do for themselves. When they become successful, that is fine, but they do so on their own terms. CCR was such a group. This CD collects some of their better known songs, and is a great addition to any collection. However, please keep going after you've bought this one. You will find that there is a lot of good music left on their albums. Enjoy!is a gold CD that some fans prefer when available.

B000EDWL82|5.0|I really liked the single \\"Munich\\" and thought I'd play samples of the album online to see if the album was worth picking up.  I liked what I heard, so I bought the album the week it was released in the U.S. Let me tell you, I LOVE THIS ALBUM.  I haven't stopped listening to it!  I don't get sick of it - I just play it over and over again.  As an added bonus, I was thrilled when I learned they would be playing live in my hometown a few weeks later.  I caught the show and had a great time seeing nearly the entire album performed live!<br /><br />The music is very guitar-driven and keyboards are only lightly used in 2 or 3 songs.  This is a GREAT road trip album!  They are great driving songs, full of energy.  If I had to separate the tracks into favorites, I'd have to say \\"Blood,\\" \\"Lights,\\" \\"Munich,\\" \\"Bullets\\" - but the whole album is excellent.<br /><br />Editors are unique, though it's difficult not to compare them with other good bands.  These are my thoughts...<br /><br />Vocals are reminiscent of: Dead Can Dance, Kitchens of Distinction, She Wants Revenge, Joy Division, Interpol<br /><br />Music is similar to: Kitchens of Distinction, Interpol, This Picture, EARLY U2, They Might Be Giants, The Proclaimers, Gene<br /><br />Music is layered and textured like: Catherine Wheel, The Verve, The Cure (a little), EARLY Trash Can Sinatras<br /><br />ENJOY!!
B000002GWN|5.0|This music is all from the era I most enjoyed. All of the songs are classic Mitchell. All her creativity, joy, and sometimes loneliness are contained in this body of work. You won't regret it if you are a fan.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|A visual feist.<br /><br />I've never played any of the games and had no idea what the backstory was supposed to be, but nevertheless, I was amazed. The visual effects were stunning; I don't think I've ever been so engrossed with completely ficticious battle scene, and doubt that I ever will be again. The texturing was so detailed that you could pick up on ever nuance of the character's movement or emotion, or even count the hairs on Cloud's head.<br /><br />I did feel as though I was missing certain aspects of the plot, having never played the game, but the special features filled in most of the holes, and I don't feel as though the storyline was lacking in any specific field or aspect. The characters were original and engaging, and were developed well in the short time alloted between fight scenes.<br /><br />For that matter, who cares about characterization? The battles were that good. This is a definite must buy for any anime and foriegn film fan, or anyone who'd like to try something a little different.

0060763280|4.0|I liked that Harv talks about getting rich is somewhat of mind's game.  If you can get your thinking right, then you will have bluerpint for riches.  I don't think it is as easy as that, but the right thinking will definitely help.   <br /> <br />He does sell his seminar which in the very end he will give two free tickets if you bought the book and book before July 1 which is just a few days away.  He has extended that offer, but instead of being free it is $79 which seems like a good deal.  I have not been to the seminar (the closest one is 6 hours away), so I cannot comment on that. <br /> <br />I would recommend giving this book a quick read.  It does have some good pointers and at least it will give some good motivation.
0061122092|5.0|There is a certain atmosphere that emanates from this book and immersing ones' soul into it is a purifying experience. The two main characters are in search of love, and the understanding of love. Is the meaning of love as in love for a partner or love for God, and which form of God? The travels of the characters lead them into knowledge, which may well be the essence of traveling. They walk together the path and learn to know each other, their inner selfs and their love for God and how they can serve God. Coelho's style is luminous and the book is easy to read although the spiritual journey may be difficult. And well worth the effort.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|The album is not something you would find in the mainstream market although it may make its why there for better or worse. Most of the songs have a catchy chorus which supports the main lyrics providing     an out of the box dance vibe sure to be played in clubs long after this album eventually expires its main stream shelf life.
0743454537|4.0|This is the story of a complex family. Loosely based on a true story, the decision to have a baby merely to serve as a bone marrow donor for an older child is controversial. This story looks at how that decision -- and, indeed, how living with a chronically ill child -- affects the entire family dynamic. I especially enjoyed looking at the life of the youngest child, the one conceived in order to provide her older sister with life.  <br /> <br />I found the font changes used to distinguish which family member was talking distracting. But I found the entire story fascinating, the way the family members interacted. I dare not say more in order to keep the ending a secret, but I will say, it's a shocker.  <br /> <br />The book is definitely worth reading. It's a good book club choice -- ripe for discussion.
B00005JLKB|1.0|I will admit, I was excited when I first learned this series was coming out. Then I saw how the characters of Superman and Clark Kent have been butchered within this show. SMALLVILLE is in fact just another teen drama taken off the shelves but given exceptionally bad Superman aspects. The show is about a teenager struggling to find his place in the world and working way too hard to fit in with his peers. Except this teenager happens to be Clark Kent, the future Man Of Steel, living in the small farm town of Smallville. The show started well, with the arrival of Ka-El and being taken in by the Kent family. Then it jumps forward in time to a high school freshman Clark Kent all mopey about how he doesn't fit in with the popular crowd, and how he just can't get his dream girl Lana Lang. So the pathetic Clark goes off to a bridge where he ponders about life and mamages to get hit by the crazed driver Lex Luthor. This is where the series finally unfolds. Clark being the super human that he is, is unhurt as Lex's car takes them both off the bridge to the water below, and Clark performs a daring rescue of Lex who is uncouncious from the car crash. Later, Lex feels indebted to Clark and also very curious to how Clark was able to save him. So Lex forms a friendship with Clark but also launches an invesitgation on him. From then on the series consists of Lex's research and delicate friendship with Clark, people with their own agendas to disrupt life in Smallville (some have been infected with traces of Kryptonite rocks), and everyone dealing with personal struggles within their lives. These personal conflicts are what takes up most of the show, Clark performs some heroic action towards the beginning and end of each episode but most of the episodes jus deal with characters' sucky lives. I may have been into this if the characters had been more Superman oriented. Clark should have been this major nerd with glasses, incredibly shy, but very interested in the ways of the world andpolitics. This interest would have led Clark to his future career as a reporter. Being a nerd is Clark's way of hiding the fact that he is Superman and has powers that hardly anyone else around him does. That's part of the fun of Superman; seeing Clark act like this major geek in order to throw people off in discovering his true identity of being Superman. Throughout the season, he should have gained his powers, learned how to use them, and then Clark should have gotten a call from his father Jar-El. This call would have led Clark to realize what good he could do as the individual that he is, and thus he would have become Superboy. EXCEPT, THIS NEVER HAPPENS. Clark is just another teenager struggling to be popular and not a nerd at all who is interested in the world and politics. Clark in this show is way too cool and I'm sure that appeals to the female fans out there. But if he is ever turned into Superman, the story won't be as believable as before in having people not making the connection of Clark being Superman. So for most of this year Clark is running around, trying to hide his true personality from others so that he can fit in, but still helps people without their knowledge because they happen to be distracted by something else at the time. SMALLVILLE is a great dissapointment in its regards to Superman or Superboy for that matter, because it takes forever for those aspects to arise. Most of the show is just a teen drama with Superman and Superboy characters in it. I am so glad that there is now another Superman film out that shows how Superman characters should truly be used.
B00025ETIW|5.0|This cd was played so many times that i cant believe it still runs.  I have seen them 3 times live and they dont disappoint.  I love the concept cd idea because its to like typical emo whining.<br /><br />And to the people that hate the group.  You only hate them because they are on MTV and are widely liked.  Well Im not a fan of the huge status, but I still think they deserve it.<br /><br />Oh and for GOD SAKES, stop telling me to listen to your stupid bands.  If I wanted to, I would.  Usually its people that have never listened to the cd because they would rather judge a band.<br /><br />If mcr stays on the creative energetic path they will be rewarded by awesome fans, not by fly by night fans.
B000002LUB|5.0|To call this the best Dio Sabbath record is saying much when you consider how good \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is but that just goes to show what a masterpiece \\"Dehumanizer\\" is. Where \\"Heaven and Hell\\" really shows off more of the harmonic and melodic side of Black Sabbath (which was the trend in the early 80's) \\"Dehumanizer\\" is pure heavy. But that is not to say that it doesn't have melody, there is not one song on \\"Dehumanizer\\" that doesn't get stuck in your head. Remember back when bands could write a heavy song yet catchy? What really helps is that Geezer is back in the band. Iommi can play but it has always been Geezer that comes up with the best riffs. And if you listen you can hear how the Sabbath records without him sound like something is missing. <br /> <br />Dio sounds awesome throughout the record. One thing that is apparent from the first track is that his style is much different here than on his previous Sabbath records. His voice sounds truly angry and evil, blending perfectly with the heavy riffs. It is also good to have Vinny back in the band. I have even ventured to say that the sound of his drums on this record have the best drum sound I have ever heard. <br /> <br />As for the music it is pure heavy. Only one song \\"Too Late\\" even uses any acoustic guitar, the rest is sheer energy. Dio's lyrics are superb--if you read them by themself they stand as poetry. It is hard to say which song is the best. In fact you won't be able to stop listening to this record so your favorite song will change every few days. From the dark and beautiful \\"Too Late\\" to \\"Buried Alive\\", with Dio shrieking over a weird time signature, you will be held in suprise with what new thing the band has thought up. And even when the songs just stay heavy (i.e. \\"Master of Insanity\\" or \\"I\\") they are still completely unique and original. <br /> <br />Just when you though you have heard the best Black Sabbath records there were to hear you find out that this jem is buried hidden in their catalog.Do yourself a favor fellow headbanger and pick this up.

B000001ZS3|5.0|I've always enjoyed Jarre and this album is no exception, but while reading some of the customer recommendations posted on this site I discovered a group by the name of MEHDl (pronounced medie). After an online search I found their site (S00THINGMUSIC,C0M) and listened to the samples... <br />I was instantly blown away by the quality of this music and so I gave it a try and now that I have listened to these CDs several times I really must say that although I'm still a Jarre fan, I find MEHDl to be a great addition to this CD. I have them both in my multi-disc CD player and love the way they compliment each other. I highly recommend that you give this artist a try or atleast just go listen to the samples, I have a feeling you'll be glad you did.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|Although racing films in general have never enjoyed overwhelming commercial success Grand Prix stands alone as the best racing film of all time!   <br /> <br />The storyline isn't brilliant by any means and there are a few `unexplained' bloopers such as Jean Pierre Sarte's mysterious helmet change from one race to the next - which was due to John Surtees leaving the Ferrari team at mid-season and signing with Cooper for a bit before eventually signing with Honda - but if you're a diehard Formula 1 fan this film is a true blessing. <br /> <br />I already own the Laser disc and still own one of the original programs that were sold at the movie theaters and I have been waiting for this film to come out on DVD for ages, simply in the hopes of viewing the treasure-trove of behind-the-scenes footage. <br />   <br />Although the film did not receive the critical success many felt it deserved the historic importance of this film should not be underestimated because it's the only clear color film footage available anywhere in the world where you can see; Graham Hill, Jack Brabham, Jimmy Clark, Dan Gurney, Phil Hill, Richie Ginther, Jochen Rindt, Bruce McLaren, Maurice Trintignant, Mike Parkes, Joakim Bonnier, Lorenzon Bandini, Chris Amon, Guy Ligier and even the great Juan Manuel Fangio together on the big screen and in their crowning glory. - Be sure to watch closely during the Spa Francorchamps drivers meeting when Jochen Rindt playfully reaches out and trips Graham Hill (aka `Bob Turner') as he's trying to step past Rindt. <br /> <br />For fans and students of cinematography the camera angles and the technology invented to achieve many of those angles are a testament to the ground-breaking achievements that underscore the unique and visionary genius of John Frankenheimer.  And of course there's a wonderful cast of outstanding actors including the great Toshiro Mifune, Brian Bedford, Yves Montand, Antonio Sabato, and of course, James Garner who was inspired by his role inthe film and went on to enjoy moderate success as an amateur racer. <br /> <br />Grand Prix is a must have for every motorsports fan and required study for any cinematography student who someday dreams of shooting a film with cars of any type, let alone racing! <br />

B0000041Q3|5.0|Sutherland would never sing Turandot in the theatre and personally, I don't think she cracks it here in this recording. However, vocally she seems to have no limits, especially when singing the taxing high passages and for Turandot, this is enough. My preference is more along the lines of Nilsson, Marton and maybe Eaglen. Likewise, Pavarotti does not come close to Bjoerling, Heppner or Corelli with his interpretation of Calaf, but he sings well. Caballe and Mehta are the real reason to get this recording; Caballe sings superbly and Mehta conducts a fine reading of Puccini's lush score.
0316168815|5.0|I guess my view of this novel is different than some of the reviews that I have read. I have NEVER read a more powerful novel than \\"The Lovely Bones\\". I work in the Criminal Justice field and I was finally glad to see a story that wasn't wrapped up tightly, where like reality, sometimes the bad guys get away with the crime.  <br /> <br />The novel is narrated by a murdered 14-year-old girl. Not bitter about her death, but simply watching the nightmare that the survivers are experiencing play out. Susie watches everything from \\"heaven\\".  She flashes back on her death by her neighbor; she watches her father search for her killer; she witnesses her mother who is unable to cope leave, searching for answers; she sees her sister struggling to come of age in the shadow of her dead sister while making decisions that have long reaching consequences; she sees her brother struggling to keep it together; while her killer continues to cover his tracks (he buries her in a safe). What is so powerful about this novel is it's attempt to get the reader to see the impact that this tragedy has on everyone involved. There are moments in the novel that I am sure will make you weep and smile. But perhaps the most insightful thing about the novel is that the victim, Susie, in all of her wisdom, at the tender age of 14 wanted more for her family. She wanted them to survive and find each other during their time of sorrow. Like a child, she does not have anger or hatred in her heart. Because part of moving on is Forgiveness, and while adults have a hard time accepting that, Susie did.
0064407667|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the books and I loved the movie. Now that I read the first book though, I see how much the movie hacked up the story. The movie is based on 3 of the stories and eventhough they messed with the story a lot it was still faithful to the atmosphere of the books at least. I was hoping for more sequels and since that isn't happening I hear, I decided to read the books.<br /><br />  The characters are more developed in the books. Count Olaf is darker and scary and less goofy than Jim Carrey made him. Justice Strauss only had like 2 scenes in the movie when in the books, she loves the kids and the kids love her. They love reading and she lets them visit and read her books when Olaf of course has no books. While Olaf sets up an evil plan to try and get their fortune. Since he's an actor he plans a play where he'd marry Violet but with the marriage being real. This way he could kill them and get the fortune. The movie puts the play at the end when infact it happens before they meet Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine in the books.<br /><br />  The books have an unpleasant and lightly goofy humor and not the over the top humor that Jim Carrey brought to the movie. The movie had a scene where Olaf left the kids in his car on train tracks hoping a train would hit the car. Although I love that scene it's not in any of the 3 first books. It's more like something you'd see in Looney Tunes than read in any of the books. At least that scene is somewhat faithful to the books though. It has Violet using her inventing skills and Klaus using the knowledge he gained from reading many books. So I can't really call the movie bad. I can't really picture anyone else as Olaf after reading the books either though. If Carrey took it down a few notches and didn't do the type of overacting that he always does in comedies, the movie could've been even better.
B00003CXAT|4.0|This movie lacked the oomph that the book had but it was still great.  The action scenes are particularly terrifying; particularly when the T-Rex breaks through the fence; also, when the raptors hunt for the two obnoxious kids in the kitchen -- too bad I was rooting for the raptors.  But still, these scenes in particular were very, very real, very scary and pulse-pounding!   <br /> <br />It's equally interesting to judge what didn't work in this movie: the characters, not quite as weak as those in the book but close; many of the computer generated shots looked surprisingly fake; and of course the bulk of the book's great science got lost. <br /> <br />But still, none of this really matters that much.  The scary scenes were awfully scary!  Those dinosaurs looked REAL!  I can watch those scenes over and over and over again; so owning a quality DVD like this makes it easy!  If you don't have it already, Give it a shot!!
0679882820|5.0|Admittedly, since my childhood I've been predisposed to like anything with the words \\"Dr. Seuss\\" on the cover - but maybe that's because he's so good. And now I get to pass that love on to my little one! This book has a fantastic natural cadence and fun sounds that are just what a baby needs to start acquiring those vital pre-reading skills. And, that same rhythm and fun are perhaps just what a parent needs to be inspired to read to their child. In short, \\"Oh the wonderful sounds Mr. Brown can do. Why don't you try to do them, too?\\"

B00000JLWW|5.0|Titanic is a romantic, adventurous, and a thrilling movie all combined into one to make the perfect movie. It contains moments of exuberance, humor, and tragedy. In their own way, the characters are all larger than life, but they're human enough to capture our sympathy. Perhaps the most amazing thing about Titanic is that, even though Cameron carefully recreates the death of the ship in all of its terrible grandeur, the event never eclipses the protagonists. To the end, we never cease caring about Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio).  <br /> <br />While Titanic is easily the most subdued and dramatic of Cameron's films, fans of more frantic pictures like Aliens and The Abyss will not be disappointed. Titanic has all of the thrills and intensity that movie-goers have come to expect from the director. A dazzling mix of style and substance, of the sublime and the spectacular, Titanic represents Cameron's most accomplished work to date. It's important not to let the running time hold you back. The movie is about 3 and a half hours long but you won't realise it because it goes by very quickly. Although this edition of the Titanic story is far from the first, it is the most memorable, and is the most deserved for Oscar nominations not only in the technical categories, but in the more substantive ones of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress because they all did a magnificent job. <br /> <br />
0446310786|5.0|It's been said so many times that Harper Lee only wrote one book, but I can't imagine what you'd do if you wrote a masterpiece like this for your first book.  How would you follow it up? <br /> <br />There is just so much about this book that is good, I want to leave it to the reader to just open it up and get through that first chapter.  Then you'll be hooked on reading forever.
B00008OLIO|5.0|\\"Raw, powerful, gritty\\" are the adjectives most of the other reviewers are using, and with good reason. This is the straight up real deal.     The lyrics to \\"Live Wire\\" are what Tipper Gore read on the floor of the US house of reps, her hands and voice shaking, when she was trying to promote censorship of Rock. (\\"I'll either break her face or take down her legs...\\")    Unfortunately, MC got worse instead of better.  'Shout @ Devil' was a very good follow up, but from there on out, they were in large part pandering to the crowd instead of screaming from the heart.
006054094X|5.0|Just like the Christian faith reacting to the notion of a 'mortal' Jesus, succumbing to 'earthly' pleasures, so thus the reactionary eurocentrists dismissing alternative history.    Menzies's provocative work not only challenges 'common' wisdom but stencils the very notion that an Asian culture was several decades technologically superior to Europe's.    Louise Levathes' \\"When China Ruled the Seas\\" is another great read on seafaring China.
0634049011|5.0|First off all I can say on this book is praise. <br /> <br />Having recently started playing around on a guitar I've taken a look at counless 'beginner' websites and lessons out there on the net and have purchased quite a fair number of books for the learner that claim to be for those of us who are starting out from little to no musical background.  And I can't knock them, they all will have and do have their place in my learning.   Three of them that I highly recommend to the novice:  <br /> <br />-'Guitar For Dummies' is quite humourous and is currently helping me practice proper technique and learning the chords.  <br />-'Mel Bay's Modern Guitar Method' is quite nicely laid out, and is making musical notation not seem so daunting.  Sure TAB is wonderful but this book is really a great read and makes notation a bit easier to grasp and relate to the strings. <br />-And then we come to this book, 'Guitar Fretboard Workbook'.  And that'll be the focus from here on. <br /> <br />This is an amazingly well put together lesson book.  I was a bit skeptical about all the positive reviews and everybody claiming how it magicly helped them understand the fretboard.  But I must say this is my favorite guitar book.  The author really knows just how to put words to the concepts that all of us can understand, even those just starting out in the musical world. <br /> <br />Every turn of the page brings a new lesson and a new excercise for you to work on.  And these arn't monotonous pages, each one brings a new concept into play and ties into the previous pages.  Truely the author speaks to you and knows just how to grind the basic concepts of the guitar/fretboard into your memory, both mental and muscle memory, all while you are actually enjoying what you are learning. <br /> <br />Other books I have tried while very usefull do have the feel that you ARE working to learn the instrument, where in 'Guitar Fretboard Workbook' you keep wanting to practice your lesson so you can turn the page and keep building. <br /> <br />This book is well worth it's weight in gold if you are starting your guitar experience and want to get a very well written intro into the insturment and to know what exactly you are doing when all those other books are telling you to put your fingers on certain points of the neck instead of just nodding your head and putting your fingers where the dots tell you.
B0006GAOBI|3.0|I very much enjoyed the theatrical version of this film.  The director's cut, though, I found somewhat lacking.  When I purchased this film, it was right after I had first seen the theatrical release.  I was very much intrigued by the film, so when I saw the directors cut version, I expected that I would be able to watch the film with an abundance of added content and scenes.  What I got was a mishmash of nonsensical scenes that detract from the overall film, and a second disk of Brits telling us why they are smarter than Americans.  I highly recommend the theatrical release of this film to all, however, steer clear of the DC if you want an enjoyable movie experience.
B00005JOX6|3.0|\\"Click\\" is a predictable yet sentimental little movie about Michael Newman (Adam Sandler), an architect who has a difficult time juggling his career with his home life. One night Michael end up at a Bed Bath & Beyond looking to purchase a universal remote control. Venturing into the mysterious \\"Beyond\\" room, Michael meets a mysterious man (Christopher Walken) who gives him a remote control that's supposed to be the top of the line in technological advancement. Michael soon discovers that he has the ability to control every aspect of his life. He can fast-forward through arguments with his wife (Kate Beckinsale), avoid boring dinners with his parents (Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner), and even mute the family dog.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Michael learns that having so much control over his own life isn't all fun and games. The universal remote eventually begins to run on auto pilot, and Michael begins fast-forwarding through large chunks of his life. He zips ahead a year in anticipation of a promotion, but learns that his home life has suffered irreparable damage. Michael eventually loses his wife to his son's swimming instructor (Sean Astin) and has no real relationship with his children. Before he knows what's happening, Michael is suddenly an old man and has witnessed his entire life go by in the blink of an eye. Fast-forwarding through life has resulted in Michael missing out on his life entirely, and he is more miserable than he ever thought possible.<br /><br />There is a lot of gross humor in this movie which did not appeal to me at all. I think the film would have been a lot more moving if the director chose to leave out all the farting/flapping/humping jokes. In spite of all that, though, \\"Click\\" treats the audience to a modern version of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and demonstrates that the best part of life is actually living it: not even the difficult parts are worth missing.
0316172324|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell, a staff writer for The New Yorker and former business and science reporter for the Washington Post, synthesizes the complex topic of conscious and unconscious decision making in Blink.   In this work, Gladwell dissects how people think and how their exterior provides valuable and often scientific explanations to their thought process.  In short, he states that it is a book about \\"thinking without thinking.\\"  Using numerous examples of recent research in the fields of psychology, military warfare, behavioral sciences, and other relevant areas, Gladwell highlights these examples to advance the thesis that we often have the ability to make a correct decision in the blink of an eye.      * First impressions are often correct:  In the opening chapter, Gladwell outlines the details of an ostensibly genuine and rare Kuoss statue.  He talks of the pain staking labor that the J. Paul Getty museum went through to establish the bona fides of this artifact.  After more than a year, the museum curators, the forensic specialists and others, verified that the statue was genuine.  Unfortunately, as Gladwell notes, they were wrong.  After the first Kuoss statue experts came to view the Kuoss (this was over a year after the museum had purchased and verified the statue's authenticity), they made instantaneous, and startling, remarks that the statue \\"looked like new\\" or \\"had a mirror like image.\\"  These comments were not taken lightly by the museum, and after further review it was determined that the statue was a fake.  Gladwell makes the point that the forensic and museum experts did not determine the authenticity of the statue after a year of analysis and research, and the statue experts made the correct determination in less than a minute.  This example sets the tone for Blink, as the following chapters discuss why the Kuoss experts were able to unlock and trust their first thoughts - even though the statue was ostensibly proven to be genuine.            * Unlocking the unconscious:   Using a series of research examples from psychological experiments, Gladwell details some interesting facts about how we determine \\"snap\\" decisions.  In essence, the snap decision is based on a set of pre-conceived and established notions that one has developed over the course of their lifetime.  For instance, one of Gladwell's research examples exposes word and action correlations.  The test, developed by Anthony Greenwald and others, was called the Implicit Association Test (IAT).  In short, a series of words (both positive and negative) were given to a tester - with another set of words and/or pictures of individuals of different races.  The tester was instructed to make associations by matching the differing word sets.  Essentially, the quicker that a tester made an association, the higher the correlation between the word sets.  For example, the results showed that there was a racial bias in almost all the testers.  They would have negative correlations between a person of a certain race and the word \\"good.\\"  The results were a bit disturbing, as they showed \\"that our unconscious attitudes may be incompatible with our stated conscious values.\\"  According to Gladwell, this is the \\"Warren Harding\\" error, as the former president was a tall and handsome person, but lacked any tangible political savvy to hold the highest office in the United States.  U.S. Citizens associated a strong president with his physical attributes and not his political qualifications.  This sort of bias still exists today, as illustrated with the IAT.  To further this conclusion, Gladwell note that most research illustrates that those in positions of power, in this case CEOS, are overwhelmingly tall white men - the medium, he explains, was just a shade under six feet.  This \\"dark side\\" of thin slicing, according to Gladwell, is responsible for our biases and discriminations in decisions making.          *  The science behind quick decision making:  Gladwell uses many examples in his latter chapters to solidify that people are hard-wired to make snap judgments.  These decisions are the product of training and experience, notes Gladwell.  The more you have of each, the more apt and adapted you will be to make the correct decision in a snap.  For instance, a military war game strategy highlights this technique.  Gladwell outlines the details of a 2002 War Game exercise that details the military tactics of two teams: red and blue.  Both teams were not evenly matched, as the blue team enjoyed superior tactics and technology - not to mention the best analysts and military strategists.  The red team had fewer resources, and the commander was meant to represent a rogue commander in the Middle East.  USMC General Paul Van Riper, or \\"Rip,\\" as he was called by many, was chosen as the commander.  A military officer who had a reputation for making good decisions in stressful situations, he proved to be an exceptional commander in Vietnam and his future endeavors.  So the stage was set, Rip was up against the greatest war game team in modern day history.  To make a long story short, Rip defeated the Blue team in less than one day.  The blue team had assumed that Rip would use the latest technology for communications such as cell phones and satellites.  But this was an incorrect assumption; Rip was able to sink the majority of the Blue Team's naval forces by using old signal communications.  For instance, the Blue Team did not calculate that he would use light signals to land and launch his fighter planes.  The point of this example was to illustrate that high stress experiences and training allowed Rip to make snap decisions that would defeat those who lacked those experiences and training.  In this case, the Blue team lacked a Commander with the aforementioned attributes.  In other words, all the expertise and technical advances could not replace the keen snap judgment of Rip.  In similar examples, Gladwell illustrated that experienced stock brokers and police officers are able to make snap judgments in a blink of an eye.  Mainly, their training and their experiences allow them to make the right split second decisions.                 Good judgment is at the core of leadership and management, and this work outlines \\"how we think without thinking.\\"  On top of the important and somewhat novel thesis, it is an interesting story of the latest revelations in psychological research that illuminates the thought process.  Blink is a page turner and a book that keeps your attention.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|\\"Unforgiven\\" took home 4 Acadmemy Awards back in 1992, is number 98 on The American Film Institute's Top 100, and is a milestone in western cinema. It's also directed by two-time Oscar Winner Clint Eastwood <br />(Best Director, \\"Unforgiven\\" & \\"Million Dollar Baby\\"), who also stars. <br />It also features two-time Oscar winner Gene Hackman (Best Actor, \\"The French Connection\\" and Best Supporting Actor, \\"Unforgiven\\") and <br />Oscar winner Morgan Freeman (Best Supporting Actor, \\"Million Dollar Baby\\"). I've never been a big fan of westerns and never really had a desire to see this movie, until I got into the HBO show \\"Deadwood\\" which made me want to look back at some western films. Well, \\"Unforgiven\\" is a masterpiece on many levels...Not just as a western. As scripted by David Webb Peoples, \\"Unforgiven\\" opens as two men viciously cut a prostitute's face with a knife in the town of Big Whiskey. When the sheriff, Little Bill Dagget (Hackman) shows up he hands down their punishment. Give the owner of the house a few horses. Outraged, the prostitutes begin to offer men $1000 dollars to kill the men who did it. Jump over to Kansas and we meet Bill Munney (Eastwood, in one of his best performances), a former outlaw, who has changed his ways since getting married. But, now, his wife is dead and he's left with his two young children. One day, a kid (about 20) shows up at his house identifying himself as The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett). The Kid tells Bill about the prostitute's offer and asks Bill to be his partner; Bill quickly turns him down, but eventually changes his mind and rides out into the country to catch up with the Kid. Along the way, Bill stops at his old friend Ned's (Freeman) place and Ned joins him. The late Richard Harris co-stars as a killer-for-hire named English Bob, who's character pretty much could've been erased. Anyway, this movie is probably my third favorite film directed by Eastwood; It's right below Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. This movie is entertaining, dramatic, and features Eastwood, Freeman, and Hackman giving some of the best performances of their careers. The chances of someone being disappointed with a film like this are very slim; this is just really one of the great movies of the last 20 years.  <br /> <br />GRADE: A <br />
B000DZIGE4|1.0|If you were to believe this movie you would have to believe that the Military has sunk to the lowest common level and preform their duty without any logic or reason.  The writer does not know what he was talking about and it shows.  He paints a very negative picture.  I distroyed the dvd because it is garbage.  Save our money and do NOT waste it on this one.
B000002JS8|3.0|Firstly may I just begin by reminding all those people who seem to take delight in trying to make out AC/DC as a bad band that without this group Guns and Roses and the rest of the spandex brigade would be nowhere. AC/DC was not a second time around 16 year old heavy metal pleaser (like so many of the second and third wave groups) but they importantly (along with others Black Sabbath. Led Zep etc) created the whole heavy metal genre. To listen to a AC/DC album from the Bon Scott era is as fresh today as it was then. Think 50s rock and roll and add in Muddy Waters with a distorted guitar and your close. It is also important to point out that unlike most of todays groups AC/DC attracted not only new metal heads but also gained the respect of hardcore bikers and the like. AC/DC bites the others only sting..... <br /> <br />Now onto this album. Yes it was the last of Bon Scotts albums and I believe (and I am a total champion of the group) that this album marked the beginning of a more commercial and slick type of production. The producers were changed for this album and an attempt was being made to make the band more appealing to those outside of Australia. It has to be remembered (although today difficult to imagine) that upto this point AC/DC were still very much a Australian band and appealed to the Australians more than the rest of the world. Hence this album starts to make a more smooth production which paves the way for countless other groups who have taken on this sound. What no group (maybe with the exception of Motorhead and the old 60s banns) have been able to do is create a totally new sound. Please remember in the days when the new wave metal bands were still in nappies AC/DC were creating a new sound. One which only latter became known as Heavy Metal. <br /> <br />The album is good but if you want to hear AC/DC at their uncommercial best try Powerage. Its real blues and thats that. <br /> <br />And of Bon Scott. No body and I mean nobody will ever tell me that he was not the greatest rock singer of all time. So dont even try.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|\\"Syriana\\" strikes me as one of the most complicated movies that I have seen in recent years. Unlike most movies I've seen, \\"Syriana\\" is a myriad of storylines all separate yet tied together into two hours.<br /><br /> \\"Syriana\\" tells the story of two major oil companies Connex and Killen merging to form Connex-Killen, which would be among the top 20 largest corporations in the world. Several storylines are told in this all of which are related to this merger. The first one is of a CIA operative named Bob Graham who is hired to find a Saudi Prince who intends to bring about economic reform in his country should he become the new Saudi king. The second is the story of a rising oil broker (played by Matt Damon) who suffers a family tragedy and meets with an ambitious Saudi prince. The third is of an executive who is faced with a moral dilemma over the shady nature of the oil merger taking place. And finally, the fourth story is of a disenfranchised Pakistani teenager who despite everything falls victim to the recruiting tactics of a charismatic extremist cleric. Although most of the main characters don't interact much, if at all, with each other, the fate of all of them ties all of these unrelated stories together as the explosive consequences of geopolitics becomes clear and bear out.<br /><br /> \\"Syriana\\" is arguably one of George CLooney's most unique movies of his career to date. Unlike other films I've seen both by him and others, \\"Syriana\\" follows four stories almost simultaniously. It is a very intense political thriller but what's interesting about the movie is that it bases it's power on being very unsettling.<br /><br /> While not the greatest movie by any means, I would have to say that \\"Syriana\\" is a movie that is definately worth checking out.

B0001KZM3O|5.0|This is such a good album, I am not sure how I managed to let it go unnoticed for so long. Oh yeah, there are 4 better Floyd albums. Anyways, this one is definitely not for everyone, but you should give (at least) The Gunner's Dream and the last three tracks a listen before you decide it's not for you. <br /> <br />Like any other Pink Floyd album it rewards repeated listening, but don't expect any of the mellowness or catchiness that was present to different degrees in all preceding Floyd albums.  That's all gone now... there is some catchiness, but man is it a depressing sort of catchiness. <br /> <br />Roger Waters subtitled the album 'A Requiem For The Post War Dream' but make no mistake about it - 'I held the blade in trembling in hand, prepared to make it but just then the phone rang') - this album is in many respects also a requiem for Roger Waters. A blind  (but not deaf) man could see this was going to be the end of the classic lineup as well. <br /> <br />Still, what an end! (like the moments when the brakes lock and you slam towards the bg truck...)
B000002L99|5.0|I am so tired of the Roth vs. Hagar Wars.  People who dislike Sammy Hagar view Van Halen's second coming as something akin to the downfall of a great nation.  Hagar sucks.  Van Halen sold out.   <br />That's all crap, of course.  I like BOTH versions of the band.  With Diamond Dave (now more similar to a piece of granite), Van Halen was a fun band, no doubt.  Nearly all their songs followed the same basic pattern: Eddie blew you over with a killer riff, David Lee Roth told some sexual jokes, Eddie took a solo, David Lee Roth laughed at his own jokes, then the song ended.  I'm really not belittling it, as the Roth-era VH was horny, good-natured fun laced with some of the greatest guitar playing of all time. <br />With Hagar, Eddie and Alex replaced a stand-up comedian with a true musician.  The result was a blazing, diverse, intelligent - yet still fun - hard rock masterpiece.  First off, anyone who thinks Roth is a better singer than Hagar - even when he still could sing the high notes - has been taking too much cough syrup.  As a musician myself who has worked with a fair amount of singers, to a T they'll all tell you Hagar is flat-out better, end of story.  Hagar didn't need to tell jokes in his song lyrics; he could sing. <br />This is by far the most complex Van Halen album they had made to date, perhaps their most complex, period.  But it's not just complex for the sake of being complex (Rush comes to mind).  Instead, it seems to achieve what is so often lacking in hard rock: intelligent fun.  Eddie and the boys seem invigorated by Sammy's smarts, and together, they wrote great material.   <br />\\"Best of Both Worlds\\" is example one.  Eddie kicks the song off with something he's not fond of: power chords.  Those chords quickly give way to a terrifc, hooky piece of hard rock with lyrics that actually go somewhere.  This song title seems to sum up what Van Halen was achieving now.  This song is a somewhat overlooked rock classic. <br />Proving that the Spirit of Dave still lingered, they managed to channel that spirit productively into \\"Summer Nights,\\" a terrific piece of summer lounging and longing wrapped around guitar work that alternates between simplistic chord picking to infuriatingly difficult whammy bar bends and key changes.  The results will leave you humming the chorus and wishing for a beach chair and a fishing pole.  Songs like the title track, \\"Good Enough\\", and \\"Get Up\\" fall somewhere between these two songs in scope, and they're both good. <br />Vah Halen alienates a lot of their fans when they put out songs like \\"Love Walks In\\", \\"Dreams\\", and \\"Why Can't This Be Love\\".  I don't understand that.  None of these songs - with the stunning exception of \\"Dreams\\" - would rank as Van Halen gems, but they do show diversity, musicality, and yes, intelligence.  They're fun too, and - heaven forbid - were hits. <br />All of this is possible, of course, due to the incredible musicianship of Edward Van Halen.  Certainly in terms of guitar playing, he will always rank as one of the top 10 of all time: he did, after all, invent a whole new style of playing.  But on this album, it's his ability to pull it all together; to make it happen, that is most impressive.  In that way, he reminds one of Jimmy Page. <br />After this album, the band still put out some impressive stuff, but nothing like this eruption.  So stop your squabbling.  Sammy is not Satan.  No one is telling you to ditch your Diver Down cassette.  But to not like this album if you're a Van Halen fan is simple musical racism.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|`The Matrix Revolutions' released in the Fall of '03 is the third and last film of the highly successful Matrix trilogy. In this final installment of the \\"Neo Mythos\\" the war in Zion between man and machine is underway. As the resistance makes a last gallant stand against the mechanized onslaught, Neo attempts a perilous journey to the City of Machines in an effort to stop the violence once and for all.<br /><br />While the special effects continued to soar to higher and more complex levels of accomplishment, the dialogue clearly shows signs of weakness, lacking the terse, polished syntax of the first two films. However having said that it is still a worthy conclusion to the Neo saga.<br /><br />Thanks Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, Agent Smith and the Wachowski brothers. It's been a fantastic adventure!
B000002H33|5.0|I am mainly writing this review to make up for whirligig's double 1-star reviews below. Can you please not double-post in the future? We already heard your unconvicing rant (you could have at least tried to explain why you think Metallica \\"sucks\\" and that their songs are not \\"good\\"), we don't need to hear it twice. <br /> <br />Anyway, apart from that this album really does deserve 5 stars. It's less thrashy than their previous two albums, the first one being the thrashiest, but it's also much more progressive with longer, more classically influenced songs. This is thrash metal, so don't expect to find any catchy, melodic, radio-friendly songs  on it. Due to the complex and progressive nature of the songs, it may take more than one listen to appreciate them. Kirk Hammet may not be as technical as Dave Mustaine, however he is still a great guitarist who can pull of some amazing solos and the music is much more progressive with him in the band. James Hetfield's rough vocals are excellent, some of the best I've heard, and really go well with the music. Lars Ulrich may not be the most technical drummer out there, but he is still much better than most other drummers nowadays. Cliff Burton (RIP) was one of the best bassists out there. <br /> <br />When comparing this to their previous album, Ride the Lightning, you will notice that they are very similar. The ordering of the songs with respect to tempo, mood and style is almost exactly the same on both albums which both have 8 songs. <br /> <br />Fight Fire with Fire Vs. Battery - Both fast and thrashy, both start with an acoustic lead and both are around 5 minutes long. Battery is slightly better. <br /> <br />Ride the Lightning Vs. Master of Puppets - Both mid-paced, heavy and long. Master of Puppets is slightly better. <br /> <br />For Whom The Bell Tolls Vs. The Thing That Should Not Be - Both slow but still heavy. For Whom the Bell Tolls is a lot better. <br /> <br />Fade to Black Vs. Welcome Home (Sanitarium) - Bothacoustic and dark. Fade to Black is significantly better. <br /> <br />Trapped Under Ice Vs. Disposable Heroes - Both fast and heavy. Disposable Heroes is twice as long and heavier. Disposable heroes wins. <br /> <br />Escape Vs. Leper Messiah - Both mid-paced and heavy and about the same length. Leper Messiah is more melodic however. Leper Messiah is a lot better. <br /> <br />The Call of Ktulu Vs. Orion - Both long instrumentals (around 8-9 minutes long). Both about mid-paced and both start soft and gradually reach a stable louder volume. Orion is more progressive and less repetitive. Orion wins slightly. <br /> <br />Creeping Death Vs. Damage Inc. - This is where the albums differ with Damage Inc being faster, heavier and less melodic. Both good but Damage Inc. does it better for me. <br /> <br />This album structure is very clever because it captures your attention with the fast and heavy Battery and then really draws you in with the gradual tempo decrease towards the middle of the album. <br /> <br />Overall, this is slightly better than Ride the Lightning, which was also a great record. This is considered Metallica's best album by many (most people would pick either this or Ride the Lightning). Definately one of the best metal albums ever made and probably the best thrash metal album ever. This is a must have for any metal fan.

B000BHN7DE|5.0|Love it! Anastacia's Greatest Hits. This release that I purchased was the import.  Please note: The U.S. Domestic release does NOT include the Dance Remix Bonus CD.  In my opinion--the best part of this album.  Not that I don't love all the rest of Anastacia's tracks...but alas, I already own almost all of the other great songs in this collection---previously released.  Most artists do this when releasing a retrospective---with a few new releases as incentive for Die-hard fans to purchase an album containing mostly songs they already have.  With that said---If you dig Anastacia, get this import CD set.  It comes packaged in a very slick little picture book (hardcover) with 2 CD's fitting neatly inside the front and back covers.  Be careful handling the CD's as they tend to be more prone to surface scratches in packaging like this.  The Domestic release of \\"Pieces of a Dream\\" include a dance mega-mix of Ana's more popular hits.  The bonus CD contained in this import version have DJ remixes of \\"One Day in Your Life\\", \\"I'm Outta Love\\", \\"Paid My Dues\\", \\"Boom\\", \\"Sick & Tired\\" and others (albeit more remix radio edits than I would've liked!).  The remix disc has 14 tracks altogether.  Some are different versions of the same song---but still really cool!  Disc 1 has 17 tracks. \\"Everything Burns\\", \\"You'll Never Be Alone\\", \\"Not That Kind\\" and \\"Left Outside Alone\\" being some of my fave tracks.  If you only have her \\"Freak of Nature\\" album--you'll get quite a few tracks that were only available previously as import releases.  My partner & I saw her live here in Palm Springs,CA---she is an amazing talent with an enormous voice, striking beauty and killer style!  Being a huge inspiration to both of us, we had to seek out and obtain all of her albums.  Do yourself 2 favors:  1-Buy this CD set. 2-Do a search on Google for Anastacia Lyn Newkirk---you'll find out alot about one amazing little lady!!!
6304712499|1.0|With so many remakes hitting the movie industry these days, I feel that this one deserves a shot at being re-done. After seeing this in the theatre and then giving it a second chance with the unrated version, I was still not impressed. As a fan of the comic book and the highly superior HBO animated series, I was mad disappointed at the feature film. The casting and the \\"feel\\" were not true to the comic and the action was substandard. <br /> <br />Martin Sheen as Jason Wynn was one of the biggest flop casting choices for the movie. John Leguizamo's performance as Clown was too over-the-top with the one-liners and lacked the sadistic flare that the character has in the comics. <br /> <br />For a comic book adaption to be on screen, the movie has to remain true to form while still holding some of the essence that the comic book provides. To me, this was just a rushed, not-to-sweet eye candy of a production that, under the helm of a, let's say director like Guillermo Del Toro (Hellboy), could have been so much better. Also, a flat-out R-Rating couldn't hurt. I mean, everything doesn't have to appeal to the kids, does it?
B0000AXE8I|4.0|`The Matrix Reloaded' released in the Spring of '03 is the second installment of the \\"Neo Mythos\\". Superior, mind-boggling special effects rule the day as Neo (Keanu Reeves) and his faithful band of awakened humans continue to battle Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and the rest of the machines not only on the Matrix, but in the real world as well.<br /><br />Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus), Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity) reprise their roles from the original film and are joined by newcomers to the series; Jada Pinkett Smith (Niobe), Harold Perrineau (Link), Lambert Wilson (Merovingian), Monica Bellucci (Persephone) and Gloria Foster (The Oracle) to name a few. I particularly enjoyed the addition of Lambert Wilson and the lovely Ms. Bellucci. I wish they had made greater use of her Persephone role. It would've made for a great love triangle subplot with her, Neo and Trinity. A missed opportunity I guess.<br /><br />The Wachowski brothers have delivered with another wonderful mix of overt futuristic technology layered over a richly textured metaphysical landscape. Not as good as the first, but oh so close.
0877951861|5.0|What would have happened if Germany had discovered the massive deception that made the D-Day invasion of Normandy possible?  The Allies brilliant deception that led the Germans to believe the invasion would occur at Calais kept vital reinforcements from reaching Normandy in time to stem the invasion, but this misinformation campaign was so massive that it is hard to believe that no hint of it reached the Germans.  But what if a deeply planted German spy had uncovered the truth?  Follett extrapolates convincingly from the history of World War II to provide a thrilling tale of espionage.  British counter-intelligence discovers evidence that a German spy is operating in London, and when they realize he knows the truth, a race is on to catch him before he can pass on his knowledge to Germany.  The suspense builds steadily as the spy eludes trap after trap, leading to a climatic cliffhanger (literally) on a storm swept island off the coast of Scotland.  This tale is not only exciting but also fully plausible, with vivid details about life in the United Kingdom during the War and a cast a well drawn characters.  A thoroughly satisfying story.
0316776963|5.0|This was probably one of the funniest books that I've ever read. No, his is not \\"politically correct\\" and yes his family is bizarre and no, you wouldn't want to read this to a room full of third graders. However, if you're an adult, a thinking adult who loves good stories, this is the book for you. <br />I liked it so much that in less than a week I bought ALL of his books and am waiting for another one soon.
B00005JK8K|2.0|As a nephew of a Navajo Code Talker, I would like to express my thoughts on WINDTALKERS. <br /> <br />First of all, if the focus of a Navajo Code Talker movie is supposed to focus on the Navajo Code Talkers and their involvement in WWII, why is the movie centered around Nicolas Cage's character while Adam Beach and Roger Willie play supporting roles? <br /> <br />Second, since a lot of folks are not informed about this part of WWII history, wouldn't it have been a much better movie if they showed the origin of the Code Talkers before they faced the horrors of war in the Pacific Theatre? <br /> <br />My uncle stood proud among the surviving Code Talkers as they were recently honored for their service in the Pacific. (note: at the beginning of the movie, he is the elder in the hat that talks to Yahzzie before he gets on the bus. He also served as technical consultant.) I'm sure after seeing the movie and having survived WWII, I doubt he enjoyed seeing the Code Talkers' back-burner depiction in the film. <br /> <br />Nice \\"action\\" movie, though.
B000001GBJ|5.0|I was touched in one way or the other by this album. \\"HEARTSTRINGS\\" and \\"SONGS FROM THE SECRET GARDEN\\" are indeed some of the unsung songs in our secret garden. The song writer Rolf Lovland and Irish violinist Fionnuala Sherry have made this album come true. They have created New music for us. <br /> <br />ALSO RECOMMEND: MEHDl~Instrumental Heaven...A True Gem..Don't Miss It !
B000002GQE|5.0|Released in 1967, this is yet another incredible Moodies album and is one of my favorites.  As a huge prog rock fan, I especially appreciate the symbolic cover art, the overarching concept/theme, the abundant use of the mellotron, and the nearly seamless blending of an orchestra.  I guess it is worth noting that as a rock band, the Moodies were pioneers in fusing orchestral sonorities with rock music and got a number of other British rock bands interested in the use of an orchestra including Yes and Deep Purple amongst others.  Like a lot of other people, my favorite tracks include the haunting and dreamy Nights in White Satin, Tuesday Afternoon, and Dawn is a Feeling, but also like the instrumental orchestral passages (London Symphony Orchestra), the sections of dark and serious spoken words, and the subtle hints of the Beatles and even Pink Floyd's Piper at the Gates of Dawn album (1967).  This remastered album comes with a series of liner notes that feature a \\"question and answer\\" session with various members of the group - in general I found them to be fairly informative. All in all, this is a landmark recording by an extremely important group and is highly recommended along with In Search of the Lost Chord (1968), To Our Children's, Children's, Children (1969), and A Question of Balance (1970).
0671449028|4.0|This one is a very cute and sweet book but my daughter just doesn't like Sandra Boynton's books that much. We also have \\"One Two Three\\" and the \\"Hipps Go Bersurk\\" book. I like all three of them.

B000BTC5LW|3.0|I will never buy a PF concert without Roger Waters in it.<br /><br />Enough said.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|OK... I didn't see the previous ones. I was talked into seeing this one and I wasn't sorry. <br />This movie delivers! <br />Along the way, the characters do bring you up to speed as to the story line. So, I did understand what was happening after a while. <br />What I liked most was that this movie moved! It gained speed and didn't stop until it came screeching in to the end. It is special effects laden, but this story could not have been told without all of the special effects.... and they are done well. <br />It is comic book to be sure... so my expectations weren't too high. However, I was pleasantly suprised. They really did a good job with this movie. <br />Not to be taken too seriously in regards to the folklore of vampires and werewolves, it is quite a romp through reaching for the heights. <br />If you have some time to spend and want to be entertained and enjoy a thrill ride, I would definitely recommend this one. Worth every penny of rental. Take it for what it is meant to be and you won't be disappointed.
B000EJ9MTW|1.0|I grew up in the 70's/80's and appreciate the efforts of Zepplin and Sabbath, I even have an Ozzy tattoo on my leg and my friend has Zepplin's blimp on his arm. <br /> <br />I have heard \\"wolfmother\\" and it pales in comparison to the classics that helped make music what it is today. <br /> <br />IMHO, \\"wolfmother\\" is a one-hit blunder.
B000AADYYO|5.0|If you're expecting a full-on, intensely heavy death-fest in Opeth's new album, then you'd be better off checking out some of their old albums. Instead, \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is a perfect combination of growling vocals, chugging guitars, and melodious interludes in a sixty-six minute treasure chest of progressive metal. Though I'm usually not a fan of progressive metal because the songs drag on for unusually long amounts of time and the time signature/riffs change every few minutes, the way this album flows from the explosion of churning death metal fury on \\"Ghost of Perdition\\" to the ending of \\"Isolation Years\\". Though death metal isn't known for being melodic, this album proves even the most skeptical of skeptic wrong, showing that even one of the most atonal music styles around can be made to sound beautiful with the proper amount of progression and variety. In addition, this album was meant to be a concept album dealing with the struggles of a man who killed his own mother, but the album from front to back does not tie together an entire story (the first half does have a solid plot, but the rest does not follow the storyline). But even if the concept is scattered throughout the album, the album has a definite sense of direction.<br /><br />The band members involved in this album are an impeccable mix of skilled instrumentalists, all led by the powerful and versatile voice of frontman Mikael Åkerfeldt, All in one song, he switches from gravelly death grunting to soft, assonant singing that is both soothing and haunting, an embodiment of the album's eerie cover and the perfect match for the album's concept. He also adds a Mellotron to the mix (described as an electromechanical polyphonic keyboard used by a myriad of famous artists since its introduction in the 1960's), which gives the album a more avant-garde feeling upon its penetration into the music. Peter Lindgren gives an extra chunkiness to Mikael's guitar with his rhythm playing and makes you feel surrounded when the music reaches its peak with both guitarists and Mikael's growling invading your ears. As with many progressive metal bands, the bass takes a backseat to the epic orchestrations, and the bass is very de-emphasized in this album, as it didn't make any impression on me and I really didn't hear it at all (sorry, Martin Mendez. Per Wiberg provides all the keyboards/pianos in this album (a must in any progressive metal magnum opus such as this one), adding to the grandiose structure of the songs. Lastly, drummer Martin Lopez may not be anything to call home about, but he does need to be fast in this album and is definitely the perfect match for this admirable metal outfit.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're disgruntled with the repetition of the average death metal band, then check out this band and let some melody and structure be added into your liking. And if you want some similar bands, try Dream Theater and Symphony X, both perhaps equally skilled in providing a compelling progressive metal masterpiece. All in all, this band just might change your opinion of all those brutal death metal bands.<br /><br />Track Selections: \\"Ghost of Perdition\\", \\"The Baying of the Hounds\\" and \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\"<br /><br />10/10usic reaches its peak with both guitarists and Mikael's growling invading your ears.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album marks the return of the Queen of Pop after her last album \\"American Life\\", which, although certified Platinum, moved only 668,000 units in the states. However, when her new single \\"Hung Up\\" was released in 2005 with its fun video, it debuted at an amazing no. 20 on the Billboard hot 100 and eventually moved up to no. 7, being her biggest hit since 2002's \\"Die Another Day\\" which reached no. 8. The album is without a doubt a club favorite. The second single from the album, \\"Sorry\\", reached no. 58 on the Hot 100. The current single is \\"Get Together\\". She is currently on her world-famous \\"Confessions Tour\\" including songs from \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" which has sold an amazing 8 million copies worldwide, 1.4 million in the states alone.
B000E8N690|5.0|Walk The Line os about music legend Johnny Cash.  From Growing up in Arkanss in the hands of an alcaholic Father, to becoming one of music's most idoled icons.  The film opens with him Readying to take the stage at his Concert at Folsom Prison, then it shifts to his early years as a Farmboy In Arkansas.  A tragic accident takes the life of his brother Jack, and John gets the blame for it.  Then the movie moves on to his time in the Air Force.  After he comes out of the Air Force he marries first wife Vivan.  Vivian disapproves if his desire for a music career and leaves him.  (After she found that he had cheated on her with June Carter). While touring he meets June Carter who he idolized all through childhood.  They become close and John feels attracted to her, but she refuses to marry him.  As a result John turns to drugs and alcahol.  June sticks with him to put him back on track, he continues to beg her to marry him and finally she agrees.  Only if he stays away from the booze and drugs.    After getting married they settle in Hendersonville Tn.   They continue to tour together.  My favorite part in the movie is when both the Carter's and The cash's are sitting at the table together and Johnny Rebels against his father for all the abuse he was subjected to.  Over all this is a great story and if you are or are not a fan if Country music or Johnny Cash it is still a worthwile film to see and maybe even purchase.  This is way better than Ray starring Jamie Foxx.
0380018179|5.0|Given that everyone under the sun has recapped the story, commented upon the relationship between the two main characters, Meggie and Ralph, or gushed about how McCullough brings the Outback to life, let me add a tidbit that is seldom covered:  JUSTINE and RAINER HARTHEIM.  Oh, how I adore these two characters, even more than Meggie and Ralph!    JUSTINE is so flawed, yet I can't help but root and care for her.  Fragile, strong, bold, frightened, confident, insecure, talented, and lacking.  She is such a human mix, and I can't help but empathize with her.  She's an adorable b*tch--Rainer Hartheim lovingly calls her a monster--and I am in awe of Colleen McCullough for her ability to create such a character as Justine.    RAINER HARTHEIM... If I were to dream up my sexiest man, Rainer Hartheim would be it.  (Please realize that I might have somewhat perverse tastes.)  Like Justine, Rainer is a bit of a monster.  He shuts down his emotional self for a substantial period of his life, and he is remorseless in his pursuit of his goals.  Yet throughout all of this, he is completely aware of what he's doing, and of who and what he is.  He feels shame for his past actions; but if he had to do it again, he would.  He accepts his past actions, but moves on with the self-promise that he will, from this point forward, be the person he wants to be, someone of whom he can be proud.  I love Rainer's patience; perseverance; spirit; spirituality; control; ambition; incredible intelligence; sophistication; philosophical acceptance of life, others, and himself; loyalty; heart; sensuality; and truth to self.  He's a man who loses himself; and when he regains himself, he is completely aware of and deeply thankful for it.  A powerful individual, and a presence one can never ignore.  Can you understand why I find this incredible, self-redeemed man so sexy?

B00003CXD5|5.0|Besides featuring an excellent Bogart film, this dvd set has the added attraction of recreating for you a \\"typical\\" night at the movies as it was in the 40's and 50's. Leonard Maltin hosts \\"Warner Night at the Movies\\" and you get a newsreel, cartoon, comedy short, the feature movie and other items. Before TV became the source of all news and entertainment, this is how America got both at the movies. <br /> <br />Enjoy!!
0143034901|4.0|I enjoyed this book, although some of the translations were a bit quirky.  I particularly liked the parallels between the differing time frames and characters.  I thought the story had interesting characters and plot twists that were not so predictable.  Faith and religion are strong undercurrents to the story - something readers may not readily comprehend.  Check into the history of the Spanish Civil War referred to throughout the story, and you'll see how the culture to this day has not fully recovered from the most brutal attempt to eliminate religion from Spain.  This book opened my eyes to one reason behind the loss of faith taking place in Europe today.

B000EGF0B4|5.0|I always thought that \\"fullscreen\\" was like you see on TV, where they would take the widescreen movie and cut off the right and left sides. But that's not the case, at least with this movie.  I never knew there were fuller shots than what you see at the movie theater.  In the fullscreen version, you may get left and right sides cut off, but you get more on the top and bottom.  More than what you saw at the theater.  This fullscreen version is really nice for some of the more intimate segments in this movie, where the sweeping vistas aren't the main thing of interest.  Highly recommend that you have both versions, if you're a Brokeaholic.
B000002UB3|5.0|As a music listener, I was initially drawn to Abbey Road because of its cool Cover, but what Idiscovered when I opened the celophane wraping, and put it in my CD Player, was sure musical genious. I must admit, upon first hearing the whole album, all the way through, I thought it was a little weird, but I strangely liked it- it grows on you. Abbey Road is more than a cover, it is the Beatles best record, period. Recorded with a 24-Track machine, this album has the clarity (sans tape hiss in I want you (she's so heavy)) one would expect in a late '70s album. I definately agree with the reviewer who rated this with contemporary music. I will agree, the sounds, depth and overrall audio quality found on this album beat out any Fall Out Boy record, and come only second to the Dark Side of the Moon and Days of Future Past (by the Moody Blues). Come Together is a classic number, you have to love the punchy Lennon rythm guitar. Something is a great song, that you'll at first hate and then play replay over and over. For Maxwell's Silver Hammer, lock yourself in your room, turn up the volume on your Stereo and see if you can hear the somber Moog synthesizers in the back ground, its a great Pop-rock number. Oh! Darling is great for the vocals, but is a a little annoying and should be skipped. Octopus's Garden is really fun, and the country guitar licks are really thought provoking and yet really Rocking. Then there's I want you(She's so heavy0. This is a must hear, although it has tape hiss in the background, its latin-rock flavor is really cool, and represents the quieter brother to Yer Blues. Here Come's the Sun is also a classic, and should be played many times. Now, as for what is considered the last section of the album,one must appreciated every track. Because is soooooo trippy, followed by the gentle, yet frollicking crunch of You never give me your money, followed by the Jefferson Airplane feel of the overtly stony Sun King. Last but not least is what is considered theclassic melody of the album - it itself is great. Skip Polythene Pam (its weird) and replay She Came in through the Bathroom Window, its really a fast paced number that will get your attention. Golden Slumbers can also be skipped after a first run-through, but Carry that Weight is all the Beatles together, and then there is........ The End. A great song with three guitar solo's- see if you can tell whose playing which solo. A great album. You won't go wrong with this one. Pick it up- Today.
0684800713|3.0|I read this book because it was the monthly selection of my reading group.  It was very well written, but I would not recommend it to my friends.  Roger Ebert, the movie critic, sometimes says of a movie that, ultimately, he did not care about the characters.  That is how I felt about this book.  I just had no empathy for any of them.  I could have stopped reading the book at any page and not felt that I had missed anything.  In fact, the last 10 pages helped to explain the book, and so I am glad I did finish.  But there are better novels out there.  So many books, so little time.
B000002UAR|4.0|I am a huge beatles fan, don't get me wrong, and so being one, I had to check out \\"the best rock album of all time\\"- Revolver. Revolver is a great album, but it is not the best beatles album, and here's why. Revolver is a great example of the acid-Beatles era, which was certainly one of their most experimental and creative, but it lacks the overrall punch of Sgt. Pepper's and pales in comparison to the sonic soundscape created on Abbey Road. (Which was recorded with a 24-Track machine) While for 1966, the backwards tape loops and spead-up vocals must have seemed out of this world, Revolver is still a little boring. With a first run through, you'll think that this is a great album. Throw away Tommorow Never Knows (what a headache) and for that, Yellow Submarine, and you've got an okay track-listing; but after a few times playing it, it gets a little too poppy. With the exception of Dr. Robert, Taxman, and She Said She Said, this album is not at all Rock music. I'm only sleeping is just plain pscyadelic (but you have to love it), but it and the rest of the album is not rock n roll. The Best Rock Album of all time? I think not. One of the top three Beatles albums you have to own, just because its really trippy and still beats out Beatles For Sale. I think Yes. In my opinion, Revolver is a good LP that could have been better. Put in Rain, and drop Yellow Submarine (I am sooooooo sick of this song) and you've got a great piece of Music. Plus, for all of you who love Indian music, Love You Too is a must hear. P.S - If you are new to the beatles, don't get One, or Sgt. Pepper's (you won't be ready for this one) Check out the White Album -- plenty of filler but it's got a great late Beatles flavor that precurors Let it be and hints toward Abbey Road. <br />
B00005JP03|4.0|The movie is ok, it is definately fun to watch because I myself am a drifter and have been doing it for a few years in Jamaica, where JDM/RHD is the way. I live in the USA too and I miss my JDM vehicles being here in America. Most Americans have no clue and don't know that drifting, yes, like drag racing it is done on the same level, in fact, even higher. I laugh at the reviewer ' Reuben Roa' who said, and I quote, \\"People dont drift on the streets they do it professionally on real race tracks. LOL, the ignorance of some people, lol. I laugh at you. Drifitng was born on the hills of Japan, not on a track dear lad, LOL. We have been drifting on the streets where I am from as long as I can remember, especially touge; which is basically a sprint.   Next issue. As for the Nissan SR20DET from the 'Great' Nissan Silvia S15 being put into a classic American Muscle Mustang; brought to attention by reviewer 'eggplant'. I agree with him/her that it is indeed a disgrace to do such a thing. LOL, American cars don't deserve the HONOR, LOL. But, all in all the movie is enjoyable, fun, which is what movies like that are supposed to be. I gave it 4 stars because it was not perfect, the acting was not amazing and the sound was ok, and it didn't really capture drifting fully. I loved the cameo though, great respects to the Drift King, Keiichi Tsuchiya; Mr. Initial D himself. Good movie.
B000002J6H|2.0|Any song that contains a lyric like \\"Well there's a rose in the fisted glove and the eagle flies with the dove,\\" should be ridiculed, especially in a song that advocates the point of view that it's OK to sleep around on your wife as long as she doesn't know about it.  I'm sure this one has been discussed in junior high poetry classes for decades.  Stills was a talented guitarist and his work with Buffalo Springfield holds up pretty well, but stuff like this clearly demonstrates why CS&N were always trying to get Neil Young to hang out with them. <br />
B00082IJ08|1.0|When I first bought this cd it was for one reason and one reason only...to get feel good inc. And it was a good song, that along with dare and dirty harry. But beyond that this cd sucks. The music is all either depressing or puts you to sleep. Its quite pathetic. So if you really want one of their singles just download them, but dont buy the cd.
B00003CXCT|4.0|* Great set of bonus features, the 2.5 hour \\"Empire of Dreams\\" alone is worth it <br />* Nice retro collection of posters and TV/theatre teasers of the original movies <br />* The box cover design is nicely done <br />* They chose a good way to store the four DVDs inside <br />* Each DVD has the movie and the director's commentary as an additional feature. The rest of the bonus features are in the Bonus disc (as expected) <br />* FYI, The Bonus DVD disc does not have a Subtitle feature  (eg the Subtitle button of your DVD player's remote control will not bring up subtitles)

0156711427|5.0|Being the \\"Orientalist\\" that I am, I simply loved \\"A Passage to India\\" E.M Foster does an excellent job on character development and the relationships that build up to fall; then of course, build up again. The entire book is a rollercoaster of friends and foes. The book will keep you puzzled at who really is the antagonist and protagonist of the story.  The book has many symbolic meanings within itself that deal with humanity and conflict in general. <br /> <br />My favorite character in the book was Mr. Fielding. He related to my own character in so many ways. He seemed to be one of the few who wanted to understand the Indians (Muslim and Hindu).  <br />The book is dealing with the conflict that the British and Indian people had when the British Raj was in power. Looking from both sides of the spectrum, it really exposes the prejudice one had for another. Not only is it a matter of separation in India by the Indian and British, but it also deals with another internal conflict in India with Muslims and Hindus. Truly, it was a divided India. <br /> <br />While sometimes a tedious read, \\"A Passage to India\\" plays out to be a very well-written story full of rich history, interesting characters, and very opinionated peoples. This book is highly recommended to anyone who would like to understand some very interesting customs of India. Check it out!
B000EQ47HC|5.0|My review for the remastered edition of the first Boston release, Boston (1976/r. 2006) is very similar to this one.  Really, most people would consider Boston (1976) and Don't Look Back (1978) as an inseperable set.  When put together they barely make the capacity of a standard compact disc (80 minutes).  And, they are more alike than the slightly more exploratory Third Stage (1986).    I must begin this review with the same sentiments as I did the other one: If you don't like the band, nobody's asking you to listen to them.  But in the name of God show some respect for the people who do.  We don't go and badmouth your music; leave ours alone.    That aside, there is no need for me to go through each of the songs.  After all, when one totals the sales of the first two Boston albums, one reaches an impressive 24,000,000 copies sold.  There are artists today who will never sell that many albums if they released twenty different titles!  Boston's albums were among the first to be transfered to the (then new technology) compact disc format.  And it was a Boston album that became the first compact disc format release to reach the Gold (500,000 copies) standard.  This just stands to prove the undying legacy of this band and these albums, as well as the reason I don't need to describe the songs.  If you haven't heard them yet, you have simply not been on planet Earth for the past thirty years.    Which makes the fact that these albums haven't been remastered in 21 years very hard to believe.  But then, Scholz always was notorious for taking his sweet time with things (remember the lawsuits for breach of contract?).  I guess he just figured he would out-do himself in that department with these remasters.  Actually, Tom himself hadn't even been consulted on the matter.  He was rather upset at this, but rather than throwing things at the executives, his agent (and presumably his lawyers) asked Sony records very politely if Tom could make some nice 24-bit digital transfers ofthe first two albums and then handle the remastering himself.  Obviously they agreed, and the fine item you are considering at this moment is one half of the result.    Don't Look Back (1978) was one of the most anticipated sophomore albums ever released.  In all (to date) seven million copies have flown off the shelves, and though most people consider it slightly inferior to the first release, it has still received a great deal of airplay, and it has stood the test of time.  Perhaps you already own some incarnation of the album (album, eight-track, cassette tape, or the original 1985 compact disc release), or maybe this will be the first copy you will be buying.  In either case, my verdict stands: BUY IT NOW! DON'T HESITATE!    The remastering is what makes this album special.  The original release is well-known for its substandard sound quality, and Tom Scholz himself is on record as having said that he couldn't listen to that edition of his album.  Now he was finally granted a chance to craft the audio just as he brilliantly crafted 90% of all the songs and instrumental parts of Boston's music.    And he has risen magnificently to the task.  His work on this and the Boston (r. 2006) release is stunning.  And yet, as I said in my other review, the word that best describes the difference in sound between this release and the original release of Don't Look Back is subtle.  It doesn't jump right out at you, but there is definitely an improvement.  It might be hard to put into words just what's different, so I'll try and do that for you.    Having listened to the original releases of this and the first Boston album literally a few thousand times each, I can point out the major differences.  Most noticible is the increase in overall volume that all new remasters enjoy.  Nonetheless, it's very welcome.  Next is the clarity and presence of the vocals: Brad Delp has never sounded better.  No longer does his voice sound like it's underwater, or like it's had all the midrange frequencies notched.  His words are clear and understandable, yet warm and pleasant.  Typically high-range male vocalists suffer from poor remastering, and Brad was no exception.  On Tom's remaster, however, you hear Brad as he was meant to be heard.    Overall, the bass frequencies have been tightened and cleaned up considerably, the midranges are vibrant and mellow yet distinct, and the high ranges are nice and clear without losing the warmth of a vinyl recording.  Gone is the plethora of tinny, nasty treble that plagued the original edition of this album.  Tom really knows what he's doing, because normally I would have found something wrong with the audio for which I would correct.  I would not change a thing about what Tom did.    The final and most welcome change is the removal of all the artifacts from the original issue.  All the piercing cymbal crashes, the siblants, and the painful Hammond organ percussive attacks (most noticible at the end of \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\") are utterly gone.  The entire flow is smooth and rich as maple syrup.    Overall, this is a must-have supplement to Boston (1976/r. 2006).  If you own every incarnation of this album, or if you've never bought it before, this remastered edition is for you.  Don't think, just buy this and the Boston (1976/r. 2006) album at the nearest outlet (or, of course, from Amazon).    What are you still reading this for?!  Get out there and buy!    P.S. I've heard quibbling about the lack of bonus tracks.  While most new remasters include them, I wouldn't worry too much with this one.  According to Tom, the live cuts Sony had on hand were very poor recordings.  Tom has all the good ones, and he plans on releasing an entire live disc, complete with his signature remastering prowess.  Just take heart in this and you'll be fine!    P.P.S. Since this review appears as a Spotlight review, it will be more visible than my other reviews for various albums.  Therefore, I have to say the following out of respect:R.I.P. Brad Delp, lead and harmony vocalist of one of the greatest classic rock bands ever.  NOBODY will ever forget your talent or your contributions to music in general.  You were one of my absolute favorite vocalists, and I consider you an inspiration.  Many people do.  More than you will ever know.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|If you've never got into the whole 'world cinema' thing, then you're missing out on what cinema's best and most unique filmakers have to offer, like South Korean director Park Chan-wook.<br /><br />Oldboy is the director's second film in his revenge trilogy that started off with Sympathy For Mr Vengeance in 2002.<br /><br />Oldboy starts off with the main character Dae Su Oh drunk and being held in a police station, but is soon bailed by his friend. The credits kick off when he is talking to his daughter in aphone booth telling her he got her a birthday preasent, his friend then talks to his wife on the phone, he calls Dae Su to the phone but is nowhere to be seen, the only thing that is left behind is the bag that he was carrying his daughter's birthday preasent in. This is when we find out he's been kidnapped, and he has no idea why he is being locked up, but while locked up he has a TV in his room that he says is your only friend, clock , and lover, on this TV he finds out that he is a wanted fugitive for killing his wife. He then builds a plan of getting out and get his revenge on the person who did this to him. 15 years later he is free and is given new clothes and a cell phone, the man who did this to him is giving him five days to find out why he was imprisoned for 15 years, so 15 years of being curious wouldn't go to waste.<br /><br />That is what I can tell you about the plot but don't want to spoil a brilliant twist that will force you to watch it a second time. This film has the energetic directing and storyline of a Quentin Tarrentino film, and has one of the best and possibly the best fight scene of all time. This film might not appeal to everyone but it certainly is a film you must watch before you die. This film is followed by Lady Vengance and is the final film in this revenge trilogy.<br /><br />A must-have.
B00011V8CW|3.0|I'm a huge Bowie fan, and buy into the idea that most of his 90's and 21st century works have restored his artistic credibility to a large degree. In brief, BTWN made me grateful that he returned to solo work, albeit I was more than a wee bit scared as his prior solo works included the non-plusses 'Tonight' and 'Never Let Me Down.' Plus, unlike most Bowie fans, I loved the first Tin Machine record, appreciating it for what it was - a bit fat detonation of his post 'Scary Monsters' work.  <br /> <br />So...why three stars? Well, I'm guilty, but I like the re-mix disc - yes, superfluous, but fun. And the record itself? It contains several extraordinary tracks - 'You've Been Around', 'I Feel Free', the title track (well, a tad below extraordinary, and now sounding dated), 'Jump They Say', 'Nite Flights' and the utterly disturbing 'Pallas Athena' - so you have 6 great songs from the proper record's 12.  <br /> <br />As for the remaining record - well, the Morrissey cover is OK, but several of the other tracks really should be stomped and buried.  <br /> <br />I do wish, if he decides to tour again, he'd revisit some of the above-mentioned extraordinary tracks live.  <br /> <br />
B000096BLG|1.0|When I got this CD, I was very disappointed.  This is not a professional recording, but rather one taped by someone in the audience.  The sound is muffled instead of being crisp.  And the backup group obviously was not very familiar with the songs.  They would go off on solos, and never complete them because they got lost in the riff and ran out of time before the vocal was supposed to return...  In addition, the CD was not playable on my computer, so I could not put it on my iPod...
B0000029GA|5.0|The term classic is criminally overused in hip hop culture.  It is very common for a fan to refer to a great album as a classic but it is a term that critics don't take lightly.  It is easy to find a great record...but a MASTERPIECE is something much tougher to find (especially in a genre where rap fans are so fickled by the next hot thing).  Perhaps no other album in the genre deserves the title more than the debut album by Nas. <br /> <br />     Plain and simple, Illmatic is the most fearless, shocking, and literally unbelievable record I have ever listened to.  It's the Michael Jordan of rap because every so-called great record that drops gets compared to it.  There are no moments of vulnerablity.  At only twenty years of age, nobody to this day has yet to match his lyrical wizadry with chilling imagery such as, \\"I never sleep, 'cause sleep it the cousin of death\\"; \\"I rap in front of more n****** than on the slave ships\\"; \\"I switched my motto -- instead of sayin f*** tommorrow/ that buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto.\\"  Reguardless of age, it was just DOPE. <br /> <br />     You have to realize that Nas came onto the scene as a man-child in a broken land.  People lost faith, \\"'Cause yeah we were beginners in the hood as five-percenters/ But somethin' must of got in us 'cause we all turned to sinners.\\"  So when Nas boasts that he loves \\"committin' sins,\\" you start to believe him.  The poetry is so heartfelt and intense.  His letter to a locked up thug is brilliant on \\"One Love\\", \\"shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul/ only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style/ then i rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes/ then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose.\\"  Timeless! <br /> <br />     As far as singles go, \\"The World is Yours,\\" stands as one of my all-time favorites.  It is five minutes of rapperfection.  The song is so lyrical that Nas doubles and triples up on metaphoars to give listeners different meanings.I remember when the source magazines jaws dropped at the release of \\"Halftime\\" in 1992.  Nas snatched up all the quotables and highlights when it dropped on the Zebra Soundtrack.  The same thing followed when \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\" dropped.  The album just encapsulates hip hop history in it's purest form. <br /> <br />     Overall, forty minutes is all the album needed.  One remarkable guest appearance from AZ and a dream team line-up of producers put it over the top.  Nas didn't think he was god, he just thought he was better and wanted people to know that for the future.  However, the next day came and the man who was so ahead of his time would be forever shadowed by the MASTERPIECE in which Illmatic personified! <br />      <br />
630469654X|4.0|I have this movie on DVD and watch it periodically. <br /> <br />It is a compelling question; why does this 1980's movie make you want to watch it over and over? <br /> <br />There is no doubt that the story is compelling and convincing.  I like Rutger Hauer and Matthew Broderick alot.  Michelle Pfeiffer isn't bad, isn't great.  Leo Kern and John Wood complete the central cast and are all very believable. <br /> <br />Others have commented on the movie music as just wrong. <br /> <br />One reviewer commented on the anachronistic phrasing. <br /> <br />I believe it is the plot and the way it is played by Hauer and Pfeiffer of non-consummated love that keeps watchers coming back.  It is a compelling story.  There are several factors that keep this story from being a great movie.  There is the use of the film technique that made it dark and grainy at times.  Probably the music.  But what jars me the most is the anachronistic language.  Phillippe is simply too well spoken to have been a street urchin all his life.  I also recall Michelle Pfeiffer's \\"Oh, damn!\\" when she is distracted by The Mouse as she feverishly--as a human--tries to catch a rabbit and fails.  Her \\"Oh, damn\\" had more the intonation of '80's girl who cannot find hairbrush than medievel damsel in starvation distress.  Hauer really stayed in character and period the best here. <br /> <br />Bottom line--watch it.  With all of it's imperfections, this is a movie that moves you to care about the characters and you will be taken up in to their fantasy dilemma.
B00005221L|5.0|I must admit that even for a girl, I think this is one of the best nail-biting, or fist smashing if you prefer, action movies that has hit the screen in the past years. This movie came out when I was six years old and along with the Conan movies, which were one of the first movies I have ever seen, made Schwarzenegger my favorite action hero. Since my father had the terminator hair cut and even resembled him, I was sucked into a world of fantastic movies, which never gave me nightmares and pretty much defined my style in books and movies for years to come. <br /> <br />Predator is one of those movies that have never received a bad word from anyone I know and that is rare these days. This movie is a smoothie of Aliens, Commando and Rambo producing a fusion of sci-fi and horror special effects that are a guarantee show stopper. The monster itself is not shy, it starts killing right away and it does make plenty of appearance so that the audience doesn't have to wonder if there is a creature at all like in some movies I've seen (where there's a lot of waiting for nothing). <br /> <br />The action unfolds as an alien space ship disposes of a small aircraft and drops it on out dear planet Earth. Aboard the one person vessel is a hunter who hunts for the pleasure, it's like a fishing trip during the weekend, and the people are the fish. As it drops on the jungles of Central America little does he know that he will meet his match there as Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and his CIA fellow officers are assigned to help rescue a hostage from the guerrilla fighters who occupy the jungle. Some of the bad guys will become snacks for the biomechanoid, but he will bump heads in the jungle with some tough guys who are not going down without a battle. The action and fight sequences were very impressive and the hunt and traps that were set up to catch the hunter were really fun to watch. Unfortunatelly, against the lush, green backdrop the Predator is deadly, fast, shoots lasers and even turns invisible and proves that he's the master of camouflage; he's a real hunter. Apparently Arnold took quite a beating during filming as he fell from tall waterfalls, swam in ice cold water for days and was engorged in mud for weeks running on steep hills. <br /> <br />Dutch takes the role of the dog catcher and takes us though the wild jungles on the hunt, and I can safely say that this movie never bores. The ending was spine tingling and intense and provided a satiating finale to this robust movie. Great action flick whether you like terrestrial boogey men or not. <br /> <br />-Kasia S.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Who knew that The Old West and Science Fiction could blend so well.  With a fantastic blend of drama, humor, and memorable characters, Firefly is a series that is a blast to watch.  It's a shame there aren't more episodes.  Everyone I've shown it too keeps asking for more.  A definite five star purchase.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|Syriana is a movie that is set in the middle east and it deals with the politics of oil. Just like Traffic, this movie is extremely slow. It took me a couple of days to get through this one (just like Traffic) because it kept putting me to sleep. The movie is also slightly hard to follow. If you turn your head for a slight moment and miss one of the conversations in subtitles you have missed a major part of the movie. But once I finally got through the movie and got the full meaning of it, it was a decent movie. The performances of matt damon and george clooney were good as they usually are.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The original cut of Kingdom of Heaven was good, but this extended edition gives a much greater insight to the characters.  It is a great movie that is well worth the time and even if you have the original, you should see this version.         I liked the theatrical cut of \\"Heaven\\" and bought it the day it hit the stores, so when I heard that there was a director's cut coming out, I wondered why bother when the original was so good. Somehow, I talked myself into purchasing the new cut and I was flabergasted. There is so much new info here that adds immeasureably to both the understanding and enjoyment of \\"Heaven\\". I definately reccommend this movie along with the original cut. But if you can only afford one, get this one.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This a stellar debut for miss india. Music that declares we don't care about material things and also declares to treat yourself and others right is what the world needs to hear. India has a beautiful voice, great lyrical content and some excellent acoustic music.
B0001HLVS2|3.0|The movie is okay, but doesn't hold a candle to A&E's Horatio Hornblower saga.  If you really want excitement, interesting characters and great acting, go for Hornblower.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Whether you are a fan of the movie Pride and Prejudice (2005), or just a lover of classical music, you are sure to enjoy this soundtrack. The music is such that you can feel the emotion of each piece and envision where each number may go in the movie. It has a peaceful country-like tone that is sure to lull you into a calm atmosphere. The instruments range from a lone-piano telling of a beautiful morning, to an orchestra portraying urgence and danger. I personally love this soundtrack enormously, and have it play as my alarm in the mornings. The music is widely known and has been heard on classical radio stations and at the Academy Awards. Overall, I definetly reccommend both the Pride and Prejudice soundtrack and the movie.
B000060OFT|1.0|I saw this in high school after reading the play, and it was so absolutely absurd that one wonders if it's supposed to be a satire.  But no, it's just that stupid. The entire class was in stiches. Shakespeare is my all time favourite playwrite, and this is quite possibly the worst adaptation of any Shakespeare play ever written. Full of cliches, discontinuity, cheesy visual \\"stretches\\" (ie. the gun's the Capulate and Mountague 'thugz' wield are manufactured by \\"Sword, co\\") to fit the old-century lines. Someone with the mindset of a Jr High school-girl might find this breathtaking, but for the rest, its two hours of laughing at the stupidity.
B00005JOWF|5.0|For those negative reviews ...the movie is based on a Comic Book Character & was never meant to win any \\"Oscars\\". <br />  <br />It's a Sci-Fi action flick & the extended cut version really improves upon that ! (Even the menu is awesome!) <br /> <br />I will be buying this one for my collection.  <br /> <br />
6305128952|5.0|Robert Redford has proved us his undeniable artistic gifts in previous occasions, but with this giant movie he really achieved that coveted pearl; the state of art in all its wholeness.<br /><br />Redford crossed over the traditional concessions and he got to prove art and cinema should not be divorced: good taste and profitability may gather and shake hands, if you respect the sensibility and intelligence of the spectator.<br /><br />This picture not only broke the walls and not only became the most ambitious, artistic and perfect American film in the last quarter of Century; besides, the mature and sensitive script around an awful event that will transform the livings and expand the reduced frontiers of two different ways of life, enhancing them when the tragedy became an unexpected gate for the bliss.<br /><br />Redford' s artistic personality has a secure place in the immortality and I really hope for him to bring us future films filled of that enriched vision where the rude vulgarity, the visible special effects big circus and the simple anecdote not only be absent; and so the new directors to come, understand the true cinema meaning is ART.<br /><br />Thanks to his generous personal effort, for having created the Sundance Festival for new directors whose fruits will create new approaches and major visions.<br /><br />Special kudos to him due that clinical eye for a very young actress in progress at those years:<br />Scarlet Johansson.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|I have to say that I am not familiar with anything that has to do with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not \\"know\\" of Willy Wonka prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed! <br /> <br />The film brings to the screen the story of a young boy whose dream of visiting the Chocolate Factory comes true. There he discovers all sorts of surprises that he never even dreamed existed.  <br />  <br />The acting is about average, the colors are nice and that's about it.  <br /> <br />In a nutshell, it's a pretty good movie for kids, while an ok movie for most adults; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top. <br />
B000000WA4|5.0|This is the album that really unleashed the Smashing Pumkins into the world, in my opinion, though their previous efforts were and still are great. I really felt when I first heard this ablum, however, that they were going deeper into the abyss than they had ever gone. They unleased something very powerful here. The power that they are tapping into is remarkable--like raw electric current. In these tracks they achieved transcendence and play with more vital, primal force than ever before or since.   After this, however, their greatest days as a band were over.
B000050GBF|5.0|Based on the heroes from Marvel comics, X-Men is a wonderful sci-fi film, which brings to the screen the struggle for supremacy between two rival groups of mutants while an undeclared state of war with the humans looms in the background.   <br />Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen and Halle Berry (BOTH of whom are GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all out of this world! <br />In short, X-Men is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)! <br />
B0001ADAVK|3.0|I enjoyed this film but it wasent a great film to see over and over again. The charactors are likeable and the story is somewhat interesting. The story drags on at times but it has a good story and is insperational at tiems. It's not Julia Roberts best film but it's still enjoyable.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Grand Prix is a classic.  <br /> <br />Some people dismiss this movie as a good movie about great cars or about the technological advances the film made 40 years ago.  The true greatness of this movie is that it is a fantastic film about real car racing.  This film is a living/breathing entity.  The images are spectacular, yes, but the greatness is the story about real drivers and the lives they lead. <br /> <br />Saul Bass, the legendary Movie Titles genius puts Grand Prix as his all time favorite work.  And why?  Because even from the Titles, the movie breaths and lives.  The Titles run through the moments before the start of the Monaco Grand Prix.  The hearts beating up to the launch of the race.  The movie races at top speed from the very beginning. <br /> <br />More importantly is the question the movie raises about WHAT drives a human being to put his or her life on the line every time a driver fires up the engines of a race car.  The people in their lives who worry every second of every race.  Some who support the drivers only to take extreme joy in their ultimate failures. <br /> <br />Grand Prix is the ulitmate racing movie.
B000FA57RG|5.0|I'm not your typical Madonna fan. This means I won't spend two days before the concert to be in the front row. But I am a follower, from a distance, yes, but still a follower. I've been watching her for 20 years now.  <br />I went to see the concert showed in this DVD, in Anhern (Netherland). The last time I saw a Madonna concert was in Buenos Aires (Argentina). It was her \\"girlie show\\", and the time 1993.  <br />More than ten years later, the show is less about being a circus, less about just having fun, about trying to shock us with sex and mainly showing everything off. This time, it's about big, very big screens and a tiny Madonna, just in front of `em. That, with some dancers moving all over her.  <br />She was so tiny in front of those huge screens.  <br />How could she manage to keep up with the myth, she herself created?  <br />How could she give this direction or this message she speaks of to 80'000 persons?  <br />To me, on a unique personal level, she failed.  <br />This DVD gives you the reasons why. Trying to be spiritual using the Madonna machine : no one can do that. She should have tried it differently. Or not. \\"Let it will be\\" is one of her new dance songs. She goes back to what her \\"cage\\", as she says herself, allows her to do: entertain people, not make them think. Yep! That's a lot and pretty much, it.  <br />I read a comment about the last part of the DVD, her trip to Israel. Well, when it comes to the part when the show is about to be over, I though I would go depressed for a week just like when I finished to see \\"truth or dare\\". But no, not this time. This last segment took this awful taste out of my mouth, that a nostalgic ends always gives; and instead brought me hope, it gives a beginning, not an end. And that's a good thing. <br />\\"Truth or dare\\" was about being God. It was raw, unconscious, power.  \\"I'm gonna tell you a secret\\" is about how small we are. It's about a person who though was God and discovered her true small human nature andlearned, just passing by, some humility. Does that make us dream? Probably not. Can or should a Popstar be like this? Neither. Is this healthier, well damn' yeah!  <br />It is true that Madonna.com said it would be a tour \\"for the fans\\" and that she would sing all those songs she said she'd never, again, sing, those songs like \\"material girl\\", for example, or \\"crazy for you\\", sang virtually over the fans, or better, \\"burning up\\" (the greatest moment, with \\"nobody knows me\\", from the show. I just BURNED!).  <br />All of this is absent from the DVD. Actually, the \\"entertainment part\\", is cut out, left I don't know where. And it's obvious why.  <br />So, don't expect a good review of the show (it isn't her best anyway so you won't miss it! Just kidding!). It isn't.  <br />It's more about what she's now. About what she cares for. And in that matter, she delivers.  <br />After all this years, Madonna is still the most intriguing performer this planet carries on. I can't wait to keep watching, learning, doing.  <br />PS: sorry Lourdes, \\"I'm gonna tell you a secret\\" it's not: \\"je vais te dire un secret\\", but \\" je vais te raconter un secret\\". Keep working on your french girl (as I will continue to work on my very miserable English!)!  <br />
0066620996|5.0|This is a book for all leaders--not just business executives--to consider, in fact to read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest, as the old Anglican collect put it. Here you will find that the great leaders are humble men and women--probably not possessed of overwhelming charisma--who picked the right people and then pursued a vision with relentless rigor. The book clearly shows why some organizations succeed and others don't--often in identically difficult situations. A book to be pondered by all who would lead.
0618477942|5.0|I'm joining the chorus of 5 star reviewers. \\"Fun Home\\" is in a class of its own like a centaur or a gryphon - a memoir and a comic book, an evisceration and a celebration - intellectually exuberant, improvising in five keys at once, heartless and heartbreaking. At times it achieves the savage surprise of poetry. I love the anarchy of its obsessions - words caper across the page, intoxicated with allusion and alliteration, while the panels detail a different level of compulsion, architectural, cartographic, fetishistic. There's not a dud page in the book; everything's alive and conflicted and absurdly complicated.    Only one cavil: am I the only one who (based on the evidence in the book) doesn't believe her father killed himself? His death is exactly the kind of clumsy tragicomic catastrophe that you'd expect, the inadvertent art of the old artificer.
B00022M518|5.0|I just had to add a bit if info that I think makes this album even better. While I love Taking Tiger Mountain and even more so Another Green World, Here Come the Warm Jets is possibly one of the best album names to ever surface in rock and roll. Especially considering the pre-history of Eno's solo work. <br /> <br />Eno used to be in Roxy Music, with the overbearing, yet talented-as-hell front man Brian Ferry. As we all know, Eno is a creative force that cant be stopped  (or topped) and so is Brian Ferry. Eno left Roxy Music on bad terms. Apparently him and Ferry didnt get along and Ferry didnt want Eno directing the groups sound....So Eno struck out on his own and released this record, Here Come The Warm Jets....which basically translates to Eno pissing all over the Roxy Music pop formula while saying \\"Ha! I can do it better wihtout you!\\" HAHAHA!!! So this album is Brian Eno metaphorically pissing all over the competition, namely Brian Ferry and Roxy Music.... <br /> <br />You cant beat that....The album rules too. Quirky, unique, brazen, funny, inventive, genre breaking, pyschedelic, pop rock and roll. There really is hardly any album like, including Eno's later work which continually pushed the boundaries of all forms of music...
B000F7CMRM|2.0|I have read Sleeping With the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude by Robert Baer and I really loved it.  It gave me a lot of insight on people in the Middle East and it was a real page turner.  I assumed his book See No Evil would be similar and that the movie made from it would be exciting and thought provoking.   Instead, this came across as a pitch for the liberal agenda.  <br />  <br />Every one in the government and big business is evil and if you try to do the right thing like the one Prince tries to do you get removed.  Some people think that the head of the oil company is suppose to be like Bush but I some how think they are trying to imply Cheney with the hunting part.  I was waiting for Chris Cooper to shoot Jeffery Wright on the hunting trip by accident.  In the end he sells out anyway because everyone is looking out for himself or herself.  <br />I guess I didn't understand why the Arabs in the film were so mad at the oil companies because they got laid off.  I suppose it was the only job they could get in that part of the country.  I don't understand why they just didn't go home, was it even worse there or what?  I also didn't believe the fact that these Arabs after a little religious talking turn in to maniocs who want to kill themselves when some religious leader tells them to.  I'm sure there must be some like that but after years of indoctrination.  These guys just seemed to out of work for 6 months to 1 year.  <br /> <br />There were scenes I did like that made me jump like the torture scene with Bob and Jimmy but that was few and far between.  I also like the Christopher Plummer role as Dr. Evil.  <br /> <br />There seemed to be too many stories going on at the same time to make it interesting enough to follow. If they would have got rid of the Matt Damon character and family and focused more on the background stories of the other characters they could have made this more of an interesting film.  They could have added more of espionage plot and make it more believable.   <br /> <br />In the scene when George Clooney knows they are targeting the Emir and gets there and just stands around instead of saying get out and hit the deck or something.   I also didn't believe that a group at the CIA would cold heartily kill from the command head quarters with a whole group around and no one say this guy has a wife and kid with him.   I could see one individual do that but not the whole group.  In a group they would have to worry that someone was going to rat them out and they would have to play by some laws.  <br />The deleted scene were limited and showed Bob's wife who I don't seem to remember being in any of the movie. In the talk with Clooney section he seems to try to tell you that they were trying to give an objective view which I think is a bunch of bologna.  <br />I guess I was expecting more of an exciting spy movie. <br />
B00005Q4CS|5.0|First let me say that I saw the previous review and if they are only offering the edited version on here then that is a shame, because to experience the true effect of this film you need to see it uncut. <br /> <br />That being said, I will never forget the evening that I sat down on the couch in a dark room all by myself to watch this film for the first time. <br /> <br />I must say that the first hour was good but not great, but the movie keeps building and building and building until the last 30 minutes of the movie which are beyond explaination. <br /> <br />I believe that I ran the entire gammut of emotions over the last 30 minutes and my mouth was agape during the unforgettable climax. <br /> <br />The soundtrack that plays throughout the movie is absolutely beautiful and is impossible to shake from your mind long after the movie has ended. <br /> <br />There is no question that you will encounter some people who tell you that this movie is too negative, or that it was something that has been done before. <br /> <br />My response:  Don't listen to them, watch the movie and judge for yourself.  It is not for everyone, yet I believe that everyone NEEDS to see this movie to at the very least put their own life into perspective. <br /> <br />All I can say is that I sat on my couch for almost 30 minutes unable to move, speak and absolutely overwhelmed - and I can truthfully say that at that point in my life I absolutely needed that.
0446608955|5.0|I had heard wonderful things about the book and movie \\"A Walk To Remember\\". I was completely engrossed once I started reading and finished the book in a day! I am glad I took the advice of other reviews and kept a box of tissues nearby as I read the book....it is a tearjerker! Such a heartfelt and moving story and I just fell in love with the characters Landon and Jamie. I just bought the movie and I'm excited to watch it with my daughter. Nicholas Sparks is a gifted writer and has a remarkable way of drawing the reader into the story. The emotions you feel as you read this book will touch your heart. I highly recommend this book!

0446608955|4.0|I don't make it a habit to read love stories, however, this book was quite good. This is one of those books that I had to stay up late reading just to figure out how it ended. I truly enjoyed this book despite its extremely feminine nature. It is a love story so beware. I think that this book would be enjoyed by people thirteen years old and older. Mind you, that age range does include males also, though, i wouldn't blame males if it is not on the top of their lists.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Anyone who is in to history and bible should watch this movie. The actors and the cinema crew did an amazing job. This movie was really good but it was worth it.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I just felt the need to say something about this album because it seems that now a days it's rare to actually hear a band that is actually unique and authentic. Plain and simple- this is just really good music.  Most bands these days all sound the same: the same generic sound, the same generic lyrics, blah, blah, blah... Jared's voice is amazing, the band is extremely talented, and the production is awesome with a lot of cool effects that enhance their sound.  <br />     Some are saying that Jared Leto is just another actor trying to get into music, but this to me is entirely wrong and close-minded.  It IS possible to be an amazing actor AND a great musician as well...despite the fact we don't see it often.  I hope his previous celebrity status doesn't cloud anyone's judgement of this music.  <br />     All in all, you can just put the CD on and actually enjoy every song on the album--I find this somewhat rare these days. There are thought-provoking lyrics, and you really feel the emotions they're trying to convey... \\"The Kill,\\" \\"The Fantasy,\\" \\"Savior,\\" \\"Hunter.\\" <br />     ...but just as a side note, I'm not going to lie, watching Jared Leto sing...wow...
B00005JNX0|4.0|This movie is great. Children and adults will find this movie funny. This movie has no age limit, anyone will like it.
B00005MCX3|5.0|What is the problem with these guys?  The make awsome music but seems to have a problem trying to have a descent sound on an album.  I bought an album a couple of years back and let me tell you, there was almost no music on it?  Talking, talking, soft music in the background, big arena echo all the way through the album. <br /> <br />Hawkwind was only wind to me until I bought this album.  WOW you better believe it, they're genius. My favorites are D-rider, Paradox, Web weaver and can't explain why. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JP01|5.0|I watched this movie in theathers, twice. This movie is great. The first two versions of this movie suck, but this one is good. The drivers in this movie are awesome, drifting is spectacular. This movie will keep you in your seats until the end, trust me. This is a good movie.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is a great cd with nice new sounds or like other people call it ''future disco''.I love all the songs but my favorites are hung up, sorry, get together, jump and forbidden love. All the songs have great beat and they make u wanna dance all day long specially hung up and jump. If you are a Madonna fan this cd is for you, and if you are not a fan and you are looking for new dance music with fresh new sounds I recomend this cd to you.
B0000C6DWU|5.0|People that have not seen this movie, should go and see it. This movie is a must see. Graphics in this movie are amazing. The plot of story is simple and very interesting and also pretty funny. Kids will enjoy this movie as much as adults would.
B00005JNEW|5.0|Even after having read the excellent book, and knowing what would happen, I still thought this was an incredible movie.  Even though it shows how obsessed Odessa (and Texas) is with football, and not in the best light, it's the truth on how it is there, as well as many other places in the country. <br /> <br />The best part for me is how it can show, even if you don't like your teammates, you have one common goal and will do anything to get there together.  Plus the moment with the Billingsley's at the end was awesome.  Words can not describe that scene for me.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|this movie is great. the beginning is really funny. This will keep you laughing even when it's over. actors did an amazing job.
B0001907DA|5.0|The box that the movies came inside of was a little bent, but each of the DVDs was in excellent shape.  I bought the movies as a gift for a cadet that I know, and he loved them!
B0002KVUKM|4.0|some people will find this movie really scary, some might find it really funny. If you like monsters and creepy stuff, you will enjoy this movie. If you don't like creepy monsters and draculas with huge teeth, please try to avoid movies like this one.
B00002Z88D|5.0|The combination of Metallica with a symphony orchestra works very well, although in some songs the orchestra arrangements come off a bit like a cliched attempt at Wagnerian drama.  Despite that, an interesting and heartfelt effort.  My favorite is No Leaf Clover, where James Hetfield breaks away from his usual vocal style for a brief time; he should try to expand his range more often.
B00005B36H|5.0|this cd is an awesome accomplishment from tool. this and aenima are my two fav tool albums on totally different levels. with albums like opiate and undertwo, they display their harder angry side, which is a great way to start. aenima is right in the middle of those two drifting further off into a psychedelic sound but maintaining that anger, that drive with build ups to maynards original frustrated scream that pumps so much energy into you that you feel your head is going to explode. this album is drifting further into an experimental psychedelic perspective, theyre getting older and becoming more calm but nothing can take away the fact that they still build up a hell of a lot of energy on this album, they just have more mellow parts than usual and theyre not as angry. songs like ''the grudge'' and the title track ''lateralus'' exactly fit what im talking about, they reflect some frustration, not so much anger, and they are basically building up energy around the parameters of the message this time. they have powerful subliminal messages and powerful clear cut messages as well and wrapped in the middle of the message sandwich are mind boggling lyrics that are very creative and intense and music with excellent playing, off-timing measures and original, awesome sounding effects. aenima was awesome, lateralus is just as awesome. if you were to start listening to tool, because aenima is in the middle of their evolving sound like i explained earlier, i feel that would be the best one to start with. 10,000 days unfortunately fell, but thats neither here nor there, THIS album is fantastic!
0060977493|5.0|I read this book in the middle of my fall semester at a west Texas school. I read at stoplights on my way to school. I read before class. I read while I was walking. I sat down on a bench to wait for a bus and read the words, \\"Centuries telescoped into one evanescent moment\\" and lost my breath. This is the most singularly beautiful piece I have ever read.
0812550757|5.0|Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Card's Speaker for the Dead is how different it is in every conceivable way from it's prequel Ender's Game, yet still manages to be an effective and entertaining sci-fi masterpiece.  With SPFTD, Card produced one of the most successful one-two punches in sci-fi literature. <br /> <br />At the heart of the story lies a biological murder mystery and the Card incorporates fascinating human and non-human characters into this huge anthropological puzzle.  He really surprised me in the way he evolved Ender into an adult I never would of pictured for him.  The alien \\"piggies\\" are well thought out and in some ways more human then the homo-sapien characters.  Everything about this book works although I can't say that fans of the Ender's Game \\"won't be disappointed\\" because the two seem so distant in everything but a few characters and similar historical events. <br /> <br />This book (like Ender's Game) won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for science fiction, thus making Card the only author to ever win both awards two years in a row.  That being the said, the comepetition was not as strong as the previous year. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  A fantastic sequel with as much power as its predecessor that deserves to be read.  Unfortunately the series took a serious nosedive from here.
B0002IQEHI|4.0|Cary Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill, a New York advertising executive who is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies and is pursued across the country while he looks for a way to survive.  With that said, Hitchcock takes us cross-country with gorgeous landscapes and a breathtaking scene at Mount Rushmore.  A scene like this would be easy to shoot now, but more difficult almost 50 years ago.  And Hitchcock uses his strengths in this movie, choosing Cary Grant to play a man on the run and trying to prove his innocence before it is too late.  This movie also has the classic scene of the dust cropper and the quote from a man saying, \\"That's funny, that plane's dustin' crops where there ain't no crops.\\"  Uh oh!  This movie is in color and holds up very well almost 50 years after the release.  My only complaint is that it is probably about 20 to 25 too long and has too much of that old school \\"hard kissing\\" where you think Cary Grant is hurting Eva Marie Saint instead of kissing her.  But definitely worth seeing and I am glad no one has tried to remake this movie, because they would probably just mess it up.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Director Ang Lee's 2003 \\"Hulk\\" is a worthwhile rendition of Marvel's Hulk. Like the '08 version, it has its strengths and weaknesses. Let's look at what works and what doesn't work:<br /><br />WHAT WORKS:<br /><br />- What I'm most impressed with is the serious, intelligent, respectable manner in which the story is presented. There are no goofy, campy elements to be found.<br /><br />- Most of the casting is good: Sam Elliott as General \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross, Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross and Josh Lucas as Glen Talbot.<br /><br />- Ang Lee shows off his filmmaking skill with various creative editing/framing techniques (supposedly giving the feel of a comic book). I've never seen this type of work in any other film, particularly not to this degree of innovation. It works for me.<br /><br />- I think they did an excellent job with the appearance of the Hulk. Since they were endeavoring to show the REAL Hulk, the one that throws tanks around and jumps across the landscape, they had no choice but to go the CGI route. They did the best they could with the technology available at the time and it holds up a decade later. Hey, it's better than a big body-builder painted green!<br /><br />- Without doubt, the best part of the film is the 22-minute rampage of the Hulk that starts at the 92-minute mark. This IS the Hulk! The enthralling sequence realistically shows the Hulk taking on the military as was often portrayed in the comics. This is definitely one of the best action sequences ever put to film. Make no mistake, the DVD is worth owning for this 22-minute episode alone!<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK:<br /><br />- The drama is presented in a lazy, convoluted way that somehow detaches the viewer from the film, but I'm okay with it as long as I put on a pot of coffee, lol. This will naturally turn-off Hulk fans who were expecting a fast-paced, simplistic \\"Hulk will SMASH\\" story.<br /><br />- Some of the casting is questionable, like Eric Bana as Bruce Banner. Some criticize him as \\"wooden\\" but this isn't what I object to as it's the point of the character. Although Bana is certainly likable in the role, and I've gotten used to him, he just doesn't exude Bruce Banner as depicted in the comics or the TV series; he's too much of a handsome muscleman who looks like he could kick some serious arse without turning into the Hulk, which takes away from the whole concept. By contrast, both Bill Bixby and Edward Norton fit the character. Then there's Nick Nolte as Bruce's father, David Banner, the \\"Absorbing Man.\\" It took me quite a while to get used to his role in this film, but I'm okay with it now.<br /><br />- Some may object to the deviations made to the origin of the hulk and that these changes slow the story down and needlessly complicate it. In the comic Bruce Banner became the Hulk after accidentally being exposed to gamma rays from a huge government test-bomb in the desert. In the film the Hulk's origin is complicated by being tied to Bruce's mad scientist father who experimented on him when he was a little boy. Although one has to allow some latitude in comic-to-film translation these changes definitely slow the story down and make the origin less immediately gratifying. BUT it does offer a father/son conflict to the table.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: The positive aspects noted above make \\"Hulk\\" at least a 3/5 Star film. What I like best is the highly mature tone (Roger Ebert called it \\"a thinking man's superhero film\\") and the enthralling 22-minute rampage, which is worth the price of admission. But the changes in the origin story slow the film down and are presented in a generally convoluted way that lacks drive. Yet, at the same time, I appreciate the yin/yang extremes of the plot; it makes for a unique viewing experience.<br /><br />In any case, the 22-minute rampage that starts at the 92-minute mark is the Hulk to a 'T' and one of the most entertaining comic-action sequences in the history of film.<br /><br />Despite being based on a comic book (and TV show), \\"Hulk\\" is not a fast-food comic flick like, say, the 90's Batman films. This is an intelligent, well-crafted piece of cinematic art that just so happens to involve a rampaging green behemoth. At 138 minutes the film's a bit overlong, but that's okay. Just put on a pot of coffee (you're gonna need it, lol), kick back and enjoy the movie magic. This is what I just did and the film gave me a great time.<br /><br />I value the '03 and '08 versions equally, but I prefer the way the Hulk looks in this version; he's more realistic whereas the Hulk in the '08 version comes off overly cartooney, albeit grittier.<br /><br />GRADE: B+omic book (and TV show), \\"Hulk\\" is not a fast-food comic flick like, say, the 90's Batman films.

B00003CXC7|5.0|This is my second favorite Hitchcock movie and for one big reason - Jimmy Stewart!  Jimmy steals the scene and often it is just him on the screen, so it's a good thing.  Grace Kelly is heavenly, as always, as his girlfriend.  Jimmy Stewart plays L.B. Jeffries, a wheelchair bound photographer who spends his time spying on his neighbors from his apartment window when he begins to suspect one of them of murder.  This movie, with it's excellent cinematography (duh!  It's Hitchcock), shows you the world through Jimmy Stewart's eyes of the apartment complex.  Tension mounts as you see what Jimmy sees.  You find yourself asking the same question: Did the man really kill his wife?  Hitchcock takes you on a rollercoaster that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I have noticed that many TV shows throughout the years have used this movie premise as a TV episode (two that come to mind are ALF - remember ALF?! - and The Simpsons).  This is definitely a must-see Hitchcock movie and probably the best of the Jimmy Stewart/Hitchcock collaborations (although Vertigo was also great).
B000060OFT|5.0|This is my favorite film, seen it 14 times in theaters. It's a modern day masterpiece, the best love story available to purchase. Roger Ebert, along with most film critics misunderstood Baz Luhrmann's unique and faithful adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet. In comparison with Franco Zeffirelli's version this film rocks.
0446577383|1.0|Wow, where to begin.  First off, this book was sooo slow and boring that it took me a few weeks to even trudge through it.  Not like his other books at all.  Second, the characters were so under-developed, stereotypical, and cartoonish that it was just unbelievable.  Third, it was predictable in many different aspects (don't want to spoil anything but I will say that it was way too obvious as to what happened to Oliver's family and who was Oliver's family!).  Fourth, and this goes along with the first thing, in that the writing was just poor, like it was not edited or proofread.  The dialogue especially was bad.  Fifth, this is a very liberal book, with leftish political views that I don't agree with.  He is using a poor plot to satisfy other leftist people who have eaten up this book despite its major lack of substance.  Lastly, the ending of this book was so unbelievable and preposterous that I waiting for Oliver to wake up and realize that it had all been a dream.  In fact, I was hoping that I would wake up and realize it had been a dream, so I could have two and a half weeks back to my life!  For some truly good books, read Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series or anything by Grisham.  Oh and Tom Hemingway...was that guy for real?
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|OK, I'll admit it. I'm going to be 45 this coming Sunday (July 2) and was feeling a bit blue about it all ... until I heard Wolfmother. This stuff is Motherf**king killer! I'm playing air guitar while standing in front of the stereo, and it feels like the early 70's all over again. I've read all about how they \\"sound\\" like a combination of Sabbath, Zeppelin, Deep Purple, White Stripes, Tull, etc. Who cares! It really doesn't matter. These guys ROCK and the music is FUN! That's what it's all about in the final analysis, isn't it?. This music has been a great birthday present 'cuz it reaffirms that rock 'n roll is still alive and kicking in all its retro/modern glory. YAY!
0783225849|5.0|This is by far my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie of all time!  The acting is top-notch with Anthony Perkins perfectly protraying Norman Bates (a role that would forever typecast him) and Janet Leigh (Jamie Leigh Curtis' mom) as Marion Crane, whose shower scene screaming will forever be famous.  But there is so much more to this movie than memorable quotes and famous scenes.  Hitchcock slowly builds the suspense, and even though kills off the major character halfway through, spins us through a mystery of what exactly happened in the motel and what is going on inside the Bates' house as well.  The black and white of this movie adds to the tension and Hitchcock's camerawork is flawless.  Also, on a side note, this was the first movie of all time to show a toilet (movies before this would show a bathroom without a toilet - kinda funny!).  The minor characters do a great job in this movie as well, as the movie builds into the perfect ending.  This is a must-see for anyone who has never seen it, especially if you do not know the twist ending.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|I am a huge fan of the original toons from the good ol days of MTV. This movie has some decent eye candy, but misses the target when it comes to the feel of the pulp.
0440241588|4.0|I think with certain authors (Grisham, Stephen King, James Patterson), that people have such high expectations that when the author writes a \\"good\\" book, people see it as a bad book because it is not as good as an earlier book.  I have accepted, however, that Grisham will probably never write a book as good as \\"The Firm,\\" King will never write one as good as \\"The Stand\\" or \\"The Shining,\\" and Patterson will never write one as good as \\"Kiss The Girls.\\"  With that being said, these authors still write good, entertaining novels.  \\"The Broker\\" is no exception.  Although not as good as \\"The Firm\\" (ha ha), this book has all the elements for an entertaining (as well as educational) read.  Joel Blackman, is a character that you sort of like and hate at the same time.  You root for him, though, because you're supposed to, and you become involved with his new life.  I found the setting of Italy awesome and all the aspects of it made me want to go and visit it myself.  Now the Italian lessons do get a bit old after a while and I do agree that the ending just sort of ends without much conclusion or suspense.  However, the rest of the book and the conflicts make this an enjoyable read.  Grisham has a great gift so learn to embrace it and stop comparing each novel to previous ones.  Otherwise, you'll be disappointed with every book he writes again instead of enjoying all of the fun that he creates.
B000BNX3B4|2.0|1.Diane Lane 2.John Cusack 3.Christopher Plummer  4. Elizabeth Perkins  5.Dermot Mulroney  6.Stockard Channing  How can you blow it with a cast like this? <br /> <br />The story was flatline and subpar. I can handle a formulaic chick flick just fine but this has no hooks or engaging sequences. <br /> <br />The jokes are contrived. I kept waiting for the sitcom laugh track. Some of the sequeneces are down right emabarrassing ie the late night drive for the condom, 71 year old father inviting his internet conquests to holiday dinner, the ending, the whole thing. <br /> <br />I would hit this with one star but put another one on for Elizabeth Perkins who was the only one to add a little bit of wit to this dud.
0783240236|4.0|While this movie builds up nicely to the scenes where there are birds everyone, I have only one complaint.  I thought the movie ends kind of abruptly and without really any explanation as to WHY there were so many birds around and attacking.  But with that being said, the cinematography and acting in this movie are outstanding!  The scenes where the birds are \\"hanging out\\" is pretty creepy and the scene where they're attacking the children is actually kind of funny (some kids are getting bombarded and get knocked over!).  What's interesting with \\"The Birds\\" is that the actors aren't the usual \\"A\\" actors.  There is no Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, or anybody like that.  But it doesn't matter because the birds are the real stars!  I guess maybe the point of the movie is that we shouldn't find out why the birds are attacking and that's why it's scarier because the birds have just gone crazy for no reason.  Don't know.  Anyway, this movie is still worth seeing, although I liked Psycho, Rear Window, Vertigo, and Rebecca better.
B000FMGTTE|3.0|This is a fine Soundtrack, and there is a lot of respect from John Ottman to keep some of the original theme in the soundtrack, but it does not deliver enough of the familiar Superman sound.  <br />The familiar intro to let you know that Superman is on the way is there, but with less intensity, and it almost captures you in the moment and then it lets you down rather quickly. In my mind I could hear the rest of what should of been played, but the actual soundtrack was doing something different.  <br /> <br />If anyone reading this review is wondering if this compares to the Original Superman Score, it does not. I would not even classify this soundtrack in the same category.  <br />This is just a Soundtrack, that has a few familiar Superman music cues. Which some people may like.  <br />I feel like the Original Superman Soundtrack has memorable songs, and Superman Returns is just a soundtrack. I am not putting it down!  <br /> <br />It sort of reminds me of a whole bunch of soundtracks actually...Pieces of Robocop, Jurrasic Park, Edward Scissor Hands, Batman Returns, The Land Before Time(the dinosaur cartoon movie).  <br /> <br />So Bottom line,  <br />If you are a die-hard Superman fan you will want to buy this Soundtrack.  <br /> <br />If you are a die-hard Superman Original Movie(1978) fan, you will probably be a little disappointed with this Soundtrack, or totally disappointed....like me... I wanted to hear more variations of the Original 1978 Soundtrack. I really was hoping for a longer variation from The Kent Farm, Leaving Home, and Jonathan's Death from the Original 1978 Soundtrack, Oh and obviously more variation of the Original Superman March. <br /> <br /> <br />If you are just a Movie Soundtrack collector, this is a GREAT Soundtrack. There is alot of stuff going on in this Soundtrack. <br />After the 3rd song you will not even know that this is a Superman Soundtrack. Just a Good Soundtrack. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000F5GNX8|5.0|I'm not quite sure how to describe Kiss Kiss Bang Bang; it's not quite a crime drama, as it has plenty of great offbeat jokes, but it is no light comedy.  The film contains a good mystery plot revolving around two mysterious murders in Los Angeles.  And the characters that inhabit the world of the film are very off-kilter.  In fact, there is no one in the film that I can even label as a straight man. <br />Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a two-bit con from New York City.  One night after a heist-gone-bad, he stumbles into an audition while fleeing from the cops.  Despondent over the death of his partner, which he may have caused, he is handed a script for a detective movie in which the character he is reading for JUST WITNESSED HIS PARTNER'S DEATH AND MAY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR IT!  His emotional state allows him to give a heartfelt performance, and he is asked to come out to LA to get ready for the part. <br />Harmony Lane (Michelle Monaghan) is an ex-small town girl who came to LA to become a famous movie star.  Well, she did become famous, but for something very different (which I won't spoil).   <br />Perry (Val Kilmer) is a homosexual detective who is known around town as Gay Perry, and he is a no-nonsense PI in charge of giving detective lessons to the moronic Harry.  To say that he is less than thrilled to have to babysit the pathetic con man is an understatement.  However, things change when the three of them are inexplicably pulled into a murder plot involving Harmony's sister and the daughter of one of LA's most powerful men. <br />The film is narrated by Harry, but he takes on the job in a way very few before him have; he is self-aware as a narrator, and he often criticizes his narration style, kicking himself for omitting critical details, and actually \\"stopping\\" the film to go back and show us the scene in question.  At one point, he even yells at two people in the film who are obscuring something to get out of the way. <br />In addition to Harry's bizarre narration, a lot of the humor stems from Perry's constant insults towards Harry, which Kilmer always delivers in a delightful deadpan.  Also, there are numerous situations in the film that are just so strange that one can't help but laugh as they break the tension of the gritty plot (which is perfectly set against the grittier side of LA, though lately, that is the only side that is showcased in film and television nowadays). <br />I will say that the solution to the mystery is a little convoluted, but they go through it enough times to allow us to wrap our heads around it.  Overall, this film is very enjoyable, and while it may put some people off (at the end, they actually apologize to \\"all the nice people in the midwest\\" for using the f-word so much), it is worth checking out, if only to hear Downey's hilarious narration techniques.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|If there's one good thing that has come out of George W. Bush's presidency it is a wealth of politically and socially-minded art in response to his unpopular regime. Leading the charge, in Hollywood at least, is George Clooney who has positioned himself as a vocal liberal celebrity with two high profile movies in 2005: Good Night, and Good Luck and Syriana. The latter film was written and directed by Stephen Gaghan, who wrote the screenplay for Steven Soderbergh's Traffic, and was loosely based on Robert Baer's memoir of his days as a CIA operative in the Middle East, See No Evil.<br /><br />Structurally, Syriana follows the same template as Traffic with several subplots structured in a non-linear fashion but containing more layers and complexities.<br /><br />In the little screen time he has early on, Clooney does an excellent job showing the rusty compass that his character lives his life by. The actor has improved and refined himself with every subsequent role and relies more and more on what is going on behind his eyes than falling back on his good looks. His performance in Syriana goes beyond the obvious Method trappings - the weight gain and the thick beard - to his expressive eyes and how he uses them to convey Barnes' world-weariness.<br /><br />Gaghan's direction reflects the stories in the movie. Everything isn't spelled out. There are a lot of gray areas with morally and ethically ambiguous characters whose motivations aren't entirely clear. If, at times, it is hard to follow all of the characters in this film it is done on purpose to illustrate just how hard it is to keep track of all the players in the Middle East oil trade and their numerous alliances, both obvious and secretive, with corporations and governments. Trying to make sense of it all can be a confusing and frustrating experience.<br /><br />\\"A Conversation with George Clooney.\\" The actor feels that Syriana is designed like the films from the 1970s that examined geopolitics. He talks about Robert Baer, the man that his character is loosely based on, and what he learned from talking to him.<br /><br />\\"Make A Change, Make A Difference\\" isn't really a making of featurette but rather the cast talking about the subject matter of the movie. Clooney and Damon speak about their passion for the material and how they felt that here was a project that actually had something to say about how our world works.<br /><br />Also included are three deleted scenes that feature footage with Barnes and his wife (Greta Scacchi who does not appear in the final film). These are nice moments that showcase the strained relationship between the couple and reinforce the toll that his job is taking on them.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.about Robert Baer, the man that his character is loosely based on, and what he learned from talking to him. <br /> <br />\\"Make A Change, Make A Difference\\" isn't really a making of featurette but rather the cast talking about the subject matter of the movie.

B00003CWPL|5.0|This film is a gift to the audience. Heres the answers to your life and the reality of it. Heres the horror of life you ignore. Heres the pain you deny, heres the terror of your past. How does Lynch know? Well he's serving the audiences needs. He's not trying to make them happy, manipulate them. Show them computer cars or appeal to the urban demographic. Its you and him in constant communion.     As a side note while watching Eraserhead. I couldnt help but thinking to myself: that Raimi wholesale lifted effects and moods straight out of Eraserhead for Evil Dead. Its so obvious, Raimi could at least have tried to mask it a little, I cant believe he didnt find it a little embarassing to be so unoriginal.
B000062YAZ|5.0|To hear some of the teenagers and little cry babies give this a negative review says more about them than about RIB.  RIB is the best of the best.  Seriously, listen to Master of Puppets and then RIB.  The two don't even compare, slightly.  Slayer is in a whole other league.   <br /> <br />Look at the Big 4 and who is left standing???? <br /> <br />Metallica?  Please.  Crybabies need a $40,000/month shrink. <br /> <br />Megadeth?  Rust in Piece and Peace Sells were masterpieces, but where are they now???? <br /> <br />Anthrax?  Used to be amazing.  What have they done lately?   <br /> <br />Slayer?  The only one not to sellout, the only one not to go lamestream, the only one barely to get any radio or any MTV, the only one to continue to release real metal albums.   <br /> <br />Me personally, I prefer South of Heaven, but RIB is untouchable. <br /> <br />Anyone who tries to compare Slayer to Slipknot is a joke and simply has no context.  Slipknot has released three albums and barely can keep it together.  Slayer has been rocking since 83' for God's sake. <br /> <br />SSSSSSLLLLLLLAAAAAAAYYYYYYYEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0753819317|5.0|I really loved this book. I finished it a few hours ago and I'm still collecting my thoughts on it. No, it isn't perfect, but few books are flawless, and none of those would I rank among my favourites. This I would. A novel doesn't have to be 100% factually accurate (hell, even logical) for it to still have emotional power. The Shadow of the Wind really resonated with me. Zafon writes so well, I understand now the hype surrounding him. His prose crackles and flows like tears of joy. The characters in this book are unique and you can't help but feel sympathetic toward them, even the uber-villain Fumero you feel a bit sorry for him when you read about his childhood. The main characters (Julian and Daniel) are full of silliness, and are so human. Nuria's account of her experiences with Carrax I couldn't put down. Fermin just steals the show. The plot is dense and engrossing, full of twists I didn't see coming. And there is so much atmosphere in this book, the scenes Zafon describes you would swear you could smell it. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a fat, juicy novel to sink their teeth into and escape from the world on their weekend off. Bloody brilliant.
B000002H5I|5.0|How can i forget hearing Tracy Chapman in class during high school with my walkman. Her voice is really a trade mark voice. I bet you wont be able to hear a voice like hers. Its the same case as Tanita Tikaram. I have all Chapmans cds BUT this one is my favorite.
B00000253N|4.0|Ok, tangled up in blue and idiot wind are two of his best songs ever, but theres no like a rolling stone, no sad eyed lady of the low lands.Blonde on bloonde for me is a much more upbeat, superior album, his lyrics though here, are at all time best, you actually start hating Sarah yourself, though she did inspire some of the greatest songs ever by the greatest songwriter ever {after John Lennon}
0440539811|5.0|What this book tries to do in 800 pages is to teach you that thinking for yourself is not necessarily beleiving in far out theories or submitting to obscure, esoteric thought but to draw your own conclusions in any situation. This is an acid trip of a book and sometimes is presented in such a way as to mess with your mind, but done so in a sense to challenge your perception of what books traditionally are and what they can be. It has a good amount of pull to draw you in as it is strange and imaginative and the pace never lets up. You don't necessarily have to be interested in conspiracy theories to like this book. It simply challenges your worldview such as the statement that follows: \\"Suppoe society crippled infants' legs instead of their minds, those that tried to walk would be the neurotics.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|Wonderful movie, great for the whole family, even my 9 year old son was really into it.  Captures the essence of how John Paul II transformed the world with love and understanding. <br />I strongly recommend this movie, may need some paper tissue. <br />
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I was really disappointed with Keira Knightley's performance here. Where's the extreme intelligence of Elizabeth Bennet? She giggled too much and failed to portray the other important aspects of her character. <br /> <br />As for the ending, it was just too much. Excessive romanticism for a Jane Austen novel. Pride and Prejudice is not a Harlequin romance.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|If you love the original Star Wars trilogy as much as me, it is time to send a loud and clear message to Lucas that you will not endorse a subpar, inferior product.  Do not get too excited when you pop this DVD into your player to watch on a widescreen TV.  The 1977 version will appear as a tiny, low-resolution image.  It is a non-anamorphic transfer (which in 2006 is NOT an industry standard), so it is NOT enhanced for 16x9 viewing.  Get ready to enjoy Star Wars like you never have before - as if you were watching it through a mail slot!!! <br /> <br />Boycott this DVD until Lucasfilm acknowledges and corrects this.  This trilogy's most loyal fans deserve better.
B000EMGJM2|5.0|Sophomore album is phenomenal, when I first ran through the CD, I thought I was going to be disappointed because it was clearly different from the first CD.  When I got a chance to listen to the entire CD, I love every bit of it.  It's not the same music as the first CD and it shouldn't be.  Anyone who listen to this CD and felt any disappointment, listen to it again, matter of fact, listen to this CD when you have some quiet time and can truly enjoy the lyrics and the music, then come back on this site and update your review, I guarantee you , your opinion will change.  I truly hope Van Hunt continues with his style of music, he refuses to be locked into a genre ,I hear jazz, blues, rock, soul, neo soul, you name it.. it's in his music.  You listen to his 1st CD and this one and realize you can't even imagine what was going through his mind when he wrote these songs, they sound like the words and music of a mad man, yet a genius.
B0009AK57Y|5.0|It's not a retcon, or a reimagination, or a franchise revitalization, or any of the franchise buzzowords that sci-fi franchise fanboys tinker with - instead, it's a new \\"Dr. Who\\" that captures the spirit of the original while knowing when to go its own way.  Unlike the original show, structured around serials of 4-6 episodes, the new show has whole hour-long episodes arranged in loose arcs.  Some of the basic story ideas are unoriginal, or too thin to otherwise work, but nifty scripts and an unspeakably irresistable chemistry between Christopher Eccleston & Billie Piper provide more than enough entertainment to punch a whole through the space-time continuum.  The beauty of the show is that it's pefect for old-school Whovians and those who never knew what the show was about.  The scripts rely on deft dialog to establish the premise of the show - and not the leaden expository narrative that you'd get on any of the Trek slin-offs - creating a backstory far richer than that other franchise could have boldly gone forward to imagine.   <br /> <br />In the first series, we meet the new Doctor (there are signs that this is a new regeneration) as he tours 21st century London; we also meet Rose Tyler, a working class girl who unknowingly stumbles upon an alien menace bent on world conquest.  Over the course of the first season, the Doctor will face off against new breeds of aliens and other way-out creatures in Earth present & past, with jaunts to far off worlds.  The episodes embody comedy and drama in the right measure - they compliment the original series without condescending to it; besides the main characters, the scripts work up guest characters - villains and heroes: from Charles Dickens to the Prime Minister of 21st Century England; From the London Blitz to the end of the World; from enemies we've never seen before to the appearance of...well, Whovians can figure it from there.  The show excels mostly because you never know where it's going, so it's always a surprise.
B00005JKO9|5.0|I thought this film was extraordinary.  The story is based on a true story of a famous reporter and poet, Jack Reed who recorded this historical event in his best-known book TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD.  The story of the Russian Revolution against the terribly corrupt monarchy and aristocracy and the US right wing suspicious disapproval of it.    The cast is excellent.  Warren Beatty who wrote the film and starred and directed it also included Jack Nicholson and  Diane Keaten who played the role of Beatty's wife, Louise Bryant.  Filled with adventure, history, and romance incorporated into a  revolution that occurred in Russia and in some respects in the US. Since the film was not allowed to be filmed in Russia it was filmed in many, many different countries, from Spain to Finland and some scenes in the US.      Since I watched the film the first time, I've watched it a few more times.  I've come to the conclusion that it should have won Best Picture over Chariots of Fire, which I didn't really care for, but was still a favorite of the movie goers.  But still Ten Days did win 10 awards including best Director, Warren Beatty and several other awards.  I still find it one of the best movies, perhaps the best movie I ever saw, with a cast \\"par excellence\\", and I've seen lots of films and own hundreds and hundreds of DVD's.  This is still the best of all.       The movie won Academy Awards for the following:[10]        * Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Maureen Stapleton playing Emma Goldman)      * Best Cinematography (Vittorio Storaro)      * Best Director (Warren Beatty)    The film received the following nominations:        * Best Actor in a Leading Role (Warren Beatty)      * Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Jack Nicholson)      * Best Actress in a Leading Role (Diane Keaton)      * Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Richard Sylbert, Michael Seirton)      * Best Costume Design      * Best Film Editing      * Best Picture      * Best Sound      * Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.[11]    To date, Reds is the last film to ever receive Academy Award nominations in all four acting categories.    The movie currently holds a high rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes, scoring at 94%. The review stated that, \\"At a time when Ronald Reagan had just become the president of the United States, Beatty's sympathetic portrait of notorious American communist John Reed seemed even more daring. Yet, as it continues to age, the film only continues to grow in relevance, assuring its rightful place at the top of the Hollywood canon.  I wonder if anybody remember Chariots of Fire.
B000F1IQNM|3.0|Colin Firth plays Cedric Brown, the father of seven boisterous and slightly out of control children whose sole mission in life is to get rid of the endless string of nannies that their father tries to bring in to train them.  After the recent death of their mother, the children--led by the clever and devious Simon, are sure that their father will remarry an evil stepmother who will treat them badly and further alienate them from the sole parent they have left.  In order to avoid this occurrence, and entertain themselves in the process, they think up any number of methods to terrorize each person who comes in to try to bring order to their wayward lives.  After the resignation of the 17th nanny, the agency that Mr. Brown uses \\"Nannies of Distinction\\" refuses to send him another.  A whisper in the air tells Mr. Brown \\"what you need is Nanny McPhee.\\" Fortunately for Mr. Brown, nothing could be closer to the truth.<br /><br />Nanny McPhee brings a bit of magic along with a lot of order when she appears in the Brown household.  Her mission is simple: teach the children five lessons and ensure that she is no longer needed.  She tells Simon, \\"When you need me but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me and no longer need me, then I have to go.\\"  She teaches the children to say please and thank you, to go to bed, wake up, and get dressed when their told, to listen, and to love.<br /><br />A bit of a fairy tale, the magic interspersed throughout Nanny McPhee made it charming and cute.  It's not a new tale to have boisterous children in need of control brought to heel by a firm nanny, but the magical elements and transformation of Nanny McPhee from a witchlike hag to a beautiful governess add an unexpected twist.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to parents, children, or anyone in the mood for a bit of fantasy.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I've always been a big fan of music from the British part of the world.  Among my favorite music acts of all time come three standouts from that part of the world: Sade, The Brand New Heavies, and Jamiroquai.  So naturally, when I heard about Corinne Bailey Rae, I had to get the album.  However, when I got the album, I didn't listen to it right away.  Upon picking a song at random and listening to it, I wasn't, admittedly, that impressed.  She reminded me, vocally, of a raspy Erykah Badu.  Amel Larrieux also came to mind.  However, as I listened to a few more songs (I have a tendency to \\"spot-listen\\"--as I write this review I haven't even listened to all the songs on the album.  I'm rating it five stars because three of the songs I HAVE heard make the album for me), her voice and the content grew on me.  She's different enough to stand in her own right without being compared to other, \\"similar\\" artists.  \\"Call Me When You Get This\\" is just fabulous.  \\"Put Your Records On\\" is also great.  But what sold me on Ms. Bailey Rae is the ballad \\"Breathless.\\"  Between the lyrics, the beat, and the vocal delivery, it's one of my favorite songs of all time by ANY artist, period and hands down, and certainly that, alone, is worth five stars.  I can't wait to hear the rest of the songs on the album, and I look forward to the future, when, hopefully, she will release another wonderful set of songs.
0920668372|5.0|\\"Love You Forever\\", while a children's book, might perhaps exert the greatest emotional impact on adults, whether or not we are parents. Although many mothers have responded from the maternal perspective, the other obvious perspective is that of any child (i.e. you and me) - boy or girl - and the realization of the profound meaningfulness of unconditional love from one's mother, facilitated by the prospect of being able to return that level of caring in later years. As a man, I tend to imagine myself as the male in the story. Although I do have a 14-yo daughter, for me the most moving aspect, as stated above, is the anticipation (and for many, perhaps the re-enactment) of the passing of one's mother, which I believe many women respond to as well, assuming they also tend to place themselves in the role as child. <br /> <br />I'd like to quote from two pre-2000 Amazon reviews of this book: <br /> <br />\\"This book is just plain touching. How can a man put into words what only a Mom can understand?\\" <br /> <br />Again, the irony here, in my opinion, is that men should be exceedingly capable of being moved by this story, whether or not they have children of their own. It may be of interest to examine whether women and men tend to assume differential roles in this story when they read it (e.g., perhaps women react most often as the mother, whereas men respond most commonly as the child). <br /> <br />Second: <br /> <br />\\"I had Robert Munsch on my radio show and interviewed him about the book. The book was written to honor the 2 still births that his wife had in two years. In fact the book is dedicated to these two babies. When I asked him about the mother going across town with a ladder to see her son, he explained that it should not be taken literally but rather figuratively that a mother will always be there for love WHENEVER! Mr Munsch read the book on the air and we had a bank of 5 callers waiting to talk to him. None of them could because they were all in tears.\\" <br /> <br />This tends to answer two questions. First, and quite presumably, the book was written primarily with the perspective of the mother in mind. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt as to the dual basis or motivation underlying Munsch's desire to write and publish this piece. Surely he was responding to emotions in the context of his relationship with his mother as well. Second, Munsch addresses the critical discrepancy between literal and figurative. In my opinion, the few negative reviews of this little book (note also the oddity that >80% of reviews are 5-star, &lt;20% are 1-star, with essentially nothing in between) failed to appreciate this important nuance.
B0000DG00B|4.0|OK I do not know very much about the Allman Brothers but they really play excellent blues-based rock. Some of the songs are excellent. The sound is a bit murky in my opinion but that is due to the technique used at the time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly had something very special, which has been attended to far more effectively in the reviews that have preceeded my own. If you're trying to decide whether to buy the DVD's or not - then of course you should. (They're rated 5 stars after 2500 user reviews...)    In a nutshell: Fantastic acting, witty screenwriting, involving plotlines, complex characters and relationships (erm, except for Jane that is) and above all else an immensly likeable hero and crew.    The show was pure quality. Bring it back Fox, or sell the rights to someone who's happy to give the audience something they want to watch for a change.
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|When \\"Star Trek: First Contact\\" was released to huge box office numbers, it was evident to Paramount Pictures that audiences were still extremely interested in this franchise, and were responding very well to the new crew.  So, wasting little time Paramount greenlit the 8th sequel in the franchises history, \\"Star Trek:  Insurrection\\", but this 'Star Trek' movie would be of a different mold than previous installments, and would that spell fortune or disaster for this lucrative franchise? <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek:  Insurrection\\" begins with the crew of the Enterprise-E being notified by Starfleet that their android comrade, Data (Brent Spiner), while on a research mission has gone rogue.  Picard (Patrick Stewart) convinces Starfleet to let him and the rest of the crew of the Enterprise-E be the ones to bring Data in before someone gets seriously hurt.  When the crew arrives to confront Data, they discover that all is not as it seemed, and though Starfleet is indeed conducting research on this strange planet that holds the key to immortality, they are also planning something much more dastardly.  Starfleet, in association with an alien race, are planning to remove the people that inhabit this planet so that they may plunder the planet's resources for the \\"benefit of mankind\\", what they fail to mention, or realize is that by removing these people, their bodies will begin to age rapidly to catch up with the amount of years they have been alive, which could mean death for many.  With orders from Starfleet demanding the Enterprise leave the planet immediately, and their own consciences telling them to stay and defend these people, the crew must decide on which side they will stand.  Let the insurrection begin! <br /> <br />I thought that this film was another great installment into the 'Star Trek' franchise, though I feel it is weaker than say \\"Star Trek:  First Contact\\", it was still a very entertaining film.  I know that some fans were unhappy with this particular outing,feeling that it was too romantic and funny, with not enough sci-fi action for their taste.  I personally enjoyed the change in pace that this film gave to the series, after such an extremely action-heavy film with \\"Star Trek:  First Contact\\", the next movie needed to slow things down a bit, or else run the risk of being judged as having not enough story and too much action in the series.  Basically, it was a no-win situation, and I think Paramount and the creative forces behind this film made the right decision in terms of what was best for the franchise as a whole. <br /> <br />The actors all did wonderful jobs with their individual character arcs in this film, and this is where much of the movie's humor stems from, because each character begins to feel the effects of the planet making them younger, many funny moments come from Worf (Michael Dorn) going through a 2nd Klingon puberty, and another from Data overhearing a comment made by Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) to Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) regarding their breasts becoming firmer.  However, humorous this all is, there is still some heavy dramatic beats when the crew realizes what will happen to the people of this planet if Starfleet has its way, and all the youthful enhancements they are experiencing pale in comparison to the pain this people will soon endure.  Jonathan Frakes (who directed and starred in the film) does an excellent job leading his co-stars, his talent for direction is very well-honed, and he handles the more romantic story in a very cool way by having many of the camera movements be more lyrical, almost like the camera is dancing with the actors in the scene, a choice that heightens the mood of the movie even more. <br /> <br />Overall, this entry into the 'Star Trek' franchise, though not the strongest, is still very solid, and definitely worth owning.  Don't listen to the critics that hated this movie, if you're a fan of 'Star Trek' then watch this movie, you will be entertained. <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek:  Insurrection\\" is rated PG for violence.
B000F6IOBQ|5.0|There is no doubt in my mind that this is not as good as the first but this one has sertin parts that are better. Marcaus looks ausome the fighting has been kicked up a noch and Kate Beckinsale finally takes her clothes off. Evolution is much more grusome and gorey than the first and has alot more language and sex. if you want a cool movie with alot of gore this is for you. if you want a cool movie with barly any gore than i strongly recomend Underworld 1. I am hoping they make an extended unrated Underworld 2 beacuse the extend Underworld 1 had alot more in it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I won't even go into detail about the brilliant album packaging, which is worth the full price in and of itself (Check it out - you'll see). Musically, however, this is Tool's strongest entry yet. Layers upon layers of musical and emotional depth - this is probably their most profound and personal album to date. Maynard's voice is richer than ever, the musicianship is impeccable - it's almost like 2 or 3 brilliant concept albums squeezed into one disc. I can't imagine any true Tool fan being disappointed.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|This has got to be the best movie ever. the acting is amazing, the combat is crazy, the lycans, vampires, and hybrids look super real and Kate Beckinsale is the hottist woman alive.

B00031TXBI|5.0|This album sucks me in and spits me out having gained and lost something. The lyrics snatch my attention in all his songs as they do here. Great to play and sing on guitar, A Firm Kick's chorus is so simple, melancholic yet uplifting, quite a dichotomy! If I didnt steal this from a friend I would have bought it already.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I am surprised that such anime genre bring up CC which is very rare in that type of genre. I loved the picture and it is very stunning graphic. This movie is good for fans who played the game Final Fantasy 7. It bring some of fond memories. You will get to see all characters, but not all will have a lot roles played in. The movie is all about Cloud.  <br /> <br />Bonus Features is subtitled but not CC so it may be hard from time to time to see who was talking. <br /> <br />But other than that, I am happy to have it in my collection.
B0007P0LO8|2.0|I have a large collection of opera dvds.  Many people only prefer to purchase staged versions, but I don't mind movie versions as well.  They give you an entirely new prospective to the story...if its done well.  This production of Butterfly is one of the worst productions of ANYTHING that I have ever seen.  Once you see the opening scene, when Domingo begins running through a random field, you should brace yourself, because it only goes downhill from there. The singing is quite good, but the cinematography and the staging is absolutely attrocious.  The camera angles are just bad and the sequence from Act 2 to Act 3 (which is all done as one act in this production) looks very, very, STUPID.  The best part of this production is Butterfly's death, which leaves Pinkerton in a state of...well, you just have to see it.  That is the only promising piece of staging in the whole production.  If you want to save some money, I would not suggest buying this production unless you want to get a couple of opera friends together, and have a nice laugh...
B00005JLF5|5.0|You can do no wrong if you purchase any of the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine DVD sets. And it's always good to start with Season One, so you can know how it all got started. This show, in my opinion, was the best of all the Star Trek series that were developed, including The Next Generation.<br /><br />Emissary, Parts I & II<br /><br />Where it all began... We learn how Benjamin Sisko and his son, Jake get assigned to DS9. And why, initially Sisko disliked Capt. Picard immensely. On an interesting side note, this is one of only 2 references the show makes to the Borg, The Next Generation's greatest villains. In one of the early DS9 novels, it is explained that interference from the nearby wormhole can destroy the Borg vessels and the Borg, therefore, steer clear from the Bajoran sector.<br /><br />Past Prologue<br /><br />This episode focuses on Kira being forced to face her allegience to Bajor and her duties on DS9. Appearance by Lursa and B'Etor, the Klingon sisters who continue in their quest to take over the Klingon Empire.<br /><br />A Man Alone<br /><br />Odo is implicated in the murder of a questionable Bajoran.<br /><br />Babel<br /><br />A mysterious illness befalls the population on DS9 and all signs at first point to the Cardassians as being the culprits but the origin may be closer to home.<br /><br />Captive Pursuit<br /><br />O'Brien befriends the alien Tosk as he is involved in a cat-and-mouse game with alien hunters from the other side of the wormhole. From a conversation between O'Brien and the alien, you get a very small glimpse of a possible hostile presence on the other side of wormhole. That presence, the Dominion, will dominate the show's major storylines from the end of Season 2 through the series' end.<br /><br />Q-Less<br /><br />Q and Vash visit DS9. Their appearance coincides with a mysterious force that wreaks havoc on the station. But is it a coincidence, or do the new visitors have something to do with it? Only appearance of Q in the entire series.<br /><br />Dax<br /><br />Curzon Dax, Jadzia's former Trill identity, is accused of murder.

The first of several episodes that focus on the Ferengi, the race that was originally created on to be the principle villains on Season of The Next Generation. They did not go over too well in that role, so the writers later came up with the Borg concept.<br /><br />Vortex<br /><br />An alien criminal from the other side of the wormhole tempts Odo by telling the shape-shifter he can put the changeling in contact with others like himself.<br /><br />Battle Lines<br /><br />Sisko, Kira, and Bashir are stranded on a war-torn world where it is impossible for the combatants to die.

B000CSUUKU|5.0|The album is kicked off by one of the band's biggest hits, Speed King and it sounds as great as ever. A TRUE CLASSIC! The second track, Bloodsucker, is a classic metal-style rocker, one of my favorites. Next is Child In Time, a ten-minute epic and fan fave, featuring Ian Gillan (Christ in the Jesus Christ Superstar), what soaring vocals and what amazing screams. Next, Flight Of The Rat (track 4) is the finest song on the album, and I'm sure many other fans will agree. Then there is the groovy, Into The Fire, an excellent composition. This is classic seventies hard rock as it was meant to be heard! Track 6, Living Wreck, takes the sound the band used with previous albums, and updates it with more distortion and Gillan's vocals. The album is closed out with Hard Lovin' Man. This is excellent, fast-paced classic hard rock/heavy metal.<br /><br />All in all, Deep Purple In Rock is a perfect ROCK album, a classic hard rock masterpiece. Perhaps today, IN ROCK is just too heavy for Classic Rock stations to play here in the States. What a shame! Jon Lord is simply fantastic on Organ. Ritchie Blackmore is a timeless guitar hero. Both of these guys have magical fingers. Don't forget Roger Glover (Bass) and Ian Paice (Drums) keeping it all together. Throughout the album all the members (Gillan included) give their best and heaviest performances, creating in my humble opinion the first true heavy metal album.<br /><br />What more is there to say? In Rock retains the magic after all these years. If you're a fan of classic hard rock, Deep Purple In Rock is an album that must be added to your collection. Heavy metal doesn't get much earlier or heavier than this. One of the best hard rock album ever! Once again, this album has a lot of classics and is highly recommended!
B000AP04OM|5.0|I first saw The Sound of Music when I was a child, and I have been in love with it ever since! Maria, the sisters of the Convent and the Von Trapp family captured my heart with their melodious songs and their real life behaviour. This film is truly a classic and one that I still watch today and will probably continue watching with my grandchildren. <br /> <br />The story appeals to people of all ages and the songs and the lyrics charm the children and parents alike, while the subtle messages to both parents and adolescents are present. Every teenage girl will feel like Liesl whose father doesnt want her to have a boyfriend at the age of sixteen. All the little children will feel like Gretel who wants to be noticed and treated as an adult even though she is only five. Fathers will relate to the Captain as they see how he struggles to show he cares to his children even though he is being eaten up by the loss of his wife and his fear of his children being spoilt. And which woman doesnt relate to Maria? We all know that at a point in our lives, we dont know what we are truly in this world to do, but the older ones always tell us that somehow, everything will work out fine.  <br /> <br />This is an educational, inspirational and entertaining movie that I believe will be around for many more years. The message here is that life is not as settled as people think. This story is based on the real life story of the Von Trapp family who ended up having to run away from Austria because of the Nazi's and Maria Von Trapp actually played a very big part in the directing of the movie. It is said that the director even found her to be too meddling at times as she wanted to movie to portray her family that she loved so much. The film was shot in Austria and a lot was done to recreate the time frame of the story and the reality of the characters. Julie Andrews and Chritopher Plummer are fabulous in their roles as Maria and Captain Von Trapp. The songs in the movie are popular to date.How many people have not heard someone singing \\"The hills are alive, with the Sound of Music\\" or \\"My Favorite Things.\\" The latter was even redone by a British pop group and was a number 1 hit. I recommend it to all who have thought of seeing it! It is truly a joyful and memorable experience!
B000028U0Y|5.0|I'm not a Cash fan, but I purchased this after seeing the movie, \\"Walk the Line\\".  An amazing performance that shows the \\"realness\\" of Johnny Cash.  He was his own man and this CD shows it.

B000BBOUU4|2.0|I didn't rate it one star, because honestly (and upsettingly), I've seen worse.    However, I'm afraid I have to offer you some age-old wisdom:  If a remake comes out, just watch the original if you want to be reminded of it.    To me, casting Johnny Depp where Gene Wilder once was is raw and uncut sacrilege. Anything such as that, which would even suggest Depp=Wilder, is an immediate contrast of common sense.    I think Tim Burton would probably be better off shooting himself before he has the opportunity to destroy his own work as well.
B000ENWKN8|1.0|I didn't care for this album. If I had taken the time to read more of the reviews here, I probably would have never purchased this one.  I never realized this was or was not supposed to be a \\"metal\\" album, but aside from a couple (literally) of choruses, there's no classic Rob Zombie scream/growls; for the most part, anything resembling a scream or growl sounded neutered and sedated. Not one song on here got me \\"pumped\\" the slightest bit.  <br /> <br />Reading the lyrics, you would think this album would be full of energy, but it just sounds like a complacent contractual \\"filler\\" album. <br /> <br /> <br />I 'm a fan of many different types of music, not just some metalhead, and I find myself unable to put this CD back into any of my players for any reason. I can't think of any mood I would be in that would make me [i] want [/i] to listen to this album again. <br /> <br />Shari Moon, is starting to remind me of a much, much, sexier Yoko Ono. If this album is the \\"new and improved\\" Rob Zombie, and not some \\"experimental sound\\" type of album, or even a \\"get off my back, here's a new one\\" I'm afraid this will be the last one I purchase from Mr. Zombie.  <br /> <br />I'm happy for him that he was able to find someone that makes him so happy, but please, please put some anger back into the music.
1400079276|3.0|I'm not sure what to make of this novel. Murakami's a favorite of several friends of mine whose opinions I respect. Perhaps I should have heeded one friend's advice and read THE WIND-UP BIRD CHRONICLE as my introduction to Murakami.<br /><br /> KAFKA ON THE SHORE follows two basic plotlines. The first is of a 15-year-old runaway, Kafka Tamura, who finds a home and an education in a small-town library. The second is of an elderly man, Nakata, who lost his memory and his ability to read in a strange, X-files-esque wartime incident when he was a young boy. He lives on government subsidy and supplements his living finding runaway cats. He's uniquely suited for this job because he has the ability to talk to cats.<br /><br /> It gets stranger from there. Characters from modern marketing, a transsexual, an indestructible worm blob creature, and a former pop music icon turned librarian populate what is one of the more bizarre novels I've read in awhile. I don't know enough about Japanese or experimental literature to know to which tradition KAFKA owes its lack of closure. I don't mind that so much as I mind the ever-changing rules of the story, or at least the unclear rules of the story. The randomness of things is fine, but it's hard to feel a sense of tension when things happen and the reader doesn't know if those things are good or bad. Am I supposed to be afraid? Amazed? Happy? Sad?<br /><br /> I certainly found the book interesting and kept reading if for nothing else to find out what insane thing happened next. High marks for originality, but I needed a better understanding of what was going on, or why things were going on, to be fully drawn into the story and care about the characters.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Ok . . . Metropolis isn't in the cards for awhile yet for a young Clark Kent.  With Smallville comparisons to Buffy seem almost inevitable to me.  Both shows sport almost invulnerable main characters with a variety of super-human abilities.  Both rely on a core cast of close friends.  Both main characters have older-mentors they blow off half of the time and then regret not listening to in the first place.  And finally, both have serious romantic issues-and this is where our heroes part ways.  Buffy's issues get resolved with very dark consequences where everyone around her is affected in a permanent manner.  With Clark Kent, however, there is this  butterfly-like dance of relationships that he has with various friends over the course of each season that involves him avoiding any serious commitment, and in the end remaining in a kind of emotional limbo with his close friends and loved ones.  More importantly, the friends, especially Chloe and Lana are like emotional yo-yos wildly flitting from jealousy to weepy love, to grim-faced resolve to be their own girl and blow Clark off once and for all.  The big question is what, if anything does this do for the series?  For the first season these issues can and should easily be forgiven as any series needs time to find its footing.  All niggling aside, the good easily outweighs the bad in the first season.  The acting from the leads is rock-solid.  Tom Welling is charming as the young Clark Kent without being too cocky and arrogant.  Kristin Kreuk and Alison Mack may take some getting used to as Clark's respective potential love interests, Lana Lane and Chloe, as they are not given much room by the writers to grow and develop very much this season.  John Schneider (you know him as Bo Duke) and Annette O'Toole provide a convincing balance between moral sternness and flexibility that still gives Clark enough freedom to be the typical teen.  My favorite is Michael Rosenbaum's portrayal of an almost tragic Lex Luthor who constantly tries to do the right thing, but is mired down by his evil corporate family reputation.  The basic premise of the season is that Clark has to come to terms with the fact he is quite different from everyone around him while at the same time coming to the aid of everyone who got, and is still being affected and transformed by the meteor rock that smashed into Smallville on the day of Clark's arrival to earth.  Although there is no story-arc or Big Bad that the viewer may have become accustomed to from the Buffy and X-Files shows, the episodes have an intriguing monster-of-the-week format; intriguing because the kids affected and transformed by the meteor rocks are not always clearly cut from the psychotic cloth (I think only one of the villains actually foams at the mouth at some point).  Highlights include, \\"Pilot\\" where Clark becomes the Smallville scarecrow of ridicule for the football season; \\"Shimmer\\" where this meek girl who has a crush on Lex supposedly can turn herself invisible; and \\"Tempest\\" where Clark, Lana, and Chloe's emotional love triangle gets resolved, or at least allowed to go into extra innings.  The DVD extras are featurettes that introduce Smallville the town.  My favorite was the interactive map.  There are deleted scenes which are pretty nice.  All in all, a good potential for greatness. <br />
B0009JAENU|5.0|Mozart: Violin Sonatas K. 301, 304, 376 & 526~ Hilary Hahn is a splendid recoding of some of Mozarts Violin Sonatas. Ms Hahn is a very beautifull and accomplished violinist that certainly plays with such skill and prowess that is worthy of Mozart and his stupendous compositions. Ms Zhu is no second fiddle here and her piano playing skill is amazing in its own right. Anyone whom has read my prior reviews knows that I love Mozart and rank him alongst with Bach, Wagner and Beethoven as the best composers ever. Mozarts music speaks directly to ones soul and ones inner senses that few composers are able to do. The book-let is a great piece of work and the beautifull photos of a serene and pensive looking Ms Hahn are so beautifull and the foreword is very well written indeed. I highly recommend this album to lovers of Mozart and to lovers of great music in general. This astounding album will not disapoint in any way, 5 out of 5 stars.

B00005JOQS|5.0|After nearly twenty years, Superman returns triumphantly to the screen to save the day of both the moviegoer and the theater owners looking for golden entertainment. It might not hurt the studio producers too, but let's keep them out of this. Supes is back and there is popcorn to be made.<br /><br /> Director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men) takes a dusty, beat up franchise and literally sinks his teeth into it. This has class written all over it and much like the director's previous work, this is really no surprise. It's a blessing in disguise.<br /><br /> After last year's schizophrenic Batman Begins and this year's laughable at most X-Men 3: The Last Stand, Superman Returns fails to follow suit. This is a film that takes all that was great in comic book filmmaking and just stains the screen with it. This is a film that knows what it wants to do and simply does it.<br /><br /> More than anything, this is a film.<br /><br /> Brandon Routh deliciously portrays Clark Kent/Superman as he awkwardly returns to his second home, planet Earth. There he finds that the world is in turmoil yet `getting by' without him. His greatest friends have long forgotten him while the love of his intergalactic life has moved on, now with a child and a husband to boot. Technically speaking, his return is without merit.<br /><br /> However, things seem to change for the worst when Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) also has his share in the homecoming. After evading a double life sentence, Luthor has plans for global domination--literally. He visits Superman's fortress, steals the invaluable alien crystals, and discovers a magnificent hidden truth inside that is damaging to both Superman and the world.<br /><br /> So in the end, yeah, the world starts the Superman hype again.<br /><br /> Taking on the heroic role of revitalizing the series, director Singer picks up the franchise where Richard Donner and Richard Lester's previous work respectively left off. This means ignoring the ill fortuned Superman III and IV, both films becoming too reliant on the gimmick rather than the story.<br /><br /> Everything here is back to the basics plus one.<br /><br /> Returns sports the same original theme conceived by John Williams, this time Singer's favorite composer John Ottman takes the reigns. By the time the theme picks up pace and the blue retro-terrific titles fly past the screen, you might want to pinch your arm and remind yourself that this is still 2006 and not 1978.<br /><br /> Effects aside, the film retains the magic and aura of the original entry with newcomer Brandon Routh filling in and gracefully replacing the late Christopher Reeve's tights and boots. He is enigmatic, spunky, and fortunately for the role of Clark Kent he is unbearably clumsy. Routh is Superman, delivering lines like \\"Good night, Lois\\" as if they're straight from the audio files that have collected dust for over twenty years now.<br /><br /> Supporting Routh at his side are Kate Bosworth as the ill-tempered journalist Lois Lane and the energetic and screen stealing Kevin Spacey who looks to be having just the right amount of fun as the arch nemesis Luthor. For Bosworth, this role is a long stretch from the surfer hey-day she came from nearly four years ago but she nails it with the right expressions and a perfect pitch.<br /><br /> Even Margot Kidder should be proud...<br /><br /> Spacey, on the other hand, portrays Lex Luthor as he should be. This is of course the same role originally staged by Gene Hackman. Yet instead of the forcibly awkward casting of Hackman, Spacey takes the character and soars to heights that might rival that of the caped crusader.<br /><br /> Gene Hackman might bite his lip at this one.<br /><br /> The film clocks in at two and a half hours which might welcome or daunt the audiences for the next coming month. Considering modern epics of the likes of King Kong or The Lord of the Rings series sport running times of three to four hours, it might be safe to saythat moviegoers should be more than happy.<br /><br /> A longer running time allows the film to stretch, to explore, and to expand the storyline that might otherwise be constricted in anything shorter. Singer even takes a cue from director Peter Jackson's work by upping the characterization and organizing outlandish, superior action sequences over breathtaking settings.<br /><br /> It's times when the almighty caped one struggles that the film really shines. Never once do the action sequences seem overly done or outwardly jutting from the storyline. The thing works and blends so smoothly that there's no fruit to be left at the bottom.<br /><br /> The dialogue is snappy, the chemistry is modern science, and the effects succeed on a level of believability and boyhood wonder. This is a film for everyone that wants a film for themselves. For those looking for a hero that they'd rather look up to than relate to, Superman Returns delivers the package right on time.<br /><br /> It just might have taken twenty years and counting in the process.and to expand the storyline that might otherwise be constricted in anything shorter.

1594200823|5.0|Michael Pollan's conversational style of writing immediately drew me into the story.  I found myself nodding and commenting as though he was in the room with me on more than a few occasions.  And while I'd seen, read and heard snatches of the subject matter in the past... Nothing else has brought to the fore the stunning truth of the lessening of the human capacity for compassion in the name of economics.  Would it really hurt the average american to pay 50¢ more for a dozen eggs if it meant that they could be produced more humanely and nutritiously?  If we could actually afford LESS food... Maybe there wouldn't be such a problem with obesity.  Anyway... I found the book to be a real eye opener and even though I doubt that it will have much of an effect on my current habits... It will certainly cause me to think more about the things that I buy.  It certainly reinforced my belief that America is following the wrong path when it comes to the consolidation and outsourcing of our basic neccessities.  All in All ...A wonderful, compelling read that I would wholeheartedly recommend. I'm passing the book over to my 17 y.o. for his summer reading.

If I had, I would have pestered her (positively) about this great fantasy novel more than I did about her good cooking!    \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is certainly among the top half dozen fantasy novels in the English language. Superior, in my view, to the\\"Ring\\" cycle and White's books on the same subject. Every girl 11 or older should have this as a summer reading project. Yes, there is sex in it, but it seems to be more a rite of passage for the reader of either gender, at any age, than an exploitation. Just impress upon your kids that this is FANTASY. I think \\"Mists\\" is less salacious than Philip Pullman's \\"Dark Materials\\" trilogy for example, and that set is kid's lit!

And this wouldn't be very difficult for any of the actors, since none of the dialogue or acting is ever so spontaneous that an over-dub would be a hard to reproduce (just say the line again, Steve).

As for entertainment value, I've seen better home-video of punks beating on rental-cars.  The continuity is the big problem.  We have dent, we don't have a dent.  We see tire marks, we don't see tire marks.  And the sounds of the revving engine DO NOT match the scenes.  The car is clearly accelerating, yet we hear the \\"double-clutching\\" or a gear down that would have slowed, then lurched the car.  And there is no slowing or lurching.  And the only crash (which destroys the bad-guys' car) is in fast motion.  It's like something you would see in a low-budget comedy.  And speaking of comedy, any of the car chase action in \\"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\\" (1963) is more fun, more exciting, and more central to the plot.  So the entertainment value in the Bullitt chase scene is just not there.  It's not even bad enough to be funny.<br /><br />The story: Nothing to see here, move along.  In fact, let's just watch Steve walk around and stand there.  Oh I get it.  I like looking at him too.  Most actors can't match his pure magnetism; there is something wonderful about his face that makes me want to  know what he might be thinking.  Unfortunately, that is not enough to carry the story.  And, most importantly, the story has nothing to do with Bullitt himself.  Sure we see his girl friend get upset because he doesn't open up, but this is at the end of the movie (and even then it is still more her problem than his).  So the big problem is, Bullitt has no problems.  He doesn't even have the problem of being much of a maverick.  The bad guys are purely bad (with no implications for our hero) and the corruption is straight-forward enough that only a 10 year-old boy would think it is important.<br /><br />Theme: This is not some post-modern commentary on modern man's alienation; this is an uncomplicated vehicle for Steve's face.  The social issues of the day (black rights etc.) are not heard and only get one face (I think there is one black character, who says nothing or almost nothing).  Corruption is always a good issue, but it is so removed from the daily life of our hero that we are not really sure why we should care because we are not sure why HE would care.  Oh sure, it's his job to get the bad guys, and sure it gets harder if one of the bad guys is the mayor.  But that is established at the outset.  No surprises (unless you can't follow the dialogue--which might be a problem due to boredom or youth, or if you haven't seen a single movie in 30 years).<br /><br />So aside from continuity problems, a simple story line (with no character connection) and poor sound and flat acting, this movie has at the charm of a 1970's made-for-TV drama.  If you like that kind of thing fine, but I wish all you fanatics (who probably just love looking at Steve's face) would stop saying how great this movie is.  It is not great.  It is not even average.  And it is well bellow average by any standards today.<br /><br />If you must see it, don't buy it, don't even rent it, just ask if you can watch it the next time your friend's dad wants to watch it.  Then, when you can't take any more, just quietly excuse yourself and be thankful that you aren't out any of your hard earned money.tly, the story has nothing to do with Bullitt himself.

0316096199|5.0|I first became a fan of Sebold when I read \\"The Lovely Bones\\"...so I sought out \\"Lucky\\" with the hopes of finding another jewel in a sea of bad literature. When I skimmed the back cover to determine what it was about, I was surprised to find that it was an autobiography of her brutal rape while she attended Syracuse University. I was inspired to see how someone could write about something so tragic and personal, and soon learned that while she discussed her eventual travel through drug addiction and alcoholism. We see the rape through the trial, and the subsequent effects of these events as they relate to her life. However, the overwhelming theme throughout the novel is SURVIVAL and forgiveness.
B00006IU73|5.0|Porcupine Tree were, up until their debut on Lava Records with the groundbreaking \\"In Absentia\\", known for being something of an underground, prog-psychadelic band. Their sound was very soft rock, and the band seemed to prefer liquid soundscapes over heavier music. However, Signify bridged the gap between the psychadelic and rock mentalities, producing an album of extreme importance for both music and Porcupine Tree's musical progression. Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun perfected this new, harder edge, but it was only on the band's seventh LP, In Absentia, that things really broke out. Starting with the screaming metal of Blackest Eyes to the lullaby orchestration on Collapse The Light Into Earth, Porcupine Tree had truly grown up. The band was now performing tighter and much more professional tunes than ever before, and their sound was better than ever. <br /> <br />This breakthrough hit in America (selling over 100,000 units in its first year, more than the collective PTree catalogue combined had sold up until that point) gave Porcupine Tree much more of a mainstream focus, yet the band never sacrificed artistic integrity: the album is by far their most complex yet, and is without a doubt a modern-day masterpiece. <br /> <br />The album, under song by song analysis: <br /> <br />1.) Blackest Eyes- This single is by far the most popular Ptree song, even over Voyage 34 and Radioactive Toy. Blackest Eyes opened the door for Porcupine Tree to bridge the gap between good and (relatively) mainstream music. The song is important, and is also a really amazing track. 5/5 <br /> <br />2.) Trains- This may be my favorite song on the album. The guitar work is amazing, Wilson's voice causes tears to well up in your eyes, and the gliding bassline and drums cause this tune to grow to epic proportions. Amazing. 5/5 <br /> <br />3.) Lips Of Ashes- Cleanses your palette of the first two amazing songs, and slows things down a bit. Really mellow, and very emotional, this song will have you floating. 4/5 <br /> <br />4.) The Sound Of Muzak- Another \\"single\\", this song is really awesome. The guitar pattern will get you thinking, and the song really flows through you, especially the vocals. Just turn it on, and play it loud. 5/5 <br /> <br />5.) Gravity Eyelids- I can't keep giving out these five out of five scores, but every song is just so amazing on this record, especially this one. Gravity Eyelids brought my attention to PTree, when I saw them perform this song live in front of me, opening for Yes in Rochester. Absolutely jaw-dropping, and astounding. 5/5 <br /> <br />6.) Wedding Nails- Instrumental #1, this song is one of Ptree's best, with shredding guitars, and a bassline to die for. Compared to previous Porcupine Tree instrumentals, its easy to see how much the band has grown. Really play it loud. 5/5 <br /> <br />7.) Prodigal- This song is one of the commercial Ptree tunes, shall we say, with an easier arrangement, but by far a very compelling track. Not my favorite, but definitely doesn't take away from the appeal of the album at all. Again, like all PTree tracks, the vocals are heavenly. 4/5 <br /> <br />8.) .3- This and Strip The Soul seem like they are meant to be together, almost like this is the orchestrated introduction to that track. A very nice palette cleanser, again, and really makes you float on cloud nine while listening. 4/5 <br /> <br />9.) The Creator Has A Mastertape- The bassline carries this track, while the keyboards add amazing sound to fill it out nicely. Starkly different from the other tracks on the album, this song is really awesome, and will get you rocking out fast. Blast this one til the neighbors call the cops on you. 5/5 <br /> <br />10.) Heart Attack On A Layby- Its amazing that a band who can create such powerfully metal tracks can calm down into an aural masterpiece like this. The lyrics tell a devastating tale (I'm sure you can guess) while the guitars and harmony vocals really get the emotions flowing. Anextraordinarily powerful tracks, sure to have you in tears by the end. 5/5 <br /> <br />11.) Strip The Soul- The climax of the album, with the next track as a nice coda. This song is the most complex on the album, in terms of arrangement, with a myriad of guitars, vocals, orchestra, and amazing drums and bass parts respectively. The song begins to drown itself in the end with near-completly distorted instruments, until it trails off, leaving the listener exhausted, in a good way, really preparing you for the last track. 5/5 <br /> <br />12.) Collapse The Light Into Earth- Devastingly emotional. This song makes you feel so empty, as if the character of this concept album has absolutely hit rock bottom. Even more emotional is how the narrator seems to find some peace in that bottom, and how everything seems to be in balance in the end. You'll be speechless. 5/5 <br /> <br />Overall, buy this album- its well worth the price, for over an hour and more of music, the Strip The Soul video, and songs that will really put you over the edge emotionally. You're going to love this album if you love good music, because this album is exactly that- prepare your music shelf an extra space for this masterpiece.
B00000K0E5|4.0|This movie was amazing on so many levels, but the main reason I love it is because I think Trevelyan is one of the best Bond villains ever. He's not some aged megalomaniacal, larger than life villain like Dr. No, Goldfinger, Samedi or Cananga, he is an equal of Bond's, someone Bond once called his friend. And this makes him the worst kind of adversary Bond could face. He knows Bond, knows his instincts, knows all his moves, and it's fantastic to see Bond matched against a villain who could take him down with words rather than fantastic gadgetry.
B000096FUD|4.0|I thought I had it bad on the set of my little student film in college. <br /> <br />Whew! <br /> <br />Watching this documentary was very difficult and very interesting at the same time. I enjoyed it, despite the tragedy that played out on the screen. <br /> <br />What makes the film so heartbreaking is that you know that the film will inevitably fail. So the entire movie-watching experience is steeped in dramatic irony. We, the viewers, know the outcome of this ill-fated film project known as \\"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.\\" But the filmmakers themselves, at the time of the filming, obviously do not know that all their actions are essentially in vain. <br /> <br />A great film, and a powerful warning to those who thinking making movies is easy.
B000EYK2GE|5.0|Long out on VHS and DVD, \\"Carl Perkins & friends\\" is finally available on CD and the wait was worth it!   <br /> <br />Recorded before a live audience at Limehouse Studios in London in October, 1985, the session captures all the warmth, love and admiration that Carl Perkins (\\"The Godfather of Rock\\") had for his friends Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Ringo Starr and Dave Edmunds.  The affections were equally returned and the result is a stunning, rocking revue of Mr. Perkins' early catalogue of hits, as well as other hits to come from Sun Records' hey day.   <br /> <br />Along with the headliners, the stage is graced by the likes of Mr. Perkins son, Greg (on bass), Slim Jim Phantom and Lee Rocker from The Stray Cats and Rosanne Cash.  Ms. Cash turns in a stellar duet with Mr. Perkins on \\"Going to Jackson\\", originally done by Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash.   <br /> <br />There are no lulls or weak cuts amongst the 18 tracks and when the final song is sung, you'll find yourself hitting the \\"repeat\\" button on your CD player.
B000089CJI|5.0|\\"Give Up\\" by the Postal Service is one of those albums you would never sit down and describe as the the kind of music that you prefer to listen to. That's because this music in unlike anything you've heard before.  <br /> <br />I came across this CD when a friend recommended it to me based on my interest in Death Cab for Cutie. I am thankful I have that friend.  <br /> <br />The songs are expertly crafted. The arrangements are complex but accessible. The lyrics are heartfelt and sincere. Overall it's just a damn good CD.  <br /> <br />My favorites are \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight,\\" \\"Nothing Better,\\" and \\"Recycled Air\\" (a gem of a tune, with a subject so simple, yet the song seems so deep).  <br /> <br />I would recommend this to anyone who like's good, solid, trance-like/trance-enducing music that is brimming with atmosphere, style, substance, and above all quality. <br /> <br />This album grows on you.  I initially gave it 4 out of 5 stars, but looking back on that rating now, I cannot for the life of me see how I would give this CD anything less than 5 stars.  It's that good. <br /> <br />You won't be disappointed.

B00004XQP4|4.0|Alright, I wasn't going to include this big part of my review where I talk some sense into people, but here it goes: 1st, to all of you who keep telling us to listen to Led Zeppelin instead of Green Day, I have one question for you: Why compare the two? Green Day is a modern day rock band, and Led Zeppelin is a classic hard rock band. Hating a band because they can't compare to Led Zeppelin - which no band can, by the way - is a ridiculous and pointless reason for hating a band. Hating a band because they're not as punk and as hard rock as The Clash is another stupid reason for hating a band. And why are Green Day posers? Because they're played on the radio and everything that's played on the radio sucks that isn't Led Zeppelin or Queen? Because they sold millions of records? Because they're played on MTV here and there? WHY? If you hate a band for any of those reasons, guess what: YOU are a poser. Just try to accept the fact that not all modern rock sucks (if you want another good rock band of today, try Radiohead).<br /><br />Anyway, this is another great Green Day record, and probably one of the best albums of 2000 along with Radiohead's Kid A.<br /><br />The only reason I take a star off is because I don't feel Warning is *as* great as their previous records. But in some cases, it's better. Let's get this through: When this album was released, the Green Day you knew in 7th grade grew up. They've moved on and have begun experimenting. This album showcases thier new-found maturity and want for moving on. On Warning, several types of music can be found: Jazz (Warning, Waiting), hard rock (Minority, Bood, Sex And Booze) and still a little bit of pop-punk (Church On Sunday, Deadbeat Holiday). It all combines into a nice blend of music. Green Day was on the edge of not being able to expand their music, since they already used up their pop-punkiness on their last 5 records (Slappy Hours, Kerplunk, Dookie, Insomniac, and Nimrod), but thanks to this album, they allowed themselves to cross into new musical territory.<br /><br />Album sales weren't that great for Warning when compared to the sales of their last 3 albums. But it managed to go gold and was one of the best selling albums of the year. They needed a break after this record, so they released International Superhits! the next year, and a B-sides of Warning called Shenanigans the next year. Then in 2004, they released the great American Idiot: a concept album----------------- Oh, sorry, I got a little off track there.<br /><br />Warning is recommended to fans of pop-punk, open-minded punk rock fans (not all of you closed-minded people who never touch anything beyond the Clash or The Sex Pistols), and, or course, fans of Green Day.ed themselves to cross into new musical territory. <br /> <br />Album sales weren't that great for Warning when compared to the sales of their last 3 albums.

B000DZIGDU|4.0|This movie caught me off-guard (no pun intended).  I was not expecting much from it, having only been slightly impressed with Mendes' previous two films, American Beauty and Road to Perdition.   <br /> <br />Jarhead had sat for ages on my entertainment center, gathering dust in its rental case, before I finally decided to give it a try.  And I'm glad I did. <br /> <br />What a great film.  Stark and gritty, but with a glowing soul at its core.  The cinematography and effects (there were mountains in the background of those \\"desert\\" shots, which had to be digitally removed) were very impressive.  The acting was top-notch.  Jake Gylenhall gave an award-worthy performance, as you can actually see and feel his character losing his mind, which seems wholly believable and true.  Jamie Foxx was understated, but powerful - and it was refreshing to not see the cliched difficult/evil superior officer that has plagued earlier war movies. <br /> <br />Some great scenes throughout - especially the \\"Deer Hunter\\" VHS scene.  Wow!  And the way the film conveys the isolation of deployed troops - cut off from home, family, and in some cases, sanity - is incredibly well done.  You feel for these guys as they trudge through their unenviable situation. <br /> <br />Overall, a very, very good film.  I give it 4 stars here, but it really deserves more like a 9 out of 10. <br /> <br />Powerful and memorable.
B000AXSN5G|2.0|Neil Young's albums have often been uneven, to say the least. Lately his recordings have sounded rather tired, with maybe a flash of brilliance here and there. Prairie Wind continues this pattern. <br /> <br />First, if you unfold the CD booklet, you'll see a beautiful sepia-toned photo of a young woman hanging laundry on a windy  day in a flat, flat land. This photo illustrates the title song, but the photo is far more compelling than the song, which chugs along for an interminable seven minutes, with a chorus of background singers pointlessly repeating \\"Prairie wind blowin' through my head.\\"  <br /> <br />Most of the songs on the album are lyrically quite ordinary, the day-to-day observations and thoughts of an aging troubadour about wide open spaces, country life, family, juxtaposed with the insanity, greed, and corruption of city, politics, business. The music -- the melodies, chord structures, and song structures -- are also rather ordinary. But it is well-recorded, and it flows  pleasantly. It just never seems to go anywhere.  <br /> <br />There is one song on Prairie Wind that might be construed as a classic Neil Young composition. No Wonder has enough lyrical complexity/ambiguity and musical power to be worth repeated listens. I saw Neil perform this song on the Conan O'Brien show, and it was effective.  <br /> <br />Neil sings to an old friend about his appreciation of their friendship. He sings about Elvis. He sings about an old classic guitar. He sings about the fading dream of the world he grew up in. It's all very heartfelt, but ultimately just plain boring.  <br /> <br />When God Made Me, I read in another review, might be an expression of Young's atheism. If you didn't know that, you might think it was a sincere question about how people have misconstrued or failed to see the Creator's intent, and to live accordingly. Again, this is quite sincere, but hardly another classic like Imagine. <br /> <br />OK, you die-hard Neil Young fans -- go ahead, you can click the \\"No\\" button now. (Was this review helpful to you?) I know you've been dying to do it. Feel free, but I tell the truth. This album has one very good song, and that is not enough to justify the purchase of an entire CD. When Neil puts out another record as good as Harvest Moon, I'll be the first in line to give it five stars.

B00005JOVO|4.0|but compared to the 1972 classic, it sadly lacks the star power...  When disaster hits the almost Titanic of a new luxury liner, the remake surpasses the original a long way.<br /><br />The demise of the ship in the end is also a scene that parallells the 1997-epic about a certain ship - as a matter of fact - some scenes even surpasses THAT 1...<br /><br />Josh Lucas  is good as a human being... not good... not evil...  but something in between:-)) Richard Dreyfuss is good as well...<br /><br />The rest of the cast suffers because they are 1-dimensional soap-stars... sorry but they do appear to be just that...<br /><br />The surviving scenes in the end are a bit too much on the far-fetched side....<br /><br />In the end it is a OK remake, but no way if it surpasses \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" in a long shot...

B000002GYN|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I love the Eagles throughout all of their incarnations, as all members past and present contributed greatly to their sound, but their debut album is terrific, true California country-rock.  The original lineup consisted of four members: Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Randy Meisner, and Bernie Leadon.  Years before incorporating the unmistakable talents of Don Felder, Joe Walsh, and Timothy B. Schmit, the original four more than held their own and, dare I say it, sound better in this stripped-down form (both in terms of personnel and recording quality) than in the tremendous, arena-rockin' \\"Hotel California\\" album (and that's a great record).  The tracks lack that overly slick, produced quality of later recordings and thus sound more down to earth.  As they always have done, the members trade off writing and lead vocal credits on this album, delighting the listener with the less-frequently-heard voices of Leadon and Meisner.  Naturally, three of their big early hits are all on this album: road trip anthem \\"Take It Easy\\", the spaghetti-Western \\"Witchy Woman\\", and the wonderfully twangy country sound of \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\".  The other seven tracks certainly measure up, though, and I recommend \\"Chug All Night\\", \\"Earlybird\\", and \\"Tryin'\\".  It's hard to pick favorites, though, so just listen to the whole album a few times and enjoy the original rootsy Eagles of 1972.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Tim Burton, 2005)<br /><br />The best way to look at Tim Burton's new reimagining of Roald Dahl's classic kids' novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is that it's a reimagining of the source material rather than a remake of the older film. They descend from a common ancestor, but have no more in common than you or I do with the Monkey Chain of Trust. (Well, not me. I'm not so sure about you sometimes.)<br /><br />In some ways, this version is closer to the source material than the older one-- for example, they have the right Oompa-Loompa songs this time (and thank Heaven for that). For about half the film, the kids seem truer to their book roots, as well, though things have been updated a bit (Mike Teevee, for example, is now a videogame devotee instead of a watcher of TV Westerns; either way, he gets his daily quantity of violence). Apart from that, though, this movie diverges as widely from the book as does the first one, but in decidedly odder ways. Not that this should be much of a surprise from Burton.<br /><br />The character of Willy Wonka, played here with far more an air of overt menace than Gene Wilder took in the original film, is the principal oddity. Wilder played things off as a nice fatherly sort of chap, which made it kind of hard to believe when he suddenly turned around and started raging. Depp's Wonka is thoroughly screwed up from the very start, and were I a ten-year-old about to accompany him into a factory, I'd have to check to make sure chocolate hadn't gotten into my britches on a regular basis. Whereas Wilder's Wonka was all about showing off the goodies, and taking as much delight in them as the kids did, Depp's version wanders through the landscape as if he has no idea what he's looking at. Positively creepy. (This makes the cutting of the original film's most infamous scene, the boat ride, all the more inexplicable.) One could make a pretty strong argument for Depp's character mirroring Willem Dafoe's brilliant performance as Count Orlok in Merhige's Shadow of the Vampire rather than anything that came out of the mind of either Dahl or Wilder.<br /><br />It's not a bad comparison, though one has to buy the idea that Depp himself actually took the path that Murnau (John Malkovich) provided as Orlok's cover story in Shadow. Depp looked into the motivations of his character, which are explored in depth here, and came up with a neurotic bag of bones who's so ill-socialized that, even when it comes to the moment he's been dreaming of these past few years, we still can't buy it. I'm relatively sure no one reading this review could possibly have gone their entire lives without seeing either the original film or this one, but I'll still not spoil the ending for you; let's just say that when it happens, it doesn't sit right.<br /><br />This is an immensely interesting film for all the wrong reasons. Johnny Depp's character is endlessly fascinating, but that's a whole different ball of wax than saying Willy Wonka, or the film that surrounds him, is immensely interesting. ** ½foe's brilliant performance as Count Orlok in Merhige's Shadow of the Vampire rather than anything that came out of the mind of either Dahl or Wilder. <br /> <br />It's not a bad comparison, though one has to buy the idea that Depp himself actually took the path that Murnau (John Malkovich) provided as Orlok's cover story in Shadow.

B000EAT246|1.0|at no time does this movie ever reach the point of being beliveable and even for an action movie at some point it has to do that! the helicopter is very cool,but do they really think that if it was going to be used to keep everyday people in line they would test it out in the open like this much less let a pilot that is known as aloose cannon be the one to test it? <br />    the other problem is that they go out of their way to keep the movie lite and then add a very sick murder in for spice i guess. skip it!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JN0T|3.0|I, Robot (Alex Proyas, 2004)<br /><br />Man, I heard a lot of bad things about this movie after it came out. Still, I'm a hige fan of Alex Proyas, and I had to give it a shot. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Spooner (Will Smith) is a detective in 2035, when robots are commonplace. Spooner is not a big fan of robots despite, as we find out in the first scene, having had his life saved by one. He is called to U. S. Robotics, the company that manufactures all those robots, after Alfred Lanning (Babe's James Cromwell) plunges to his death from hundreds of feet above the building's lobby. Everyone else is convinced his death is a suicide-- but Spooner's not so sure. With the company poised to roll out its new line, CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) isn't thrilled with an anti-robot cop running around.<br /><br />The first thing you have to do with I, Robot is to divorce it from the source material. This is not Isaac Asimov's novel. (It probably would have been a good idea for them to put a different title on it.) In fact, it admits this, stating that the movie was \\"inspired by\\" the novel rather than based on it. So don't think of it as a bad adaptation of Asimov, or that's what you're going to get. The second thing you have to do with it is forgive it its relatively stupid climax and even stupider ending. Obviously, someone has a lot of his special effects budget left and didn't want to get less money for effects for his next film. That said, the effects are, in fact, pretty cool, and if you can switch your brain off when we get to the climax, you've got a chance.<br /><br />It's a shame you have to, though, because the first hour or so of the movie is a well-plotted, intelligent mystery flick. Sure, it's nothing special-- renegade cop who thinks he's onto the truth while everyone else thinks he's nuts-- but it's done with style and humor. And, of course, lots of special effects. This is a story that allows for exploration with effects, and Proyas takes advantage of that, much like he did in Dark City. The difference is that there, he managed to rein in the compulsion to descend into effects-mania that he shows here. (Perhaps the smaller budget helped.) When it comes right down to it, Proyas is a very good director, and this could have been a truly fantastic film. As it stands, it's not a bad film, but it didn't quite realize its potential. ***ge of that, much like he did in Dark City.

0812550706|5.0|I had seen this book many times, and for some unknown reason was drawn to it.  I never, however, left the bookstore with this book in my bag.  A friend, however, recently suggested that I pick it up.  The next day, I bought the book.  I finished it less than 12 hours later. <br />First off, I related to Ender.  While I never felt the same as he did in all things, I was one of those 'gifted children'.  I always scored EXCEPTIONALLY well in placement tests.  I never applied myself and, as a result, never had the grades to seem that brilliant. <br />Ender, and the children around him in the story, are all gifted children.  I feel that most people who read books are intelligent and gifted, or at the very least, above the norm.  Those are the people this book will strike a chord with.  I am currently 25, and read this book twice (and for the first time) within the past year.  I have recommended this book to several of my friends who read.  They all loved the book, with a few small exceptions. <br />The story takes place in a future with mankind under a world-wide government.  Ender finds himself taken away from his parents and sent to, for lack of a better name, military school.  Unlike most schools, however, it is all about the game.  Ender finds himself gifted at this game, able to use his excellent mind to come up with unprecedented tactics. <br />With this excellent gift comes the curse that any gifted person finds, the jealousy of others.  Ender is a compassionate child who, when threatened, defends himself.  His character is realistic and can easily be empathized with.  The occasional jumps back to his siblings at home provide an interesting break from Ender's school. <br />I have little complaints about this book.  The final chapter, which I believe is actually from The Speaker for the Dead, feels out of place, but does provide a sort of round up into a happier ending.  The ending can feel a bit sudden and disappointing, but unfortunately realistic.  The book is filled with action, being difficult to put down. <br />The writing style leaves something to be desired, but at the same time, this can make it simple to read.  The book flows and if you read the story for the enjoyment of reading, you will enjoy this book.  I haven't read the other books about Ender or his friends, but I probably will, simply to delve into the 'what happens to this person' story. <br />In the end, I would be hard-pressed to find a book I enjoyed reading more than Ender's Game.
0790729342|5.0|this is THE ONE,the movie that made mel gibson a world star and forever changed the action movie landscape forever. it also started the post-apocolyptic movie craze in the 80's with its tale of former cop,now wandering nomad named max. in the first movie of this three movie cycle max lost his family to thugs as the world tore it's self apart. max savagely hunted down and killed all of the thugs and rode off into the wasteland,which is were we find him as the movie opens. this max is cold and very much a lone wolf who has almost no human feelings left in him.what he and everyone else wants is fuel,which is getting harder to find.after a funny bit with a gyro-chopter pilot max finds a group of people hold up at a oil dump and after some intresting fights helps the people leave the dump with the gas as a horde of outlaws lay siege to the camp! <br />     the final chase one of the greatest car chases in movie history and takesthis movie into the area of legend! many movies have tried but none have matched the energy of this one of a kind action adventure. the stunts are beyond anything you have ever seen. check this one out!!!!!!! <br />
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|The only reason that I am writing this review is because Pitchfork got it TOTALLY wrong rating this album at a mere 5.9.  O.K., so it's not the best album ever, but dammit if it isn't really, really good.  Check out \\"Heart in a Cage,\\" \\"Razorblade,\\" \\"Vision of Division,\\" and \\"You Only Live Once.\\"  Listen, if you have ever dated a really cold, hurtful, hyper-critical, neurotic girlfriend with really annoying friends, who only puts out enough, good enough to keep you around to buy her drinks, and is always telling you what's wrong with you, never what's right, then add a star to my rating 'cause this album was written for you.
B00003CXD0|1.0|To begin with the movie Tootsie is classified as a genre of romance and comic.This movie is produced in New York. The protagonist is Michael Dorsey and he is the most important character in the film.The situation of this movie is of a man that is a talent actor but for reasons of money he decides to dress like a woman.For the reason that he cannot continue woring in the job he has and that his manager tell him nobody would hire him because he is unemployed  by that time. So there is where Dorothy appears and he starts working as a women is a soap opera in televison where he becames so famous. He gets the job here but he did it without having the intention of hurting anyone and also anyone in the place knew that he was a man dresses like a woman.In addition he falls in love with one of the woman that works with him in the soap opera. Thre is only one friend that knows what he is doing. He has one problem and is that his bestfriend falls in love with him but he didn't treat her well for the reason that he is in love with the other woman.The characters of this movie are really good actors evryone seems to knoe what they are doing.THe way the character acts in the movie is ok and the decision the man takes to wear  women's clothin instead of try to find a job in the way he is seems to me very intelligent. Because he could only accept that he was unemployed but no he decides to do something so that he could work. The stes in the movie are really well done and I like the part where the father of the woman that acts in the ospa opera gives a ring to dorothy without knowing thta she was a man.The lightnoing is was ok in every scene you could see everything ok and well iluminated. The costumes the actors used where a little diffrerent form he ones we use right now but eventhough they were not the same they look ok.Furthermore th emusic they put inspires the movie to look more interesting, there were not that much music but it was ok. This movie could be reall in life becausesometimes when people dont have jobs or they got fire they do everything they can to have a job. <br />I will really recommend this movie to my audience because itis interesting to see how his man do all that work with enthusiam and it really leave us a message of life.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Wowie, this documentary packs a punch. I wasn't sure I wanted to exchange two hours of my life to listen to a retired guy talk about his life. I'm glad I did! His insights are so honest, OK, searing, that I just need to ruminate on them for a year or two. I've sent this DVD as a gift to a couple of friends so we can talk about it together. Be sure and see this documentary--I really don't think you'll be disappointed.

B000FS9FCQ|3.0|Before I begin, let me tell you that I WORSHIP this comic series. Alan Moore is a God amongst men. This is the best comic series that has ever been. And may ever be. It doesn't just edge out its competitors (DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, BATMAN: YEAR ONE, ARKHAM ASYLUM, even Moore's other works like THE KILLING JOKE, WATCHMEN, SWAMP THING, and FROM HELL), it blows them away. The tale is the best example of fiction writing in any category. David Lloyd's art doesn't hurt either. It's brilliant and atmospheric. The writing is supremely intelligent, caustic, incendiary, touching, challenging, disturbing and witty.<br /><br />But here, we're talking about the film.<br /><br />And the film leaves you wanting.<br /><br />I'm not going to get too far into the plot of the film, because everyone else already has. I will, however, go into my criticisms of the film.<br /><br />Obviously, this is going to come under fire from some people who will read this because of the following criticism: Too much has changed from the comic to the screen. Evey's origins, the obliteration of what I believed to be ultimately necessary characters to the tale in the comic, the ridiculous characterization of Adam Sutler (read: [...]) by John Hurt, and the teachings/love/hate between V and Evey.<br /><br />Really, the only scene that works as it was played out in the comic is the incarceration/torture/self-discovery of Evey.<br /><br />The heart of the ideas of the comic are still present, but they are watered down for a more palatable consumption.<br /><br />If you are a lunatic for the comic like I am, you've probably already seen it and feel the same way.<br /><br />If you haven't read the comic, see the film, and at the same time, buy the graphic novel. Get them in the same shipment. Watch the film, then read the graphic novel. And you'll know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Obviously, we've come a long way from LXG and FROM HELL, but it still needs more Moore.
0312323859|4.0|Darcy Rhone is the girl that all girls love to hate.  She's pretty, popular, and she has a great career.  However, as we learned in the first novel, Something Borrowed, having the perfect boyfriend doesn't always perfection get.  She's not even that smart!<br /><br />So we find her once more, reaping what she has sown- One doesn't necessarily have to read the first novel in order to enjoy the second, by the way.  Just when we think she's going to crash and burn...and oh, does she come close...she emerges as a likable and sympathetic character.  Oh, if we all could be as fortunate as our heroine.<br /><br />Still, this was a great vacation read for me and if you are a fan of the genre, it will be for you, too.  Enjoy.
B000094Q3I|5.0|This is an extraordinary album. If you want to check out this artist, start here! I completely agree with the previous review. Cotton eyed Joe is a beautiful rendition. A voice at once reminiscent of Elvis, or Nina Simone, but truly original.
B000EYK4KI|5.0|I'm utterly fascinated. \\"Mr and Mrs Smith\\" is on my Top Ten List; last summer I saw it three times in theaters and ran out and bought the DVD and the soundtrack immediately. Now I have two versions of the DVD, and it is well worth the $[...]I have spent over all (toilet paper when you consider the millions the production spent on elements that would never have seen the light of day but for the technological revolution that made special feature DVD so popular). I already loved the film, but I love it that much more now that I've seen what the production threw on the cutting room floor. They made GREAT choices: most of America-- fans, audiences, tabloids news shows, and critics included-- only focused on the casting choice of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie (and by the way, the candid commentary on their work ethic and attitudes on set is awesome, as well). However, and this may be because I am a filmmaker, I think it only adds to the validity of final cut to see what they were working with: it's almost as if you have the Avid file in front of you, and you can see what's in the trash bin and what is still on the timeline.      I was amazed to see how little control Doug Liman seemed to have with his own creativity going into filming the movie. There's always a struggle with the suits in the studio, I'm aware of that, but the extent to which their power trips will take it...and the amount of money they are willing to throw at their own ego rubs...is just insane! As a filmmaker myself (who unfortunately has shied away from directing in the past few years), to watch the battle of wits is really interesting: to see where a creative mind gives and takes and compromises (or in this case, just seems to placate: did you know the car scene was only considered \\"optional\\" by the studio suits?  sure, but by all means, we need to have two options for other fight sequences) really teaches you a lot.  I feel like I got more out of sitting on my couch today, eating Haagen Daz directly out of the gallon (you heard me correctly), staring at the television for three hours, than in all three years of college, paying forty grand to listen to some old white guy drone on and on about mise-en-scene.  Hell, we even got to see some of Doug's animated storyboards!    The second disc of that DVD set is all special features, including a gag reel, an alternate ending, a behind-the-scenes documentary, and sessions with Doug, where he shows more deleted scenes and explains them. Now I understand how the script grew to 250 pages and why that translated into reshoots and the production team running out of film: he shot A LOT of crap he didn't use. \\"Mr and Mrs Smith\\" is a long movie as it is, but scenes were shot in multiple versions, and additional sequences (not moments, lines, or scenes, but full-on sequences: practically subplots) were shot, as well. The thing could have become an epic...or at least a miniseries if everything was used. For one thing, the characters of Mother and Father (which are in the film for all of nine seconds) were first shot with Jacqueline Bissett and Terence Stamp and then reshot with Keith David and Angela Bassett, and still none of the footage ended up in the final cut. Full scenes. Full LONG scenes. The desert scene was shot as both what you see in the film and as a snowy ravine sequence. The studio tried to convince Doug he needed voice over and created a complete B-plot with Adam Brody and Estella Warren in order to set him up as a central enough character to be accepted as that narrator, which wasn't used either. There were moments when dialogue (\\"okay so it's a crap marriage\\") was reused and then turned into a brief monologue...and truth be told, I actually kind of liked those moments as individual clips because they made the allegory about marriage that much more in your face, but I understand-- as the DVD tries to show you-- why it wasn't necessary in the final cut.    This DVD is worth buying even if you already have the filmfrom it's first DVD release back in November; the second disc is worth the price alone. It's not a step-by-step script-to-screen of the film, but it's the closest thing I've seen on a DVD of extras. If you're an aspiring filmmaker, the sessions with Doug Liman will give you new perspective on what it takes to make it in this industry, and if you're just a fan of Brad and/or Angelina, you will get to see them in many, many new moments that may not be as color-corrected as the final cut of the film but still look amazing. And the alternate ending is adorable! Not right for the flow of the film, but I loved it anyway.  However, I am not saying this should be a replacement for the original DVD.  After all, the feature film version on this is not what was release in theatres originally, and the new \\"unrated\\" version changed some stuff I thought detracted from its greatness-- such as leaving out the first half of Adam Brody's material and leaving in some top lines that made the transitions less smooth and succienct.  Of course, what makes it unrated is that they left in the full sex scene, something which you cannot find as even a deleted scene on the original DVD.  And it's hot ;)
B000059Z8J|5.0|I don't think I could say anything bad about this film. It's where all the other Comic adaptations look to, to see how it was done. The story was done well, and the way it was filmed, gives a sense of reality and a way for us to connect with the characters. This wasn't a 2-Dimensional portrayal, but felt like these were real poeple. Wish the other deleted scenes were in this film though.
B000FMGTTE|2.0|If you want something to collect with your memorabilia for the movie, than by all means add this to your collection.  But, in terms of having something memorable to listen, there is nothing here.  This is a very paint-by-numbers score.  Some basic themes with the standard dependency on some chorus to make it sound bigger than it is.  This isn't a soundtrack that you'll want to listen to over and over for its own sake.  It's very formulistic with no driver or passion.  I haven't seen the movie yet to know how it fits in with the tone and mood of the film.  On its own, it pales in comparison not to just William's majestic effort, but to standard film scores of the time.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|Having been a longtime fan of the Dune books and David Lynch's interpretation of Dune, I was eager to get my hands on the `Extended Version' release on DVD. Having never seen the television version of the film before, I was appalled that this would actually be enthusiastically released as a quality piece of film.<br /><br />The `extended version' is nothing more than a very poorly edited version of the film that was watered down and muzzled for the mass market daytime television demographic. Many elements of the theatrical release that helped make it what it was were either missing altogether or hacked apart by horrible editing. Some of these include the blatant reuse of scenes and dry added narrative during the Harkonnen attack, and the deletion of the heart plug and spitting scenes. On the positive side, the few truly unique and `new' scenes added helped to flesh out Gurney Halleck's character (a personal favorite of mine), and to expand on the bene gesserit sub-plot. Aside from these minor positives though, it is easy to see why Lynch disowned this cut of the film.<br /><br />The remastered theatrical release is the true star of this edition, which is available in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen. Fans of the books and/or film can rejoice in what is an excellent transfer of the film to DVD, worthy of any Dune fan's collection. The extras leave quite a bit to be desired though, as Lynch and other key cast and crew are MIA in this set. Instead, viewers get Raffaella De Laurentiis laying to rest the rumor of an 'ultimate' Lynch cut of the film. There are some interesting interviews with a few people involved in the production though, but the lack of Lynch, MacLachlan and others makes this release feel hollow and incomplete. Certainly, Dune deserves a better DVD release treatment than this...<br /><br />For those Die-hard Dune fans or those that want to have the extended release in their collection, this is a must have. I personally enjoyed seeing some of the truly 'new' scenes in the extended cut, even if the overall product was appallingly bad. For anyone else, this is definitely a forgettable DVD treatment of such a fantastically epic film.'new' scenes in the extended cut, even if the overall product was appallingly bad.

B000F6IOC0|4.0|I did like the first movie better, but really enjoyed this movie. The action scenes and the stunts were very entertaining.
B000004286|5.0|Without question, this is the best soundtrack album I have ever heard.  It has a haunting quality that intensified the mood of the movie but also weaves it's way into your psyche.  The combination of strings, horns, percussion and bagpipes can literally reduce you to tears with the beauty of each note.  I have never been so moved by music as I have by this.  James Horner is one of my favorite modern composers and this truly was his opus.  Never before or since has he captured the soul with music.

B000FA57RG|5.0|The revention tour/documentary first aired on cable MTV and VH1 <br />I watched it and loved it.  It seems Madonna has done some editing and deleting in the documentary, but that is exactly what it is a documentary.  Her revention was two years ago and I am trying remember the concert from start to finish but I can't.  Now if you want to see the revention tour ask Lady M to put the tour on DVD let's try shall we: Madonna can you put the revention tour on DVD? (and hopefully the blonde ambition tour to on DVD). I like both documentaries it has shown a maturiy in herself and her music and (once in a while the classic madonna) comes out.  Can you be honest and say you would want the same documentary fourteen years later NO because she is always growing and changing.  You will pay some money for the DVD/CD but what about her confession tour: front seats near the catwalk mmmmmmmmm.  You will get your money's worth satisfied or not. <br />
B00005JOQS|4.0|I'll say up front that Superman was never my favorite superhero, though I am a comic book fan and did follow the Super titles for a while.  He was always a little too perfect. <br /> <br />I also didn't have great hopes for this version of Superman.  For one thing, I'm tired of the remakes of 70s movies, and I was a fan of at least the first Christopher Reeve movie.  For another, the trailers and stills I'd seen made Brandon Routh look kind of wooden and pretty-boy, like he was cast mainly for how he looked in the suit.  But I ended up having not only a good time at this movie, but a great time. <br /> <br />What I liked: <br /> <br />--Bryan Singer obviously came of age during the post 1960s period when comic books became a little more nuanced in terms of character and exploring the vulnerabilities and down sides of being a superhero, and obviously liked those books.  It shows in his approach.   <br /> <br />--Brandon Routh, surprisingly enough.  He brought a human dimension to Superman even as he got across the concept that he is not of this earth better than I'd seen in the previous movies. <br /> <br />--The emotion in the Lois/Superman storyline.  Yeah, so I'm all girly in that way, sue me.  There were some interesting dimensions that have me psyched for sequel(s). <br /> <br />--The effects were awesome, this is the one thing I did expect.  Combined with the storyline, I had no problem believing this stuff was really happening, that Superman was flying, catching flying debris, shooting heat beams out of his eyes and all the rest.   <br /> <br />--There was more to the movie than just the effects.  There was actually some almost subtle stuff, which is more than one expects in a big summer blockbuster movie. <br /> <br />--Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor!  He just seemed to be having a really good time chewing the scenery and had a great combination of comic moments and menacing moments to be scary (though he could have been a LITTLE scarier). <br /> <br />What I didn't like so much: <br /> <br />--Parker Posey was totally wasted as Luthor's sidekick/girlfriend/whatever.  Very annoying character, very annoying that Parker Posey was reduced to a rather screechy bimbette.  She did have one or two good lines but on the whole could have done without her. <br /> <br />--Not enough Clark Kent and no dimension to Clark when he was on screen.  I did like the continuity with the Christopher Reeve dorky Clark, walking into things and all, but Routh played Clark almost like he was playing Chris Reeve as Clark.   <br /> <br />--Not enough Ma Kent.  Another wasted role (Eva Marie Saint) on just a few minutes of screen time and very little added to the story.  This goes along with needing more Clark.  The movie did a good job of getting across the more alien aspect of Superman (and the godlike qualities of a truly superhuman superhero) but the human aspect was flat. <br /> <br />--There were some of the usual plot holes that a big summer action movie tends to have, the things that after the movie is over and the initial rush subsides you're like, wait a minute, what happened to THAT guy or THAT mcguffin?  But it's a rare big blockbuster that doesn't have those so I just kind of roll with it.  There was nothing that ruined the movie for me. <br /> <br />On the whole, I had a great time.  And during some of the most tense and suspenseful moments, I noticed that I was curled up in my seat and intensely involved, which is a good sign.  I took a second to glance around at some of my fellow moviegoers and saw the same expressions and postures on them, which was cool. <br /> <br />So, I give it a thumbs up.  Successful restart to a seemingly dead franchise, and done well enough that I'm excited about the idea of another one or two sequels.  Definitely worth seeing, and worth seeing on the big screen. <br /> <br />
B000B8QEYC|3.0|Yes, I know all artists grow and change, and I am still a devoted Enya fan.  But i have to confess, I like her earlier work much more.  I'm a little bothered by the sing-songy trend I see emerging in her work.  I'm not getting the powerful, larger than life images in my mind like i did with her first three CD's.  This comes across more as Enya Lite.  give me the old style, massive sound I fell in love with years ago.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I was determined to dislike this movie, for two reasons - - the hype it had received and the fact that this was Sofia Coppola's first written/directed movie, as I was certain she was nothing more than a naked emperor with the right name.  I was so very wrong.  This movie has stolen my heart!  Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson are so sublimely perfect, and beautiful, in this film.  This is a love story rooted in loneliness.  How anyone can be lonely in a crowded city like Tokyo is almost unfathomable, but that is what makes the story so true.  I loved the humor in the imagery, the stark contrasts between these two Americans and their Japanese counterparts.  I especially appreciated the beautiful and refreshing ending.  Anything else would have been a disappointment.  Many people I admire and respect hated this film, and that puzzles me.  I was transfixed yet giggled out loud several times.  Kudos to you, Ms. Coppola, for a beautifully written and directed experience.  I only wish I had shared it with someone I love.

B000002HH2|5.0|If you have never purchased a Bjork album, and are not too sure if you will like her or not, \\"Post\\" will be an excellent indication as if you do or not. The structure of the songs, are usually quite common, although the uniqueness and originality relies on the album's VERY strange and out-there lyrics (perhaps the craziest of Bjork's career), the way the electronic media is used, and of course Bjork's vocal.<br /><br />\\"Army Of Me\\" opens the album very powerfully. It is one of the most accessible songs of Bjork's career, but this does not mean that it is one of the lesser tracks. It is very industrial and electronic. \\"Hyper-ballad\\" follows. I absolutely hated this song at first, but it is now in my top-5-favourite-Bjork-songs list (not that I have one), and continues to grow on me. The intro starts of with a bass synth sound, before acoustic drums are heard, and the wonderful lyric: \\"We live on a mountain, right at the top, there's a beautiful view\\" and so on. Classic. Bjork talks about throwing car parts and cutlery of a mountain, and imagining what the sound would be of her falling of a cliff. Genius. Her lyrically creative and best song, which became her second top 10 hit, and was the fourth single (after \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\") \\"The Modern Things\\" follows and it is another track that I adore. Bjork sings about how all the modern things such as cars and such have always have existed - they just have been hiding inside mountains (and this point you may be beginning to wonder what it is with her and mountains) amongst other bizarre lyrics, and she implies that mechanical things will soon take over the world, if you take the lyrics literally.<br /><br />The 'classic' \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\" follows, and most fans see this song as one of the worst, if not the worst, song Bjork has ever created. It peaked at #4 in the UK, and sold nearly half a million copies there - the single. It was the last song where Bjork used jazz instruments such as saxophones. The song was so popular because it was VERY VERY different without being inaccessible or not radio friendly, the contrast between the verses and the chorus, the great video (her best until Alarm Call), and also the contrasting lyrics. \\"Enjoy\\" is another very loud and industrial song about sex to put it quite simply. It is strange and the best non-single. It is dark and reminds me of 'Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors', by Radiohead, although not as repetitive and distorted. \\"You've Been Flirting Again\\" is such a good song, and my second favourite non-single. It is absolutely beautiful and I love how Bjork performs it live at most of her concerts.

0451169514|5.0|The movie was very good...but since I had read the book before seeing the tv miniseries, the movie paled in comparison! I believe the movie would have been tremendous if produced in full length to go hand in hand with the novel. The book was gripping and suspenseful, one of those you don't want to put down. As always, Stephen King provides vivid detail through his choice of vocabulary and descriptions. This book is an excellent choice! <br />
0553801503|2.0|If you really like this series and have just finished book one or two, stop now - and savor the best that Martin had to offer. Feast for Crows was not only disappointing, but disingenuous.  Without revealing story line, I can say that the author has chosen a path for the continuation of this story that appears designed to sell more books, but not to satisfy his readers.  Shame.  At the end of four books, I have a bad taste in my mouth.
B000002HJD|5.0|For those of who would invoke as a criticism excessive vulgarity or \\"sophomore-ish\\" are completely ignoring the context that this is epic poetry about the American *street*.  And yet there are plenty of high brow cultural references; to wit: \\"Thoughts in time and out of season\\" is a reference to one of Nietzsche's works often translated into English as \\"Thoughts out of Season\\"; of course Jim was obsessed with Nietzsche.  But slang about our body parts cuts straight to the heart of our obessessions - to have ignored said slang would have been to ignore the world that Morrison was immersed in (as our we, once we move past our priggishness).  \\"We cling to c*nts and c*cks of despair\\" is so dead on its not even funny - or should I provide a link to one of the thousands of porn webpages out there?
B000068IEU|4.0|I actually liked this movie. I do not think that the acting sucks...well some of it does but there is also some very strong acting in the film. Anyway, I do not know what the fascination for the 1970's is with many people, but I am one of those who love that decade in particular. I think that pop culture has not really changed ALL that much since then.<br /><br />I was just an innocent teenager in high school who had a fascination with horror films (and still do) when I first rented the movie. I found it very shocking and disturbing, of course. It was a movie that stayed with me for years. I knew even then that the movie was low budget, it had SOME bad acting, and some flaws, but there were also something about it that left a lasting impression on me. I am nothing like the killers of course, and could easily see that I had much in common with character of \\"Mari\\" (another spelling of \\"Mary\\") in the film. I just found it so frightening and disturbing that such people as \\"Krug\\" and his companions could exist in the world. \\"Mari\\" was obviously sheltered and sweet and I think she tended to see the world through rose-colored glasses. The other girl, \\"Phyllis,\\" was much wiser to the ways of the world and much tougher.<br /><br />Of course I do not enjoy seeing rape or violence, but the strongest part of the film is the middle part when the girls are taken to the woods and tormented, raped and eventually murdered. The scene where one of the girls is forced to urinate was very personal and difficult to watch. What a cheap but very effective thing that was.<br /><br />The latter part of the film is more funny than scary. I believe the first part of the film is the weakest and worst part. If one could just get through that (and through the fashions of the times), then it is possible to find some redeeming things about this film. I do not think it's a bad first attempt at a horror film.<br /><br />Also, I liked David Hess as \\"Krug.\\" He did quite well. He had a very strong presence, I thought. Was his music all that bad? \\"The road leads to nowhere\\" (or whatever the title is) sounds very 1970's and dated to me, but the song was actually right for the film, don't ya think? I hated it too when I first heard it, but now I do not think about the music when I watch the film anymore. It is just there in the background.<br /><br />By the way, \\"The Virgin Spring\\" was actually the inspiration for this film (as many of you probably know). Also, the title really has nothing to do with the movie, but I agree that it gives a little bit of an air of intrigue and mystery. So what about the last house on the left? What happens there?

6303471714|4.0|I love and always will love this exercise video. The backdrops are nice, and Cindy is beautiful without being annoying. Plus she is not ultra thin or ultra muscular, she's just healthy and fit. Her figure is inspiring but not completely unattainable. She stays quiet most the time and does not have an annoying voice. The music in this video is really good. Obviously, some of the exercises are probably not recommended, such as head rolls backwards and she does lunge with her knee past her toes. However, do the exercises in proper form, I was lucky enough to learn proper form in gym class. Also, there's a lot of reps packed into a short amount of time, so at times, I pause it between sets so I can take an extra min. to finish at my own pace. The reason why I keep coming back to this video is because it is pleasant to watch, the men in the house will probably watch it with you, and the results speak for themselves. Everytime I do this video 3x a week I see and feel major results. Obviously, don't hurt yourself and throw your back out, don't look to Cindy to have perfect form, just let her lead you through exercises you already know and modify them to fit your fitness capabilities if they're dangerous. I think this video + common sense is a great way to get strength building, fat reducing results.
B000002P5W|5.0|While it is hard to say that any of Jimi's works are underrated, as he was one of music's greatest contributers in the twentieth century, this one certainly does not recieve as nearly as much attention as his debut or his magnum opus,\\"Electric Ladyland\\", but it is one of the most excellent, consistent albums of all time. Every single song, with the exception of the first track, would have been a career peak for most other bands. It contains many of Jimi's trademark songs, such as the title track,\\"Spanish Castle Magic\\",\\"If Six Was Nine\\", and my personal favorite song of all time,\\"Little Wing\\", which is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Don't miss Stevie Ray Vaughan's version as well. All in all, this is an absolutely beautiful album. If you are a fan of classic rock, hard rock,rock, a curious new fan, or just someone who loves music in general, you need this album more than your next breath of air.    Rest in peace, Jimi.
B000C3H4M2|5.0|Talking Heads were, at the time of this album's original release, the hippest band in New York.  The types of people who today champion bands like Animal Collective (groan...) and Gang Gang Dance (yay!) were wetting themselves over the Heads in '79-'80.  I myself was too young to experience this first hand, but thanks to the magic of record stores I discovered that yes, David Byrne & co. were worth all the fuss after all.  Now, thanks to the newfangled magic of dualdisc, a whole new generation can hear for themselves where today's hip bands were inspired by.<br /><br />\\"Fear of Music\\" is arguably not the Heads' greatest album, but it's still my personal favorite (not coincidentally, it's also the first one I heard).  While it's decidedly darker than their previous albums, it's still full of the quirky humor and quirkier rhythms that brought them earlier acclaim.  FOM goes further and deeper, though.  Thanks in part to producer Brian Eno* and a simple desire to experiment, the album introduces non-western music into the mix.  The African rhythms inspired by Fela Kuti are all over opener \\"I Zimbra\\" like herpes on Paris Hilton's nether regions.  The lyrics to that song, mistakenly thought by many to be in some sort of African dialect (pig Swahili, maybe?) are actually an old Dadaist nonsense poem.  Though the African music would definitely become an integral part of the Heads' sound, it wasn't until \\"Remain In Light\\" when they really took over.  As for FOM, the album marked a much greater use of synths and other weird noises.  The lyrics, though for the most part no different in tone than previous efforts, definitely were a bit darker.  Paranoia abounds: In Byrne's satirical world view, we should be wary of everything from \\"Animals\\" (\\"to trust in them/a big mistake\\") to \\"Air\\" (\\"what is happening to my skin?/Where is that protection that I needed?/Air can hurt you too\\").  The apex of all this is the classic, CBGB-referencing \\"Life During Wartime,\\" in which the speaker seems to be trapped in the death throes of civilization itself (\\"The sound of gunfire, off in the distance/I'm getting used to it now\\").  This song was also the closest the band had come at that time to actual funk, though like everything they did, it was a funk of their own devising.<br /><br />The dualdisc edition, in my opinion, is absolute aces.  Some grouches may complain about the 5.1 surround mix, but I think it stays true to Eno and the band's vision for the album.  Heck, it's even more claustrophobic now!  Also, you have the option to listen to the album in it's original mix, albeit remastered, on the audio side as well as the DVD side.  The DVD also offers a pair of cool video clips: \\"I Zimbra\\" and \\"Cities\\" performed live on a German Television show from the early eighties (the appearance was to promote \\"Remain In Light,\\" and more songs from the show can be found on the dualdisc version of that album).  Check out Jerry Harrison rocking a yellow shirt/red pants combination--truly, the 80's were a different time!<br /><br />I will complain, although only a little bit, about the packaging.  While I have no problem with Digipaks, in fact I sort of prefer them, in this case it's a step down from the vinyl edition I bought all those years ago.  the cross-stitch pattern on that was raised and textured, and on the CD it's just flat, which in my opinion defeats the point.  The digipak could have just as easily preserved this, so they kind of dropped the ball here.  The vinyl version also included a lyric sheet; the CD booklet, though it has pictures of David Byrne's notebook from the time, omits them.  Of course, that's what the internet is for, other than porn.  Again, these are just little nit-picks.  Taken as a whole, \\"Fear Of Music\\" is not only as good as ever, but now it may be even a little better.<br /><br />*also be sure to check out the Byrne/Eno collaborative side project, \\"My Life in the Bush of Ghosts.\\"  It's more experimental and plays with all sorts ofAfrican and Arabic music, not to mention heavy use of tape loops that probably influenced what others would soon start doing with samplers.  Not coincidentally, this has also been recently reissued, though not on dualdisc.all sorts of African and Arabic music, not to mention heavy use of tape loops that probably influenced what others would soon start doing with samplers.

B00005JOQS|5.0|First of all, if you want to do any prep work for watching \\"Superman Returns,\\" all you really need to see from the Christopher Reeve series is the 1978 \\"Superman\\" film.  All that matters from the second one is that Lex Luthor has been to Superman's Fortress of Solitude, and the third and fourth films are thankfully flushed from our cinematic memories of the Man of Steel.  However, you have another option in that director Bryan Singer, who came up with the story for the film along with screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, also came up with stories for four \\"Returns Prequel\\" comic books, entitled \\"Krypton to Earth,\\" \\"Ma Kent,\\" Lex Luthor,\\" and \\"Lois Lane.\\"  They work in most of the key elements from the \\"Superman\\" film that matter here.  I have seen several similar comic book prequels, but these are by far the best, reminding us of why Jor-el sent his only son to Earth, and showing us that the world misses Superman but Martha Kent misses her son, how Lex hooked up with Kitty, and why Lois Lane wrote her editorial \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\\"<br /><br />Still, even if you have not seen that \\"Superman\\" recently you will probably recognize a lot of the elements from that film that have made their way in this summer's big blockbuster.  In fact there are so many that there are points where you wonder if \\"Superman Returns\\" is more of a remake than it is a sequel. Lois still cannot spell and still tries to sneak a cigarette, while Superman still saves her, still takes her flying, and is even telling the same jokes as before.  They are still using John Williams' theme music, but that would be a good thing to keep from the first movie.  Fortunately, there are some significant new things to go with the borrowed and the blue (suit).<br /><br />What happened was that when astronomers discovered a planet that could be Krypton, Superman decided he had to travel there to see what happened to his home world.  Five years have passed and before Superman returns it is Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) who comes back to the Daily Planet to find things are different.  Mainly, that Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has two new men in her life, Richard White (James Marsden), the nephew of Perry White (Frank Langella) and an associate editor at the Daily Planet, and their son, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu), who is, interestingly enough, about five years old.  Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), is out of prison, thanks in part to the absence of Superman, and with help from Kitty Kowalski (Parker Posey), gets his hands on some items from Krypton that will make him rich and help him kill Superman.<br /><br />The bottom line is that \\"Superman Returns\\" is better than we expected, which is impressive given how high our expectations where for this film.  I was rather surprised how easily I was willing to accept that Routh was Superman, but he has the attitude down pat.  He tones down both parts from what we saw with Christopher Reeve, but that makes sense given what he spent the last five years doing, even if he does not look like he is five years older.  Bosworth is a much more solid Lois Lane and they really should have ditched the spelling and smoking bits.  Spacey picks up where he left off the last time he played a bald character (i.e., \\"Seven\\"), and makes Lex lethal this time around (plus props for having his credit last so the name of the guy who plays Superman comes first).  But for me the standout character in the movie is Marsden's Richard White, because this guy is good enough for Lois and a hero in his own right in this movie.  This was rather surprising, but a key reason why the movie works.  The character they needed to ditch or rewrite was Posey's Kitty, who is a rehashed Miss Teschmacher, which is not what these movie needed (any more than bringing back Otis).  There is enough comedy that works in this film without needing anybody other than Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) as the comic relief.<br /><br />There are several treats for fans ofSuperman in all of his myriad incarnations.  Noel Neill, who was Lois Lane on television's \\"The Adventures of Superman\\" and Young Lois Lane's mother (on the train) in the 1978 movie, plays Gertrude Vanderworth, Lex Luther's benefactress, while Jack Larson, who played Jimmy Olson on the series, is Bo the Bartender.  The end credits mention the memories of Christopher Reeve and Dana Reeve, but the best homage to his memory (and there are a lot in this film) is when Singer repeats the bit where Superman is flying in space and right before he flies out of the frame he looks into the camera and smiles at us.  That was the quintessential shot of Reeve as Superman.  Just like Jor-el, Marlon Brandon proves that death is not a deterrent and I have to add that while there are some pretty emotional scenes at the end of this one, I flashed on what could have been a fantastic scene between Lois and Martha Kent (Eva Marie Saint) in the last act that would have blown everybody completely away.  But, hey, boys and girls, that is why they make sequels and as long as they ink Singer and this cast and stick to the archetypal vision of Superman, Warner Bros. could have a franchise that will rival Spider-Man (bet they air the trailer for \\"Spider-Man III\\" everywhere they show \\"Superman Returns\\").riad incarnations.

B00005JOQS|4.0|Since others can do a much better job relating the story, I will give my take on the film only from a singular perspective--the Christian messianic take on Superman as 'savior'.<br /><br />First off, I enjoyed the movie. As one who remembers the original Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen from the TV series, it was nice to see them again in cameo roles.<br /><br />The special effects rock--literally. The quakes, shakes, (near) crashes will pound you, and these were well-done. I will not discuss the plot involving Lois, Clark, Lois's husband and son, etc. Other reviewers can do that. But suffice it to say, this is a great story.<br /><br />The film--over 2.5 hours long--is two movies. The first half is the typical (and nicely done) Superman fare. Unlike many, I did not feel the opening sequences lagged. They tied up loose ends, provided retrospection and the acting (all the way through) was great.<br /><br />My only disappointment was the made-to-happen `bonding' between Lois's husband and Clark Kent. Not disappointing because it happened, but because it didn't. It came close at times, but never really materialized. What a shame.<br /><br />The second half of the film was Messianic--to the point of going `over the top' in some instances. This is not a complaint. It would be hard to believe however, that all of this was unintentional. Even the names of the main characters contain the moniker 'El', which is a Hebraism for 'God'. Initially, like Christ, Superman comes to the world unrecognized, unappreciated, and rejected (Lois's \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman\\" wins a Pulitzer Prize).<br /><br />In short, there are crystals (belonging to the destroyed world of Superman's father), which are stolen by the villain Lex Luther. He seeks to create his own 'world' by propagating these crystals in the sea, but he underestimates the proclivity with which the crystals grow. These ever-growing masses even fuse with the kryptonite Luther uses to encase them as they are 'planted'.<br /><br />Superman must save the world from the rapidly growing crystals. But to do so, he must succumb to the power of the deadly kryptonite. He must face the enemy in order to defeat it. In short, we see the hero suffering, dying, departing to the 'underworld', rising from the dead in glory, and finally ascending into the heavens. The messianic overtones (or undertones) are as obvious as the twice-repeated \\"...the father becomes the son; the son becomes the father\\", and the father's words \\"They (humanity) only need the light to guide them. I sent you, my only son.\\". Christ, of course, is the 'Light of the world'. One can hardly miss the father to son: \\"...you will never be alone\\", much as Christ claimed co-eternity with His Father.<br /><br />For those seeking theology in the film, it is not easy to miss the crystals as 'sin'. As Satan perverted that which was meant for good from the Father's world, so Luther steals the crystals. Both the crystals and Satan's deception in Eden involve that which was to make one 'wise'. Too, as evil lurked in that first garden with Adam and Eve, and confronted Christ in Gethsemane, His garden place of solitude, so the evil Lex Luther stole the crystals from Superman's place of solitude.<br /><br />The prevalence and permeation of sin in the world is the pictured in the crystals' growth which becomes virtually out of control. And embedded within is the deadly kryptonite--the sting of sin--death. Superman, in seeking to be the savior, is seemingly defeated by Luther (Satan) and the cruel mistreatment at the villain's hand is reminiscent of Christ's torture by the Romans, and in a similar vein, the torture of Aslan by the White Witch in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.<br /><br />At last, Superman is stabbed by Luther with one of the deadly crystals, and, like Christ, \\"tastes the sting of death and sin\\", though He is innocent. There is a descent into the deep 'abyss' of the sea, (although this is not the final death scene) reminding one of Christ's descent into the belly of the earth. But Superman will eventually return and rid the planet of this evil by lifting the entire thorny-appearing, dark  crystal 'world' skyward (Christ being `lifted up' and bearing the sin of the world), and separating it forever from the earth he loves.<br /><br />In the end, the empty hospital room where Superman dies screams 'empty tomb!'. Like Christ, even his clothing lies neatly folded beside him. But the hero gloriously ascends from death into the clouds after reminding those who would miss him: \\"I'm always around\\", much as Christ's \\"I am with you always\\".<br /><br />I won't give away the scenes and plot twists that made this film enjoyable, but it's impossible to miss the messianic overtones.ally return and rid the planet of this evil by lifting the entire thorny-appearing, dark  crystal 'world' skyward (Christ being `lifted up' and bearing the sin of the world), and separating it forever from the earth he loves.

B0000A0DRY|5.0|Unlike, say, the Doors or the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Jefferson Airplane really is a \\"'sixties band.\\" The group's hippie ethos was and remains omnipresent, the very core of its sociomusical importance. Thus it is that the Airplane's most celebrated and probably greatest album, SURREALISTIC PILLOW, sounds a lot more dated now than many other classic records from 1967 - though still less so than SERGEANT PEPPER. But as even a cursory listen proves, the flower children had a lot more to offer than free love and cheap acid.      Right from the heavily reverbed drums opening \\"She Has Funny Cars,\\" PILLOW is a powerfully expansive and entertaining experience, and its overt sense of its own time and place does nothing to weaken it. The hard-rocking \\"Somebody to Love\\" is still a rousing blend of psychedelic swagger and pop accessibility, \\"D.C.B.A. 25\\" a lovely folk-rock gem which can wring a nostalgia for the Summer of Love even from one who wasn't there. It's a pair of beautiful ballads, however - \\"Today\\" and the magnificent \\"Comin' Back to Me\\" - which are really the album's highlights. Singer Marty Balin's lovely, emotive tenor has never quite gotten the credit it deserves; but his performances on these two songs make clear that it was he, rather than the overhyped Grace Slick, who truly was the voice of Jefferson Airplane. Not that Slick doesn't do some fair work of her own, on flute and keyboards as well as at the mike: \\"White Rabbit\\" may sound corny from the smarmy vantage of 2006, but put it up against any of the tripe currently being peddled as worthwhile music on FM radio and it's nothing less than high art.     This 2003 remaster of PILLOW sounds good - though not great, perhaps, as the original album appears to have been rather muddily recorded - and adds seven bonus tracks, a couple of which are indeed good enough to have been on the LP itself. Hippie or not, you're sure to find something you like here, as people have been doing for nearly forty years. Peace!
0307276902|3.0|This is a good read, but don't bother if you are looking for help for someone with addictions or insights on how to cope. There is some accurate information, for instance, that an abuser of alcohol or drugs, after stopping the abuse, will most often start again at the same intensity that he or she left off.  However, such truths are often lost in the interactions of characters who think they are above the rules, and outside the need to apply what they are presented during their various sessions.  They seem less like adults seeking help and more like junior high students quietly tuned out to the real reason they are there. The petty power struggles and illicit romances take priority. While Frey acknowledges that only an extremely small percentage of those in rehab will make it to sobriety and maintain it, his take on how to kick his own addictions (just quit) is exactly the road to failure that many alcoholics and addicts take. His character rarely fully accepts any of the treatment, and never subscribes to some of its most important tenets, yet we are led to believe that he has since remained sober. An alcoholic or addict in that situation would be back to using.  The characters are interesting enough, the writing style is enjoyable to read, but this book is to addictions treatment what The DaVinci Code is to biblical history.
B0002PUHF6|5.0|IM GLAD I WAS ABLE TO SEE A FILM THAT I SAW ALMOST 16 YEARS AGO. I WAS HAPPY TO HAVE PURCHASED IT.
B0002A2WDQ|3.0|Imagine Karate Kid in the context of a wannabe rock star and you have Crossroads. He plays a \\"good guy\\" role again by rescuing an old man from a convalescent home, a girl from self-desecration and his soul from being lost to the devil by allegedly playing better (with classical music, no doubt) than a smokin' fast guitar player from the hairspray 80's. I was disenchanted by the fact that like most Hollywood movies, the actor never really played any of the music you think you see him playing; that's the fantasy of movies, but I would have preferred seeing a real musician take the role of a guitar player than air-guitarist pretending to play better than Steve Vai. I only recommend this movie if you're easily moved and inspired. :)

0671027344|5.0|If I could rate this book more than 5 stars I would. It is simply un-comparable to any of its time or before it. Some may see the similarities of the angst filled stories with books such as J.D. Salinger's Cathcer and the Rye. Yet it doesn't even compare the the wholeness of this book. Buy it, read it, you will be changed for ever. <br /> <br />****SPOILER**** <br /> <br />To all you idiots out there who don't think Charlie is ill. You are both wrong and right. Charlie is ill, but not in a Depressive, or Bipolar, or Schizophrenic sense. He was molested by his Aunt Helen and it severely traumatized him. I can't believe you people missed one of the most important aspects of the book.

1572704225|5.0|Marie G's review credited this read to Jonathon Cecil, who is an outstanding reader of the Wodehouse Series.  But the particular version of Right Ho that I heard (and the one I believe can be ordered here at Amazon) is actually read by Ian Carmichael.  Not to worry, however, Mr Carmichael does a wonderful job, and his reading is very similar to Mr. Cecil.  Here you will not find the \\"over simpering\\" versions as read by Frederick Davidson or the \\"under inspired\\" readings of Simon Vance.  If you like Cecil, you will enjoy Carmichael. And the tale is one of the best!
0684801558|4.0|Fitzgerald is at his best in his brilliant and subtle characterizations in this book. He has a terrific grasp of his characters and finds ways to make them realistic. The problem with his characters is that none of them are really likable. I am sure not even Fitzgerald himself thought the characters to be particularly sympathetic. Maybe this was his aim, but it prevents the reader from getting overly involved in the work. I found myself rooting against the main characters, and really all the characters, because they were so egocentric and pompous. It is brillaint writing, no doubt about that, but it is hard to really love a book when the characters are ALL so hatable.  <br />It is also a rather depressing and bleak look at society. So too is the Great Gatsby, but this one does not seem to have that certain charm that makes you love it. Despite Gatsby's and Nick's flaws they were mostly sympathetic characters. <br />Don't get me wrong, this was a really enjoyable and interesting book, but just could not quite grasp its own epic aims.

We've waited long enough for this much sought after concert in Pink Floyd history and this bunch of so-called \\"Mr. Righteous\\" have no appreciation at all whatsoever. What a total shame! In fact, clueless on when and where to shut up. Regardless, the true fans are out there and they'll certainly endorse this DVD 100%.

0393327655|5.0|This book was excellent.  Whether you \\"believe\\" him or not...the book makes sense.  What a novel idea, look at the world and the universe in a way that makes sense. I can't say he wrote anything that I haven't thought about before.   <br /> <br />Ethics.  It's something this world needs more of.  It's something at the very least that should be talked about.  Anyone who has a nasty review for this book, must have checked their brain at the door before reading it.   <br /> <br />Sam Harris asks alot of questions regarding faith & dogmatic religion.  Why shouldn't he?  Why shouldn't we all?  Religion  & all dogmatic faiths get a free ride.  When things go our way it's \\"Thank the Lord\\".  When things go bad it's \\"The Lord works in mysterious ways.\\"  That's never really worked for me. <br /> <br />This is a must read.  Read the book with your eyes & your brains.  You may not like the words or some of the ideas, BUT at the very least you'll see there is another way of looking at the world.  People of all religions & faith forget they are free to think.  That's the last thing organized religion wants from it's flock.  Don't think.  Just do.  That doesn't work for everyone.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|After being recommended this movie on three different Internet recommendation engines, being told to see it by a good friend, and having half a dozen other people mention it, I figured I had to get around to seeing it.  This is generally not a good way to go about seeing a movie because either one's hopes are too high or one wants to dislike it just so that everyone can stop talking about it.<br /><br />But I liked it.  It's a pretty tight psychological thriller, involving a pretty typical storyline about alterations to the past causing the future to to turn out in \\"unexpected ways\\"... rarely ever the way the protagonist really wants it to be. \\"I'll make everything perfect!\\" he decrees.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher is an interesting actor.  I think he's a lot like Keira Knightley: both of them CAN act, it's just that if the director doesn't tell them to they won't.  However, this movie shows Kutcher's one-up to Knightley in that he actually did act in this one, and Knightley has yet to fully embrace a role (but I haven't seen all of her movies, so who knows on that part).<br /><br />Anyway, I think the biggest thing that prevented me from giving this movie a higher score is the way the children are presented.  I know that children can be damaged, and can do extreme and horrific things, but oftentimes I have a hard time accepting a movie where they find each other and end up the whole group of them hurting each other.  It's hard to explain, but it's the same reason why I don't really accept a lot of the contemporary cop dramas... there seems a need in those to get some mentally damaged woman with a completely differently mentally damaged man, and then work out this intricate plot involving how their mental problems cause this huge crime but also hide it in layers of mental instability.  Same thing here, I find it pretty difficult to accept four kids from three different families all with their completely separate lives coming together to create specific incident which one just happens to be able to twist around.  More than making the story unbelievable, it's a matter of making it seem as if everybody out there is some insane psychopath ready to explode in the right situation...  when actually psychopaths are generally kind of rare.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBhich one just happens to be able to twist around.

B000E8LQQA|3.0|This book is well-received and I really wanted to like it. I really wanted to. But compared to other India/Middle Eastern immigrant novels, it just left me cold. Head and Dust, Namesake, and even The Kite Runner were more compelling for me. Still, many readers may get something out of this book. It's not without any merit. <br />Brick Lane centers around a young Bangladeshi woman who marries an older man living in London (also Bangladeshi) as part of an arranged marriage. She is brought from her small village to the big city of London where she slowly evolves from a young, sheltered, and shy child to a woman who knows her mind and can assert herself. <br />Part of you wants to yell, \\"You go girl!\\" It can't be easy for a Middle Eastern woman for whom repression has become normalcy to break free. And for that, I enjoyed the book. It also taught be about the Muslim religion and point of view, particularly surrounding the 911 attacks. For that, it also has value. Somehow, in the middle of it all, though, I just stopped caring about any of the characters. The characterization was better than average -- the plot somewhat predictable but interesting nevertheless. And yet. <br /> <br />One of the problems I had with the book was that somewhere in the middle, the main character's journey becomes muddled, the plot goes off on some tangents, and the power of the book's message becomes diluted. Surely, it shows a sampling of a life repression for females in her situation and the Muslim's community's conundrums in London. However, the book is not streamlined with quite the adeptness it needs to carry off the complexities and layers that it had the potential to reveal. I had many of the same issues with The Kite Runner. The Kite Runner had a more compelling plot, though. Would I recommend the book? With reservations. To whom: To those interested in the immigrant's journey. To those interested in learning about the complex Middle Eastern / Muslim perspective. To those who enjoy aninteresting story unriddled with philosophical waxing. Did it change my life? Surprisingly, yes... though not because I love the book. I found the perspective on those of Muslim faith/background extremely informative and crucial to my gaining an understanding on world politics. It's a not a bad book. It's just not what I consider a great one. If I had been motivated (and should have been) to learn about the political aspects of the book, I could have done so by reading articles and non-fiction books.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Lady and the Trap has been an enduring Disney classic for 50 years now and it's amazing how well it holds up after all that time.  The hand painted animation is beautiful and the story and music are top notch.  This film is an example of Disney animation at its classic best.   <br /> <br />But calling Lady and the Tramp a great animated film is really selling it short.  It's a great MOVIE, period.  Lady's idyllic life is shattered and bad boy Tramp comes to her rescue.  While he begins his relationship with Lady in the dog house (sorry, couldn't resist), he slowly redeems himself in her eyes and love conquers all in the end.  If you've seen any romantic comedies from the last several years and compare it to this movie you'll realize that a story about two dogs is actually more romantic and more funny than virtually any similar film featuring humans.  Watch Lady and the Tramp and you'll know why this film is still so loved after 50 years. <br /> <br />
B000F5GNX8|4.0|This is genre-bending noirish dark comedy at its self-referential best.  I had a lot of fun watching this film, and laughed out loud more than I have in a long time.  Val Kilmer and Robert Downey, Jr. are at the top of their game; the script is clever; and writer Shane Black pulls it off in his directorial debut.  They were enjoying themselves when they made this film, and it shows!  This is the kind of movie I was expecting when I watched the \\"Ice Harvest\\" -- while there were elements of that film that worked the whole left a bad taste in my mouth, even the funny elements seemed serious and forced.  In kiss kiss bang bang it all came together -- and worked, even at moments that should not have been funny (like a finger getting slammed OFF in a door, and then a dog eating the finger).  Nothing brilliant, nothing profound, just well-made solid madcap dark laughter enjoyment.
B000002AGE|5.0|Weather Report's \\"Heavy Weather\\" is the best album to come out of the jazz fusion genre of the mid 1970's (with the possible exception of Herbie Hancock's \\"Headhunters\\").  Wayne Shorter from the Miles Davis Quintent (Miles himself being an innovator in this genre) and classicaly trained keyboardist Joey Zawinul teamed up with virtuoso bassist Jaco Pastorius to create the brilliantly produced tracks for the album.  It is interesting to note that this album is actually less of a jazz album in the strictest sense, and more of a pop/dance album.  \\"Heavy Weather\\" proved that a pop/dance album could be completely instrumental, full of improvised solos based on jazz idioms, and feature every member of the group interacting in a dynamic fashion.  Jaco's solos on Birdland (the resonant and beautiful pinging harmonics of the opening riff were executed in only two takes!) and Zawinul's intensely orchestrated keyboard playing did tend to overshadow Wayne Shorter, who actually became something of a sideman in this record.  Despite the fact he was limited to playing excerpts here and there, however, Shorter was still an integral leader of the ensemble, and would continue to do so, even after Jaco had left the group.  It cannot be denied, however, that the presence of a musician as innovative and fresh to the ear as Jaco is really what made this album a near perfect work of art.  Also notable is the addition of not one, but two percussionists, Alex Acuna (mostly drumset)and Manola Badrena covering all the other percussion instruments.  The choice of Latin drummers/percussionists over more traditional jazz drummers (such as Elvin Jones) greatly added to the fusion/dance vibe of the record.  The modern sound that was being forged on this album required two percussionists that could hold down dance grooves while interacting with the other members of the ensemble.   <br />There may never be a better combination of musicians on one album.  Despite the fact that Weather Report would dwindle down in innovation and popularity as the 1980's approached, this album stands as a testimony to the brilliant combination of world beats, dance rhythms, jazz harmonies and melodies, and a very produced but real and musical sound.
B000A88EV4|5.0|I saw this at what I believe was it's European premiere in Edinburgh. It was like watching a beautifully choreographed car crash - sublime yet horrifying. It's heart is black. It casts no light. Mike Leigh's vision of the human condition is here presented in so bleak a light that it can only corrode anyone who watches it. I recall that it made me feel physically sick at the time and I described it as the antithesis of everything I believe art should be - yet it is, undoubtebly, art. It is a work of brilliance which does not shine. A black, black, diamond. Yet I still believe it should never have been made. Most people live in hope; this film denies that. Whilst there are some who recognise the nihilistic world it presents, most will be shocked by it - and it's greatest disservice is presenting the world as it is to a majority which will deny it, and live their squinting lives not seeing because of it. A work of too, too, accurate brillance.
1401207138|5.0|And it is scarry now.  This comic has been called the greatest graphic novel ever written and with good reason.  It is at once a retelling of history and warning for the future.  A warning that came true september 11 2001.  This is comic book writing at its best and scariest.  Post 9-11 it is impossible not see parallels.  It is cruel, disheartening, and truely stagering to think that this was produced in 1986. It is truely scarry that for all intents and purposes what happened in this comic really happened in real life.  There was really an attack on new york, real people died.  And the response in the comic book is really the same as what happened 9-12.<br /><br />Perhaps no comic, no graphic novel, and no manga of the past 30 years has held critics and fans so entranced as Watchmen.  Our fear of the future is as palpable as the fear of the dark. We all fear what we can't understand.  The truth of this graphic novel then is not lost on those that chose to listen.
B000002KYR|1.0|Yes this is ZZ Top and no it's not a bit like 'tres hombre' or 'rio grande' this is where the lil band from Texas sold out big time. Sure the girls are great in the video's but so what? the songs stink 'legs' being the absolute pits of that trilogy with its irritating drum beat sounding like a machine with no emotion. Even Billy Gibbons ferocious soloing is toned down. Sure this album made big bucks but so what? it sucks from beginning to end, no wonder teens brought it in droves it hardly would appeal to lovers of 'la grange' If you're looking for high octane boogie forget it, if you're looking for something that people who don't really like rock, but feel they have to have something slightly rocky, be my guest.

0670034711|3.0|I love reading books on personal travel experiences (eg Paul Theroux) so I really looked forward to reading this book.  It was an interesting concept.  She kind of lost me when every opportunity was taken to bash conservatives in general and Republicans in particular.  If I were on a spiritual quest or looking for inner peace, politics would be the last thing I'd be commenting on. So I started to question how sincere her quest really was. Was she looking for true meaning or was it just a fun way to spend the year, add more characters to her repertoire and make some money?  Even by her own admission (specifically in the segment where she compares herself to her very thorough sister) she is a person who tends to skim the surface of life, taking the good and avoiding the difficult. Fun maybe, anecdotal--but not instructive. Not the kind of person I would seek out for special insights or true wisdom.  I'm sure she is right when she says she makes friends easily, but the more important question (to me) would be \\"does she keep them?\\"
B000001FT2|5.0|Grace Jones is a very unique artist-and I used the term art because I cannot think of another word to describe the sound she achieved in Nassau in the early 80's with Sly & Robbie in the recording studio.It's a tough,stripped down sound-based loosley in reggae and caribbean styles but spice up with modern electronics,some light drum programming and very chilly atmospherics.Her menacing title cover of Iggy Pop is just that-creepy with no warmth or sentimentality.The albums basic sound is based summed up in \\"Walking In The Rain\\" in which Grace talk sings the lyrics.The hit here is \\"Pull Up To The Bumper\\" and that is a catchy contemporary funk tune with an interesting rigid beat.\\"Libertango\\" is another highlite because it's partically sung in French (a Jones trademark by this time) and the music defies classification.She then tackles \\"Use Me\\" and \\"Demolition Man\\"-channeling more the aggression in the songs vocally along along with the rhythm section's attack.\\"I've Done It Again\\" is another crowning achievment-a ballad featuring her best vocals (and that is saying A LOT) and another great poignant,unsentimentalized lyric.Grace Jones is just a musical artist and vocal painter with a lot of flair and a rebellious temperment.In the case of 'Nightclubbing' she is also more then willing to let everyone come along for the ride.And it certainly is a ride worth taking.

B00005JOQS|5.0|This is an incredibly fantasic film! It's also a scathing critique of greed and avarice by the rich and powerful! The very obvious Christian imagery is absolutley delightful. The complexities of true erotic love are dealt with in heart rendering fashion. The passion to do good in the world, even at great personal risk, is clearly shown. Superman is truly the ultimate social activist!<br /><br />Lex Luther represents brilliant insanity, plus the foibles of the super rich and powerful. In the real world we call these people the ruling elite: billionaires, multi-millionaires, CEO's, rulers, generals, on and on. In the beginning we see a super wealthy heiress signing all her wealth over to Lucky Lex because he gave her \\"such pleasure.\\" Despite the fact his evil reputation proceeded him. When Lucky Lex finally obtains incredible wealth, what does he do with it? He raids the Universe's equivalent of the Library of Alexander. The greatest single library the world has ever known. What is Lunatic Luther's primary goal with such incredible knowledge and wisdom from 50 worlds? It's to make huge amounts of money at the expense of the environment and the people living there. Hello! Does this remind you of anybody? How about the huge transnational corporations and their allies in government & academia, along with the super powerful people who guide them along! Where environmental regulation and protecting the public's health is turned into the enemy! Sure Lex Luther is a caricature, but that does not lesson the impact of the underlying message!<br /><br />Now what does Supernman do with his God-like powers? Does he pal around with the sane super rich? No! How about hobnob with celebrities of various kinds? Not worth his time! Does he seek political power? Nope! Does he become a hermit and lock himself away in the monastary? You got to be kidding! Does he legitimately seek wealth for his own personal gain? Capitalism holds no interest for him! Does he surround himself with a harem of the most beautiful and available women in the world? Sorry! He knows what true love is all about, and it's not skin deep!<br /><br />Instead he's an average middle class guy. Of all the careers in the world to choose from he decides to be a journalist. A job, which for most, pays only a modest salary. Our hero seeks no glory, no power, no fame, no fortune!<br /><br />When Clark Kent becomes Superman, does he favor one country over the other? No! He's interested in helping those in need throughout the entire world. He does not discriminate! He sees the human race as one!<br /><br />My favorite line in the entire movie is when Superman confronts Lois Lane about her award-winning piece on \\"Why The World Does Not Need Superman.\\" Our hero tells his favorite reporter, \\"You say the world does not need a savior but I hear (literally) a world crying for one!\\" Wow! One of the most profound things I have heard out of Hollywood in a long, long time! Forget the obvious allusion to Judaism and Christianity for a moment. If we are honest with ourselves, don't most of us wish for some God-like being, that's both incredibly powerful, and who is motivated by pure love and wisdom to help straighten out this very troubled world? Until now, I never realized how absolutely brilliant the Superman story truly is!<br /><br />Erotic love is also sensitively portrayed. Clark Kent has feelings, and he's incredibly brave! All's fair in love and war is not Superman's philosophy. He respects Lois and her boyfriend, even if it means a profound loneliness. In real life love and relationships can get quite complicated. It's important to realize we all have choices, and the capacity to do what is right!<br /><br />Superman shows by example how we all can make the world a better place! His powers give him a mind-boggling array of choices with how he spends his free time! So how does he spend every available free moment? Saving lives, fighting crime, rescueing people from disasters and literally listening to the cry of humanity. He's a reporter of the truth, a humanitarian, an idealist, and a lover!<br /><br />May we all be a little like Superman in our own lives!ruth, a humanitarian, an idealist, and a lover!     May we all be a little like Superman in our own lives!
B000FGGE68|5.0|First things first, Equilibrium was ok but was probably Christian Bales worst movie. It was a total B movie. Not Freejack B but still B. And that story had been done before. You can't compare it to this at all.<br /><br /> Ultraviolet is digital-live-action-anime pure and simple. It is not a sci-fi movie at all. If you like anime you will like this.<br /><br /> The great thing about this is that you can sit back and enjoy an action packed ride from beginning to end.

We stopped after the corny evil leader shooting 3 of the 4 trapped hemophages, one in the mouth, one in the eye, one in the ear -- the speak no evil, see no evil, hear no evil -- about it made us actually crack up laughing for about 3 minutes.  Who knew it was actually a comedy?
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alica is so talented.  I love her voice.  Its so powerful and soulful.  The problem with other very talented artists is that they dont have very good material (ie- chritina agulara).  not the case with alica.  i did not like her first cd.  it was a little more typical R&B.  but this time around i can really see that she has grown up.  This cd has so many solid songs in it that it is totally worth the price.  the dvd is a little boring and not needed.  its just her going to hotels and in her car and stuff.  thats not why i gave it 5 stars.  all 5 stars are for alica and her great music.  i just hope her next cd is just as good.
B00005JOQS|5.0|It's taken more than a decade to get the Man of Steel, The Man of Tomorrow, and the Big Blue Wonder to find his way back onto the big screen. After the debacle that was Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, it would be understandable that many people would be skeptical going into Superman Returns, the first film in the franchise since 1987. But now, in 2006, Bryan Singer has done what many comic book and film fans have been hoping for with the treatment of Superman - he's restored the magic, respectability and wonder to the character. <br /> <br />Clocking in at a nearly-epic 2 hours and 34 mins, Singer and company return to the world of Metropolis, where Superman has seemingly disappeared for close to 5 years without a trace. The world has moved on when Superman finally does make a return, a shock to the world, and even more of a shock to his love - Lois Lane. But being a part of the world, of course, Lois has also moved on - becoming engaged to the boss's son, and raising a child, placing Superman and Clark Kent in a very unusual situation. <br /> <br />In today's world, where almost every comic book hero has seemingly had a film introducing him or her to today's audience, the return of the original superhero is a very welcome change to the madness. Singer manages to seamlessly combine various elements of action, romance, suspense, drama, and emotional depth that will have even the most hardcore and uncompromising of fans to appreciate this adaptation. The fact that we've had a full generation go without a Superman film makes the return even more of a welcome. <br /> <br />One man that should definitely be accepting the Superman welcome is the relative unknown handpicked by Singer to portray the Man of Steel - Brandon Routh. Routh, while having a very tough act to follow in Christopher Reeve, portrays the role of Superman and Clark Kent with the plenty of confidence. While he still has to get comfortable filling those red boots, his charm and like-ability can make a lot of us believe that Routh really could be Superman. Some may warm-up to him more than others, but it's pretty much been solidified - Brandon Routh is Superman. <br /> <br />And behind Routh is a cast that can, at times, be deemed nearly hit-or-miss. But a few of the casting errors are more than made up for by Kevin Spacey, who portrays the Lex Luthor role with superb cheekiness, as well as embracing the twisted, megalomaniacal genius that makes the character of Lex Luthor such an enduring adversary to the Man of Steel. His performance, alone, gives the film just the right element of chaos and comedy usually associated with such a comic book film. <br /> <br />The casting of Kate Bosworth in the role of Superman's main lover, Lois Lane, is a bit of a questionable. Bosworth definitely brings the spice and ferociousness that makes Lois such a reputable reporter, but at times can seem a bit rigid for much of the film. At times, during the more emotional scenes, Bosworth does manage to put through the right of emotion to give the scene its impact. But, at times, it does seem like she's holding something back. For what it's worth, Bosworth does a good enough job to get her through the film, and bring a bit more character to the new and refined Lois Lane. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the remainder of the cast plays their roles with wonderful results. Sam Huntington does a good job of portraying the role of the geeky, anxious photographer in Jimmy Olsen, as does Frank Langella playing the cool, newspaper aficionado boss of The Daily Planet in Perry White. And Parker Posey does a wonderful job of playing Lex Luthor's right-hand goon in Kitty Kowalski. Think of a second Miss Teschmacher, except a bit more involved, a bit dumber, and a bit more torn about Lex's plots to kill millions of innocent people. Correction: Make that BILLIONS of innocent people! With the return of a superhero this caliber, the main priority placed on this film by a lot of people were the use of the special effects - which are used expertly in this film. While these effects may not be anything groundbreaking, the visual of a man effectively soaring through the air with such grace would give just about anybody a thrill. Something Bryan Singer uses to his advantage and carries the film through some invigorating action sequences. It does just what it's supposed to do - it makes you believe that a man can fly, again. That's all that matters. <br /> <br />Superman Returns is not an attempt at reinventing, remodeling or modernizing the Man of Steel. Instead, it's a film that reintroduces some of the elements that we loved about the Richard Donner Superman film(s), while also giving winks and nods to the die-hard comic book fans, as well. Even though the Superman character may turn 60 years old in 2008, the character seems just as timeless as ever here in the 21st century. <br /> <br />Sure, you'll have your Spider-Mans and Batmans, but you'll only have one Superman. Singer unique and exclusive vision of the Man of Steel in the new millennium makes the character all the more relevant today. With it's amazing blend of action, emotion, drama, comedy and thrills, Superman Returns has a quality of class that very few action films will ever have the chance of equaling.
B00006G8G1|3.0|Anyone who has ever seen Iron Maiden live knows that they are one of the greatest live acts on the planet. They have energy, flash, and enough killer songs to fill up a two-hour set with no problems. Rock in Rio is their first attempt to bring this unbelievable experience home on DVD. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite grab the live Maiden experience, mainly because of the setlist.  <br /> <br />By no means is Rock in Rio a bad performance. The classics present here are given fiery renditions by the current six-piece Maiden lineup. On the standards like The Trooper, The Number of the Beast, and Hallowed Be Thy Name, the awesome power of live Maiden is impossible to doubt. The problem is that the set is bogged down with so much crap. Brave New World, the new album at the time, is disproportionately represented to say the least. In the interest of completeness, Maiden kill about 20 minutes of potentially incredible set time to play out-and-out crap from the Blaze Bayley albums - 20 minutes that could have been used to put some other neglected classics like Still Life or Killers into the show. This is a bad move, and it does major damage to the set. <br /> <br />Also, despite having a quarter of a million screaming Brazilians in attendance, the DVD is shot on low-quality fullscreen video. A performance of this immensity demands widescreen presentation, like AC/DC did for their Donington show in 1991.  <br /> <br />For the Maiden faithful, Rock in Rio is essential. It shows a newly reunited Maiden before a great audience, playing their classics very well. Unfortunately, the weak setlist choices just murder the potential intensity of the show. Maiden hardcores and casual fans alike will be far more pleased with the superlative History of Iron Maiden DVDs. Take it or leave it.
4893580914|5.0|We just used this textbook for an intensive six week summer course in basic kanji. I found the textbook well-organized and a good introduction to 250 of the most basic kanji. I particularly like the presentation of the lessons and the way the course-book was organized in terms of reinforcing the kanji through the lessons for each set of kanji (after the initial introduction and writing exercises for each lesson, there are good and useful lessons and reviews of common applications of the kanji). <br /> <br />I plan on buying the next volume and continuing my kanji lessons as I continue on with the 200 level Japanese lessons.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|During their early days from 1980 to 1983, Iron Maiden was most likely the greatest metal act on the planet. This double DVD catalogs that time in enthralling detail. Three shows, a 90-minute documentary, and a host of other goodies make this one of the most complete DVDs ever produced for a band. The DVD is a fantastic buy for its price, and the material is essential for any metal fan. Buy this now. <br /> <br />If you still need more convincing, think on this. Three shows are included on Disc 1 from each of the three years between 1981-83. Live at the Rainbow, the first show, is a half-hour sprint through Maiden's earliest, punkiest material featuring original frontman Paul Di'Anno. Di'Anno turns in a great show here, and makes you wish he was still with Maiden - until you see the 1982 Beast over Hammersmith show, with Bruce Dickinson. Maiden's classic singer is a bit younger, less assured during this show than he would be later on, but he does do well enough to make you forget all about Di'Anno. By the 1983 World Piece tour, which is catalogued in the third video, Maiden is at the peak of their powers, and the concert reflects that. All three shows are more than worthy, though the Hammersmith show is a bit low-res.  <br /> <br />Disc 2 is where many Maiden fans will find themselves fixated. The centerpiece is the 90-minute History of Iron Maiden, Part 1 documentary, which sets a new gold standard for band trivia and minutiae. The documentarians take 8 years of Maiden and find many former members that even Maiden hardcores will never have heard of, now looking like respectable British citizens but proud of their time with one of the all-time great rock bands. The story is captivating, the anecdotes are often hilarious, and it will leave you calling your bandmates for practice (if you have any). Also included are a circa-1980 British TV documentary on the band, the long-lost Live at the Ruskin Arms concert, all the band's music videos from the period, and an extensive gallery of Steve Harris' scrapbook.  <br /> <br />Maiden fans cannot miss with this DVD, and more general metal fans will find themselves enthralled as well. The only reason not to want this DVD is if you absolutely can't stand the music - but even if you don't like Maiden, you stand a chance of being won over. Strongly, strongly recommended.
B00005YJMX|4.0|I don't think I've ever seen this many rats in a movie before.  Werner Herzog's NOSFERATU, his remake of F.W. Murnau's 1922 classic Dracula story, is lousy with rats.  Nice and relatively placid white rats, for the most part - someplace somewhere says Herzog was unable to get his hands on buckets of brown rats, the creepy, feral kind, and so he trucked in white lab rats and dipped them (sometimes) in brown dye.  The rats are, I suppose, one arm of Dracula's army, the biological warfare arm that spreads disease and gnaws away from within at man and his creations.  Whatever, placid or not, seeing hundreds of rat milling around is unsettling.  Not quite as unsettling, though, as Klaus Kinski's Count Dracula.  There seems to be two great cinematic streams flowing from Bram Stoker's novel.  One has a sophisticated, sexy and urbane count whose headwaters is Bela Lugosi.  The other has a feral and unearthly count, the kind that originated with Max Schreck in Murnau's film.  With his pointy teeth, bald pate and misshapen ears Kinski's Dracula is very much in the latter camp.  In fact, in structure and even in some shots Herzog's film is very similar to Murnau's.  Kinski's Dracula is by turns predatory and pathetic, always creepy and thoroughly convincing.<br /><br /> Herzog's NOSFERATU is an international production and one version was filmed in English.  A good thing if you don't like messing with sub-titles, although the accents tend to get thick at times and subtitles in any language aren't included.  Bruno Ganz (German) and Isabell Adjani (French) play that most unfortunate of all upwardly mobile young couples, Jonathan and Lucy Harker.  The eager and naively ambitious Jonathan travels to Transylvania to sell the count a house across the street from his in Wismar.  Lucy is the stay at home bride whose psychic and spiritual connection with her husband is so strong that even miles apart she wakes with a frightened start when Drac goes a-dining at Caf&eacute; de Jon's Jugular.<br /><br /> Herzog's NOSFERATU is weird and moody, atmospheric and familiar, visually stunning at times, as deliberately paced as a snail crawling over a sand dune.  If you have the patience to track a slow-moving horror movie you could do a lot worse..   <br /> <br /> Herzog's NOSFERATU is weird and moody, atmospheric and familiar, visually stunning at times, as deliberately paced as a snail crawling over a sand dune.

B00030590I|4.0|I was looking forward very much to seeing \\"Hero\\" when it was shown in certain movie theaters in the United States. I bought the DVD version and have seen it several times. This movie has a rather complex plot, which is neither necessarily good or bad, but necessitates for many of us seeing the film again to better understand the actual \\"truth\\" of the events presented. <br /> <br />   Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi are my two favorite Chinese actresses and I was very happy to see both of them in this movie, although Zhang Ziyi has a mostly supporting role. One of the most notable aspects of \\"Hero,\\" as noted by many reviewers is how Zhang Yimou, the director, uses vibrant colors through certain segments in the movie. The special effects, especially the use of arrows, is somewhat overdone, but the movie, as a whole, is very good and worthwhile watching again and again. However, as far as Chinese action films go, I think \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and \\"House of the Flying Daggers\\" are better.   <br /> <br />   I was not overly impressed by the character \\"Nameless,\\" played by Jet Li. Given his tragic family background and the determination of the king of Qin to conquer Zhao, his homeland, his rationale for sparing the live of the future first Qin emperor is quite implausible. I do not mind the patriotic aspects of the film, relating to \\"our land,\\" and this Chinese patriotism is not really propaganda, certainly no more so than certain celebrated American films.  <br /> <br />  My main criticism of \\"Hero\\" is it should have shown the king of Qin for the villian he really was. The king of Qin was very ruthless, his rigid Legalist governing approach and determination to use military force to unite China led to repression and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of human beings. The first Qin emperor has been properly considered by most Chinese and American historians as being a cruel tyrant, responsible for widespread suffering among intellectuals and the common people.
0345409671|5.0|The Good, the Bad, and the Undead The Vampire Lestat never fails to please. As usual Anne Rice is on top of her game. Menhoch the Devil is the fourth book the series. Set in the vast whiteness of New York, and the cool winter of New Orleans. Lestat travels to Heaven and Hell (a.k.a. Sheol). In this just one of Lestat's many tales he goes back in time to watch the creation of life itself. Lestat must make the choice between serving a proud God or a humble Devil. In this story there are many beliefs that you probably never considered. There is also one major sub-plot that included a drug lord and his daughter an up and coming televangelist. The whole story is about Lestat's morale choice between God and the Devil. Little does anyone know, but the Devil is not all bad and God is not all that merciful. There are many different characters in the story ranging from the eccentric Lestat to the mild mannered Armand. There were even some human characters like Roger and his daughter Dora. Even some heavenly creatures got into the act such as God and the Devil. There are many different twists and turn in this story that take theology and religion to a whole new level. The way Anne writes is almost spellbinding. She makes the characters come alive in this epic tale. The characters are almost alive they have so much detail. This is one amazing story that I would recommend to anyone who likes exciting characters. If you like Interview with a Vampire you will love all of Anne Rice's series. It is best to start off with the beginning of the series all the way through. Or if you're just looking for a good book to read to pick up and read, I think that Menhoch the Devil is the book for you.

B00005JOQS|5.0|I'm fortunate enough to have seen the original Superman and Superman II in the theaters when they were first released. Those two films introduced me to the fantasy world of comics and I haven't left since. Those first two films were followed up by two more inferior sequels that I don't even want to acknowledge. Since then the franchise has languished in development hell for almost two decades. Even with the early success of Tim Burton's two Batman films (again I shan't acknowledge the three inferior sequels afterwards) the Superman franchise still couldn't get back onto the silver screen. With comic book film adaptations all the rage and Batman even getting its best and truest film adaptation from 2005's Batman Begins, Superman finally gets back into the theaters within the capable hands of Bryan Singer (director of the first two X-men films).<br /><br />Bryan Singer must've felt like the rest of the Superman's fans since he clearly establishes the timeline of Superman Returns after Superman II. Nowhere to be found were any hints or talk of Richard Pryor's character and the evil-inducing kryptonite or any mention of Nuclear Man. No, Superman Returns follows-up Superman's climactic fight against General Zod and his followers with a sudden jaunt out into the deepest reaches of space to find his home planet of Krypton. He leaves Earth and its people without a hint of goodbye and most of all leaves the woman he loves without any warning. Lois Lane wasn't very happy about that turn of events and she tries to move on with her life partly by writing a Pulitzer Prize winning editorial proclaiming the reasons \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman\\". The film doesn't dwell too much on Superman's trip back to Earth after discovering that Krypton's not much more than a cosmic graveyard and that he truly was the Last Son of Krypton. The rest of the film was pretty much Superman trying to reintegrate himself both as Superman and as Clark Kent within Earth's society. The film does show that the world may have changed since he left for Krypton five years prior, but in the end the world truly does still need Superman.<br /><br />Bryan Singer tried to balance continuing the franchise as a direct sequel thus minimizing exposition and sequences introducing the origins of Superman. When he does fall back on origin themes he does so through flashback and dialogue that seemlessly blends in with the rest of the story. He also uses to great effect the late Marlon Brando's speech to his son Kal-El about his purpose and destiny. If there's a flaw to be seen in the overall product it would be the plot concocted by --- the recently released from prison --- Lex Luthor to use Superman's Kryptonian legacy to make himself ruler of the world. It's not a small feat, but the overall feel of this part of the story seems abit too much of a rehash of the original plot Luthor came-up with in the first film. This time Luthor doesn't just go for just one coastline of the Continental US, but the whole world. One would think that Luthor would've come up with something abit more creative while he was in prison. I can't fault that part of the storyline too much since it had one of the awe-inspiring sequences showing Superman's true power levels. I won't spoil the sequence, but that scene Superman showed that Superman really has earned the label he's been given since the first two films: Superman as godlike.<br /><br />Really, Superman Returns shows less of Superman's human side, though it shows through when he's Clark Kent, and more of his alien legacy as an outsider whose abilities and unflinching principles makes him out to be some sort of alien Messiah. This was clearly evident in Brando's speech as Jor-El in how Kal-el (Superman) was his only son and his gift to humanity who has in them the capacity to do greater good if only shown the light. I'm sure I won't be the only one to pick up on this. But it's not a wrong conclusion to arrive at. Superman's always been seen throughout his history as some sort of Christ figure. There's a scene in the film where he flies out of Earth's gravity and just floats in space looking down on Earth. It's a scene that evokes a god looking down on his charges. This has always made Superman even more of an outsider than Batman. Batman has his humanity to keep him grounded. Superman doesn't play on being human, but he knows that he'll never truly be one with the people of Earth yet he still protects them as if he is one. If there's a sequel to this film, I would dearly like to see how they take this messianic complexity of Superman and continue exploring it.<br /><br />But enough with the serious part of the film. Despite the flaw in parts of the film's plot, the audience reaction to the film was definitely positive. We cheered and laughed and clapped throughout the film. The action sequences didn't overwhelm the picture, but when they were there it seemed seamless. I didn't nitpick once about how Singer and crew portrayed Superman's abilities. Two action sequences --- one in the first half and the other close to the end --- had me cheering and speechless at the same time. Whatever amount of money they spent creating those scenes were money well-spent. In the end I wished that they'd added a few more action-oriented scenes, but I was glad they pulled off the ones they did have with aplomb.<br /><br />The performances by the two leads, Brandon Routh as Superman and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, were more than adequate. One could see that Routh tried channeling Christopher Reeve as Superman and Clark Kent and to some success. But at times it showed too much like mimicking and less a creative impulse. I'm sure if the franchise gets a go ahead ofr a sequel Routh will get a chance to make the character his own. But his performance was well done in any case and he showed a presence that befit a Superman. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor would've been brilliant if he'd decided upon one look for Luthor. At times he looked like an extension of Gene Hackman's diabolical car-salesman performance. Then there'd be times he resembled something close to the characterization similar in theme to Lex Luthor as savior of mankind against a godlike alien being whose mere presence hinders humanity from reaching beyond its mortal ken. In the end, Spacey's performance was great for pulling off Luthor as Superman's greatest arch-nemesis, but it would've been even greater if he had settled on which Luthor-persona to portray. Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane was serviceable. Again she didn't perform badly, but she didn't put a stamp on the character to make it her own. I think that was one thing I noticed in all the performances. They were well done, but in the end they seemed to honor the past performances of the cast from the first two films abit much instead of taking their roles and running with it. Hopefully this will change with any subsequent sequels.<br /><br />Even with these flaws in the film I cannot give Superman Returns a grade less than great. For even with the flaws, Superman Returns didn't disappoint and followed through on the hype surrounding it. It might not have reached the pinnacle and bar set by Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, but it does reintroduces with a bang an iconic figure in pop-culture history back into the limelight. Superman the film franchise might have been gone from Earth far longer than the character was in the film, but he was welcome back with cheering applause from an audience both young and old. Despite the current generations ambivalence towards straight-laced heros and types, Superman Returns showed that the world truly does need Superman.een throughout his history as some sort of Christ figure.

B0000CABBW|1.0|&lt;yawn> This is such an old tale. The woman/female is horribly abused merely because she is the \\"wrong gender\\". She endures it, says nothing, is kind and sweet and thoughtful and forgiving. Finally she gives her life before the sexist macho creep who treats her worse than garbage wakes up. And of course, when he wakes up, he gets a seat of honor right next to her. But I suppose you could forgive the naivete of the main character as she is only 11. She's not grown up and felt her full outrage at such brutal betrayal and constant condemnation based on nothing more than that she was born female.

B00005JOQS|4.0|Superman Returns (PG-13) <br />In Theaters: 6/28/06 <br /> <br />Noteable Cast <br />Brandon Routh as Superman/Clark Kent, Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, James Marsden as Richard White, Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski, Frank Langella as Perry White, Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen, Eva Marie Saint as Martha Kent <br /> <br />Quick Synopsis <br />After spending five years in space to visit the remains of his birthplace Krypton, Superman returns to Earth to find many things have changed, except one ... Lex Luthor is still out to own the world and destroy Superman. <br /> <br />Quick Thoughts <br />An excellent tribute to the original Superman movie. Superman Returns is a great movie definitely worth seeing on the big screen. It has something for everyone, romance, drama, and action ... and oh yeah ... Superman! The movie was made keeping most of the story from the original movie, along with some light hearted scenes and some great one-liners with references from the original that were good for some laughs. For additional insight into the movie, go to your local comic shop and pick up \\"Superman Returns Prequel\\", a four part series setting up some storyline to the beginning of the movie.  <br /> <br />Now for some highlights, so if you have not seen the movie and plan on going, do not read any further. The story is that astronomers have discovered the remains of Krypton, so Superman travels to Krypton in hopes of finding survivors or at least something of his home planet, but only finds a barren waste land. He returns to Earth via crashing in Smallville, again, and reunites with his mother before heading off to Metropolis to reclaim his job at the Daily Planet. <br /> <br />After returning to the Daily Planet, Clark is given back his job by Perry White (because another reporter has recently died), and Clark is also reunited with Jimmy Olsen who informs Clark that Lois is practically married to Richard White (Perry Whites nephew), and that Lois hasa child. <br /> <br />Meanwhile Lex Luthor is out of prison, because Superman did not appear in court to testify against Luthor for trying to send half of California into the sea. Now Luthor has found Supermans Fortress of Solitude and taken the crystals from within along with the Kryptonian knowledge of how they work. His plan is to use the crystals to create a new continent that will wipe out most of the United States. These events cause some catastrophes which give Clark the need to bring his Superman back into action. <br /> <br />Now for the part that will shake the comic world up, during Lex's plans it becomes apparent that Lois' son, Grant, is extraordinary and after Superman foils Lex's plans once again, we find out that Grant is actually Superman's own son! (Which is probably referencing the love scene from Superman II, so the people that will be yelling at Bryan Singer about the \\"Superboy\\", well as I see it he was just expanding on what had already happened in an earlier movie.) <br /> <br />All-in-all I thought Superman Returns was as good as the original Superman movie and is a great movie with superb acting and special effects. Brandon Routh does a great job of taking on the roles of Clark Kent and Superman (a tribute to the late Christopher Reeves). Kevin Spacey is one of my favorite actors and as expected does a great job to bringing life of Lex Luthor (once again a great tribute to Gene Hackman). There were some \\"liberties\\" taken with the storyline that may or may not determine how much a true Superman fan will like the movie, or not and as with most movies there a some predictable scenes. As for me, being a huge Superman (and Batman) fan, I loved the movie and anxiously await some sequels to further develop this new storyline of Superman/Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Richard White, and Grant, the son of Superman and Lois. <br /> <br />[...]

B000002H5I|3.0|Some previous reviewers have lamented the fact that Tracy Chapman is not a recording superstar.  I, for one, am baffled at how Chapman could expect anything more than isolated niche success in her endeavors.  This album highlights both her strengths and her shortcomings brilliantly, and for some it will hold immense appeal, while not so much for others. <br /> <br />I will confess that I fall into the ambivalent camp.  There is a place in my musical collection for Tracy Chapman, but not a big one.  This record in particular seems to be so infused with \\"message\\" (a common symptom of recordings from activists, though it is more tolerable when the artist has a little bit more of a sense of humor, a la The Coup) that it nearly collapses under the weight of its own moralizing if you invest your full attention to following the words.  Very few of the songs are particularly up-tempo and the rhythm in most of the tracks tends to be downplayed. <br /> <br />For some fans, particularly those firmly seated in the soft rock and folk rock genres, that will fit the bill nicely.  For me, it's not so great.  I hold brazen, unmasked philosophizing in a fairly high contempt in the music I listen to, and so the record tends to grate on my nerves a touch.  Good for an occasional play, but probably not anything that would work its way into my regular rotation.
B00005JOQS|4.0|Roger Ebert gave the first Batman 2 stars and he's wrong again with Superman Returns which he also gave 2 stars. It's a great ride and it brings back the kid in you just in the opening credits and hearing the John Williams classic musical score. Superman returns after 5 years of looking for any piece of Krypton that he can find. He returns to find Lois engaged to Perry White's son played by James Marsden (X-Men) and with a kid as well. He finds himself needed again just when he's settiling in. Lex Luther has an evil plan to basically turn Earth into Krypton in a world where he'd be the leader.<br /><br />  This movie is 10 times better than Superman 3 and 4. It's not better than part 1 or 2 but it's right up there with them at least. Brandon Routh may not be as good as Christopher Reeves as playing Clark Kent or Superman. However he is the best Superman next to Reeves. Routh's Superman looks like he popped right out of the comic book. He may not have Reeves' charm but he still makes a very heroic Superman. As for playing a bumbling reporter, he needs to work on that a lot before the next movies. Ebert was way off though when he said he barely had any lines because they probably dind't know if he could act. Routh has a good part at the end where he delivers the lines that were once said to him by his father. He does it well too.<br /><br />  Kate Bosworth's Lois is more vulnerable than the kind of Lois we're used to. I mean she gets knocked around violently by one of Lex's bodyguards. You know the Erica Durance Lois in Smallville wouldn't take that [...]. Erica Durance is a very good Lois and it's sad that Smallville is only interested in pushing Lana in our face constantly and they don't  know how to use Lois. Anyway Bosworth still looks the part at least and does give us a different Lois even if it's not a better Lois.<br /><br />  Kevin Spacey is excellent as Lex Luther, he basically gives us an older version of Michael Rosenbaum's Lex in Smallville. Gene Hackman was a great Lex Luther too but his was a little too whacky. Spacey makes a great ruthless and scary Luther and it's one of his best performances in awhile. Parker Posey is also excellent as his partner Kitty. She livened up movies that weren't that good, like Scream 3 and Blade Trinity. Here she's finally in a good a movie and has really good chemestry with Spacey. Hell they have better chemestry than Routh and Bosworth who don't have Reeves and Margot Kidder chemestry.<br /><br />  One problem with the film is that....Lois Lane and Clark never work together. She never even wonders why Clark isn't around when Superman is around. It is funny though when Lois and her fiance joke about how Clark and Superman have the same height and built. Plus although Spacey is a great Lex Luther, I am sort of Lex Luthered out. I know part 3 sucked when it tried to have someone other than Luther as the villian. But I'd love to see Darkseid in a Superman movie for once . They need someone evil with powers like part 2 had Zod. I'd like something like that instead of just Luther as the villian again. It's still hard not to get into this movie though or get excited when you hear the John Williams score.was a great Lex Luther too but his was a little too whacky. Spacey makes a great ruthless and scary Luther and it's one of his best performances in awhile. Parker Posey is also excellent as his partner Kitty.

B00005JKHN|5.0|Disney really gave this film the art-treasure treatment. The film is nearly 50 years old, but the colors glow and the sound is wonderful. A painstaking frame-by-frame restoration was conducted, and the soundtrack remastered, resulting in a film which probably looks better now on DVD than when it was originally released. This film has always been a favorite of mine of all the Disney classics, and I think the music has a lot to do with it. \\"Once Upon a Dream\\" is truly beautiful, which is a given considering the classical composition it was based on. The artwork is superb, even for Disney in its heyday. This movie is rightly considered a classic, and has finally been given its due on DVD.
B000BPG2JC|4.0|Discovering a wonderful new author is a special treat for readers, and Craig Johnson's 'The Cold Dish' is especially delicious. Set in a fictional small town in northern Wyoming and featuring grieving, 50-something widower Sheriff Walt Longmire, the book is a beautifully crafted mystery that will hold your attention from the first page. A marvelous supporting cast of eccentric locals including Longmire's best friend, Henry Standing Bear, both assist and hinder the Sheriff as he makes his way through a maze of suspects to solve a grisy series of murders. By the last chapter of this terrific first novel, the reader will feel that he, too, knows the starkly beautiful country at the foot of the Big Horn mountains. A guaranteed great read!
B000001OAA|5.0|This is my favorite Garbage album. I like the songs MY LOVER'S BOX, DOG'S NEW TRICKS, ONLY HAPPY WHEN IT RAINS and STUPID GIRL. This album was also released as a boxed set of 45 VINYL RECORDS, each record containing two of the songs from the album.
0694003611|5.0|In our family \\"Goodnight Moon\\" has become a \\"read-every-night book.\\" As the bunny calmly says goodnight to everything inside and outside the window, our children seem to feel a comforting sense of predictability, security and peace as they wind down for sleep. Part of our current bedtime ritual also includes pointing out the mouse in each color illustration. My husband and I enjoy reading picture books with our two sons, ages 2 and 4. Many are simply for pure fun and enjoyment together. However, we have also found that some books serve as a wonderful opportunity for us to continue teaching a lesson about our family rules and values. For example, we can calmly revisit a situation with our boys by reading a picture book, away from the heat of the moment of their ocassional, embarrassing, angry behavior by reading \\"Elbert's Bad Word\\" or \\"How Are You Peeling.\\"  When we find ourselves searching for the appropriate words to use, we discovered that a book can often get the point or lesson across to a young child in just the right way. Sometimes, the text or pictures encourages our children to ask questions or make comments, thereby giving us a clearer sense of their understanding. Then we can focus further discussion as needed. We found a great little book with an awesome annotated listing of over 100 excellent picture books to read with a 2, 3, 4, or 5-year-old called \\"The Pocket Parent\\". This quick read parenting guide addresses many hot-button issues we have experieneced with our toddlers--such as Bedtime, Bad Words, Morning Crazies, Thumb sucking, Tantrums, Whining and more. Reading appropriate books, like \\"Goodnight Moon\\", is definitely one effective way that helps me establish comforting routines with my children while keeping lines of communication open to discuss concerns and solve problems together when needed. <br />
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Al principio no podía creer que Shakira lanzara un nuevo álbum después de que Fijación Oral Vol.1 ya estaba en venta, no soy muy amigo de los fenómenos comerciales premeditados por las disqueras y ver que Shakira trataba de posicionar dos álbumes al mismo tiempo me pareció algo bastante desconcertante, pues era clara una hambre de ventas. Sin embargo, como buen fan de Shakira que soy no me resistí las ganas y compre el Oral Fixation Vol. 2 y para mi sorpresa, resultó ser un tremendo álbum, mucho mejor de lo que el reggeaton y la nueva música \\"Sexual-Promiscua\\" que tocan en la radio de estos días.  <br /> <br />El álbum captura desde el primer momento con la explosiva canción How do You Do? y sus picantes líneas que nuevamente traen viejos cuestionamientos de la religión (desde octavo día - Donde están los ladrones?) con preguntas como \\"How many people die and hurt in your name?\\", cuanta gente muere y hiere en tu nombre o \\"How does it feel to be so hight?\\",  ¿Qué se siente estar tan alto?, pero no son solo letras, Shakira trae nueva sangre a su música al trabajar con G. Edwards, L. Christy, S. Spock dando como resultado uno de los mejores temas del álbum.  <br /> <br />Canciones como Don't Bother de corte roquero (primer sencillo) o  Dreams for Plans nos muestran la faceta romántica y sentimental de Shakira evocando traiciones o relaciones que se tornan en monotonía y que  se contraponen a temas como Your Embrace y Something (Con fragmentos escritos en francés) en los que vemos a Shakira desde un perspectiva enamorada o arrepentida. Todos acompañados de bellas melodías y gran trabajo de cuerdas. <br /> <br />Las colaboraciones del álbum parecen ser su punto débil y es que la versión en inglés de Día Especial (Fijación Oral Vol.1) sigue sendo tan plana y aburrida como su versión en español, rara vez se puede diferenciar la voz de su supuesto co-interprete Gustavo Cerati. Santana también aparece  en el álbum con ilegal y su clásicainterpretación de la guitarra eléctrica que, a pesar de ser majestuosa, parece que no tiene posibilidades de expandirse o evolucionar; interpretación que se une a la sosa y repetitiva letra del tema que pueden llegar a hacerla larga e interminable, la canción es buena pero un dúo con Santana debería ser mucho más explosivo y pegajoso como lo han sido sus pasadas colaboraciones con Michelle Branch(Game Of Love), tristemente la canción salió a la radio como single esperando que Santana le diera fuerzas a las ventas de Shakira o ¿Fue lo opuesto?. <br /> <br />El clímax del disco esta en las súper producciones que lo hacen sorpresivo y adictivo al mismo tiempo, todas mostrando facetas hasta ahora algo desconocidas de Shakira, pasando por Animal City y su tonta letra pero poderosa música roquera, Hey You con sus provocativas letras y guitarras Rocanroleras  o Timor la fuerte canción brit-pop que además de ser sumamente pegajosa cuestiona todo el sistema de nuestra sociedad.  <br /> <br />Sin embargo, este álbum no sería tan bueno si no fuera por Costume Makes the Clown y el trabajo de Brendan Shakirakley, simplemente se escucha una y otra vez sin parar, adictiva, explosiva, roquera, cuerdas, es de lo mejor que Shakira nos haya entregado, una letra donde se hace justicia a la realidad donde no siempre cuando se quiere se actúa perfecto. Es una pena que este tema haya caído al olvido por los productores ejecutivos, el álbum merece un segundo vistazo, de verdad lo recomiendo.
B000BNNLN4|5.0|This isn't a particularly long novel, yet Lewycka manages to accomplish so much! The story-line itself is simple: two estranged sisters in England try to stop their aged father's marriage to a gold-digging Ukrainian woman. But the book itself is complex. It's one of the funniest books I've read in a long time, and there is joy, and yet there is also plenty of tragedy and grief. All of the characters are wonderful; even some of the minor supporting characters are fully realized people. And none of the characters are fully good or bad. The author even had me sympathizing at times with the gold-digger and the men with whom she had affairs. I think the book's greatest asset, however, is that it shows genuine insight into real families, and the sorts of complicated stories that families make for themselves. How many books can make you laugh, make you cry, and teach you about the history of tractors and the Ukraine, all in less than 300 pages?
B00005JOQT|5.0|I remember seeing Superman IV in the theaters when I was six, how there were so many people swarming all around, how there was excitement. Clearly it was a shoddy movie, but to a kid you just can't buy that kind of palpable movie madness.<br /><br />Now I'm as old as my parents were when they saw the very first Superman, and I've got to say this must be what it felt like. I think Bryan Singer is fast becoming one of the most respectable directors in Hollywood, and what he did with this movie--on a far, far grander scale than either of his X-Men movies--merits SOME kind of award come Oscar time.<br /><br />We all know the story--Kryptonian boy comes to Earth, saves man from the foibles of archnemesis Lex Luthor, woos Lois Lane. Singer and Co. decided to have this movie pick up after Superman II (wise move) but you never really get a jarring sense of chronology--no General Zod references here. Instead, Supe has just returned from a nearly five-year journey to see if anything remains of his homeworld; alas, the answer is no.<br /><br />What's strange is that him being gone is such a small deal when it comes to the overall movie. But that's okay; there's plenty more fantastic things to keep the average moviegoer and Superman afficionado happy. What I love most about this sequel is that so much of it feels like home--Brandon Routh has moments where he looks exactly like the dearly departed Christopher Reeve, and his voice is dead-on most of the time. He quotes several lines from the first movie to great effect. Kate Bosworth as Lois isn't as quirky as Margot Kidder but she still can't spell, and she does the best job I've seen in a long time of playing the \\"strong female\\" role without ever drawing your attention to it.<br /><br />The plot also feels familiar--Superman spends a night righting wrongs across the world; Luthor AGAIN gets hold of that Adis Ababa kryptonite, and Supe AGAIN falls prey to it; but there are intriguing elements dealing with Fortress crystals that take Luthor into land-grabbing madness like we've never seen.<br /><br />The special effects are superb, of course; you can't spend almost $300 million and get it wrong! Here is where I thought Singer might overdo things, but his restraint is commendable. He allows Routh to do all the old Superman things and yet they don't feel aged at all. Singer was concerned with how to entertain a generation where flying is no longer the spectacle it once was, and yet, watching the movie, it's hard to believe that any kid, no matter how jaded, could scoff at what's on screen. The movie is that well done.<br /><br />Don't let detractors fool you. This kind of movie only comes along...once every thirty years or so.take Luthor into land-grabbing madness like we've never seen.<br /><br />The special effects are superb, of course; you can't spend almost $300 million and get it wrong!

B000000OQF|1.0|Squash 'n squeek a couple of guys behind me has said it the best, this album is the most overrated of all time. I think that the reason that it is popular is because Guns 'N Roses made a genre like Metal more tangible in the public eye, when there where many more talented metal artists out at the time, before, as well as after. I do not think that they have enough talent as musicians to be considered so great. They made songs with some good aspects that I feel are way overclouded with the bad ones (and there are a lot!). They are just drug addicts with no substance to theie musc, and they have maybe one or two decent songs. I'm sorry but this gets a one star review in my book.
0895260131|1.0|Spencer does here what he does with all of his books on Islam: He twists the facts and skews them to meet his own Evangelo-Zionist agenda. <br /> <br />How come when Mr Spencer talks about the Arab conquests he never mentions the well documented fact that the Jewish populations of Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Spain overwhelmingly supported the muslim conquests of these lands? Spain was taken with the physical and financial support of the Spanish Jews, who were tired of the persecution of their Christian Visigothic overlords (many of the Roman population did the same). <br /> <br />Also... <br /> <br />when are we going to be treated to a \\"Politically incorrect Guide to the Jews and Judaism\\" <br />??? <br /> <br />(I guess I shouldn't hold my breath)
B000EQH2QK|3.0|De la primera edición del Oral Fixation Vol.2 dije que no me agradaban los álbumes que tratan de ser vendidos por las disqueras a toda costa y, que a pesar de esto, era sorpresivamente adictivo, pues bien ¡una re-edición es el colmo!, y los que compramos la versión anterior ¿qué?, también tenemos que comprar esta. Al álbum se le agregaron dos temas que son súper hits por separado, Hips don't lie una súper canción que pega y retumba gracias a su fusión de cumbia con Reggae. Por otro lado La tortura, que se bailo hasta desfallecer en Latinoamérica. Pero juntas en un mismo álbum, no creo que resulte, y re-parchando al Oral Fixation Vol.2 si que menos, el álbum estaba bien sin ellas, ligero pero bien hecho. Ahora perdió personalidad con los ritmos de Hips don't lie que desentonan con el resto del trabajo, y con el espanol de la La Tortura, que la hace menos atractiva que un hidden track (Canción escondida) con relación a los demás temas. El álbum perdió algo a mi modo de ver..      Oral Fixation Vol.2 Primera Edicion:    El álbum captura desde el primer momento con la explosiva canción How do You Do? y sus picantes líneas que nuevamente traen viejos cuestionamientos de la religión (desde octavo día - Donde están los ladrones?) con preguntas como \\"How many people die and hurt in your name?\\", cuanta gente muere y hiere en tu nombre o \\"How does it feel to be so hight?\\",  ¿Qué se siente estar tan alto?, pero no son solo letras, Shakira trae nueva sangre a su música al trabajar con G.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's a rare thing now-a-days to find a show that not only has drama and wit, but a good plot as well.  Firefly has all three, and with abundance.  This is some of the best TV (and without the commercials) ever.  If you like sci fi even just a little, you should get this (well - at least see it - get you mom, dad, kids, wife to buy it for you [or I suppose you could borrow it from the library]. <br /> <br />The bottom line is, this is a show to see.
B000007O9L|5.0|Agree with most comments as this is a very good live album compared to other live Cds of the stones especially the recent, I was lucky to have attended the Brixton Academy club gig and I must say it was a night that I will never forget, the only pitty on the Cd is that there arenot a few more tracks on the Stripped Cd they played that night as they were on fire (and it already was very hot at the venue,so you can imagine) <br /> <br />Nico
0307276902|4.0|For all of you who are coming down so hard on Frey, how many of you have actually been drug addicts?? Seen, felt, or experienced what he described in his memoir?? MAYBE a fourth of you. You claim you've asked other people who supposedly know more about the circumstances than he does...What makes your source more believeable than him?? Because YOU know them?? You can't fight or condemn something when you have no personal basis to argue from. Would you have enjoyed it more and looked at it with a more open mind had it been placed in the fiction section?? Probably so. <br /> <br />The bottom line is A Million Little Pieces is a remarkable and beautiful account of what a human being can do when they believe in themselves and believe they have something to live for, and also shows it's never too late to change and improve if you truly desire to. Fiction or non-fiction, exagerrated or straight-to-the-point, it's heart-wrenching, raw, and inspirational.

B000FIH4RO|4.0|Fastway was greatly overlooked by most, but they are an excellent band. This album is more \\"polished than their earlier stuff, but that's not neccessarily a bad thing. Overall, the songs are solid and full of hooks. Some favorites: Kill Me With Your Heart(solid rocker), The World Waits For You, Change(good ballad), Little By Little(could have been on 1st album) and Move Over(Dave King sings Janis Joplin - great). One problem with this cd - I seem to recall this being the same with the original release, I had on cassette - is the track listing is wrong.<br /><br />This is the correct listing.<br /><br />1. Waiting For The Roar<br /><br />2. The World Waits For You<br /><br />3. Little By Little<br /><br />4. Change<br /><br />5. Rock On<br /><br />6. Tired Of Your Love<br /><br />7. Move Over<br /><br />8. Kill Me With Your Heart<br /><br />9. Girl<br /><br />10. Back Door Man<br /><br />11. Doin' Just Fine<br /><br />If you like good, straight forward rock buy this album - or any of the first three Fastway albums. Great songs and Dave King can sing absolutely anything.
B00003W8NM|5.0|UPDATED REVIEW 16/01/2013<br />One of the best movies ever made:  An exercise in \\"visual philosophy\\", using all technical resources to illustrate and narrate a mental imaginary and machinations based plotline.  Fight Club is a fable of the id, ego, and super ego interacting, to revive the main character (\\"Jack) from his stupor.  This lethargy and detachment from his bodily needs and id instincts, prevents him to sleep and mate.  His sexual drive and need for love have been channeled into consumerism.  He buys things he doesn't need compulsively, to escape his misery without success.  The solutions he (or his psyche segments) comes up with are evolutionary, but basically of the same substance he longs and aches for to awaken him from this lethargy.  He starts off visiting shockingly bleeding heart -support groups.  Used to the corporate politically correct, neutral and aseptic dialogues, this candidness rattles him up towards vitality, recognizing his own humanity, enlightening the steps to come in the path.  Nirvana is his desired path, the path at the very core of all human being that looks for religion, drugs or any perception of god or what is beyond words and things, and ultimately that ghost inside us.  His Id/super ego is Tyler Durden.  He shows him how to escape from fear.  That fear that drove him to drown himself into things, in work and vapid banality.  Then there comes the Fight Club.  \\"Fight club wasn't about winning or losing.  It wasn't about words.\\"  Says Jack.  It is not about violence in the sense of hurting someone else out of anger, I would add.  Jack is detached from the animal we are, that eats, defecates, has sex and breathes.  Jack is detached from the caveman we have been for thousands of years, that \\"evolved\\" men despise, but is rooted in our DNA.  Jack is an extreme case of the dangers of excessive consumerism, individuality and materialism of our culture.  Jack fears loosing (a fight, his job, anything that threatens his ego or causes him pain) and longs for human contact and intimacy.  Searching for a relationship is a big stretch.  Baby steps, the support group first. Then fighting furnishes him with all this.<br />I would like to address the movie's critics like Robert Ebert, who fail to seize the zeitgeist and how fight club relates and how the violence is tangential.  The story is about a very particular individual with a very common pathology who seeks a very unorthodox solution in a very dire, desperate situation.  This masterpiece exercises and puts forth \\"visual philosophy\\", displaying what would be a modern version of Zen enlightenment exercises or Koans.  There is no doctor that treats greed and Ikea fetishes.  This dude is on his own.  He needs to get in touch with his masculinity and loose the fear at the root of all fears, the fear of death,  and so do the other attendees of the Fight Club.<br />Fighting is a start; the fear of physical harm is in the same line.  Guys don't go to Fight Club to win, everyone is a winner, because the target is to unload the burden of fear.  If you desensitize yourself to the fear of punches and blood, abstract fear triggers, as being fired diminish by contrast.  Our culture is plagued with fears of the unknown, the what ifs that blocks us from taking risks that could change or enhance our life.<br />Tyler Durden, the superego is boundless and moves forward unfettered to things that are not realistic for the ego, the pranks and crimes against possessions of the project mayhem.  But before that he confronts Jack with the fear of death using chemical burn.  Crazy, unorthodox yet effective, and more important in a movie: entertaining.<br />Finally, Jack evolves towards love, the main driver from the start.  The movie is a love story.  His relationship with the woman is abrasive, because his sexuality is twisted, hence is expressed through unexpected outlets at the start.  He develops his personality and is able to express caring for a female and start a relationship and integrates his psyche, destroying his overpowering superego.  Metaphorically expressed by the dissolution of Tyler.<br />A beautifully aesthetically stunning crafted movie, fluid as our thouth processes are.  From the start it displays a voyage through the brain's fear center.  As a fable that it is, the use of special effects and creative, aggressive, edgy cinematography suspends your disbelief into a journey in a very human experience, a tale about our war.  As Tyler Durden says when he puts the finger on our greed/consumerism epidemic, \\"our war is a spiritual war\\".  Interwoven masterfully are the elements of a man's struggle with this disease and fighting our war.  It never stops being an action film.<br />The rant that Tyler delivers to the fight club, encapsulates some of the concerns the movie wants to bring the audience to brood upon. It is one of  the few congruent lines thrown in your  lap to understand the movie and the issues brought to light.  Issues related to living lives without meaning, in mechanic jobs we hate, to buy stuff conditioned by the media to, but that we really don't truly need. We've become consumer droids. Space monkeys conditioned to press buttons towards oblivion. The media offers its carrot: fame, fortune, and every Ego-booster conceivable. And if the entanglement is rooted on the ego logic, ego perception and egotistic behavior it only messes up the problem further.  All reinforces the need to gain awareness of the influence of the ego.<br />The movie doesn't wrap up nicely the answers to these questions, and throws them on your lap.<br />This movie left me with the strong impression of watching one of the most aggressive criticisms towards the dangers of excessive consumerism, of my generation.<br />It is difficult to believe it was made by the director of Seven and two of the most prominent actors of our generation who put their necks on the line to express these concerns.<br /><br />Bravo!!ionship and integrates his psyche, destroying his overpowering superego.

Losing them is a way of facing and dissipating that fear.     The same with machismo and the image that we men need to hold, that we cannot lose a fight without feeling devalued. Setting ourselves to lose a fight is very effective, besides dangerous and eccentric, way of discarding that fear.   Conversely, is similar to the therapy used to treat phobias. The analyst gradually confronts the patient with the feared object.  Until, desensitivity provides she/he can overcome the fear.    Staying in the moment, even on the most agonizing moments hardens your skin enough to stop dodging reality, the eternal now ever, with every device imaginable: food, tv and of course buying stuff you don't need.   Tyler puts Jack through these and other tests to awaken him.   But Tyler doesn't stops there, he wants to awaken society.     All weaved together by hip techno music, MTV video esthetics and steps towards enlightenment, is what the movie ´´Fight Club´´is about.     Other principles in the mix are that a fragmented being cannot truly love. The desire for Marla and his inability to let go of the past, is another pressure point on Jack pushing him towards freedom.   Tyler represents a double edge sword savior or guru. On one side, the desire to be frenetic and push himself to the edge to conquer limitations, and also all he desires to be as a man.     To accept truly himself, and use all his energy as a united being he has to let go of this figure.   Keep what learn and dump the rest and find a wise middle where he is comfortable at.

B000EXDS5M|5.0|Director George Roy Hill (The Sting), paired two kings, Redford and Newman, in what film critics assert as the best \\"buddy\\" picture of all time, \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\"..Ironically, Robert Redford was rebuffed as bonafide to play Sundance..Newman didn't cotton to a minor-league stage actor, Redford, better known for \\"barefootin in the park\\" with Jane Fonda than for silver screen presence to play The Kid, or Newman was \\"going south\\", not to Bolivia, but on to other projects..The part was passed around Hollywood like hot license plates, and rejected by luminaries such as Steve McQueen, Warren Beatty, and more surprisingly, Marlon Brando..Hill lobbied hard and often for Redford and convinced Newman to trust the newcomer, and as a closing caveat guaranteed Newman the choice dialogue from the script..Imagine today, anyone besides Redford playing the laconic, nebbish part of Sundance, the quickshot beta, to Butch's quickwitted alpha..Newman and Redford clicked beautifully as the \\"banditos yanquis\\", and Redford's starship subsequently went galactic..Henceforward, the only trains Redford (Sundance) robbed were the ones at the studios..Newman and Redford became beer buddies on the set, and Newman appreciated that Redford respected his stature in the business, much like Sundance respected Butch's back at the \\"Hole in the Wall\\"..Butch and Sundance knew viscerally, the West was phasing from a black and white world into a more colorized, mechanized century, and reckoned their days were numbered as horse-back mounted train-robbers, to wit: the telegraph easily outran the best bred horses..And, one night while laying up in a bordello after a fresh kill, they spyed the future, the bicycle, being hawked by a hardware salesman on the town square as a replacement for the horse..Butch had to have one!..And in the most unusual scene in the film, Butch rides Etta Place around on the handlebars, to the tune of a hoarse and bug-ridden B.J. Thomas singing \\"Raindrops keep falling on my head, and just like a guy whose feet are too big for his bed\\"..Well, you get the picture..Not your daddy's Oldsmobile!
B000063V8S|5.0|Obviously, if you aren't a Star Trek fan, you're not going to buy this product. But if you happen to be that open-minded Sci Fi fan interested in a classic Sci Fi series, I'd highly recommend the Next Generation series. The characters and plot lines set the standard for Star Trek (in my opinion.) And now that they're all dropping in price down to about 50-60 bucks, its affordable too.
1577311523|2.0|First I have to agree with IAF 67, Kula Kine and Johnson.  They say it better than I can.  This is not an easy read book.  The author should know, being in the suidical frame of mind at one time, that it is difficult to focus and process thoughts during difficult times that may lead one to this type of book.  Understanding that I should think his writing technique would be more effective if simplified. I have already lost interest and am tired of flipping back pages to be able to follow the pattern of thought. This may work for someone else and that is good.   <br /> <br />I have to agree that some good meditations would do just as well if not better.  Myself I would recommend \\"The Four Agreements\\" or \\"How to Expand Love\\" by the Dalai Lama. <br /> <br />It is my opinion letting go of the past completely is not realistic.  You can let go of it's bonds and pain.  Turn that past into positive energy, look back and rejoice in the fact you are no longer there, you are here and alive.  The fact you are looking back at that poopy past shows your strength and ability to endure, you got to today, so keep it up!  Deal with that past, pack it up, and say good bye to the bad and savor the good.  My son died by suicide at the sweet age of 17, 17 years ago.  The pain and knowledge I learned has been very helpful to others.  His picture is on my wall and I see it every day.  I won't forget that now will I?  We had wonderful times, the pictures show his loving smile, I laugh about our fun times. I have learned about depression, worked with teens, volunteered in the field to better others lives.  Now that is healty past in my mind that inspires me today.  It reassures me that the now can be dealt with because the worse thing ever has already been conquered.  Now, I hope that wasn't more mumbo jumbo than the book. <br /> <br />I really could not feel the spirituality in this book.  I like books that I can stop in the midst of reading and say \\"YES\\", I can relate to that......

B00004T9UF|1.0|The Marshall mathers lp has got to be the most overrated album in the history of hip-hop and music, to say that this is better than classics like It takes a nation to hold us back, Ready to die, Illmatic, must be on some kind of acid trip, I Thought every single song was useless, eminem claims he's anti-pop, yet he has the same fanbase as the backstreet boys & NSync, the real silm shady was a ridiculous song and everything else is just silly. (with the exception of stan)    This rapper paved the way for so-called hardcore rappers aka Poseurs like 50 who's making rap look bad then ever.    and 50 didn't get shot 9 times, that was just a gimmick, he got shot 3 times.    If you want a real good album of 2000's based on a white rapper look no futher than Bubba Sparxxx's deliverence.    Eminem is not for me, only for pathetic useless stans who only thinks this is a good album.    This album is the most overrated album of all time live with it.
1400079179|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Da Vinci Code. Unlike most, I didn't read this when all the balmy started, I read it after the flick came out. I have to say I rightfully enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />While definitely not a command of prose, the Da Vinci Code seemed to have a plausible plot. Mr. Brown was definitely well researched in his subject (although he likely should have checked up on the current status of the Priory of Sion, whom have been proven as frauds) and the thought of Mary and Jesus having themselves a babby definitely jogs the mind a bit.<br /><br />I just do not understand why there's all the anger and animosity toward Brown's book. Much of it is just hatred for him saying Jesus got his oats but what of it? Does it make him less the Saviour if he had a wee un?<br /><br />Well, rather then get in that palaver I believe I'll just say that this novel has you turning pages one after the next. I say don't worry so much about WHO it was about and just try to enjoy the ride. By the by, the book is superior to the film.
0030839939|2.0|This is a very well-written book, but it is OVER THIRTY YEARS OLD. The selection of topics was excellent for the time, but it is now a different time. If you are not yet brain-dead, i.e. not content with teaching only what you learned as a grad student, try something more current, such as Chaikin and Lubensky.

B0000630BT|5.0|I really enjoyed this album, to me it's as if Rob Halford left us something to remember him by when he left Judas Priest. This is one of the fastest and heaviest album they produced in the 90s, if you are a newcomer to heavy metal then this is the album you should definetly check out. Whenever I am tired, I listen to this album and it fills me up with adreneline.
B000059TFO|4.0|Although loosely based upon the true-life story of the murders of three young civil rights workers in Neshoba County, Mississippi in 1964, history gives way to an entertaining crime drama with a superb cast, particularly Gene Hackman, who gives perhaps his best performance ever.  It is a compelling, fast-moving story which will doubtless keep the viewer entertained.  As a good piece of drama, MB excels.  However, for a far more interesting (and factual) version of the story, read Don Whitehead's \\"Attack on Terror\\".  Enjoy the movie, but view it as drama, not history.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Greatest Hits albums are always difficult to rate.  Realistically, no compilation will ever be able to gather every last \\"hit\\" from a particular artist, and \\"The Essential Michael Jackson\\" is no exception.  And despite its (very few) limitations, \\"Essential\\" does an A+ job. <br /> <br />For starters, the amount of material in this package is quite staggering; it extends from the early #1's of the J5 under Motown up to Michael's latest solo work for a total of 38 songs.  Ordered chronologically by single release date, \\"Essential\\" shows the impressive transformation of a child star into one of the most impressive musical forces in pop-music today.  But despite the stylistic evolution and technological adaptions made along the way, the energy and emotion (neither insufficient nor overpowering) remain at the core of each and every song. <br /> <br />The first disc begins with the Jackson 5ive's first three number ones, as well as some of Michael's early solo work.  Then, the J5 become The Jacksons, switching labels and becoming disco icons with hits like \\"Shake Your Body\\" and \\"Blame It On The Boogie\\".  Of course, Michael finds the biggest success behind solo albums \\"Off the Wall\\" and \\"Thriller\\", which dominate the last half of this CD. <br /> <br />By disc number two, Michael is no longer splitting duty with his siblings and is 100% solo.  \\"Bad\\" and \\"Dangerous\\" take up all but two tracks on this disc, which makes sense because those two LPs are both studio albums and greatest hits packages, considering the majority of the songs from those albums turned platinum.  Lastly, the biggest hit of \\"HIStory\\" and \\"Invincible\\" round out the last two tracks. <br /> <br />Naturally, I didn't take the time to write out all of the tracks from \\"Essential\\", but just by the few I mentioned you can already grasp at the notion that this collection is pure platinum.  If you're a casual Michael Jackson fan, this is a must buy.  In a couple hours of listening, you'll understand why this man was the juggernaut he was. <br /> <br />\\"Essential\\" isn't perfect, however.  If you own one or more of the \\"Big Four\\", then you're most likely better off skipping this.  As those albums make up 90% of anything with \\"Michael Jackson\\" and \\"Greatest Hits\\" in the same title, you'd be better to just grab all four of those albums if you haven't done so already.  There are a number of \\"Misses\\" that you'll be glad you shelled out extra for.   <br /> <br />Also, the balance in \\"Essential\\" is great.  Solo to group, ballad to dance hit, this is a very well constructed compilation.  Where it fumbles the ball is in the source material.  As said before, Michael's first four Epic solo albums have the lion's share of representation, which means that you now have another CD with \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", and \\"Thriller\\".  Meanwhile, the under-appreciated \\"HIStory\\" gets only 1 track, as does \\"Invincible\\".  Granted, they didn't have quite the effect that the \\"Big Four\\" had on the music industry, but after doing such a great job of chronicling Michael's discography, the last decade of his career is basically glossed over.   <br /> <br />Perhaps an additional disc was needed, which would allot more space not only for more recent songs, but also allow for additional songs in that didn't make the cut.  Just a thought. <br /> <br />Regardless of the complaints, however, \\"Essential\\" does its job of presenting both 38 great tracks and providing a timeline of the most successful artist to date.  And in focusing on the biggest hits, its only reasonable that some great undervalued songs aren't included.  It's a shame, but can't diminish the value of this collection.  If you're out for the ultimate Michael Jackson hits compilation, this is it. <br /> <br />Happy listening.
B00000AF98|5.0|Although either Creatures Of The Night or Lick It Up are frequently mentioned as their best output from the '80s, i think Crazy Nights is better.Why? Why not! It has some of the most catchy, hook-laden, memorable pop metal you'll ever hear.There is not filler (something present in almost every KISS album except for their debut).Musicianship and performance are both powerful and will induce a fell-good rush in every discerning music fan.I can't imagine anyone not liking this, but i'm sure such people exist. <br />Highly recommended, quality KISS album, and a landmark in Music History.Not a time capsule by any means, just plain  excellent, timeless material.I can only hope KISS will give the '80s more exposure in their live set-list.How about playing this album complete for it's anniversary, next year? <br />
B00005B36H|3.0|Most Tool fans won't like what I have to say here. This is an album with a much more accomplished sound than previous works. The vocals have improved, and to some extent been influenced by Maynard's first outing with A Perfect Circle. I just didn't care for the pretentiousness. Tool started out, with a silly, angry sort of album with Opiate. Undertow, was the same sound, but dealt with more personal matters for Maynard. Aenima, was just wierd as hell. It didn't really make any sense, but it sounded cool. The deal with Lateralus, is the entire thing is just so pretentious and overproduced... I can't stand listening to metal like this. Even their most recent \\"10,000 Days\\" actually makes sense to me. It doesn't seem as overdone. Lateralus was most people's favorite tool album, it just didn't do it for me the same.
1402547056|5.0|My book club has read quite a few Alexander McCall Smith books and were delighted to finally \\"hear\\", on CD, the proper pronounciation of some of the African words and names we have been wondering about.  I used the CD as background for our review of \\"Blue Shoes and Happiness\\" book club dinner and it provided a superb ambience for the evening.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This disc has been in my CD player since I got it.  It tells a fantastic story.
B000003CMD|4.0|Okay, I'll be fair to the Brothers and won't complain about the lack of Duane (seeing that he died) since, with or without him, they're one of my five favorite bands. My complaint about a few of these songs is the lack of Gregg as a dominant songwriting presence. Betts writes or cowrite four of these seven songs. That's not always bad - the record's two big hits (Ramblin' Man and the obligatory instrumental epic Jessica) are both catchy, breezy, guitar-dominated fun. And Dickey's a good guitarist. Just not an outstanding songwriter, as proved by his remaining two songs. Now, I like Southbound - catchy, piano-driven blues - but it's more an excuse to jam than a song. And Dickey's solo feature at the end (Pony Boy) is a big disaster. The guy's voice is flatter than steamrollered paper.<br />Gregg's songs are a ton more consistent. The atypically political Wasted Words (which could be anti-Watergate, or just a laundry list of grievences against hypocrites in general) is a cool barroom boogie sort of like Ain't Wastin' Time No More. Come and Go Blues is the album's most underrated song by far. I love the blues, and this is a big dollop of it - really, the only pure blues song on this album. Jelly Jelly is just an average sex song, it would've been better without the tinny organ, but not as bad as Pony Boy.<br />Another element of this album I don't get is Chuck Leavel. I mean, I like the guy's work with the Rolling Stones (though he's no Nicky Hopkins or anything), but the group already had a beyond capable keyboard player in Gregg (who played piano in addition to organ, though he's better known for the latter). Two is just overkill.<br />Berry Oakley died during these sessions (in a bike accident! Close to where Duane died!), and he was replaced by Lamar Williams. Berry was a good  bassist, it must be said. Lamar sounds a lot like Berry. RIP Berry! And Duane!
B00009AOBI|2.0|This Director's Cut is bad, simply because it's not the original threatrical version  - I liked  the old soundtrack and with this one the Springsteen songs seem way too overused and doesn't fit. It was fine the way it was.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|This is a very interesting, very thought provoking movie.<br /><br />I saw it for the first time in the theatres, and it took me sometime to really \\"get\\" what was going on. No question about it - the film is a bit convoluted, and that's why I couldn't give it a full five stars.<br /><br />But many great movies demand repeated viewings, and this is when \\"Syriana\\" pays off. I've now seen the movie quite a few times on DVD, and not only do I understand it far better than I did that first time, but I'm impressed by the many substantive and interconnected stories which the film is telling. The performances are superb and the writing and directing is creative. If nothing else, the film certainly makes you think, and you may not look at the U.S. Government oil policies the same way again....
B000HBK3MM|2.0|I like two songs, \\"Put Your Records On\\" and \\"Till It Happens to You\\" and I kinda like \\"I'd Like to\\".  I really like her voice and I think she has great potential, but I just think alot of the music is empty and cheesy.  I don't feel alot of depth in the music or her voice on most tracks.  Maybe she just needs to mature a bit.
B0009UC7H0|2.0|After hearing Clive Cussler's name mentioned in reverential terms for so long, my expectations for this movie adaptation of his book were rather high.<br /><br />So, I was rather disappointed to see that the characters were all cardboard cut-outs and while the action of the film is quite consistent, the plot somehow meanders along without much cohesiveness.<br /><br />So, while I did make it through to the end, overall, I was bored by this rather expensive looking film.
B000059XUI|2.0|Even for such a troubled filled production, Superman II turned out rather well. The villains are excelent but you'll enjoy the fate of the mean truck driver even more. <br />That said this is the worst looking DVD I've ever seen by a long shot. The image is incredibly dull and the sound not much better. Had I only known a new edition which includes Richard Donner's original cut was going to come out late 2006 I would have surely waited. Now I'll have to but this movie again and throw my first copy straight into the garbage.

B000FILW86|4.0|This is one of Cheap Trick's better releases - not just in recent years, but in their entire career.  That's a bold statement, but the more I listen to \\"Rockford\\", the more I like it (w/ the exception of a couple songs).  Let's face it -- not EVERY song was great on their classic albums, either:  Cheap Trick ('77 & '97), Heaven Tonight, Dream Police, etc. all had a clunker or two on them.  The biggest difference I noticed between \\"Rockford\\" and \\"Special One\\" was the fact that I listened to it all the way through, then wanted to hear it again...and again.  This CD hasn't left my player in over a week!  \\"Special One\\" had muddy production and the songs weren't there...it was a huge disappointment.  \\"Rockford\\" lives up to the hype.
B000E97X66|4.0|I agree with one of the earlier reviewers...why wouldn't this be included in the boxed set?  Seems like a Sony rip-off to me too. It doesn't cause me to give it one star, however.  The music itself is awesome, a window into a bruce that really doesn't exist anymore. <br /> <br />Alos, in response to Mr. Savage, who remembers \\"Pretty Flamingo\\" being in the setlist...you obviously were NOT at THIS show...you were at the show SIX DAYS LATER (Nov 24 '75) where that song was in the setlist!  Mystery solved.  THIS show is the complete setlist from the 11/18/75 show also in London. <br /> <br />Man, I'm way too into this stuff...I gotta get a life.
B0001LYH9S|5.0|It's so twisted and, after a time, accessible, and I never fail to notice something new within its plethora of sonic layers. It works even better when you edit out the 'segues.'  <br /> <br />I was very disappointed when the series didn't continue, as threatened/promised by Bowie/Eno way back when, with works such as 'Contamination' etc. I really hope the above reviewer (Mr. 30 \\"UCF Student\\") is accurate in his review above!  <br /> <br />One of my all-time favorite Bowie records, and coming at a time when I really didn't expect to passionately enjoy anything by him post Scary Monsters. In addition to the promised studio series, I'd really like to see/hear a live document of the Ouside tour(s).  <br /> <br />Favorite songs include: Heart's Filthy Lesson; The Motel; Hallo Spaceboy; Voyeur of Utter Destruction; Thru These Architect's Eyes; Strangers When We Meet...overall, a truly devastating and mind blowing record.  <br /> <br />Final wish: Once and for all, please re-issue 'The Buddha of Suburbia.'  <br /> <br /> <br />
0060763280|5.0|This was $20 well spent dollars. I purchased it in an airport and managed to finish it before arriving home. It reads quickly, with interesting anecdotes throughout to illustrate the key concept of each chapter. Eker's main contribution to this genre is his comparison of how rich people think about wealth and money compared to the attitudes of poor people. According to Eker, creating wealth really is a matter of attitude--just as W. Clement Stone and Napoleon Hill suggested a positive mental attitude can lead to success.    My favorite wealth vs. poverty mindset is the Ekerism: \\"Rich people choose to get paid based on results. Poor people choose to get paid based on time.\\" Combine an attitude of expecting payment only for results with Tom Hopkins advice to do the most productive thing possible at all times, and you will achieve your goals. Ah, goals. Every book on success and wealth talks about goals. You may also want to read \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" by Napoleon Hill and \\"The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth\\" by Phillip Collinsworth.
B00005JNQS|5.0|My 4 1/2 year old son and 3 year old daughter both love this movie.  I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it and it is among our favorites.  The characters are very lovable, it has catchy music and has a nice message (hard work, determination, helpfulness, teamwork, etc.)  It is also entertaining for adults - I don't mind watching it over and over again.  There are a few things that may not appeal to some with younger kids (jokes about Aunt \\"Fannie\\" and her attributes) however they are pretty tame.
076790592X|4.0|\\"Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lessons\\" had its ups and downs with me. Sometimes, it hit me hard, I felt the message, and could imagine myself embracing the wisdom.  Other times, I'd shake my head and felt as if I were drowning in sweet sugariness, not seeing how any of Morrie's wisdom can be put to use without striving for excellence in a career.  Without money, how can we live comfortable enough to enjoy our loved ones?  Isn't it a vicious cycle?  I thought that he could feel as he did because he was secure enough in his life, in all respects, to say and preach what he felt.  It does make you realize the simplicity of life, and how we do over complicate everything, and the overall message did sit well with me.  But, I just can't fully wrap myself in all Morrie said. I greatly enjoyed author Mitch Albom's writing.  I recommend.

B00005JOVH|5.0|Brett Ratner does a good job of delivering an action packed third entry into the comic series with the X-MEN III The Last Stand. I really don't understand the stupid bellyaching against the movie. The special effects were great, the acting was good, and the dialogue while nothing sophisticated fit the movie perfectly. <br /> <br />The plot is similar to the other movies, the X-MEN do battle against Magneto's mutants and himself once again. The twist here is that an anti-mutant gene or antidote is being made from one mutant. This will turn the mutants human. Of course the moral tale is brought here once again for the mutants being a \\"disease\\". <br /> <br />Ratner like Singer does a good job of setting up the action and tension as well as one director can having directed the profitably successful \\"Rush Hour\\" movies Ratner really didn't disappoint whatsoever with the exception of perhaps giving a deeper profile of the Sentinels. <br /> <br />The Dark Phoenix, Jean Grey's alter ego comes to life and destroys everyone in her path, Magneto seizes the opportunity but even he doesn't realize the dangerous powers she has. <br />It was also great seeing the other new X-MEN in here including Kitty Pryde , Beast, Archangel and other mutants like Juggernaut. Famke Jansen is very good here and sexy as always, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine again knows hot to hit the mark as Wolverine and Ian Ian McKellen in his last stint as Magneto is terrific <br /> <br />This is a good old smashmouth action comic book film like the last one and I have to say if this is the last movie that I was pretty satisfied with the work everything did on the movie.

0525457585|5.0|This book is incredible.  If I had to use my imagination to imagine a book that the most creative imagination could create--this story would be the outcome!! <br /> <br />The first 100 or so pages were JUST LIKE THE FIRST MOVIE and I found myself a little bored, but than the story takes off and so many things that I had never even heard of happened! <br /> <br />This book is a forever classic and everyone should read it at least once.  I felt my childhood feelings come right back to me.  This definitely renewed my creative side as well.  I highly recommend this book!!  VERY HIGHLY!  I cannot in my wildest dream think of a more imaginative storyline.  Michael Ende is genius.

This book teaches us valuable information about how we live, how we feel, and how we perceive our lives.

This book explains what it means to live and provides meaningful points of view, derived from the Toltec natives, about how we can better understand life.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Quote: \\"Division Bell is the worst Pink Floyd album ever made Followed a close second by A Momentary Lapse of Reason.David Gilmour has already said this concert looks terrible.\\" End Quote <br /> <br />Someone has no appreciation for Pink Floyd's music to say this.  MLOR is one of Pink Floyds best albums, definitely one of my all time favorites.  Most all of my PF buddies agree.  Gilmour also stated the reason for a good bit of the delay was so that they could work out the PQ problems, which he stated they did just that... so it will not look terrible.  It obviously won't be HD quality but if Gilmour has anything to do with it, it will be quite good... you can bank on that.  He is a perfectionist with SQ and PQ. <br /> <br />I am looking forward to this one and have no doubt it will shine!  I will complete this review once owned and viewed.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I already had \\"Nevermind\\" but wasn't satisfied knowing some of Nirvana's best tracks like All Apologies, You Know You're Right & Heart-Shaped Box wasn't in my collection so I got this. This greatest hits is only missing a few tracks like \\"Stay Away\\" and \\"On A Plane\\" oh yeah and \\"Polly\\" Why isn't Polly on here? Either the Nevermind version or the \\"New Wave\\" version would have been nice on this. Besides those missing tracks, which I already have on Nevermind anyway, this is an amazing collection of songs! At first I was disappointed that All Apologies was the live unplugged version but after hearing it now I love it. It's a little softer and deeper sounding. That's just an amazing song no matter what. It's so sad that Kurt had to leave us. Nirvana made awesome music! \m/
B00005JP4U|5.0|I just read online that President Bush has declared that he has no intention of seeing this film.  A more thoughtful chief executive might at least indicate a willingness to view a documentary featuring a former \\"worthy opponent\\" (although that particular term of respect for a political adversary seems to have longsince fallen out of usage) in order to better understand the issues embraced not only by said opponent but by a sizeable number of the citizenry at large.  It might suggest something like an open mind...but then that wouldn't play too well with the conservative base, would it? <br /> <br />If the president really were to take in this thoughtful and surprisingly involving documentary, he might actually learn something--nothing that his handlers wouldn't be able to put a negative spin on, of course.  They can only be expected to discount the science and the motivations behind the film.  Already right wing columnists--as well as any number of conservative Amazon reviewers below--have launched into full attack mode and, in effect, do the Bush administration's handiwork for them.  They are quick to point out the so-called \\"global cooling\\" scare of the early 1970s as proof that scientists are hacks--except of course when they agree with the administration.   <br /> <br />(Some scientists WERE talking about cooling trends during that era, admittedly, but they were only just beginning to develop a consensus on meterological trends.  The science has gotten a lot more exact since then, but that hasn't stopped POLITICAL hacks like George Will from mentioning the supposed great \\"global cooling\\" scare of 35 years ago at every turn.) <br /> <br />And Al Gore has anticipated their arguments and responded to them in advance throughout the course of this film and the lecture series that it documents.  He refers to them as \\"alleged global warming\\" deniers, people who dispute the indisputable, mainly out of economic concerns.  More generously, he refers to good men and womenon both sides of the aisle who remain in denial in the face of what appears to be--if it is true--an overwhelmingly catastropic situation.  <br /> <br />And he demonstrates a certain fundamental understanding of human nature when he cites how in an earlier era the medical establishment, the government and tobacco producers lived in denial of the \\"inconvenient truth\\" that cigarette smoking causes cancer--and how he personally paid the price for such ignorance in losing a beloved sister to that disease.  Ingrained habit, coupled with hardcore economic interests can make for deadly intransigence in the face of overwhelming evidence. <br /> <br />Like the graphic shows though, when you weigh your economic interests (represented by bricks of gold bullion) against the fate of the planet, hmmmm, which one DO you choose?  Kinda reminds you of the old Jack Benny \\"Your-money-or-your-life\\" gag.  Unfortunately, the punchline is changed.  You can't answer \\"I'm thinking! I'm thinking!\\" anymore.  Plainly, too many people aren't thinking at all.
B000EDWKXI|3.0|There are some magnificient views of Venice in this movie. Also, the costumes are really impressive. So visually some scenes are very nice. However, the movie overall is very average. The story is not believable and the actors play is pretty weak. Casanova looks bored of all these women chasing him without any obvious reason, that really makes no sense. Francesca is a feminist who is probably a couple centuries ahead of her time.<br /><br />Overall, very average.
B00005JOQS|4.0|I really would give this movie 3 1/2 stars, but I figure what they hey, round up :)    It's simple for me: when Superman was on the screen, it was awesome!  When it was Clark Kent?  Yawn.  The Clark kent scenes didn't have anywhere near the whimsical fun of the older movies.  Routh is a good actor, but he's no Christopher Reeve when it comes to playing the alter ego.  I would have graded the movie much lower if it hadn't been all Superman in the last 30 minutes.      I enjoyed the tie-ins to the original movie, including lines spoken by Marlon Brando pulled straight from the first.  There were multiple \\"duplicate scenes\\" from the original that I enjoyed as well.  I just wish Routh had pulled Clark kent off better...    As for Superman...  OH. MY. GOD.  The BEST thing they did was handle how Superman flies.  It was ALWAYS fast.  I mean FAST.  I mean \\"Faster than a speeding bullet\\" fast. ;)  I LOVED sitting there and feeling like I was being pushed back in my seat whenever we had an over-the-shoulder shot of Supes flying.  Excellent.  And the use of his powers always had what I would expect in a real superhero: routine for them but absolutely awe-inspiring for the common person.  They REALLY did a good job with the FX on this one.  Best Superman yet.    So, I guess my title sums up my feelings.  When Superman was on the screen, I couldn't get enough.  When Clark Kent was on the screen, I'd had enough within 30 seconds.  That, and the \\"Savior\\" imagery was a bit much.  But whateva :)    Bottom line: worth the price of admission :)
B00006CXSS|5.0|This will be the movie we watch on Memorial day.  It is a classic that is moving.  I certainly didn't want the movie to end.  I have already seen this one 3 times and find it just as good as the first time I saw it.
B00005JP4U|5.0|Like a lot of people, I thought that a powerpoint lecture by Al Gore would be a snoozefest.  When I first saw the trailer to 'An Inconvenient Truth', I laughed at the way the movie was hyped, yet was nothing more than a lecture by Gore.<br /><br />Gore's lecture was absolutely amazing.  He painted a clear picture of the global warming problem in an apolitical manner.  The facts backed up by imagery and research were very convincing that we are in danger.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that 'An Inconvenient Truth' will not reach a wide audience, or reach those that should see it the most.  Gore is a political creature, and therefore he will not reach about 50% of the population.  This presentation is an important one that all should see, regardless of political preference.
B000FGGE68|4.0|This isn't that bad. I give it 4 stars for sci fi fans and 3 stars for everyone else. It has a shaky story and the action is a little over the top - ok a lot over the top in some scenes. This makes it hard to believe what is going on...but if you play close enough attention, the unbelievable parts become a little more believable. <br /> <br />This is non stop action - extremely similar to Equilibrium...in fact, in the end, i thought I was watching Equilibrium - they are that similar. I'd say the fight scenes better than Equilibrium, but they are more over the top...so they kind of even out. <br /> <br />There are 2 fight scenes in particular that catch my eye...one in the library and one on the rooftop. The one on the rooftop is more of what you wished you saw in the matrix and the library is identical to Equilibrium in so many ways...but more beautiful :) If you don't like sci fi, I'd say you still need to see these two scenes. <br /> <br />The con and plus is milla jovovich's character. They make her character nigh invincible, one thing I hate seen done to hero characters (seems like female characters are particularily made this way in so many roles where they play the hero). This makes her hard to identify with, but, to her credit, she plays the role well and she is pleasing to watch. <br /> <br />The scenery and imagery is very nice. I liked the entire look of the film. There is alot of information thrown at you if you pay attention...i wish they had spent more time on story and character development...or made a prequel prior to this that would have built into this...it feels like they skipped a whole movie's worth of material. <br /> <br />I'd say your probably safe to buy this if you are a scifi fan. If your not into scifi but like action you may want to consider renting it...but it'd be safer to find a sci fi friend to borrow it from.
0684824906|4.0|It's almost as if Lincoln had read Sun-Tzu'z work and decided to put it into practice when creating his cabinet. Most likely it was Lincoln's consummate skill as a politician that motivated him to surround himself with his political rivals; not allowing personal feelings and past slights to interfere with his decision to utilize some of the best minds America had to offer to deal with the trying times the country was going to face in the years ahead. Goodwin's decision to pursue this aspect of Lincoln's presidency was a good one; as this book is able to shed some new light on Lincoln and his relationship with his cabinet, a group that often is hidden in the great shadow of Lincoln but nonetheless had a vital role to play in the saving of the Union. Starting with early biographical material on Seward, Stanton, and the rest of the cabinet, Goodwin portrays a group of ambitious but very different men, who are brought together by Lincoln's willingness to sacrifice ego for the good of the country. Each relationship with Lincoln is well delineated, from Seward's close bonds to Chase's never ending pursuit of the presidency. The book's only shortcoming is that in the end, Goodwin cannot resist Lincoln's allure; and as time moves on the cabinet falls farther away from the center until once again they are overshadowed by Lincoln's inherent greatness. But you can hardly fault Goodwin; Lincoln is hard man to resist as his cabinet discovered.
B0006MT314|5.0|I sooo love this album, i listen to it so many times a day. i really like it cuz it has a mix of all kinds of music:)
B0002858YS|4.0|<br />Even the name of the band, a name that is really hard to live up to I might add, gives you an idea where these guys are coming from. Starting with the clever/juvenile lyrics on \\"Mr. Brighside\\" (\\"Now they're going to bed, And my stomach is sick, And it's all in my head, But she's touching his-chest\\") and continuing with pounding, rhythmic music occasionally accompanied by 80's synth sounds, and a lead singer whose voice just drips with sarcasm and you have is a band that throws caution to the wind; luckily, most of the time they get away with it. The lyrics just challenge the conventions when coupled with driving beats on songs like \\"Somebody Told Me\\"  <br />Well somebody told me <br />You had a boyfriend <br />Who looked like a girlfriend <br />That I had in February of last year <br />It's not confidential <br />I've got potential <br />I don't think they always get away with this ,  \\"On Top\\" seems to combine the worst of the above elements into something annoying, but overall this is a band to watch grow.  <br />
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Sky Captain is a beautifully designed and convincingly rendered movie based on the stylistic concepts of the early Golden Age of Science Fiction, which started in the 30s and ended in the 60s with the arrival of the so-called New Wave. Much of the visual style owes its inspiration to the work of several architects and designers of the period. Huge Ferriss, an architect, drew beautiful charcoal drawings and portraits of a futuristic, high-rise New York that were very popular and appeared as illustrations in many important magazines of the day. Two other influences that were significant were Norman Bel Geddes, an industrial designer, and Raymond Loewy.<br /><br />The flying platform in the movie derives from one of Bel Geddes's most ambitious concepts, a nine story high amphibious airliner that incorporated open recreation areas, space for a symphony orchestra, two airplane hangers, a gymnasium and a solarium. Loewy is remembered for designs that have influenced almost every aspect of American life, including Air Force One, NASA's Skylab space station, Frigidaire freezers, washers, and ovens, the redesign of the original Coke Bottle, the Lucky Strike cigaret package, many diesel locomotive designs, Studebaker automobiles, and the Greyhound Scenicruiser bus, to mention some of his most important projects.<br /><br />The streamlined art deco design of the period owes a great deal to the work of these three men, and was the reason that everything from cars to Buck Rogers's rocket ship had the same look. The film brilliantly recaptures the zeitgeist and overall look and feel of this period of the Golden Age. I think the film is worth seeing if only for that. But the special effects and action are also great and make this a fun movie to see even if you're not a fan of Art Deco architecture and the old Sci-Fi pulp magazines.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF ANY PERSON ABOVE 18 YEARS WOULD AVOID THIS GREAT ALBUM FROM BOSTON AND BUY SOME TR**H FROM SOMEONE AS HORRIBLE AS JESSICA SIMPSON WHO IS AS BAD AS HER SISTER ASHLEE,  AND BRITNEY.THIS AS ONE OF THE FINEST ALBUMS EVER WITH SUCH TITANIC HITS LIKE MORE THAN A FEELING.GET THIS WITH DONT LOOK BACK THEIR SUPERB SOPHOMORE ALBUM.
B00005JOQS|5.0|The 3D IMAX Experience is the way to see SUPERMAN RETURNS. This movie is excellent, from the opening credits as the audiences cheered and applauded on to SUPERMAN's exit in the end. Lots of fun to watch, and a great story. Die Hard fans will enjoy this even more to the many references and details from SUPERMAN I & II. (Jor-El aka Marlon Brando's voice throughout the movie, picture of Jonathon Kent/Glenn Ford on the mantle). You cannot compare the incredible Chris Reeve to Brandon Routh. Brandon is truly a new SUPERMAN, who did an amazing job, especially as the geeky Clark Kent. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor was fantastic. This is truly an emotional Superman story, with lots of flying where you feel you are flying (or floating) in the sky with him. There is alot of humor too, with great performances by the new Lois Lane & Jimmy Olsen. The entire time I was watching this movie (night before opening), I was already thinking about stories that could be used for the sequel. I'm so happy SUPERMAN RETURNS!!
0441013074|5.0|I'm not exactly sure the exact reason for the negative reviews. Such items as book length, insufficient sci-fi purity and jokes are the main culprits.  I appreciate the wit and inside jokes from the author - at least it's not Turtledove with his absurd alternate histories where the same leaders star despite the changes in events. In its own way, it is just as superb as Redemption Ark or Chaos City.  WARNING: This is NOT a science fiction only book; it is not a space opera as are Chaos City and the Redemption Series; it is not a \\"time travel\\" story.  It has noir mystery, actions, imagination and the author balances the two stories that eventually merge.  <br /> <br />Reynolds excells in characterization, particularly romance - a talent that few science fiction writers share. And if we're talking romance what better setting than Paris with its cafes, jazz bars and beauty. There are science fiction (space) aspects but in reality this is a 1930's film noir mystery.  Add time travel and you get a rollicking, fun, story that is slightly over the top but in sci-fi terms, well integrated and plausible. There is no need to repeat the plot as the chapters alternate between a Paris of 1959 with a detective investigating a suspicious suicide and and an archeologist exploring a destroyed Paris 300 years later. The author has invented an entire future history and culture for mankind where humans have split over the use of nanotechnology (the book contains awesome descriptions of such wonders). It's all there - the politics, intrigue, war, action and that most important of human emotions, love.  The book had a cinematic quality - the fog, furtive meetings in tunnels, an edge-if-the-seat action and old-fashioned romance.  Even the ending contains hope though unbeknownst to our intrepid hero. I give it a solid \\"A\\".
B000E6UK5K|4.0|This is the perfect album to listen to while staring at the sea. Gilmour sounds as majestic as ever. Listening to tracks \\"Blue\\" and \\"On an Island\\" are delightfully brilliant.   <br />Have been listening to it non-stop since I purchased it over a month ago. David Gilmour never ceases to amaze.
0800177975|1.0|I love a lot of Arnold's movies but this movie is just a one time viewing.  <br />My overall opinion a horrible movie, would have been great if it was actually funny.
B000FGGE68|2.0|I think I'm mostly going to touch base on the surround sound. It's not good, and for a film that boasts as much noise and action as \\"Ultraviolet\\" does, I was gravely dissapointed at what I got. I don't know how many DVD's is considered \\"Alot\\" but I have quite a few and the 5.1 Surround Sound on this film is very lackluster. If you want a good futuristic movie with real acting and intensity get Kurt Wimmer's first movie \\"Equilibrium\\". If you have already seen it and are still curious about \\"Ultraviolet\\" go ahead and see for yourself. It's almost the same concept (totalitarian future government) but even less realized then his other film. Milla Jovovich's acting chops are not even close to being in the same league as Christian Bale from \\"Equilibrium\\" and almost everything becomes tedious when you don't even have great sound pumping out of the speakers to fall back on. Watchable, but not worth your money.....too late for me...don't let it get you too.
B000002AS3|5.0|Oasis is my favorite band, and for a good reason too. I love every single song that Oasis has recorded, it just seems to be the band that fits me best. Even twelve years after its release, Oasis's debut album Definitely Maybe still sounds magnificent. Many consider this album to be the finest debut album of all time, while personally I believe it to be the finest album of all time. <br /> <br />Let me put my love for Oasis to good use in describing you the beauty of Definitely Maybe, my favorite Oasis album and my favorite album ever. <br /> <br />1: \\"Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" This is my favorite Oasis song. From the second I heard it I was hooked. Five minutes and twenty three seconds of pure joy. <br /> <br />2: \\"Shakermaker\\" Sounds like a drug-induced vision of magnificence. Trippy, but upbeat and hard rocking. <br /> <br />3: \\"Live Forever\\" Absolutely beautiful. The lyrics flow majestically. Must be heard to be believed. <br /> <br />4: \\"Up In The Sky\\" The music is upbeat and happy, but the lyrics are sad. Makes you happy but sad at the same time, an interesting tune. <br /> <br />5: \\"Columbia\\" Pure Oasis. Gritty and harsh, the lyrics are not meant to be understood, just heard. A great song. <br /> <br />6: \\"Supersonic\\" Oasis's first single leaves one stunned. Goes in and out from the \\"Brit grit\\" Oasis to the bittersweet Oasis in the A and B parts of the song. Sad but graceful. <br /> <br />7: \\"Bring It On Down\\" This song is an experience. Whenever I hear this song, my body seems to collect energy. The louder the better. The lyrics sound like an insult, and the music sounds like a force to be felt. This is pure. <br /> <br />8: \\"Cigarettes & Alcohol\\" This song is fun to listen to. Not exactly beautiful, but nicely sour. Tastes like a British pub. <br /> <br />9: \\"Digsy's Dinner\\" A sad song. Sounds harsher, but harsh is what most of definitely maybe is. Nice little tune. <br /> <br />10: \\"Slide Away\\" A beautiful song, bittersweet but a nice ride. Takes me to a different place. <br /> <br />11: \\"Married With Children\\" One of the only really \\"soft\\" songs here. Purely acoustic and magnificent. <br /> <br />Overall, its a beautiful album. I may have seemed to glorify the album, but the album really is glorious after all. <br /> <br />This is one album that should be in every music lover's collection. Absolutely beautiful.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Eli Roth's style of directing is a mixture of toungue-in-cheek comedy, and extreme violence. He did it in \\"Cabin Fever\\" and he does it again in \\"Hostel\\". This review actually doesn't need to be any longer. If you like his style you should enjoy his 2nd film. Short and Sweet. A must for horror fans!
1401359418|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I'd never really thought about luck before, but upon meditating on the principles in the book, I realized that there is more to luck than just chance.  It's an asset that you can acquire and Richard Wiseman tells you how to acquire it!  Don't just read it - when you're finished, enroll in \\"Luck School\\" and watch your life change!  I'm astounded at all the things that are happening in only four days of \\"school\\"!  It isn't just my  outer world that is changing but my response to events as well - my awareness of these principles is changing me!  It is all explained in this generous gift of a book - buy it quick!
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|In advance I want to let everyone know I'm not an expert on this film but I enjoyed it nevertheless. \\"Advent Childen\\" is one of those movies that caters more to the devoted followers of the \\"Final Fantasy\\" series, and even more so to those in love with \\"Final Fantasy VII\\". They will know all the details and everything like it's nobodies business, and good for them. To me the film is eye candy, spectacular action, polished CGI, complete with gravity defying stunts. The movie assumes you are somewhat familiar with everyone and familiar with that world. The point of my review is that even if you aren't, it's still a fun movie to look at.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Absolutely outstanding! I cannot recommend this CD enough.  If you are into Neo Soul then you will love this album.  However, you should not buy this album if any of the following apply to you. <br /> <br />1.) You own anything by Ashanti <br />2.) You watch 106 and Park <br />3.) You prefer BET to BETJ <br />4.) You own anything by TI or The Game <br /> <br />If any of the above apply to you then please look elsewhere.  Corrine is more than a singer she's a vocalist and a superb song writer. She sings of memories of her childhood and of love this is warm \\"like oil on her hands\\".   <br /> <br />There are no guest rappers on this CD nor are there any remixes featuring Missy or Mariah.  Corrine does the way it supposed to be done she lets her voice and song writing speak for her instead of her booty. <br /> <br />The lead single \\"Like a Star\\" reminds me of \\"Orange Moon\\" by Erykah Badu.  But it is not the best song on the Album that honor goes to \\"Breathless\\". <br /> <br />Erykah Badu, India.Arie, Kindred, Vivian Green fans need apply.  Those looking for the \\"R&B hotty\\" look away.  Support real R&B, Support real music. Get this album... you won't be disappointed.
0736063684|5.0|I have been working out for 5 years on and off. I bought this book to isolate certain muscle groups and it has paid off. Not only does the book show you how to properly do specific exercises, it warns of potential dangers of some exercises. The images in the book are very detailed and there are a ton of exercises that are explained in detail. A+
B000F39MAQ|4.0|Willi Decker's modern-dress staging of \\"La Traviata\\" will certainly not be to everyone's taste, but I found it worked surprisingly well in this DVD in which filmmaker Brian Large chooses to highlight the strongly played relationships between the three main characters through his emphasis on close ups. Even if the almost bare stage, with starkly symbolic objects like the huge clock ticking away Violetta's life and couches as the only furniture, might have seemed chilly in the theatre, this is still a story of a trio of people loving, ruining lives, suffering, and dying, and those passions come across with shocking strength on the screen. At the very least, this provocative staging will make you see this story and its protagonists in a fresh new way. <br /> <br />That's thanks to a wonderful cast who live their roles with all their might. People who think that the \\"Dream Couple\\" -- Netrebko and Villazón -- are an over-hyped media creation are just flat wrong. Yes, they get a lot of hype, but they deserve it. Both have beautiful voices that touch the heart, solid vocal techniques to back them up, and outstanding acting ability. That they're also great to look at is a wonderful bonus. I wish opera folks weren't so inclined to always bring up great singers of the past -- she's no Callas, he's no Corelli -- to put down the singers of the present. These two are brilliant in their own right and should be treasured for the extraordinarily fresh vitality they bring to the opera world. <br /> <br />Totally committed in her acting and singing, Anna Netrebko is a heartbreakingly vulnerable Violetta; her third act had me weeping. Rolando Villazón made Alfredo into a wonderfully believable young man in love: a somewhat immature and socially gauche young country boy who hates Violetta's nasty crowd (they're very nasty in this production!) but loves her with a winning, virile passion -- and a frightening touch of jealousy. His vibrant singing is very exciting, but unfortunately his big Act II cavatina doesn't achieve its full impact because of Decker's hyper staging here. No tenor should have to sing such a tough aria while pulling on his pants! The interpolated love scene in Act II between Violetta and Alfredo was actually a great addition because it shows us a little of the lovers' blissful relationship (which otherwise is something we have to take on faith) and it provides the only light moments in an otherwise rather grim staging. And it's delightfully spicy without being at all in bad taste! <br /> <br />I have more reservations about Thomas Hampson as Father Germont. Though his voice is rather thin and dry for Verdi, he sounds much better in the DVD then in the \\"Traviata\\" CD that was released last fall. And, though slightly too mannered and stilted, his acting of the domineering father is very strong and sometimes even touching as he realizes he's making a mess of things. His aria \\"Di Provenza il mar\\"comes across here as a harrowing piece of emotional blackmail rather than just a beautiful song. <br /> <br />My reservations come with some of Decker's heavy-handed use of symbols to tell what's really a very human story. I don't like the chorus all dressed as men, Violetta's tormenters. They come across as obnoxious cartoons rather than people, and the performance generally goes downhill when they're on. <br /> <br />The Vienna Philharmonic also does not come across as the great, subtle orchestra that it is. Chalk that up to conductor Carlo Rizzi I guess. <br /> <br />But where it really counts, this DVD scores. Get it for Netrebko and Villazón's performances if nothing else. <br /> <br />And try to get the Premium Edition with the bonus DVD with its delicious backstage at the rehearsals feature. Netrebko, Villazón and Decker are very candid and illuminating about what they're trying to achieve, and the two stars -- especially Villazón who is irrepressibly hilarious! -- provide a lot of laughs. Pompous diva and divo they're definitelynot! Wonderfully entertaining!! <br /> <br />
B00005JOQS|5.0|WOW! With Batman Begins and Superman Returns both coming out within a year of each other, we have two epic DC Comics franchises that will carry on for years to come. Brandon Routh was very convincing as the man of steel and Kate Bosworth played a lovely Lois Lane. Of course Kevin Spacey stole the show as Lex Luthor, while Parker Posey was a riot as his sidekick. With a budget around 250 million you would expect the CGI to be amazing and yeah, it really was. I had a feeling this film would follow in the tradition of the 1978 film as soon as I heard the iconic theme and saw the blue cast credits flying overhead. What a great summer film. Now bring on Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest!
B000FOQ0TG|5.0|When I heard that they were releasing a deluxe edition of \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\", I was thrilled! I couldn't wait! This is one of the greatest albums ever made, and this special edition rules! It consists of a 2 CD and 1 DVD package. Disc 1 is the remastered version of \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" released in 2003. Disc 2 is a previously unreleased live performance of the ENTIRE album from the Hammersmith Odeon in London in 1990, which is FANTASTIC!!!! And the DVD is \\"Video: Mindcrime\\" which is on DVD for the first time ever, and I was so thrilled when I finally got to see this, and I didn't need to buy a used VHS copy. It has music videos for 9 songs on the album: <br /> <br />I Remember Now <br />Anarchy X <br />Revolution Calling <br />Operation: Mindcrime <br />Speak <br />Breaking The Silence <br />I Don't Believe In Love <br />Waiting For 22 <br />Eyes Of A Stranger (the best of the 9 videos) <br /> <br />and the DVD also includes a TV spot, and a previously unreleased making of featurette which really just focuses on the album's music videos, but it's still great, and it's got some neat behind the scenes footage and interviews with the band members. This deluxe edition is worth every dollar! Go pick it up! If you haven't heard OM before, then get this! If you have heard it before, get this anyway, because it's worth it!
B00005JOSS|5.0|I went to see this movie, and was impressed again by the chemistry between Reeves and Bullock.  I saw this the first time in Speed and I was not disappointed.  I thought both Reeves and Bullock really \\"nailed\\" their roles, and I truly believed and invested in their lives.  It is definitely worth seeing.
B000FMGTTE|5.0|When Bryan Singer announced that his editor, John Ottman, would be scoring Superman Returns, two questions came to mind. Would the Superman Theme we all know and love be used? And, why not invite John Williams back to revisit an old friend?<br /><br />  To answer the first question, Singer stated that he always intended to use the Superman Theme because you can't make a Superman movie and not have it. That's like making a Star Trek movie and not using the Star Trek Theme. Not only did he use the main theme, but others as well. In fact, the whole album is based on Williams score and Ottman just builds from it. Everything is here in one form or another.<br /><br />  There are snippets from \\"Death of Jonathan Kent\\" as well as \\"The Fortress of Solitude.\\" Also, we get \\"The Love Theme\\" in an abbrviated version. March of the Villians is here to but you need to pay close attention to catch it.<br /><br />  So your probably rhinking that the Superman Returns score is just a rehash of Williams score right? Actually, no. While Ottman uses bits and pieces from Williams, he builds from that with newly written meatrial. And it's just as exciting and memorable as Williams's. One new thing that is really nice is that Superman now has a Personal Theme and one that's played throughout the film. It's touching, emotional and beautiful.<br /><br />  You can tell that Williams was an influence on Ottman because like Williams score for Superman, Ottman here also uses a lot of precussion, string, wind instruments. For added effect, a choir's been added which somehow uses the Love Theme instead of the \\"Can You Read My Mind\\" and on Superman's Personal Theme.<br /><br />  The Cd also comes with enhanced stuff. Not much when you look it but still a treat. What's the enhanced stuff? It's:<br /><br />1) 2 Trailers<br /><br />2) A session of recording the Superman Theme<br /><br />3) Trailer for Suoperman Documentry.<br /><br />  The score's not bad. In fact, it's great and Ottman did a wonderful job. There are different types of music here that relate to specific scenes in the film and he has done a superb job with it.<br /><br />  As for Williams, I have a hunch he was asked but had to decline because of prior commitments which is a shame because it wou;d have been nice seeing the guy who wrote one of the most popular scores(Oscar Nominated)come back to do it all again.<br /><br />  Well Mr. Williams, here's your chance to visit with your old friend for the sequal.rful job.

B0000640S2|4.0|In spite of its flaws (and let's face it, Rambo isn't art), this still remains one of the most relentlessly intense, adrenalin-fuelled action pics ever made. I first got into the Rambo series with Rambo III, although I had already seen Part II on televison a couple of years after its theatrical release (I wish I had seen this on the big screen). Initially I didn't think it was anything great, but Rambo has gradually become over the years one of those guilty pleasures of mine (we all have them). <br />   True, the characters are fairly one-dimensional & some of the dialogue & acting is a bit cheesy - but the movie succeeds admirably in those areas that really count in an escapist action film. The look of the film - specifically Stallone as the steel-thewed supersoldier with his trademark bandana & specialised bow with explosive-tipped arrows - plus state-of-the-art pyrotechnics - all allied to well done action sequences & exciting score by Jerry Goldsmith. <br />   Much of the action & violence for which the film is much maligned, is concentrated in the last quarter or so, rather than liberally sprinked throughout, & God knows Rambo's actions seem rather justified after having been a) abandoned by the American government b) captured & tortured by communist soldiers and c) having his compatriot/ally Co Boa killed before his eyes. <br />  This film made Rambo a household name & 80s cultural icon. It was an enormous box-office hit - I believe it took more money its first three weeks alone than any other R-rated picture at that time, as well as being a smash hit here in Australia (as were the other 2 Rambo films). Go ahead: see it!
B000E97HIA|3.0|I missed the purple train in the 80s and only discovered Prince's musical genius in the early 1990s. When I discovered it, 'twas with a vengeance, though. I bought up every studio album and even hunted down bootlegs. Whenever a new CD was released, I was there the minute the store opened to snatch it up. Prince spoke to me with almost every song, and my friends and I wondered what unreleased gems awaited our discovery amidst the thousands of songs reputed to be in his vaults.<br /><br />Sadly, with the debacle that was Crystal Ball, Prince burned a lot of his fans---including me. That said, I still went out (walking instead of running) to purchase his next few recordings, but without the fervor that had filled me earlier. And each CD that I purchased seemed to get weaker and weaker, with an occasional highlight here and there. Musicology was the first Prince CD I refused to buy, because I heard a copy of my uncle's \\"free\\" concert CD and found it boring and uninspired at best.<br /><br />So when Prince announced his new album, I had mixed feelings. I wanted to hear it, but feared getting burned once again. The songs I heard through iTunes, \\"Te Amo Corazon\\" and \\"Black Sweat,\\" were both pretty good, but it was only after I checked the CD out at the local library that I decided to purchase it. I am still not certain if that was a good decision.<br /><br />The title track features the familiar voice of Camille, but the tune itself is a relatively listless reminder of \\"Jam of the Year\\" and \\"Life of the Party.\\" (My daughter loves the hook, but she is 4. That might tell you something.) \\"Lolita\\" features some interesting New Wave instrumentation and a more mature lyrical sensibility about fidelity. \\"Te Amo Corazon\\" adds a Latin flourish to Prince's trademark album ballad, and Prince pulls a James Brown with \\"Black Sweat,\\" a minimalist funk workout that might have been an outtake from Parade, albeit one that would not have made the final cut. The only interesting thing about \\"Incense and Candles\\" is Prince's use of a vocoder. \\"Fury\\" is an upbeat number that sounds near-identical to other Prince songs from Rave and Musicology. The much-praised song \\"Beautiful, Loved and Blessed\\" sounds like it was lifted straight off of New Power Soul, and while \\"The Dance\\" and \\"Get on the Boat\\" are not bad songs, they are not particularly memorable songs either. (Am I alone in wishing Prince would move past the Cab Calloway horn section jams? What happened to Prince's scorching guitar solos?)<br /><br />The CD is still better than Musicology, although that is not saying much. Those who think that this is his best since SOT have their right to an opinion, but I think their opinions just show that they have tin ears. At its best, 3121 is a slimmed-down version of Emancipation and at its worst it is simply Prince rehashing old material. It used to be evident in Prince's music that he listened to and drew inspiration from a variety of music; these days its the same tired R&B with a few horns thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Maybe it is me, maybe it is Prince---either way, one of us is getting too old for this music.s Prince's use of a vocoder. \\"Fury\\" is an upbeat number that sounds near-identical to other Prince songs from Rave and Musicology.

B00004RF97|5.0|I do believe this classic will continue to span generations.  Besides containing many stars of its time, it is clever and smart with wonderful performances by the entire cast. More than two thumbs up if I had more thumbs.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I have bought extra copies to hand out to friends and family especially young people starting out but even older folks at a crisis or major transitional juncture of their lives. I, myself, coming out of a coma to a year of upheaval and turmoil and change have found it to be of great comfort. It helps if you are knowledgeable regarding the references but not necessary and, in fact it might even may better if they serve as an intro. Last comment: This film made me want to smoke a joint or drop a tab it is so experiential. Alas, as I have been clean and sober for 30 years I didn't succumb but it really was a temptation and that is saying a lot.
B00005JJX8|5.0|It doesn't get much better than Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, and the French Rivera.
B00097A5I6|5.0|This is the first Oasis album I have ever purchased. I know that sounds crazy, but during the peak of their U.S. popularity in the 90s, I was more into grunge and paid little attention to \\"BritPop.\\" I can tell you that from the day I put this in my CD player, it did not come out for three weeks. I actually heard the song \\"Lyla\\" on my FIFA soccer game, and that's the reason I got the album. I can definitely hear the Beatles' influence on their sound, specifically the guitar on \\"Lyla\\" (reminds me of \\"Getting Better\\") and the drums on \\"A Bell Will Ring\\" (reminds of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\"). And since I am new to the Oasis thing, can somebody explain to me what \\"BritPop\\" is supposed to mean? This isn't what I would call pop -- this is guitar-driven rock. This is the best album I've bought since the \\"Garden State\\" soundtrack more than a year ago. If the Beatles were together today, they'd sound like Oasis. I can't give this album a higher compliment than that.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Based on the heroes from Marvel comics, X-Men is a wonderful sci-fi film, which brings to the screen the struggle for supremacy between two rival groups of mutants while an undeclared state of war with the humans looms in the background. <br />X2-X-Men United picks up where the first movie left off, with a mutant attempt against the US President leading to government countermeasures against the X-Men. <br />Moreover, Wolverine is now closer than ever in finding out about his past, while more interesting characters also make their appearance.    <br />Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen and Halle Berry (BOTH of whom are GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all out of this world! <br />In short, X2-X-Men is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)! <br />
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I have never written a review before but Everwood was my favorite show ever. I can't believe it got cancelled. It was so well written and the cast was so perfect. A lot of shows are really good but they always have that one actor that you can't stand, that never happened in Everwood. Even the guest stars were perfect. I'm going to miss this show so much and I'm am really hoping that they decide to put the rest of the seasons on DVD soon. I heard that they weren't going to because of low sales of the first season. Even though I loved every episode I think the show got better as the seasons went on so I think that the sales would go up if they put out the other seasons. I own a lot of tv shows on DVD and I would really love to have the entire collection of Everwood in my collection.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|The Brothers Grimm brings to the screen the story of two brothers, two charlatans, as they try to earn a living by playing on the simple folks' fears and superstitions.  The setting is Napoleonic Europe and specifically French occupied Germany and the strong sense of history adds to the overall enjoyment of the film.  Matt Damon, Heath Ledger, Lena Heady (who is GORGEOUS and is a more pretty/womanly version of Keira Knightley), Monica Bellucci (no comment needed), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.  There are slight, and not so slight, hints of the French film Brotherhood of the Wolf, Van Helsing and Sleepy Hollow as well as Dungeons and Dragons (!).   The setting, the dialogues, the music, the battle sequences, and the costumes are all wonderful!  On the negative side, some of the silly dialogue could have been avoided.  Very well written and very well presented, it is a movie definitely worth watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History and Fantasy, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!
0316172324|5.0|It is well written book which is about snap judgment/gut feeling are more accurate than theoritical analysis.
B000FFJ85I|2.0|I don't care if a band is \\"punk\\" or whether or not they've become famous.  This album is just not good.  There is another review on here where the person says you have to listen to the songs at least 3 times because they aren't catchy.  I'm sorry, but I thought that was a sign of poor songwriting.  No matter what style of music you play, if the song is good it's gonna get stuck in your head.  This album doesn't.  I've listened to it more than 3 times and I honestly can't hum a single tune from it outside of Miss Murder which is being played everywhere right now.  And that song's not very good.  It has no structure.  It's just a 3 minute length of sound with some Davey Havok screeching.  Some of the songs are like a mix between AFI and Depeche Mode.  I don't know.  I think this band hit it's prime with Sing The Sorrow and can probably look forward to coasting swiftly downhill pretty quickly.
B00005MNP8|5.0|It did truly change my life. I was 14 years old. I was smart, not abused or geeky but i needed a true outlet... I had loved spinning girl group 45's and Beatles records handed down to me. Parallel Lines introduced me to sarcasm. And it stuck. Also it's just a perfect record. Mike Chapman helped shape my adolescence, but this is his (almost) crowning moment. Try not to scream: \\"I fell in love with you\\". Everyone should have Parallel Lines.
068987474X|5.0|I found this book just when I needed it. I had met a man who was all over me for a short time but lost interest very quickly. The fake letters from crazy \\"Nikki\\" in the book described me perfectly: How could a guy who seemed so into me suddenly not be? He HAD to still feel something. And I spent (wasted) the next 18 months of my life trying to reconnect with the part of him that did.  <br /> <br />I almost destroyed a relationship with a guy who IS into me chasing after this other guy, thinking that I must have picked wrong all those years ago and this other guy must be The One because of the relentless pursuit on his part and seemingly soulmate-ish rapport at the beginning. When his walk didn't live up to his talk, I was devastated, until I read the book and realized he was \\"just not that into me.\\" And, in fact, to borrow a chapter heading from the book, he's \\"a selfish jerk, a bully and a really big freak.\\" And neither are my fault. <br /> <br />I was able to let him go and recommit to the guy who is into me. Thank you, Greg and Liz. <br /> <br />
0143039830|4.0|Sometimes (and I don't think I'm alone here), I do judge a book by its cover.  At least my interest was piqued when looking at the cover of Paul Auster's New York Trilogy, with its pulp mystery feel.  Of course, glancing at a book cover really only gives you a superficial view of what's inside, and sure enough, the New York Trilogy - consisting of the novellas City of Glass, Ghosts and The Locked Room - is only superficially a set of mysteries.  Instead, we are given intriguing quests involving the nature of identity and the meaning of our existence; it may sound a bit dull and high-brow, but these stories are actually quite entertaining and thought provoking. <br /> <br />City of Glass follows Quinn, a mystery writer who receives a phone call meant for a private eye named Paul Auster.  Quinn decides to take on Auster's identity and takes a case involving Peter Stillman, a man whose life is threatened by his father who is about to be released from an insane asylum.  Stillman (the son) spent his childhood in complete isolation (hence his father's commitment), and now has trouble grasping who he really is.  Quinn has a different sort of identity crisis; after the death of his wife and child, he has pretty much shed his own life and is running on auto-pilot; this void will be filled in unexpected ways when he impersonates Auster.  What happens internally to Quinn is the main thrust of the story; the mystery plot is merely the device that drives these internal changes. <br /> <br />Ghosts is the tale of Blue, a private investigator hired by White to spy on Black.  Blue will take this job very seriously; his surveillance will consume his life as it goes on and on through months and years; Black, however, never seems to do anything significant and White is a figure of mystery, too, willing to pay but never offering any explanations for the job.  This is a tale of interlocking identities, with Blue and Black becoming intimately linked. <br /> <br />Finally, in The Locked Room, the narrator winds up taking over the life of Fanshawe, his childhood friend who has disappeared.  He marries Fanshawe's estranged wife, adopts his child and lives off the income of Fanshawe's writing.  This is all done with Fanshawe's implied (and later explicit) permission.  For the narrator, however, this is a burden that will threaten to overwhelm him as he learns more and more about his old friend's life. <br /> <br />If there is a failing in this book, it's that - despite claims to the contrary - there is nothing distinctly \\"New York\\" about this book.  Although it is implied that the city itself would be a sort of character in this trilogy, that is not really the case; I feel these tales could take place in any urban environment with the change of a few place references.  This, however, is a minor quibble.  Overall, this is a good book, rating a high four stars.  If you're looking for a mystery, go elsewhere;  if you're looking for a thought-provoking character-driven tale (with a fair share of humor), this will be a good read. <br />
B00005JOQS|5.0|For more than 60 years he has been the most popular superhero of all time and now he's returned to movie screens in Bryan Singer's action packed and emotionally terrific triumph \\"Superman Returns\\" no question the best Superman movie yet, Brandon Routh is a recarnation of Christopher Reeve, Kevin Spacey outdoes Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and Kate Bosworth gives a terrific new approach to Lois Lane. Spetacular and fantastic, a triumph, one of the best summer movies no doubt, a brilliantly riveting motion picture event that pays homage to the Richard Donner films, Terrific Entertainment, this is a must see event, go look up at the movie screen \\"SUPERMAN RETURNS\\" and I hope he returns again. \\"I see an old man's sick joke\\"
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Fleetwood Mac has had a long and varied history, with lineup changes, legendary classics, legendary 'flops', love triangles, blessed reunions, and internal disentigration.  After 16 years, the \\"golden duo\\" of former lovers Nicks and Buckingham are reunited on this disc, with the unfortunate omission of Christine McVie.<br /><br />However, even with her absence, the Mac makes one of their most solid later albums, and definitely the most experimental since 'Tusk' closed out the '70s.  Buckingham is INVOLVED, and it's undeniable.  He hasn't displayed this much passion probably since his early opus 'Tusk'.  For evidence of this, check out the 'making of' dvd, 'Destiny Rules.'<br /><br />A lot of other reviewers are remarking that this disc is good, but falls short of being an important FM work.  I have to disagree, if for no other reason than the fact the group could come back together in their \\"original\\" lineup (not exactly, but the original 'Rumours' lineup at least) after a decade and a half and produce a solid, sturdy, meaningful album is a stunning feat in itself.  The songs here are good, with Nicks providing some of her best pieces in years (and continuing on her 'Trouble In Shangri-La' sound) and Buckingham showing, yet again, why he is probably one of the most gifted (albeit perhaps somewhat underrated) musical geniuses of his time.<br /><br />Originally his concept called for this to be a double-album, and while that would have been a hard sell, at a steep sale price, and a LOT of material for the first album in so many years, fans may have found it difficult to fully sink their teeth into such a glut of work all at once.  Perhaps some of what wasn't included in 'Say You Will' will make it onto future records.  Let's hope so.  The trimmed down version, at 18 tracks, is a beast of an album, and while stylistically \\"uneven\\" (I prefer diverse) it WORKS.<br /><br />The tracks are strong, some graceful, some anxious, some thought-provoking...and there is often the familiar pang of Nicks' and Buckingham's former love affair, most notably when, on \\"Thrown Down\\", she sings, \\"You've shaken your faith in me, no...you've shaken my faith in everything else...a decision no one makes, and now you're going home...Faith is a hard thing to hold onto, something inside you says 'I don't have to'...you're not like other people, you do what you want to...\\"<br /><br />Wow, you can FEEL that sting, after all these years, and feel the kind of deep bond, pain, and anguish that would provoke such songwriting, so obviously about Buckingham, some two decades after their breakup.  This is the stuff Mac is good at, blisteringly solid music, experimentation, mysticism, and mood.  One of my favorite Mac albums, without a doubt.<br /><br />\\"Rumors\\" was an unforseen fluke, a leviathan of a record that steamrolled past all expectations.  We can't compare everything they release to that...that would be like comparing every Prince song to 'Little Red Corvette' - it was a different time, a different era, a different world, and these people have 30 years more experience and are STILL producing music better than pretty much anything on corporate radio today.  And THAT, my friends, is a triumph, and that is why FM are one of rock's most remarkable and storied bands.

B000FFJ85I|4.0|Well let me preface all of this by saying that I've been a casual AFI fan.  I've been a big punk rock fan for years as well as many other genres but for some reason AFI hasn't been something I ever really listened to by myself.  I really liked Sing The Sorrow for the most part but I am really impressed by this album.  It is for the most part a lot more mellow and maybe even poppy but it definitley is less \\"punk\\" than their previous efforts.  But who cares? If that is something that you would hate on a band for then you aren't a true music fan.  this album is very well written.  The songs are impressive and laid out well.  This album has a  lot of 80's influence and i personally don't really care for most 80's music but it works and works well here.  Miss Murder, Summer Shudder, Love Like Winter are just some examples of straight up great songwriting.  I am very much impressed with this release and I am now anxious to see what the future holds for these guys.
B000002GFC|5.0|I can listen to these guys over and over again in my car and never get bored. Great lyrics, awesome riffs, Cream is definitely tasty.
0140284087|5.0|Carry On, Jeeves is another classic from P.G. Wodehouse.  It follows in the same kind of humorous hiliarious vein of his other books that involve Berty Wooster and his Man Servant Jeeves.  This is a book that should not be missed.  In fact, <br />all of P.G. Wodehouse's books involving Jeeves and Berty Wooster <br />should be thoroughly enjoyed by every one.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Awesome movie. Nolan is a genius. Mind-boggling thriller that changes your reaction since it's told in reverse.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is one of the most charming films I've seen in a long time.  Sometimes one wants to see a movie that makes you smile when it's over.  This is that movie.  The extras on the DVD have added to my pleasure.  Seeing the scenes that were edited out was a lot of fun.  Too bad the film couldn't be issued as a three and one half hour dirctor's cut. <br /> <br />
B00000DHZJ|5.0|I never get sick of listening to this cd, and that should tell you something. \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" and \\"Crosstown Traffic\\" are my personal favorites. Everyone should be forced to listen to Hendrix at least once in their lifetime.
B000FMGTTE|5.0|WOW!  Goosebumps-giving Superman theme!  Breath-taking-away love theme!  John Williams' themes come back to life!!!  Filled out with new Superman music from John Ottman - evoking sounds similar to scores from \\"Gladiator\\", \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and even some child-like wonder similar to \\"Polar Express\\" (just a bit!).  Lots of guts and heart in this score.    You can't really mess up Williams' Superman March, and Ottman scores it faithfully yet with new, exhilerating zest here. But I was wondering if the love theme (Can You Read My Mind) would translate well in the year 2006, 25 years later... Well, Ottman has done it, and done it well. He plays it exactly as Williams did, and then pushes and pulls it at other times with different chords to take your breath away.    Director Brian Singer and composer John Ottman have created this score to \\"SUPERMAN RETURNS\\" JUST RIGHT - something old (with new vibrance) and something new. They've included lots of action music with big orchestra hits, darker sinister themes for the villians, and noble, soul-injected themes that just soar and sing.  Even the current/popular style of choral underscore seems OK and appropriate here.  And before you get lost in the new music, here comes a bit of Williams' Krypton theme, or Leaving Home theme.... YES!!!    From a Superman fan who was a boy in the 1970s-80s - and now a new fan of this new version: GREAT MUSIC!!!!! Superman has DEFINITELY returned!!!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie is definitely one of my all-time favorites! I'll mention that I hadn't read the book before I watched the movie, but I knew about it since it is a frequently discussed classic. I'm in the middle of reading the book now, and I love it just as much as the movie. I think Wright did a wonderful job with the layout of different scenes and the original shots were excellent. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy (don't know the actor's  name) had perfect chemistry! Besides the obvious romance, watching the whole Bennet family in action was so entertaining and eye-opening to the common characteristics found in every family. You have to see this one!
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Emmylou Harris and Mark Knopfler are great together. Their voices are a perfect combination, both with voices that are a bit rough around the edges and full of honest emotion. Knopfler's guitar playing is also great but I wish the album gave him more chances to show it. Don't expect any early Dire Straits type guitar solos. I guess that's the backside of the coin of their being so perfect together - neither is given the chance to ever step up front and outshine the other.     The album sounds pretty much like you'd expect from Harris. It has beautiful songs, beautifully produced. The album may not be very engaging or musically innovative, but it certainly is beautiful.
0375405380|4.0|\\"The Power of the Dog\\" inspects three generations of Mexican drug lords and the psychology of those who oppose them. It's a book both about hopelessness and doing what you feel is right, regardless of the outcome. However, there's not much preaching -- written in a sparse style with excellent ending impact to each scene, it's a speeding trip through hell that reveals the corrupting force of politics, money, drugs, weapons and sex. The author has clearly done his research including the behind the scenes knowledge that never quite makes it into mainstream publications, and from it has spun a suspenseful and compelling yarn.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This is a CD that really grew on me- even at first tho I thought it was great, imagine DangerMouse and Cee-Lo and you don't really know what to expect. Cee-lo sings beautifully, but alas, doesn't really rap at all- which is what most people will know him from. The production is great once again, thanks to DangerMouse!
B00005JOQS|5.0|Nearly 30 years ago we saw the rebirth of the 1938 character on screen, we had seen the black & white to color TV reruns, but until unknown Christopher Reeve flew to John Williams' music embodiment of the Superman, we believed that \\"a man could fly\\" like the tagline offered, and the film still holds up pretty well. But this \\"Return\\" after 1987's fourth and weakess offering is styled to continue the movie continuity (more post Superman II, than IV) with the original nearly invulnerable character with the same two weaknesses we all know and love: Kryptonite, of course, and those pesky human bonds, i.e. the people around him who can be used by his enemies as leverage, the very reason for his lame CK alter ego. Both of these weaknesses are exploited again and again in the films, this one too. These weaknesses are exploited by nemesis Lex Luthor, played in the spirit of Hackman's incarnation of the character here by the brilliant Kevin Spacey. This time his plan isn't any more original, just visually inspired, he plans to use Superman's Kryptonian tech to create \\"New Krypton\\" on Earth, with a Kryptonite twist. Luthor's philosophy is articulately outlined by an early scene with his latest groupie Kitty Kowaiski (Parker Posey) in which LL is asks if he considers himself a god, and he sees himself as Prometheus stealing fire from the gods to \\"share it\\" with mankind. I thought that this was a truly original view of Luthor's motivation for his hatred of Superman, not the old he's good and I'm bad, setup, but a genuine distain for this alien who's holding out on the human race.<br /><br />There was preproduction talk, about the same time the DaVinci Code was being scrutinized, about the messiah angle of SUPERMAN RETURNS; Jor-El sends his only son to Earth to lead through example, he returns to the heavens (search the remains of Krypton),  his \\"second coming\\" back to Earth and towards the climax of the film he takes a \\"Passion\\"-like beating from Luthor's thugs looking on like Roman centurians. The original character concept has always been at least a demi-god, coming to terms with his human-half like Hercules, super-strong, part-god, part-man, his greatest weakness his hubris. Jewish immigrants themselves, the original creative team, before \\"Supes\\" did more than leap over tall buildings, probably saw him as the ultimate immigration success story, not for themselves they got little over 100  bucks and a 10 yr contract for the character, but Superman was embraced by the fictitious world the same as the real world. Director Bryan Singer explores the emotional impact of a world that has moved on without Superman, a concept probably more effectively done in the various Superman comic series over the years (he has left Earth for self imposed exiles on multiple occasions, not to mention his death in 1992). The film deals with the impact on those around both Clark Kent and Superman. Lois has had a kid (who was born shortly after Superman leaves Earth, hmm...),  gotten an X-man fianc&eacute; and written a Pulitzer winning story \\"Why the World Doesn't Needs Superman.\\" Sure there's loads of character exploration, that's what Singer excels at ( see Usual Suspects and X Men 1 &2), but there's also more action than you'll see anywhere else this summer, even without Richard Donner. The story could be better considering all the writers who didn't make the cut in the end (Kevin Smith, J.J. Abrams for starters). I wish they had broken away from the familiar, maybe dare I say it \\"left out Lex,\\" maybe even used the \\"Death of Superman\\" storyline, including Doomsday and the \\"Reign of the Supermen.\\"  WB's Smallville has proved that the character can be successful without being constrained to canon.  But this familiarity is surely a strength that makes the film feel like a long-over-due sequel. It's got the same, only darker, sense of humor as the originals. There's also an amusing anti-smoking gag that runs through the film (for example, a catatrophic sequenceof events started by a cabbie's stogie, and Lois is hounded to quit by multiple parties).<br /><br />The art direction was bold, but while the suit pays homage to decades of design, it is careful not to stray to far (although the retro-reverse shield on the belt is a cool touch). Metropolis, is finally a real city now, not just a recycled New York, the Daily Planet looks great, and you just know that globe on top is gonna see some action from the opening. But as for FX, there are some milestones here, some crazy-good super-saves, I mean a bullet to the super-eye, awesome, New Krypton awesome, I wasn't sure they could top \\"Matrix\\" flight, or even \\"Smallville\\" limited airborne moments, but never has the rescue of a crashing plane  been handled with better style, believable physics and sheer coolness!<br /><br />With Singer as big a fan as he is of the original films he should have tried get John Williams to handle the whole score instead of his X-staple John Ottman. But Ottman uses enough of Williams' Superman motiffs and themes to satisfy.  And it's plenty better than the X3 music, yuck.<br /><br />On casting, the movies gotten loads of grief, partly because the part has turned over so much, but I agree with the need for a relative unknown, so you aren't distracted by a celebrity. Brandon Routh, fits the bill, he looks and sounds like Reeve, which was more the plan than getting Superman, I think. Spacey is so good in everything that he does his celebrity transcends any part he plays, Kate gives a lot of heart to the Lois character as does the great Frank Lanella playing editor Perry White. Using Brando footage as Jor-El is inspired as is the casting of Eva Marie Saint as Martha Kent. Sam Huntington plays Superman's pal Jimmy Olsen well-enough (although the guy is almost never out shooting pics), while Superman's revial for Lois' affections are played believably by James Marsden as Richard White, who at one point in a \\"discussion\\" with Lois throws her previous story title \\"The Night I Spent With Superman\\" in her face. There's a nice love triangle, but it's not the traditional Clark/Lois/Superman. There's little chemistry between Brandon as Clark and Kate as Lois, but once she overcomes her abandonment issues with Superman he becomes a player in a triangle with Lois and Richard. But, he comes to terms with his role in their lives when he asks his competition during a rescue if \\"he's got them.\\" By the end we realize, as does Clark, that the world still needs a savior and a Superman.

B000F8O35U|5.0|First we got Beauty and the Beast, then The Lion King, then Aladdin. Now, we get the fourth film of the \\"Big 4\\" that put Disney animation back on the map in the late 80s, early 90s getting the attention and treatment it deserves. <br /> <br />No one does animation quite like Disney, nor does anyone do two-disc DVD treatment like Disney. Following in its footsteps of the aforementioned predecessors (along with other Platinum editions Snow White, Bambi, Cinderella, and Lady and the Tramp), The Little Mermaid Platinum edition will help do justice to a magical tale for all ages, complete with behind the scenes bonus features. <br /> <br />This will be one to own, and pass down to children of future generations.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0156027321|5.0|Yann Martel has written a fantastic story with 2 intriquing and convincing main characters--a sixteen year old boy nicknamed Pi and the capricious yet somehow lovable Richard Parker. <br /> <br />Pi is a resouceful, spiritual, and strong willed teenager who must endure a journey which begins in part II with a shipwreck. His voyage on a lifeboat leaves him with a desperate and unique dilemma while having to endure heartbreak, constant threat to his life,  fear, lack of food and water. The latter part of the book is bizzare, and even grotesque especially when he thinks he has been \\"rescued\\" in a very unusual and enchanting way. <br /> <br />This may or may not be a true story. I believe that it's possible.  But the reader must decide for him/herself and, for me, I believe in the story which the book is built on.   <br /> <br />I love Martel's writing style.  It's very straight forward and concise.  I think he is a great writer.  I wish this book would go on and on. It will live forever in my heart and my mind.   I know that I will return to it often and I can't wait for another book from him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I think the best thing to come from the Renaissance of Superhero films is to be less tongue-in-cheek with the characters and show them just how extreme a real-life personality has to be to want to live the life.  We've seen it in \\"Daredevil\\" and we've seen it in the \\"Blade\\" series.  We've seen people who'd rather be \\"Normal\\" forced into the life through mere genetics in the \\"X-Men\\" films and we've seen a guy become a hero out of never-ending guilt in \\"Spider-Man.\\"  Now, we see the fully-developed psychological reasons why Bruce Wayne, a man who has all the privileges of being white, rich, and gifted, would choose to live what amounts to a freak's life. <br /> <br />Nolan and Goyer took what Tim Burton did in \\"Batman\\" and did it one better.  Rather than giving us an artistically \\"dark\\" vision as to who the character is and what makes him tick, they decided to give us a plausibly \\"real-world\\" look into what a Gotham City would be like, right down to the gritty corruption that consumes it.  We also get to see just how long it took for Bruce Wayne to become \\"Batman,\\" right down to where he almost takes the other road and blow away the man who murdered his parents. <br /> <br />Christian Bale - not my first choice to play Wayne, but one can't have a really big name wear the suit.  It's been proven - if a \\"superstar\\" wears the suit, then we don't see the character.  (Unless, the actor is tailor made for the role, a la Patrick Stewart's Professor Xavier, or someone transcends expectations, like Michael Keaton did in the first \\"Batman\\")  He delivered a dark, fatalistic Batman, as well as a flighty-but-never-fey millionaire playboy \\"Bruce Wayne.\\"  You get the feeling with Bale that the real Bruce Wayne DID die those long years ago along with his parents.  I got a sense of doom from him the moment he decided to become Batman, and that is the core of the character - the REAL \\"person\\" is Batman.  \\"Bruce Wayne\\" has become a mask.  As it should be. <br /> <br />All told, this wasthe Batman that had to be, apart from the first Dini animated series.  Thank God for the Goyers and Nolans of this world.  They both did this character, and the character's long, storied, history, the justice it deserved.
B000FGGE68|3.0|i never watched a movie so stupid like UV :S<br /><br />this had a few special effects, but it also had some horrible special effects, so let me tell you if you're a fan of good special effecs dont watch it!!<br /><br />see ya ;)
630512762X|4.0|I watched the last third of \\"Face/Off\\" a few years ago while changing channels on TV.  I thought that what I saw was ridiculous and was glad I hadn't tried to watch the whole movie.  I saw some praise for it later and started to doubt the credibility of the source. However, I thought I would see what I thought about it by watching it from the beginning.  It certainly made a big difference. <br /> <br />This movie was a lot more complicated that I had originally understood.  The pace is fast-moving but the director makes sure that we see and hear enough to know enough about how we arrive at a technological twist to be able to buy into it.  The bad guy is bad and the good guy is good and the stakes are high.  It's hard to catch your breath in this movie (although I benefitted from commercial breaks).  There are twists and turns that keep you on your toes and the role-changing that takes place is ripe with many interesting possibilities.  The basic premise is that a top cop had a criminal's face grafted to his in order to go underground to prevent a major disaster.  Unforseen events keep popping up and then the movie got to the place that I had joined it several years ago.  I could see why I was unimpressed by having missed the story up to that point.  The fast pace continues to the very end. <br /> <br />This is a good action movie but it suffers from the indistructibility of the main characters.  These two guys get shot at so much, often at close range with machine guns, that you want to scream (or at least I did).  Consider the action in such movies as \\"High Noon\\" or the original \\"Cape Fear\\" where a minimum of shots are fired (if at all) yet we are rivetted to the screen from the suspenseful excitement.  I don't know how many score of bullets missed the mark of the Travolta and Cage characters but the shooting was clearly over done.  The closing scenes were the worst examples and probably caused most of my initial negative reactions.  Seeing it from the beginning added more such excessive scenes but it also weaved together a plot that was worth following.
B000EGCITG|4.0|OK, the first PINK CD was awesome but this one is a close second.  Listen to it a few times. It's got a full range of what her voice can do and how easily she fits into so many music styles.
B000E8QVWY|3.0|The makers of \\"Walk the Line\\" obviously had to walk a thin, shaky tightrope when creating this movie.  There's pretty much a requirement to target the 18-35 year-old audience, and most people in that age group simply don't know enough about Johnny Cash and June Carter to appreciate their vast cultural significance and absolute authenticity.  But, since Cash was one of those rare artists who can truly be called larger than life (and death), he found admirers in that age bracket in the last decade or so of his life.  Still, that cult following isn't enough to fill movie theatre seats, so \\"Walk the Line\\"'s creators were called upon to make some compromises while striving to evoke Cash's iconic integrity.   <br /> <br />The result is a solid, enjoyable, and moving film that follows a familiar formula in celebrity biographies: big, pivotal scenes that show the protagonist's tough road to success, with less attention to the complex interaction of the individual artist with her or his culture. <br /> <br />Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix are, no surprise, much better looking and more glamorous, and far less earthy, than the people they are playing, but that doesn't bother me--it's Hollywood when all's said and done, and I'd rather see actors interpret their roles than to try imitating the inimitable.  Having said that, I'll stick with the general reaction and say that Witherspoon is more impressive than Phoenix because she is so much more natural and comfortable inside her character.  I respect Phoenix for doing his own playing and singing, but since I did see Johnny Cash in concert once (and hundreds of times on TV), I couldn't ever fully accept him as the Man in Black.  At the same time, I can't think of anyone who could have done better.  Playing God in a film would be easier than playing Johnny Cash! <br /> <br />The film is well-photographed, and the production design captures the various eras well, even if the film exhibits the sort of slickness and polish thattoday's moviegoers demand.  There is respect for Johnny Cash, along with an honest depiction of him as a deeply flawed, difficult man.  Supporting performances are strong overall, with the actor playing Cash's grudge-holding father doing well with a pretty one-dimensional role.  Most of all, there's the music, supervised by the great T-Bone Burnett.   <br /> <br />\\"Walk the Line\\" is a good, not great movie, but it will undoubtedly bring more believers to the shrine of the Man in Black, one of the most important musicians and songwriters of the second half of the 20th century.
B000001ESN|5.0|This is not so much a review as it is a comentary because I have nothing to add on to the numerous reviews of this album by others only to say I categorize this as my second favorite album from RUSH next to Moving Pictures.  NOW ... on to the other thing I want to get off my chest.  I notice alot of fans and reviewers alike say they prefer a certain album over Moving Pictures for the only fact that Moving Pictures is most popular to RUSH fans as their favorite...  now I think that is a stupid reason, you should only look at the piece of music and nothing outside of that when rating, reviewing or loving a certain album/song, whatever... and by doing that the conclusion is Moving Pictures is absolutely a perfect recording/album and RUSH's best by a grain of sand at most.  ON that note I say, A Farewell to Reviews.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I always enjoyed listening to his songs and watching him on Tv when I was younger.I have many of Johnny cash songs,and this album is great to add to any music collection.The reason why I think that this is a must for Johnny Cash fans is because it is Live.Being that it is live ,It makes you feel like you were there at one of his concerts.If you do like this buy also Johnny Cash Live At San Quentin
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of all time.  If you're new to the Flaming Lips, you're going to read a lot of fan reviews telling you to buy some of the \\"older stuff\\", but this album is really the Lips first masterpiece.  A lot of their older stuff is pretty experimental and, frankly, difficult to listen to.  Every band has to have a small group of older fans that get bitter at some point because their favorite band suddenly becomes successful and everyone starts to take notice.  The Lips have been working very hard at what they do since the 1980's.  I'm glad they're on a major label with lots of tour and promotion support because their music should be heard around the world.  It's great stuff, and I hope they continue to win over new fans.
B000E6ESL2|4.0|This movie seems to follow in the footsteps of other recent films that are shot in a non-linear fashion; a method that serves to gradually disorient the viewer. (i.e. Momento, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, etc.)  The effect is probably intentional, and so if you don't like being disoriented, you will not like this movie.  But if you can roll with it and be open minded, it's an interesting ride inside an unsettling world. Most movies take viewers to a definitive, predrawn conclusion -- whereas this one creates as many questions as it answers. So in an age of dumbed down plots, it's refreshing to watch a visually masterful, mind bending film that leaves the interpretation up for grabs. If you like movies like Donnie Darko, you will like this flick. I give credit to the director for taking a risk.
B00000DLUV|3.0|Very good. I enjoy and it arrived speedy and in goon shapr
B000ETQRCM|4.0|best Pearl Jam album in years? ehh, maybe. Best since 'Yield' anyway (gee I guess that has been 8 years) Main difference is a return to straight-forward rocking and a more confident sound... however I still believe Vedder ran out of things to say lyrically a while ago, and the constant Bush-bashing is a bit much. However most of the CD 'sounds good to the ear', if not great in places. Enjoy it for a few listens then move on... Also Vedder's montone voice makes the songs kinda blend together (in a bad way). My suggestion: Vedder join Chris Cornell & co. in Audioslave for a super super-group. This CD would give Pearl Jam a solid farewell CD.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|Stumbling throught the thousands of reviews here, I saw two kinds: The ones who loved it, and the ones who hate it. <br /> <br />I was given Firefly on DVD as a birthday present, and instantly became a large fan of it. All of the haters of it say that it's \\"not smart\\" and \\"doesn't make you think\\" \\"you don't care about the characters.\\" First of all, no it's not GENIUS, but it has some pretty smart jokes and humor. And why WOULD it make you think? It's American telivision! The only show I can think of where you have to think is Lost, which is genius in it's own! <br /> <br />And another thing.... yes you do care about the characters very much. They are a very diverse cast with great personalities. If you loved this show, you'll love the movie Serenity even more. <br /> <br />So I'm telling you, get it. You may not like it. It's nothing spectacular but it's not crap either. It's a smart-ish, funny, and just overall fun show.

B000HBK3MM|4.0|This album was such a beautiful surprise to me!! When I first heard about this young lady, I saw her on VH1 soul and she was explaining that she was coming out with a new album..I heard the single \\"Put Your Records On\\" and thought it was alright..It was a catchy single but nothing that really held my attention..So a few days later, I just decided to download the songs on the album, granted, I hadnt even listened to the samples provided here..I was basically taking a chance..Needless to say, Im so glad I did.. <br /> <br />I play this cd every single day!!! Her voice is soft and sensual and invokes so much emotion and she doesnt have to belt out anything to do it..Of course the whole album is good, but I do have my favorites: <br /> <br />1) Like a star: This is one of the greatest album openings I have ever heard..It just opens the album up so nicely and introduces you to this shining star! <br /> <br />2)Enchantment: This has to be my favorite song from the album..It is something so sexy about this song and it kinda has the feel of Zero 7..Its like I can hear Sia Furler sing on this song..Its constantly on repeat..You dont realize that you've been enchanted by the song until its over! <br /> <br />3)Till it happens to you: This song has an old classic feeling to me for some reason..Very sensual and cool..Has a jazzy feeling to it! <br /> <br />4)Call me when you get this: This is another one of my favorite songs..I love the guitars and overally melody to this song..I think it has such a summer feeling, something you cruise to on a warm summer night! <br /> <br />So there goes my review..I really havent gotten past song number 6 because I enjoy the songs I've reviewed so much so Im still stuck on the first half of the album..But once I get to the rest of them, I'll let you know what I think..But trust me, the album is beautiful and I cant wait to see what she comes out with next!!
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I originally saw an advertisement for this soothing songstress on VH1's latest \\"You Oughtta Know\\" segment to promote up n' coming artists. I love mellow, carefree music, and her style perfectly represents that. When I bought the album and listened to its tracks, she quickly became one of my favorite artists. <br /> <br />This album is perfect for those who listen to Adult Alternative and R&B, as Rae is a beautiful blend of the two genres. Like the flowery album cover indicates, Rae created relaxing and carefree songs perfect for a sunny afternoon. Especially the song \\"Put your records on\\". <br /> <br />She sounds like a mix between Macy Gray and Amel Larrieux, to put it simply. Rae has a slightly raspy voice like Macy Gray, with the gentle, angelic sound of Amel Larrieux.  <br /> <br />Recommended tracks (my faves): Put Your Records On, Breathless, Trouble Sleeping, Enchantment, and Choux Pastry Heart. <br /> <br />The reason I gave 4 stars: The flaw I see is that, relative to other musicians, I don't think she can sing that well. In my opinion, her raspy, somewhat off-key voice gets annoying on several tracks. I often think, \\"Well, she wouldn't get past a panel of professional musicians in a competition. If she did pass, she wouldn't get advance very far in it.\\" Still, in a big way, it's her voice that makes Rae unique from other artists.  <br /> <br />I love the album!
B00005JNRY|4.0|I always find the Disney Pixar films to be a treat. And Cars is no different. The animation is incredible, with canyon landscapes, waterfalls, and highways. And with a great soundtrack, the music montages throughout the film are impeccable. <br />The voices are great. All too often, the names of the cast of these animated movies are much bigger than the actual voice talents. But it's great to hear the voices of Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt, and Larry the Cable Guy (who is hilarious by the way) playing around on screen. <br />And don't forget about the minor characters. It's great seeing stereotype cars such as the hippie van, the army jeep, the sexy Porsche, the old carriage, the German Volkswagen beetle, and many others. Though funny, it's refreshing to see that they didn't center the plot around a silly gag such as stereotyping cars, the way it was advertised. <br />The plot is very simple, a big shot race car learns his lesson by making friends while stuck in a remote town in the middle of nowhere. It's simple, but affective. <br />The only complaint I have with the film is its length. At 2 hours, it certainly seemed to drag. However, all in all, other than nitpicks, it was a heartwarming film.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|In 2002, Paramount Pictures decided to try their hand at redeeming themselves in the eyes of `Trekkies' after the somewhat dismal performance of their previous endeavor \\"Star Trek:  Insurrection\\".  Though I personally enjoyed `Insurrection', many hardcore fans despised the movie, citing it as being too romantic and humorous and way too light on the action.  So, with that response to their previous installment, Paramount wanted to make the next movie be much darker, more action-packed, and featuring an even more intense storyline than previous films.  For the previous two films, Paramount was happy with actor Jonathan Frakes filling the role of director as well, especially with his extremely entertaining and successful effort with \\"Star Trek:  First Contact\\", but with the somewhat lesser performance of \\"Star Trek:  Insurrection\\", the executives at Paramount felt it would be safer to go with a fresh perspective to direct the newest film.  Enter renowned film editor Stuart Baird, whose talent for finding the perfect blend of action and drama has served him well throughout his career in film, and Paramount felt it was time to give this long-time editor the chance to put his skills directly behind the camera.  Would this choice prove to be a wise one, or merely another nail in the coffin for this slowly dwindling franchise, only time would tell. <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek:  Nemesis\\" begins on a joyous note, with the wedding of Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis).  On this wonderful day even more good news arrives when Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) receives word that the Romulans want peace, and that the crew of the Enterprise-E are to be the emissaries of the Federation.  Just as the Enterprise makes its way towards the Romulan Empire, a brilliant villain named Shinzon awaits them, harboring an evil plan of destruction for the Federation, and a dark secret linking him and Picard. <br /> <br />Prior to the release of this 10th film in thelong-running `Star Trek' movie franchise, I felt that \\"Star Trek:  First Contact\\" was probably the best `Star Trek' movie made; however, after viewing \\"Star Trek:  Nemesis\\", I believe a new best of `Trek' movie has been named.  The hardcore fans of the franchise, or `Trekkies' as they prefer to be called, who were less than thrilled with `Insurrection', were without a doubt unbelievably impressed with `Nemesis'.  Even though \\"Star Trek:  Nemesis\\" was by far one of the best `Star Trek' films ever made, it sadly didn't do too well at the box office.  This was caused by the poor reception to \\"Star Trek:  Insurrection\\" and that the current TV series \\"Star Trek:  Enterprise\\" was receiving poor ratings, so support for the franchise was at an all-time low.  I also believe a big problem the `Star Trek' franchise faced, and the result was evident for this movie, was that the market had been oversaturated with the series, because pretty much for the last 20 to 30 years there has always been some form of `Star Trek' that could be seen either on TV or in theaters.  Perhaps, if more time had gone by between the release of `Insurrection' and the release of `Nemesis', the latter would have fared better at the box office, but now we'll never know for sure. <br /> <br />The acting, as always in these movies, was top-notch due to the cast being so familiar with their characters that they all are second nature to them.  The director, Stuart Baird, a newcomer to the `Star Trek' franchise, did an excellent job helming this film, and delivered a high-octane thrill ride that delivered on so many levels.  All of the special effects in the movie were outstanding, and by far the best in the entire series, which added to the overall greatness of this movie.  Without a doubt, this movie should have done much better at the box office, and it's a shame it didn't because it truly is the best in the series, and is one `Star Trek' film that should not be missed! <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek:  Nemesis\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief sensuality.
B0000669JL|4.0|I loved this cd; a wonderous mix of freedom, love and spirit.  I was pleasantly surprised when I turn this on and noticed immediately the range of people and ages who start bopping around and singing along, from my almost 2 year old granddaughter to my 54 year old husband; Marley's music knows no boundaries.  A must-have for anyone's collection, no matter what genre of music they tend to appreciate otherwise.  Marley is a genius we lost way too soon.  This cd never gets too far away from my reach.
B00005JNRY|4.0|Cars is a genuinely entertaining movie with some good laughs and a good message, even if you're like me and not into NASCAR. My wife and I took the kids and enjoyed it as much as they did. Be sure to stick around for the spoofs on the other Pixar films during the credits.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Back when I was 13 or so, I had the Mellon Collie and the infinite sadness.  A double album of pure awesomeness.  As I got older my tastes changed, but as I wised up in my early 20s I reverted back to \\"great\\" music as opposed to some of the garbage I was listening too.  First band I went back to was SPs.  I immediatly picked up all of their albums.   <br /> <br />Siamese Dream is absolutely stunning.  I can't say enough really.  There isn't really any song on this album that is \\"filler\\" or \\"okay\\".  My favorite by far is \\"Mayonnaise\\".  A truly inspirational song that gives me chills every time.  Recently I found an acoustic version of this and it's amazing.   <br /> <br />The thing is, this is the type of awesome music you can expect from EVERY SP album, with the exception of Machina.  Each one is a masterpiece in of itself.  This of course if my favorite, followed closely by Mellon Collie and the infinite sadness (a lot of even harder and SOFTER songs on this one, brilliant), adore, gish, Pisces Iscariot.   <br /> <br />I consider my taste in music to be pretty high standard.  In the 90s I was listening to Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Pearl Jam etc.  I can tell you, that these bands have not come any close to the pure quality of the Smashing Pumpkins.  No contest.  Smashing Pumpkins is one of the most underrated bands ever. <br /> <br />Corgan seems to pour out his heart and soul into every lyric in every song.  That along with the intense unique drums of Chamberlain makes Smashing Pumpkins one of the greatest bands of my generation if not the greatest.
B00012QM8G|4.0|This movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler during World War II. The movie starts out with him starting a company to build pots and pans for the army. With the help of a Jewish production manager, he creates a highly successful company that relies on the work of Jews in a Nazi ghetto in Krakow, Poland. He follows the Jews to a work camp, a concentration camp, and finally another work camp that makes bullets.  He makes a list with is production manager Itzhak Stern of people he \\"needs\\" for his factory. In reality he just wanted to help them live. <br /> <br /> There were many real people in this movie. The most important of these people is Oskar Schindler. He was treated with very good historical accuracy. One example of this is when he began worrying about the Jewish cause, after hiding Jews were killed. In the movie, the same thing occurs. He also saved the Jews who were mis-transported to Auschwitz instead of his factory. He does the same thing in the movie. However, he did not write the list as portrayed in the movie. Itzak Stern did. Another real character in this movie was Schindler's account, Itzhak Stern. He is also treated with remarkable historical accuracy. For example he ran the factory with essentially no input from Schindler in the movie and in real life and he saved the life of intellectuals in both. Some real events that occurred in the movie is the razing of the Krakow Ghetto and building Plaszow.  <br /> <br /> The movie was set from 1939 to 1945. The city of Krakow, Poland was used. This setting was very realistic. The ghetto looked like a slum and the inhabitants despised the Jews. Another setting used was Plaszow. The set looked small compared to what the camp actually looked like. However, the buildings looked similar. Auschwitz looked like all the pictures I found, including the large chimney. The time span covered was 6 years. The furnishings were bare, as espected in a concentration camp. The clothes and hairstyles were also right. One propI thought was used remarkably well was the railroad cars. The cars were crowded, dirty, and hot/cold (depending on the weather). Another prop used well was the factory. The methods used in the factory are old fashioned and not the most efficient way of doing things. <br /> <br /> I think Liam Nelson and Ben Kingsley did a great job. They both were very realistic. The actor who played the Nazi commander, Ralph Fiennes, overacted a little. The plot moved very slow.  The Nazi violence was shown again and again. This really happened, but does not get the viewer sadder as time goes on, but mad at the Nazis. The Jews in this movie are stereotypical. Almost all of the ones displayed are Hasidic and shrewd businessman. Although the second half of this statement is true in many cases, most Jews are not both. The viewer is interested
B0007XT87G|5.0|I was in high school when Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, Yes, etc. were in their prime (I'm just over 50). This group ranks right up there as musicians and with their vision of what a complete \\"album\\" should be like. It took a couple listens to fully enjoy this epic CD. Now I can't get it out of my CD player. PT gives hope for new rock music, they are superb! Check out their album \\"In Absentia\\" it's just as good, slightly less \\"hard\\". Someone told me that Classic Rock magazine named Deadwing the best new CD in 2005. Not sure if that's true, but they get my vote! Play the song - Arriving Somewhere But Not Here - a few times - Loud! You'll get hooked!
6305308659|5.0|from first hearing about the movie, pleasentville may sound a bit odd but if you take the time to watch, you will find it is a very good film. pleasentville tells of two 90's kids (tobey maguire in pre spiderman days and reese witherspoon before her breakout in legally blonde) who are given a remote by, don knots. they are then transported to the world of pleasentville which is like a replica of the 50's era were everything is black and white and things are 'pleasent'. now, they must deal with life in pleasentville before they can go home. the film is kind of a split movie, the first hour or so being a comedy and the second hour being a drama. this may rub people the wrong way when a film switches dynamics but in pleasentville, it works. the film also sports some great cinamatography as pleasentville slowly turns from black and white to full blown color. a really touching film that also scewers 50's cliche's be sure to check out the film that is, well, pleasent.
B00005JOQS|5.0|I went to a special pre-release screening of Superman Returns that I thought was supposed to start at 9:30 and did not start until 10:30.  While watching the previews, I wondered why on earth I ever agreed to go see a movie at this hour on a work night.  As soon as the film started, with the stunning 3-D-like presentation of the credits, accompanied by that wonderfully irreplaceable theme music by John Williams, all doubts were gone. <br /> <br />And in this theme music is the key to the wonder of Superman Returns.  It is set up as a sequel to the original films, and yet it recycles many elements of the original, and so it manages the seemingly impossible task of being a sequel and a remake at the same time.  Watching the film was like a wonderful trip back in time to 1978.  Everything was different and yet everything was the same.  <br /> <br />Once again, Lex Luthor has a plan for taking over the world that involves land, and this plan is even more diabolical and life-threatening than the first one ever thought of being.  There is delicious irony in how Luthor ends up in this film, given his original plans.  And it just wouldn't be Superman without a replay of the magical scene where Superman takes Lois Lane on a flying trip.  The musical score plays a prank on the viewer at this point, and I can only say \\"be patient.\\" <br /> <br />The film is dedicated to Christopher and Dana Reeve.  Perhaps the greatest tribute to Christopher Reeve imaginable is Brandon Routh's performance as Clark Kent/Superman.  In some of Routh's scenes, particularly as Clark Kent, he is the spitting image of Christopher Reeve.  I don't think I realized how much I identified Reeve with Superman until I saw Routh in the same role.  There is also some resemblance between James Marsden, who plays Richard White, Lois Lane's new love interest, and Routh and Reeve, giving the impression that if Lois couldn't be with Superman, then the only substitute she would accept would be one with similar features.  Another connection to the original film is the use of archive footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's father. <br /> <br />Director Bryan Singer doesn't try to extend the illusion by bringing in lookalikes for the roles of Lois Lane and Lex Luthor.  Kate Bosworth and a bald Kevin Spacey acquit themselves well in these parts, without completely erasing memories of Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman, which would be a pretty big order for just about anyone. <br /> <br />One major difference between this film and the original is that Lex Luthor's henchmen are considerably more threatening than was buffoon Ned Beatty in the original.  David Fabrizio as head henchman Brutus nevertheless shows a sympathetic side when he accompanies Lois' son Jason in a piece on the piano during the scene where son and mother are held hostage.  (Tristan Lake Leabu as son Jason White shows himself in his limited screen time to be a good little actor, particularly in the scene where we discover that he may not be quite who we think he is.)  And if I have a preference for Valerie Perrine over Parker Posey as Lex Luthor's girlfriends in the two films, it is mostly because Perrine made the effort to help Superman out of the Krypton-related jam he had gotten into in the earlier film, while Posey, whose life Superman has previously saved, watches helplessly as Superman is overcome by the deadly Krypton. <br /> <br />The special effects are stunning and very much an integral part of the story.  They are never there just to draw attention to themselves. <br /> <br />I always enjoyed the original film, and saw it several times.  I don't think I every truly realized how much I loved the original until seeing Bryan Singer's loving and respectful take on it.  I imagine that younger folks who never saw the original will still enjoy the remake.  And the film's real gift is to those of us who did indeed see and love the original.  For us, it's a must-see.
006092988X|3.0|This novel is the detailed account of young Francie Nolan's life from birth to about age 17. While the story is quite poignant at times, the amount of detail is really just too much. I felt like Smith gave a breakdown of every meal and purchase made from 1901 to 1918! Yikes! While these descriptions did give the reader a sense of the desperation, hunger, humiliations, etc. that the characters faced on a daily basis, I felt that it detracted from the story after a while as I grew accustomed (and perhaps calloused) to their misfortunes. The characters were very well developed, particularly Francie, Johnny (her pathetic ne'er-do-well of a father), and Katie (the hardworking and often under-appreciated mother). Smith did an excellent job of presenting them as multi-faceted people, full of inconsistencies and indulgences, without passing judgment on them. The relationships between the characters were also touching and true, the emotions real and understandable. Smith gives poverty a true sense of dignity. For this, she is to be commended. Keeping in mind also when this book was written, Smith blazed some new trails for the frank discussion of women's sexual identities and labor inequities. By today's standards, these things may not seem significant, but Smith undoubtedly was ahead of her time and helped clear the way for women writers to follow. So, while this book is not one of my favorites, it is worthy of a read, more for historical relevance than pleasure, at least for me.
0385338694|4.0|The heroine of Sophie Kinsella's newest novel is definitely a throwback to the shopaholic who made her famous, Becky Bloomwood.  The difference is that this new heroine, Samantha Sweeting (Kinsella loves alliteration it would seem), is a lawyer who is addicted to the long hours, stressful situations, and constant struggles to come out on top that comprise the life of an associate up for partner.<br /><br />For about the first 100 pages I felt like I was reading one of the Shopaholic books, and was disappointed to say the least.  It was like Kinsella was trying to pull the wool over my eyes and just pretend that she was going down another avenue when in fact _____aholics were all she had in her.<br /><br />Not true, and this book takes a turn if you'll wait for it that blows Becky Bloomwood out of the water.  Stephanie Sweeting takes responsibility for her actions and doesn't play the victim. Stephanie Sweeting has a sense of control in a world full of chaos and when she realizes that her high powered job is making a mess of her, she does something about it.  Stephanie Sweeting is NOT Becky Bloomwood. And thank god for that.<br /><br />For those who enjoyed the Shopaholic series, this book has enough of those elements to please them; and for those new to Kinsella, this book is so much better than the other series. The love story is sweeter and more real (it's hard to imagine constantly dealing with a wife who orders ten different coffee tables and hides credit cards without being exasperated).  The heroine is someone you can look up to and find inspiration in rather than wishing she would just grow up and learn to take responsibility for her own actions.  And the moral is refreshing and honest--it's a shame that we need a reminder to take some time out for ourselves once in awhile, but Kinsella has thoughtfully incorporated that in the forefront of this escapist chick lit novel that actually has a pretty decent story to tell. It's excellent escapist fiction and a quick and amusing read.a quick and amusing read.
B00005JP01|1.0|F&F: Tokyo Drift is the story of a teenager (strikingly similar in resemblance to Eli Manning of the New York Football Giants) who can't keep his foot off the gas pedal and nose out of trouble. Rather than face the wrath of the American legal system, he is sent to Tokyo to live with his estranged father. <br /> <br />Of course, this leads to more trouble, destroyed vehicles, and a spectacular showdown to win a fair maiden's heart, as well as his freedom (and fortunately that of the audience, as the credits soon follow). <br /> <br />The plot is cheesy and downright absurd, not to mention suffering from stereotypes and cliches.  For instance, are we to believe that a Yakuza crime boss (need I go on?) is really interested in the goings-on of teenagers who wish to settle a score, so much so that he will banish the loser of the race? How about the lead character's father, who just happens to have a 1960s Ford Mustang lying around in the garage. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you'll be surprised with a guest cameo appearance near the end. <br /> <br />It is unfortunate that the target audience is young adults who will leave the theatre having learned that street racing is a \\"peaceful solution\\" (actual quote from the movie). If you stick around for the credits you can tell your friends that you witnessed a paradox. Yes, after watching the entire 100+ minutes of Tokyo Drift, a disclaimer tells you that street racing is dangerous, do not attempt, and so forth (in other words, forget the $10 dollars you just spent as well as the movie, and drive safe). <br /> <br />Aside from all the unpleasantness, however, we are treated to the message that within every American, there is a Japanese soul waiting to be unleashed (I am referring to the aforementioned Ford Mustang that was fitted with an Nissan RB26DETT motor to compete in the epic climax). An unlikely pair who manage to work together and defy the odds. Truly the stuff of legend.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|The tagline for this album is \\"Pain and Suffering in Various Tempos\\" and Depeche Mode delivers on this promise.  I recently saw them in concert and afterwards ordered this album.  Every song is awesome - some instantly hit you with their catchy beats and driving lyrics, some too spectacular to amaze you right away.   <br /> <br />1.  A Pain That I'm Used To 4/5 - Emergency!  The album opens warning you you're inside Space Mountain - never knowing where you're headed and what's coming up next - just go along for the thrilling ride! <br /> <br />2.  John the Revelator 5/5 - One of two songs that just hits you right away with how catchy and wonderful it is.  Such a great song to sing along to!  Dave sounds so powerful here! <br /> <br />3.  Suffer Well 5/5 - Probably the most beautiful song on the album - both musically and lyrically.  One easily relatable to. <br /> <br />4.  The Sinner In Me 3/5 - Nice song - probably the closest you would come to filler on this album, though. <br /> <br />5.  Precious 4/5 - Understandable pick for lead single - nice pop song. <br /> <br />6.  Macro 4/5 - I didn't really like this song at first, but it really caught on with me.  I really like singing along with this one. <br /> <br />7.  I Want It All 5/5 - This song is slow, poetic, emotional, and cooling. <br /> <br />8.  Nothing's Impossible 5/5 - Dave w/a vocoder enhanced voice.  Really adds to the light, effortless feel that continues from I Want It All. <br /> <br />9.  Introspectre 2/5 - Musical interlude - nothing overwhelming here. <br /> <br />10.  Damaged People 2/5 - Sounds like Depeche Mode if they were around in the 60's. <br /> <br />11.  Lilian 5/5 - The other song that hits you instantly - Catchy as all hell - good dance song! <br /> <br />12.  The Darkest Star 5/5 - Not something that instantly grabbed me, but after a few listens, suddenly pulled me in and under, immersed in the build up of intensity in this song - culminating in what becomes an almost epic of sorts- closing the album - ending the ride - leaving you dizzy and jarred - settled - but ready to go again!

B000BW7QWW|5.0|What can I say? Serenity is not your average Science Fiction movie. For starters, it's a movie spawned from a huge fan movement (Browncoats) of a (undeservedly)cancelled television show by Joss Whedon(Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel). In my opnion, it's a movie made specifically for the fans because of all the different references to past episodes but that doesn't mean some guy who's bored on a Friday night won't enjoy it. While the graphics aren't the same as LotR or Star Wars (New Trilogy) but the story is still compelling and even though the dialogue sounds a bit awkward at times (it's still better than the new Star Wars trilogy at any right), it stays true to the universe. The acting is good, you can get a sense of the characters and their developement over the course of the movie.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|Gaghan has now made two similar powerful films that have something to say on the more important issues of the current times.  That is no small feat.  Like Jonathan Swift writing \\"Gulliver's Travels:\\" Joseph Heller and \\"Catch 22; or better yet Don DeLillo writing \\"Underworld\\" or \\"White Noise,\\" Gaghan reveals something that necessarily isn't being said too widespread about modern times and does it in such a way that it is hard not to listen and doubly it's hard not to be engaged and entertained while listening.<br /><br />The performances are all fine here is \\"Syriana.\\"  A hefty Clooney does quite a turn portraying CIA agent, Bob.  Matt Damon is very believable as a family man who gets mixed in the middle through a loss and chain of fate events in the big business in the Middle East that is oil.  Jeffrey White as the private lawyer hired by the Department of Justice, Bennett Holiday, perhaps tops them all in a understated, truly believable, lion of a role.<br /><br />Just as in Gaghan's \\"Traffic,\\" multiple story lines are woven together to get at the bigger picture that is either the next \\"Great Game\\" of energy business or the Global War on Terrorism depending on the way you look at it.  So of course the weighty issues of the United States and the international community is, as its always been, economic, religious, historical, violence veiled in power and international relations, but mostly and at the very core of it all...it's about people.  \\"Syriana,\\" finds a way to tell the story of the people that make up the drama of terrorism and the fight against it...of international energy commerce and the people that fight for it, in it, against it, and with it.<br /><br />There are several silent explosions throughout \\"Syriana.\\"  A Stinger goes off in Iran?  A Hellfire missile is lofted from a Predator against a Saudi Emir.  A misguided youth guides a small fishing vessel very accurately against an oil tanker (ala the USS Cole) and each explosion brings light.  We don't get to hear the big Hollywood boom (thank you Stephen Gaghan) but we do get commentary about how lives rise from the ashes.  Matt Damon's character, after a near death experience, gets re-centered and grounded in the importance of family and being there for the ones closest to you, the ones you love.  A young man commits suicide for another person's cause with the hope to bring his Mother from Pakistan to Saudi Arabia to be with his father.  These are stories that need to be told because these are stories that are happening and wrapped up in our collective current events.<br /><br />What does Syriana mean?  It's an unfortunate named film indeed but what gives it additional intrigue is that the film's script was inspired from Robert Baer's (ex CIA agent) expose book, \\"See No Evil.\\"  It makes you wonder (as does \\"Traffic\\") how much of the story line is based on real world events.  There may even be an appearance by Condi Rice in the movie...see if you can catch it.<br /><br />So, this movie is a must see for those that care about the issues that face the modern world.  Some may find the multiple story lines off-putting and some may find the political issues a tad boring (my Mother-in-law for one did...whom made it through half the movie with me), but I say watch it.  You won't regret you did.<br /><br />--MMWon't get to hear the big Hollywood boom (thank you Stephen Gaghan) but we do get commentary about how lives rise from the ashes.

1400079179|2.0|I love to read, and sometimes I'll even pick up a book my husband has purchased when I don't have anything of my own to read, as I did with this book.  Dan Brown wants to impress you with some zany controversial facts, but he cuts corners by writing a lame unconvincing \\"thriller\\" around them.  Like, I don't understand why Sophie would be so upset at her grandfather that she wouldn't speak to him for 10 years.  What she saw wasn't even that big of a deal!  That just doesn't make sense.  But of course, Mr. Brown wants you to \\"ooh\\" and \\"ahh\\" at the Biblical \\"facts.\\"  I think that the story itself is incredibly lame, do Langdon and Sophie really have to spark a romance at the end?!  Why?!  Gimme a break!  I'm insulted.  He should've just started a conspiracy website and loaded his facts there instead of wasting perfectly good trees on this stinker!
B000F7CMRM|4.0|I was anxious as everyone to see this movie, and was captivated by it to an extent, but in the end it was disappointing in its complexity.  The ending ties up a few main threads, but there were other storylines introduced that weren't resolved, and I can honestly say I didn't understand the reasoning behind several things that happened.  Although I enjoy movies that force you to fill in the pieces and don't explain all the details through dialog, this movie is so vague that one feels lost (some reviewers point out this effectively communicates the immense complexity of the geopolitical oil quagmire, but I <br />don't share that reaction).  I wasn't left with a satisfactory understanding of most of the main players, including the CIA (the lost missiles and the rationale of the Hamas/Iran fiasco), the Justice Dept. and the mercurial motivations of the investigating attorney, and to a lesser extent the whole Kazakhstan affair as it related to the Chineese in the middle east.  Maybe I'm old school: although a lot of interesting scenarios were presented, I was disheartened the movie didn't have a more precise message.  Side notes:  The \\"corruption\\" rant was an attention getter, but basically silly and juvenile.  Matt Damon's idylic relation with the prince was one of the movies highlights.
B000002UVZ|5.0|I've followed REM since their \\"Fables\\" days, and \\"Pageant\\" is my favorite of all of their albums followed closely by \\"Automatic for the People\\". I get the feeling that REM is running out of melodies as of late...or else, they don't want to repeat themselves. <br /> <br />\\"Lifes Rich Pageant\\" is one of a few albums that I can listen to from beginning to end, because it's consistently that good throughout. \\"Pageant\\" combines the folk rock of \\"Murmur\\", \\"Reckoning\\" and \\"Fables of the Reconstruction\\" with the punchiness of good old fashioned rock: the guitars rock harder, the drums boom louder, and Michael Stipe's vocals come front and center.  <br /> <br />\\"Pageant\\" begins with an amazing 4 songs: \\"Begin the Begin\\", \\"These Days\\", \\"Fall on Me\\" and \\"Cuyahoga\\". \\"Begin\\" and \\"These Days\\" inspire me to go out and do something bold. \\"Fall on Me\\" and \\"Cuyahoga\\" are beautiful mid-tempo songs. Mike Mills' backing vocals on this album, and in particular \\"Fall on Me\\", are great. For as much as people focus on Michael Stipe, Mike Mills is the glue: his backing vocals and bass playing add a great dimension to the band. And of course, Mills stars with his own turn at lead vocals in \\"Superman\\", a re-make of a Clique song. Other luminaries on \\"Pageant\\" include \\"Flowers of Guatemala\\" and \\"I Believe\\". While \\"Fall on Me\\" is probably my favorite on \\"Pageant\\" for its sheer melody and lyrics, \\"Superman\\" is the funnest of the bunch - and even better to watch live as the crowd howls when Mills takes the vocals for a rare turn.
B00005MP58|5.0|I have seen all of the Pride and Prejudice and this is by far my favorite.  The acting is superior and it follows the book.  I prefer this two DVD format to the six VHS format.  If you like Pride and Prejudice, you must have this movie!
B00000DC7L|5.0|An excellent compilation of songs with interesting vocals and a range of guitars.  <br />Apart from his \\"Red Special\\" Brian plays Ibanez in  \\"Nothin' but blue\\". The 'commercial song' \\"Driven by you\\" will wake you up while \\"Too much love\\" is pure masterpiece, sounds even more dramatic than Freddie's version!  <br /> <br />\\"Last horison\\" on the other hand, is a nice, calm guitar solo....Brilliant! For more unique licks and a beautiful ending I recommend \\"Furia\\" by Dr May.
B0000714BP|3.0|For the first 1/3 of 'Wong Foo,' the film delivers a gender-bending road trip at a brisk pace.  Everything from the moment gal pals, Vida(Swayze) and Nozema(Snipes) meet drag queen-in-training Chi Chi(Luguizamo) to the instant car trouble forces them to stay in that dusty western town is funny and magical.  To that point, it's all about these three, and they are undoubtedly the most interesting characters in the film.  The second 2/3 aims at being heartwarming and even a tad philosophical as the trio improves the drab, even desperate, lives of the inhabitants.  Maybe that's why I wished that the road trip would have continued and that their break-down was brief; as a glitzy, campy drag show on wheels (a-la 'Priscilla, queen of The Desert), wong Foo is a wonderfully entertaining comedy but as a mini-drama, its pacing and humor are as stalled as that old yellow Cadillac.  On the whole, Swayze's Vida is a believable-looking and acting drag character played with depth and sensitivity.  Snipes' Noxzema is somewhat less believable in looks and mannerism, and is limited to acidic quips and drag platitudes.  Leguizamo's Chi-Chi is high camp, even for drag queens, but her girlish enthusiasm and petulance is well-developed. The music, costumes and characters are colorful and interesting, despite the overly-long breakdown sequence.  For more sheer Drag fun, Priscilla is a better bet, but Wong Foo is entertaining enough to deserve watching, or owning on the low-priced DVD.

His characters come to life more than any other author I've read, leaving you to really root for the good guys, and even a dog!  <br /> <br />Though I rarely reread novels, I am excited to pick this one up again and again after all these years.  Koontz knows exactly how to blend suspense and horror with love and compassion for an amazing read that you can't put down!  <br /> <br />You've got to read this book!  It will be your favorite too. I would give it 10 stars if I could!

Triple H: What the Hell is wrong with Fed Up and Hellraiser and that whirligig dude ladies and gentlemen? The fact of the matter is is that Boston's self-titled album is killer, sold 17 million US copes for GREAT REASONS and kicks more *ss than any aging teen trash or Dire Straits record as this classic album has songs like More Than a Feeling, Smokin', Peace of Mind, Rock and Roll Band. Shawn Michaels: Triple H, lest not forget Tom Scholz' guitars plus Brad Delp's vocals(and he sings all the parts here) and his voice would have Heffica, P*sst*n* and Britard(who is now a washed up JOKE) either lose weight or m*sc*rry or have seizures!

Then dropping $35.00 for a t-shirt because it was made in the US or $18.00 for that small jar of cashews from the minibar because you 'just had to have something to munch on\\" before going to dinner? If you answered yes to any of the above, you would have no problem dropping the full price (Amazon, $14.98) to have a red-book CD copy (no inferior compressed downloads, thank you) of the perfect pop song, \\"What have I done to Deserve this?\\" from Pet Shop Boys. One of the most beautifully sung and arranged female pop vocals ever recorded is to be found on this one song. It is well known that Dusty Springfield demanded several run-throughs and takes to make this cut. She is said to have sweated every single note to perfection because she felt so strongly about her performance. Believe me, it shows. Perfection. You also get the unrivalled, unmatched 80's pop and dance-beat mastery with all the other selections that only the \\"Boys\\" were able to create. And all for only $14.98.
B000BTJDGC|3.0|I am not sure what to rate this movie as.  As a movie it kept me interested for the whole length.  However, as it represents itself as based on a true story, I would have to say that it is rather loosely based on the true story of the real girl in Germany in the 1970s of Annaliese Michel and it is not that close to the true story.  In the true story, there were two priests indicted and also indicted were the parents.  I would like to have known more about the real girl and not the story as depicted in this movie of a ficticious Emily Rose.  After reading all 187 reviews, I have to conclude that many saw this movie just to be entertained or shocked by it horror movie aspect even if the movie is supposed to be an exorcism based on this true story.  It is true that most movies are for entertainment, but this movie should make one think about the truth about demons.  Some apparently were mislead by the trailer and thought it was nonstop horror movie when most of it was a courtroom drama.  <br /> <br />The real message that should have been taken from this movie is what the ficticious Canadian priest said of his experience with the demonic which was that \\"it scared the Hell out of him.\\"  The other point the priest character made was that he wanted to take the stand to give the message of Emily Rose which was that Hell and demons are real.  That is the message that people should take away from this movie and that is that God is real, Hell is real and so is possesion, demons or fallen angels, victim souls, stigmatists and Catholic exorcists and exorcisms.  Only the Catholic Church possesses the power to exorcise demons from the possessed, a power that Christ himself exercised in the Gospel and promised to His Church, the One, True, Holy and Apostolic Catholic Church.  Whether or not the person of Annaliese Michel was truly possessed and died because the exorcism failed, only God knows ,and only the Catholic Church has the right to judge this case.  If she was a stigmatist,then again, it is up to the Catholic Church to decide if she was one or not. The state, such as Germany, does not have the right to outlaw exorcisms as superstitious or medeival.  If any one is interested in a true story of an exorcism, there is an excellent book called \\"Begone Satan,\\" by Carl Vogl, available on Amazon for less than the price of a movie ticket.  As for stigmatists in the Catholic Church, there are many, including of course St. Francis of Assisi and St. Padre Pio of San Giovanni Rotunda in Italy who died only about 40 years ago.  When a man came to St. Pio and told him that he did not believe in Hell, Padre Pio told him, 'You'll believe it when you get there.\\" <br /> <br />As for me, I believe all of the above - that Hell, demons, possession, exorcisms, etc., and all the truths of the Catholic Church exist.  As the tombstone of the real person of this story, Annaliese Michel, says, \\"Work out your salvation in fear and trembling.\\"  That is what I intend to do, so help me God.  Many Catholic saints, such as St. Teresa de Avila, have experience the pains of Hell temporarily and the very thought of it makes the horrors of this movie seem minor.  One further recommendation is a book on Hell itself and that is \\"The Dogma of Hell\\" by F. X. Schouppe.  Reading that will make ones hair stand on end.   One does not have to be overly fearful of demons and Hell, however, if one is in the state of sanctifying grace and dies in that state.  He will be assured of Heaven, even if he has to pass through Purgatory.  But again, we must remember that Satan does go about as a roaring lion seeking those who he may devour and the wise will take heed. <br />

B000687M48|4.0|In my review of the album Fallen I quoted Lemmy of Motorhead saying that the album was above and beyond the call of duty. The rest of the quote was that he felt they couldn't do it live. Well I have to disagree with Mr Kilminster as having seen the 'World Domination' tour on it's Australian leg I have to say that the band sounded spot on. And this CD shows that they can actually fill up the sound mix just like on their breakthrough album.<br /><br />This is actually a bit of a no frills thing in terms of audio. The sound is fine, the band are tight which is interesting given the personnel dramas of the time. The crowd noise appears to have been phased in and out though that's a fairly regular situation. The main difference between these tunes from Fallen and their live versions here is that the sound does sound a touch hollower.<br /><br />Really this is a cash in job on their fame. Putting out a live album when you've got next to no back catalogue is a bit cheeky. It also serves to fill the gap between their albums - aforementioned personnel upheavals no doubt played their part. Not that filling in time between albums w/ live releases and curiosities is a new idea (G'n'R Lies anyone?).<br /><br />For fans of this band this is probably essential listening. The songs do sound good, the crowd is suitably adoring and they are a likeable project.<br /><br />Three stars for the strength of the songs and because it doesn't feel like there has been massive overdubs.<br /><br />The fourth star for the extra DVD which shows the band putting in value. They did also sell the DVD separately for a while however. Make sure you get this version with the DVD already in it as it really is worthwhile viewing.
B000F39MAQ|5.0|This is a terrific DVD.  Netrebko and Villaizon sparkle.There is obvious chemistry between the two of them.  I must confess that I am not objective about Netrebko.  She is gorgeous and has a gorgeous voice. I saw her in the \\"Don Pasquale\\" at the Met  in April and she was wonderful.  This production takes advantage of her sheer animal magnetism and exuberance. The sound is soaring and beautiful <br /> <br />I thought the minimalist settings were really quite effective and meaningful. The use of the clock and Death figure as metaphors added a new dimension to thinking about the Opera. <br /> <br />This would be a good introduction to Opera for a younger audience (20's and 30's) since they will not have preconceived notions about what Traviata should be and cannot fail to be Attracted to the music and the performers.
B00004TJKI|2.0|I fairly enjoyed the quaint opening of the movie with Jimmy fishing and reminiscing with his legal eagle pal.  However, then <br />the problem of the endless rehashing of the rape began, and the antiquated ideas about \\"provocation of rape\\" were ceaselessly unpealed.  Leading to courtroom discussions about how she was dressed, how she acted, if she flirted.  Reflections of a bygone era when a crime wasn't a crime, but may have been a crime depending on the height of the skirt line.  But even worse than that is the ungodly length of court room banter, often sound and fury which disappointingly led to nothing at the end.  No smoking gun or interesting twist or clues to successfully assemble.  Just a court full of knicker snickerers and a trial that supposedly hinged on the prosecutor's awareness of  the victims paternal history.  Nonsense, and 3 hours down the tubes. However, the movie gets two stars for the clever and alert interjections of the judge, and the appearance of a young George C. Scott, who at that age was interestingly a deadringer for Michael Douglass.  Jimmy does a stand-up job as always.
B000005Z0E|5.0|To keep this short and to the point: <br /> <br />If you've never heard a 2Pac album before this may be the best place to start. His music from this album is rapped with a type of raw passion that I haven't heard before. The messages within his lyrics are important, for those who choose to listen to them. <br /> <br />If you have heard 2Pac's music before then I suggest you pick this up. It will be good to hear his original tracks whether you're a casual fan or if you have a deep love for his music. <br /> <br />The music off of 2Pacalypse Now and some of his other early albums is distinctly different in style from his time on the Death Row record label (which is anything from the All Eyez On Me album forward, including that album.) Both styles are quite unique and just as good as one another, as 2Pac didn't lose a step until his tragic death in 1996. I particurlarly enjoy both styles of his music, and think that any fan should find it in themselves to try to as well.
1416524800|5.0|I can't believe it.  I bought this book, DECEPTION POINT,<br /><br />Sunday.  Didn't even know till then Dan Brown had a new book.  Started reading it Monday.  Finished all 700+ pages today (Wednesday).  I couldn't put it down.  A must read, as good as THE DA VINCI CODE.  Brown really knows how to write a thriller that holds you till the end with no wordiness in the middle to drag it out.  Every word is a grabber.
B000089RV6|5.0|Back in Black is my favorite album from my favorite band, AC/DC. For the review below the one below me, Brian Johnson does not scream. If you want screaming, listen to From First To Last, or Atreyu. Seriously, no one in classic rock screams like the new emo crap. Anyways, after Bon Scott died, AC/DC thought they were done, but they produced this album as their last one. When they saw how many they sold, im sure their minds were changed. Back in Black has sold over 40 million copies. I can play all of the songs on guitar, they are all amazing, totally different from the Bon era. So, BUY THIS ALBUM, ESPECIALLY THE DUAL DISK ITS AWESOME!
0783240236|5.0|After watching \\"The Birds\\" as a schoolboy over thirty years ago, I daydreamed of feathered friends amassing stealthily on rooftops and telephone lines (when they were still above ground), as well as on playground apparatus, praying they would swoop down, suddenly and unexpectedly, through the windows and peck apart disfavored teachers and classmates so that I could flee the damnable day in satisfying glee. Very cool! <br /> <br />Today, I hold a doctorate, perhaps am a little wiser, definitely a little nicer and, although I still have foul acquaintances and colleagues that I wouldn't mind seeing pecked apart, I have never been more impressed, or awed, by the Master's, Alfred Hitchcock's, unqualified brilliance in filmmaking. He is truly missed. <br /> <br />The cheeky, intelligent dialog between wealthy publication heiress, Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), and jaded criminal defense attorney, Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), in this psychological adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's short story, establishes the sophisticated tone of the film. The protagonists meet at the counter of a tony San Francisco pet store. Melanie, the socialite prankster, presumes, rather transparently, to be a sales associate. A poor substitute for the attendant she sent away on a real task, Melanie endeavors to assist Mitch's quest to find a suitable gift for his young sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright). Mitch, who reads the tabloids, recognizes his stealthy \\"sales associate\\" and her clandestine ploys, and decides to play along--just long enough to embarrass the knockout blond in her furtive manhunt. No question, Mitch is mighty sharp--perhaps a little too sharp for a guy. He is aware that Melanie's father has rivals who have been trying to humiliate the family by mercilessly over-spinning tales of his daughter's \\"sordid\\" past, including her naked jump into Italy's Trevi Fountain. Determined not to be out-done, Melanie plots to turn the tables on the prey she so badly underestimated, scheming to personally deliver Mitch's lovebirds for his sister at their Bodega Bay retreat. <br /> <br />For any man, this scenario qualifies, unequivocally, as his worst possible nightmare--infinitely scarier than the lunging gull that bloodies Melanie's scalp while motor-boating to Mitch's haunts. Who, on earth, said women are the weaker sex? <br /> <br />Many believe The Birds portends the growing fear of civil unrest, encroaching socialism, and unbridled communism abroad that charged public perceptions during the cold war of the `50s and `60s. Scripts for deleted scenes and alternate endings, along with photos, supposedly support this view on the superb DVD transfer. If true, it only does so in part. More likely, the \\"birds of the world\\" that are \\"uniting,\\" as referenced in the \\"discarded\\" materials, address deeply personal, social, psychological, and esoteric matters, which Hitchcock weaves into the film. <br /> <br />The Birds showcases isolated and tormented souls. It exposes their personal dilemmas, fears, shortcomings, and tragic histories. Alternating cycles of volatile psychic confrontation, symbolized by the bird attacks, ingeniously frame the film's characters in sundry combinations of intense interaction. The disquietude between escalating sorties is a metaphor of the smoldering instability prowling their lives. <br /> <br />Despite their material wealth and comfort, Melanie and Mitch are lonely hearts. Their lives ring hollow. Melanie has suffered unfathomable heartbreak over her mother's abandonment of the family. She inveighs on this matter with Mitch when she paradoxically asks, testily, whether the absence of a relationship is not worse than a brutal and dysfunctional one, which she knows he has endured with his widowed mother (Jessica Tandy). In a particularly provocative scene, Melanie confronts Lydia, Mitch's mother, who assails her son as an unsuitable replacement for his father to head the family. She reproaches his choice of female companions who fuel her fear of abandonment. Agonizing over her loss, she admits she envied her husband's innate ability to relate with children, contrasting it against her own failure as a mother. Despite Tandy's spectacularly introspective performance, it is Hedren, with her empathic eyes misting over, who registers the full brunt of her counterpart's anguish, concomitantly communicating her character's own emotional emptiness, while barely uttering a word. This is brilliance, pure and simple. In this face-off, Hitchcock cunningly shreds the painted veil of antagonism between the characters. We witness the void-filling birth pangs of a remarkably mature, mother-daughter relationship. All this occurs, no less, between vicious bird attacks! <br /> <br />Melanie incites passive--and, at times, overt--aggression in the residents of Bodega Bay. Her encounters often are accompanied by bird attacks. She is a living psychopomp, a herald, obliquely tolerated by some, and openly reviled by others. Ironically, those who \\"judge\\" her also beg forgiveness--Hitchcock's nod to Frank Capra. Ensconced in stultifying complacency and self-absorption, two local merchants, in a memorable scene, profess to know the Brenners, yet cannot correctly name Mitch's sister. Another scene ramps-up tension between Melanie and Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette), a comely schoolteacher who once harbored designs for Mitch, and is unable to leave Bodega Bay. <br /> <br />No confrontation is more brutal than Melanie's sole encounter with the birds in Mitch's attic. This is an unparalleled battle of the \\"self,\\" one that Melanie barely survives, and not without Mitch's intervention. Almost unnoticeably, the superficiality that once characterized their relationship has deepened into a trusting and loving dynamic. Melanie's initial indifference towards Cathy, who's wistful yearning for attention she rebuffed, gives way to an eye-opening revelation. Something devastatingly familiar urges her to fill the void in the young girl's life as a more youthful, female role model. <br /> <br />Like the proverbial Phoenix rising from the ashes, The Birds, in the end, is not about inextinguishable conflict and devastation. Nor is it about dysfunctional families and terminal relationships--though there are tragic losses from the feathered assaults. The Birds is not a political statement. Foremost, The Birds is a film about struggled, new beginnings. Look carefully for the dove-like cloud that frames the sunbeam that pierces the twilight skies of Bodega Bay. This is a powerful metaphor of the sacred feminine pouring her spirit from the unseen heavenly realm to earth as projected light. New beginnings beget new consciousnesses, which beget new realities. Melanie's gift of the sedate, cooing lovebirds provides her with excellent therapy to recover from her own physical and psychic shock. Cathy, insisting they should not be abandoned, runs back to the house to retrieve their cage, which she jams into Melanie's roadster, now filled with the others. For the first time, the four smile at each other as they depart their decaying homestead and the carrion of Bodega Bay, as self-improved, functional travelers. <br />
B000000OSG|5.0|The Use Your Illusion epics are a great compilation of music from one of my favorite bands, but of the two, i like Use Your Illusion II better. UYI2 has deep lyrics and great guitar playing from Slash and Izzy. The best songs are Civil War and Estranged. Two incredible songs, and are probably some of the best GN'R songs. I was sad to see Estranged was not included on the greatest hits cd. The greatest hits also missed a few earlier songs like Nightrain, Mr. Brownestone, and My Michelle. <br /> <br />     Use Your Illusion II is a great cd if your down, and wanna hear some good music from a great band. 5 stars all the way. GUNS N' ROSES RULES.
B000062X90|3.0|Wishbone Ash - from around the time of the druids.... nah just joking. But we are discussing a record from 1972.<br /><br />It's well documented that Steve Harris of Iron Maiden is a big fan of these boys and it's claimed that their early twin guitar attack was quite influential on his musical thinking. So for the heavy rock fan what is there on offer here?<br /><br />It starts fairly non mainstream with a 9.42 track called Time Was. The first couple of minutes stubmle along but then a rockabilly feel comes in and it becomes generic rock 'n' roll territory. Most of the rest of the tracks are overly mellow, plodding is a word that springs to mind. Alleged classic Blowin' Free isn't too bad but best of the bunch is, by far, The King Will Come.<br /><br />This track - a staple of their live set for evermore - has movements of rockin' out and mellow phases that actually work. When the band played the Metal Hammer Festival at Loreley this was chosen to represent the band on the attendant video, such was it's strenght still, over a decade after it's release here on Argus.<br /><br />However after this we get more longwinded trash, often only saved by some very pleasing guitar work. Some variety is injected by the shared vocal duties and bonus points for Andy Powell playing a flying V style guitar way back in 1972! My version of this disc has the bonus track of No Easy Road, initially a b-side for the Blowin Free single.<br /><br />Oh and a pretty nifty cover by Hipgnosis. Utterly irrelevant to the music by you get that....
B000E8QVWY|3.0|I was a little disappointed with the story. Joaquin Phoenix just didn't line up with Johnny Cash for me. June Carter Cash was a handsome women but not like Reese Witherspoon who is   extremely attractive (cute). That said both actors did remarkably excellent jobs singing. Cry Cry Cry was very effective. Two others Cocaine Blues & Get Rhythm are not heard very often. A lot of the movie was wasted on John's sophmoric pursuit of June. Sometimes he was married or she was married to someone else. It didn't matter to him. He begs her to marry him. It was childish & pathetic as portrayed. A very short movie without that nonsense. Of course the best parts were the stage performances of both of them. So, it's okay & I recommend it.
B000002WCJ|4.0|Michael Kiske is the lead throat on this album, really in some ways the start of a new era for Helloween after The Walls of Jericho and Keys Pt I. The music writing team is firing on all cylinders with Kiske, Kai Hansen and band leader Michael Weikath all coming up with a number of gems for the listener.<br /><br />Wrapped in cool cover art and very much steeped in a genre they helped define, this album sees the band stretching out musically, while staying true to their formula of 'high speed megagoth', to quote another reviewer.<br /><br />Songs span the aspirational in Eagle Fly Free, the bemusing metal of Rise and Fall and the quirkiness of Dr Stein. Bolstered by the histrionic Save Us and the Kai Hansen soul baring tune of I Want Out, this is an album with much to offer the fan of this style of metal. And that style is balls to the wall, fast paced metal, sort of a prototype for all later power metal and also with one foot in the speed metal genre. The songs are at times fairly simple, despite everything happening at a million miles per hour but in this case that speed works well. The songs for the most part stretch out to five minutes or so, except for the last track which is a 13+ minute opus. Very well placed at the end of the disc, as putting it earlier may well of sapped the energy from the album as a whole.<br /><br />Helloween were on a creative and commercial high point here as this album garnered the band many many fans around the traps. Highly recommended.
0670824399|5.0|For parents wanting to teach thier children the love of reading and to speak up when approporiate, Matilda by Roald Dahl is a great book.   <br /> <br />After my nine year old read the book, I was curious so I read it too. The only word of caution is there is a piece in the book about death.  It is presented well and, while I didn't have trouble with the reference, some parents may.
B00005QK3D|4.0|OK, horrid cover art on both back and front aside, the pumpkinheads of Helloween came up with a very interesting album here. To illustrate how varied this disc is you only have to listen to tunes such as Number One which is a strangely plaintive piece of metal balladeering and Heavy Metal Hamsters which is musically excellent yet lyrically so off the wall you start to wonder what sort of recreational substance abuse was happening in the studio. Personally I find the track funny but I'm probably in the minority on that one, many fans of a band of hitherto 'serious' musos such as Helloween would be aghast at such wilful silliness on the part of their heroes.<br /><br />Other tracks that are indicative of how the band were changing can be found in Kids of the Century which rides a decent melody, but is somehow taken less seriously by the listener because one gets the impression that the band were taking themselves less seriously. With many bands that's a good thing, but here you just come away disappointed. Sort of like a restaurant that you go to and then years later realise you've never been back to, this album cranks to a decent level however doesn't seem to demand extra listens.<br /><br />In summation, a finely produced, ambitious release from a band with great musicianship with the likes of guitarist Roland Grapow on guitar, Michael Kiske on vocals and once again Weikath is sharing writing duties. Chris Tsangarides produced the whole thing and this is a band that cares enough to actually credit solos on the individual songs. But it ain't the first Helloween album I'd recommend for the newcomer to sink their teeth into.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|OK, we don't even have to discuss the music....we all know it is superb!! But the cinematography of this DVD is amazing. I have never seen a concert-DVD that is so \\"up close\\", nor that has such outstanding picture and sound quality. <br />Definitely will make you regret even more that the Eagles aren't touring!!!
B000BVEKO0|2.0|i feel as a korn fan of 11 years i can write a decent review of opinion. please note that that is exactly what this is. an OPINION. <br /> <br />This album sorely disappointed me from start to end. I didnt like one song at all. I am going to stand up and say NO, ITS NOT BECAUSE HEAD LEFT. Its one of FIVE guys. Brian had absolutely no affect on David being lazy and uncreative with his drumming. Fieldy started playing normal of his own free will im sure. Munky, i hope to god you find some more inspiration than you did this round. The guitar playing is so boring. and jonathan, i really didnt dig what he tried to do this album. the moment i heard \\"because no one understands you, but the music do..\\" they lost me. I do not like this new attempt one bit. Even the artwork sucks. and so do the onstage people in outfits remaking it. <br /> <br />HOWEVER---- please note, that if you were an old fan but dislike the new cd, the bonus track \\"It's Me Again\\" is actually quite decent. Much like something that was scrapped from the \\"Take A Look In The Mirror\\" sessions. Not perfect, but i put it in rotation for myself.
B000301YY8|4.0|Given the huge success of his single \\"You're Beautiful\\" together with other singles from his album. James Blunt has come really far for a debut artist. His album is one that is quite unusual as he is not going over mainstream Pop. Which I praise him for. Instead of just dishing out garbage like most artists we know today. Here is one guy dishing a album that puts many artists to shame. Why? Because the songs convey so much conviction if you listen closely. Personally I and a couple of my friends appreciate this album a lot! I mean for a debut artist to sing songs like this means he knows what he's doing instead of singing gardbage like most debut artists. <br />This album is for eveyone and is listen friendly of course. Making this album one this year's must have's on your list. This people I promise you. Is not garbage but an album full of emotions of a human being! Have a listen...
B00005JNRY|4.0|It lacked that deep emotional connection other Pixar films had. Still, it has great animation a wonderful voices and characters, but is not Toy Story, certainly not The Incredibles or Finding Nemo.
0793542049|4.0|I am just starting to explore the concepts of walking bass lines and jazz standards and found this book to be very useful.  The examples are clear and informative and I have been able to learn quite a lot in a very short space of time.
B000063147|5.0|This disc is incredible.  M. Shadows has such a vocal range such as metal has never seen.  Warmness on the Soul is an awesome ballad that falls in the middle of the disc.  Other notable tracks include Turn the Other Way, The Art of Subconcious Illusion, and We Come Out at Night.  Look forward to future releases from this band.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna's latest (at the time I'm writing this) is a dance music album, as if you couldn't guess that from the album title.  It's a solid album, with good beats and catchy melodies.  Madonna's voice is in fine shape, too.  One aspect of the album that I found slightly annoying is that there are no breaks between songs.  One song leads right into another.  So, if you just want to play one song, it won't have a \\"natural\\" beginning or ending, if that makes sense.  If it doesn't make sense, just click \\"not helpful\\".  Anyway, that's just a minor complaint.  Overall, it's very good album that Madonna's fans should enjoy.  As an aside, I saw Madonna in concert the other day, performing the songs from this album, and I must say she puts on quite a show.
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|This album was very good.  M. Shadows has an extremely melodic voice and can change from piercing screams to melodic singing in an instant.  The only reason I gave this album 4 stars is because it had too much singing for my taste.  I liked the screaming better than the singing.  But that shouldn't stop anyone from buying the disc.  If you liked Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, you will definitely enjoy this album.  If you liked City of Evil, you may have mixed feelings.  Anyway, this is a must-buy.
0743454537|4.0|Anna is a 13-year-old who was created specifically as a DNA match for her older sister Kate, who has leukemia. Anna has always had to undergo surgeries for her older sister, whether she wanted to or not. But one day, Anna hires a lawyer so she can have the rights to her own body, which means she would never have to undergo surgery for her older sister again. But if she doesn't, her sister may die. <br />This is an excellent, emotional novel on a subject that deserves discussion. Each chapter is from the perspective of a different character, a feature the author uses to move the story along and add suspense. And, despite the sad ending, it is a very interesting story. I highly recommend this book.
B00005JOQS|5.0|I am a big fan of Christopher Reeve and I thought that no one could ever take his steps as Superman until Brandon showed up. He is the next Superman and Superman Returns is a steller movie. Watching this movie made it seem as though Superman never died. The acting was exceptional.

B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce's \\"Dangerously In love\\" is a classic and definitely the best record that came out that year. This woman is amazing. She has such a beautiful voice that everytime she sings i get goosebumps. This record is one of the few records that i can listen to from beginning to end. This girl is amazing in Destiny's Child but even better as a solo artist.All of the tracks are beautiful in their own way.The best songs on this record are:  1.Crazy In Love - The first single to be released off Dangerously In Love and the video had us all falling in love and trying to knock off Beyonce's \\"Oh Oh Oh Oh\\" booty dance. Beyonce's beau Jay joins her on this track and makes it even hotter.Great club banger. Great song to show the world that what she and Jay has is great and that she is sooooo in love!!!!10/10  2.Naughty Girl -  The fourth and final single to be released off \\"Dangerously\\". Great video and song. Beyonce looks amazing in the video and sounds so great and I loved seeing her dancing with Usher. 10/10.  3.Baby Boy - The second singleto be released and Beyonce looked like she spent hours in the gym specifically for this video. So sexy and Sean's rap sounds great with B's voice. Great choice for 2nd single.10/10.  4.Hip Hop Star - Great sexy hip hop song. The lyrics are so suggestive.9/10  5.Be With You - Great song for where B croons that she rather be with her man Jay and nobody else. This song is great to just turn off the lights, light some candles and start making babies. I wish that it was a single tho.This has got to be 1 of my fave songs on this album.10/10.  6.Me,Myself And I - This song is about B telling her man that its over cuz he cheated and that she's moving on and that she's got Me,Myself And I in the end and that after the rain the sun will come out again. This song was a great choice for 3rd single and for all the ladies out there who ever got their heart broken. This song is an awesome song that helped me thru a tabanca in 2003. The video was great too,so unique and we saw Beyonce stripped of all her makeup for the beautiful woman that she truly is. I love this song soooooo much and play it over and over.10/10.  7.Yes - Beautiful song, great lyrics and I'm sure all ladies can relate.10/10.  8.Signs - Great production by Missy and Beyonce's vocals sound so amazing.10/10.  9.Speechless - Beautiful ballad 9/10.  11.The Closer I Get to You - Beautiful duet with Luther. 9/10.  12.Dangerously In Love - Beautiful ballad about being in love with your man even though there's a possibility of getting hurt.9/10.  Beyonce fans and haters this is a record that everybody should have in their cd collection.Cant wait to see the video for \\"Deja Vu\\" and i cant wait till \\"B-Day\\" drops in September. Yuh dun know it's gone be hott!!!! B you go girl and great performance at the BET awards u looked awesome!!!!!
0688145078|3.0|Great pictures. Just an average book. It is written from the point of view of once the baby is home. At any rate, it helps get your child ready for the coming arrival.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina is amazing!!!!!! She is a white girl with a black girl's pipes. That chick can sing and she can write amazing records too.All the songs on Stripped are amazing and stand out tracks and my favourites on the album include: <br />1.Cant Hold Us Down - beautiful song about female empowerment and Lil Kim joins her on this track as well.9/10. <br />2.Fighter - Third single off of Stripped and great song that shows that we can all be strong people and move on even when people we trust stab us in the back.9/10. <br />3.Love Embrace Interlude - Beautiful interlude that leads up to my favourite song on this album. <br />4.Loving Me 4 Me - Christina sounds amazing on this record and there is no doubt in my mind that this song is dedicated to her husband Jordan. The lyrics are so beautifully written and it is a great love song.This song should've been a single.10/10 <br />5.Infatuation - Great song about her ex Jorgie and the fact that her relationship was basically infatuation.I love this song and the beat is awesome.8/10. <br />6.Beautiful - Great song about self esteem and loving yourself for who you are.9/10. <br />7.Get Mine, Get Yours - Sexy song and lyrics about casual sex.8/10. <br />8.Dirrty - This video showed Christina in a different light. The beat is awesome and christina looks so sexy.The dancing is sexy and the lyrics are just great.After Loving Me 4 Me, this has got to be my favourite song on this album.Great club banger and first single.10/10. <br />Whether you are a Christina fan or not this album is worth having in your cd collection. Her new single \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" is so awesome and i cant wait for her new album \\"Back To Basics to come out! I'm only expecting the best from Christina in the future. This girl is amazing and her style is so unique! You go girl!!!!!!! <br />
0060849827|5.0|You really don't have to have a 'need' for this book to find it entertaining. If you're the curious type, this has everything, from how to maim someone using only your own eyelash to how to trap, skin and cook an aardvark to more than enough reasons why you don't want to go outside, ever. <br /> <br />Actually, it has very useful first aid information and every page has something interesting - I take public transportation to and from work and no matter how long the trip takes I always have emergency reading material in my bag. <br /> <br />If you are the type who has 'bathroom books,' this is a worthy addition to your collection as well.
B0009X766Y|4.0|The film is a classic, the restoration is beautiful, and the restored audio is excellent, with one inexplicable gaff.  During a humorous dialog exchange, one of Redford's funniest lines is replaced with a sanitized-for-TV dub, which I had only ever heard on the broadcast version of the movie. <br /> <br />Original Dialog <br />Gondorf: Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.   <br />Hooker: He didn't tell me you was a f**k-up, neither. <br /> <br />The perfect timing of the exchange is blown to bits by the dubbed in line, \\"He didn't tell me you was a screw-up, neither,\\" which has neither the delivery nor the comic impact of Redford's original.  Even if it meant getting the film re-rated, this movie deserved better treatment.  Why a company would go the all the effort of restoring a classic, award-winning film, then leave in a clumsy, laugh-robbing dub like this, is a complete mystery to me. <br /> <br />Other than this one cringing moment, it's a true gem.
B000FMGTTE|4.0|John Ottmans work is fairly new to me. He came to my attention with his score for X2- X-men United, which i thought was a great improvement from the first X-men film. After that whenever i would see his name i would pay closer attention to his music, such as the case with the movie Hide and Seek which i think he did a wonderful job on. <br /> <br /> Now he has paired with long time collaberator and friend Bryan Singer to score Superman Returns, the long awaited sequel which has been in the making for some 15 or so years. <br /> <br />One thing that really disappointed me about the third and foruth Batman films (besides how bad they were) was the fact that Danny Elfman's theme was disgarded for a cheap imitation by Elliot Goldenthal. Not the case with Superman Returns.  The film was more of a continuation of the Donner films, and so was the score. While it was a great thing to prominantly feature Williams music in the film, I wish Ottman would have been a bit more daring in making this score HIS. But that is about the only negative thing I have to say about this otherwise beautifully orchestrated score. <br />  <br />Ottman helped to tell the story without being overly intrusive, which is kind of hard to do especially when making a Superman film. Supermans personal theme was a nice addition, although Lex Luthors theme came up a bit empty. There is beautiful use of choir, and strong horns as well.  <br /> <br />Its not the greatest score ive ever heard but it is definitely a great addition to anyones collection. I look forward to hearing more from John Ottman, and as an aspiring filmmaker, I would hope to one day work with him.
B000660UN0|5.0|This DVD/CD is far superior to the CD which preceded it, 'Me and Mr J', which was released in 2004. The band gels and seems more cohesive. In addition, the arrangements are more interesting and there is more variety in the presentation of the classic Delta songs. Clapton performs several with Dayle Bramhall 11, which are outstanding, but the highlights for me, are the solo accoustic numbers, 'Ramblin' on my Mind' and a poignant 'Love in Vain'. <br /> <br />The previous album lacked this essential variety and sounded repetitious and routine by comparison. Clapton is an excellent accoustic blues guitarist, and should give more exposure to this form of presentation. This is the missing ingredient from the first CD. <br /> <br />What contributes to the enhanced atmosphere, is the decision to perform in the hotel room in Dallas, where Robert Johnson recorded the originals in 1937/38. There are more than a few ghosts hovering and it imbues the music with a sense of spirit and dignity. <br /> <br />There is also an excellent 'Kind Hearted Woman Blues', which the band handles with aplomb. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.

1573226521|5.0|Think \\"The Lord of the Flies,\\" then think Game Boy, Marijuana, teen angst, and Vietnam war-flicks.<br /><br />An unlikely combination, no doubt, but somehow, thanks to Alex Garland's narrative gift, he manages to weave these elements into a successful, and highly addicting, first novel.<br /><br />Like most people, I first experienced \\"The Beach\\" through the DiCaprio movie of the same name. The movie interested me a little, and a week later, I decided to pick up the book. I know it's clich&eacute;, but believe me when I say, the book is much, much better than the movie.<br /><br />Richard, the main character, is a backpacker through Thailand, and, like a lot of backpackers, he is searching for that undiscovered place--paradise, if you will. Enter Daffy, a suicide who leaves him a map to a hidden beach. Richard, with some friends, travels there and discovers his utopia. I won't spoil the rest, but it's probably easy to guess.<br /><br />The appeal of \\"The Beach\\" is not in its premise, which has been done countless times before. The appeal lies in Garland's ability to bring something new to the table. The Vietnam flashbacks with Daffy, the conflict with the dope farmers, and the pending sense of doom are the elements in this story that make it a real page turner.<br /><br />We all know the ending of the story before it starts, but finding out HOW Richard's train wreck concludes is a different matter completely.

0618001905|4.0|What is most depressing about this book is that, in the year 2006, most people do not even know that 10 million people were killed in such a callous way. The lives of black people are so devalued, even now. <br /> <br />Hochschild does a good job of chronicling the worst of what happened, particularly in detailing the efforts of a couple of unsung African-American heros of the Congo horrors who few people know about, William Sheppard and George Washington Williams. <br /> <br />Anyone who thinks this story proves that good ultimately triumphed over evil is way off base. The whistle blowers paid heavy prices. One was driven to suicide. They all had their reputations dragged into the mud. Some had to go on trial as if they were the bad guys. Meanwhile, Leopold was allowed to continue his murderous activities for years after Morel, Williams, Sheppard, and others blew the whistle on him. As this book details, Britain and Belgium allowed Leopold to continue his murderous behavior until he became too much of an embarassment with his underage girlfriend and also when it became clear the profits from the death, enslavement, castration, child molestation, and rape of all those black people where not being properly shared with other white folks. <br /> <br />Disgracefully, even then, as this book chronicles, the Congo rubber trade continued after Leopold had to give up control of the Congo. Let us be for real about this. Belgium is still, to this day, abusing Africans in the Great Lakes region (research Belgium's role in the Rwanda genocide).  <br /> <br />And, even after being forced to give up the Congo, Leopold still got a nice fat golden parachute, instead of what he deserved, which was a lifetime sentence of hard labor. <br /> <br />Justice is not served when 10 million black people die, and the white guy who engineered it gets to walk away with fat pockets and no jail time. <br /> <br />

B00005JOQS|5.0|It has been a long time since I've posted a film review online. I consider myself to be a film connoisseur even if my experience is limited to genre type pictures. The purpose of this review is to persuade you all to go see Superman Returns. It is one of the best films ever made (do not chew me out yet because this is only my personal opinion.) It was directed by Mr. Bryan Singer and stars Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth, James Marsden and newcomer Brandon Routh as the Man of Steel. It is as faithful to both the comics and Richard Donner's interpretation as you can get. It feels like a remake but it never manages to insult our intelligence and say it is, which is what I believe is the problem with other remakes of today.<br /><br /> Routh as Superman. It was almost as if someone had reincarnated the late great Christopher Reeve. Routh had every little nuance, gesture, facial tic down to a tee. Also, the resemblance is uncanny. But resemblance is not enough; he brings to mind Reeve's iconic portrayal and also manages to make the role his own with small subtleties. Just like Christian Bale reinvented the Batman, Routh has brought us back the Last Son of Krypton while paying homage to the man who we all remember as the definitive version of the same role. I do not know if homage is a strong enough word for how Routh and Singer have honored Christopher and Dana Reeve. I know wherever they are, they are smiling.<br /><br /> Superman in a new contemporary society. The world does not seem to have moved on much since his departure. There is still crime, despair, and poverty, so the world still needs a Superman. The only little inconsistency with this world is that Donner's original film takes place in the 70s and this film is obviously set in the 21st century. So that means either Donner's films will have to be retconned to have taken place in the not too distant future or, you know what? It really doesn't matter.<br /><br /> Superman and Lois Lane's relationship. This is what carries the film and it does so effectively without being cheesy or contrived. It is an age old dilemma. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy disappears, girl moves on with her life but boy is still in love with her. Also, there is a unique plot twist that will totally blow you away and if you listen to internet spoilers, it may sound lame and campy. But Singer's direction and the way it is presented are so effective, you come out of the theatre satisfied.<br /><br /> Spacey as Luthor. Now this performance seemed scary at first in the context that it looked as if Spacey was trying to copy Gene Hackman but he does not. This is Lex Luthor with the volume turned way up and it does not come off as over the top or campy. You really hate this guy and you wait in desperation for Superman to get his hands on him. His nefarious plot, while reminiscent of the 1978 original, is one of which only a Lex Luthor can think of.<br /><br /> Ebert and the Hollywood System. Roger Ebert didn't like it. You know what? Screw Roger Ebert. For over 30 years the world has had this man's biased opinion shoved down our throats and I am sick to my stomach of it. How is he an authority on movies and has never made one? How can he tell Russell Crowe or Sharon Stone how to act when he has never been behind a camera? What makes his opinion the only one that matters? Jesus Christ! They act like he's God Almighty or something. See this film for what it is and not because of no talent hacks like Ebert telling you otherwise.<br /><br /> Superman has had a rough road trying to get back on the silver screen since that 1987 flop, The Quest For Peace. It seems everyone that was attached to the project at one point or another wanted to reinvent Superman as a martial arts action hero weirdo like Van Damme or Seagal. You should read online some of the crappy ideas they had for a potential Superman film, everything from Matrix rip off fights to battles with giant spiders. Finally, here comes Singer who recognizes that such changes are unwarranted and that you have to keep the character true to the original stories and not some contemporary merchandise-sales-only-matter pop culture MTV machine (remember Batman & Robin).<br /><br /> Singer's direction and the Musical Score. From the moment the Warner Brothers shield appeared to the end credits, I knew I was watching a Superman film. Aesthetically and artistically, the film seemed like Donner and Reeve were back together again in an all new completely original Superman story. Singer seems to have found his niche with this particular type of genre. I know in Hollywood, these type of movies do not get much respect because they are looked upon as too commercial and that they are for kids, but they are wrong. If they would look past the secret identities and corny getups, they would see the depth that pictures bring to the American cultural landscape. It is not about having super powers and saving the world, it is about holding true to your own personal principles and using supernatural means, even if they do not exist, to do so. Men like Sam Raimi, Christopher Nolan, and Bryan Singer seem to understand this and I hope they continue to put these masterpieces on the screen in the years to come.<br /><br />The main themes are borrowed from the great John Williams but the original themes make it seem like Williams was right there with John Ottman, who has composed a score that makes us once again believe a man can fly.<br /><br /> The Final analysis. Along with X-Men: The Last Stand, this one of the few movies worth watching this year. Not because of the special effects but because of the depth of the characterizations and the lengths to which the filmmakers have gone to present us not only a great comic book adaptation, but also a great film. So I highly recommend Superman Returns to both the fanboys and the general move going audience. If Batman Begins is the best superhero adaptation to date, then Superman Returns is the second best. Side note: I know this may sound like an attempt for both franchises to be more pop friendly and fanboy pleasing, but I think Christopher Nolan and Bryan Singer need to start talking with one another. I know I don't have to say about what.inally, here comes Singer who recognizes that such changes are unwarranted and that you have to keep the character true to the original stories and not some contemporary merchandise-sales-only-matter pop culture MTV machine (remember Batman & Robin). <br /> <br /> Singer's direction and the Musical Score.

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Honestly, the most I can say is that this movie truly showed just how much an indie film can outshine a hollywood budgeted film. This small budgeted Indie film didn't require huge hollywood graphics to be a hit and only used the talent of these actors and awesome movie script to outshine most of the hollywood movies that have came out. I saw this movie twice in the movie theater and I have already pre-ordered it.
B000000OQ5|5.0|Tesla is probably the best metal band to come out of the 80's (considering that Motley is my all time fave).  These guys rocked harder and louder than anybody else but only got moderate recognition from top 40 radio when they released Love Song off of Radio Controversy.  This is their legacy to the rock world.  Every song rocks, HARD. Even the ballads.  They had better muscianship and song writing than any of their contemporaries.  I listen to this cd often and everytime I hear I still bang my head.  This cd has stood the test of time.  Thank you Tesla, for everything.
0877180121|5.0|This book is wonderful to begin teaching young children the rudiments of piano playing.  The children are most excited when they have to play their parts while I play the accompaniment.  These 'duet' sessions have generated much joy, laughter and fun, which is what music should be to children.   <br /> <br />If your child requires more challenging work, I would suggest using this book in tandem with another book like from Michael Aaron's series or John Thompson's \\"Teaching Little Fingers to Play\\".
B000002INR|5.0|This album came out when glam was king and Skid Row were worthy heirs to the throne. Sebastian Bach probably had the best voice of any lead singer of his time.  The songwriting is great with catchy hooks and plenty of crunching guitars.  The only song that doesn't stand up with the rest is \\"Can't Stand the Heartache\\", so just skid right over it.  Every other song is awesome, and this disc stands up well with the test of time.  This disc is in regular rotation in my car.
B000683VI4|4.0|I did enjoy The Notebook very much. Beautifully shot, it was a lovely story although I found it predictable. Most of my other friends did not find it as easy to call as I did, so I'm not going to spoil the story for everyone. Despite figuring out what was going on right away, it didn't deter me from enjoying the movie. It's worth it just to watch Rachel McAdams alone. She was quite something in Mean Girls, and she really shows her range in The Notebook. If you're the type that likes sappy romances, you will definitely love this movie that shows true love truly stands the tests of time. Enjoy!
B0001I55OC|5.0|If you are a fan of time-travel movies, you will love &#34; Timeline&#34;.  A group of young present-day archeologists from 1999 go back in time, to April 4, 1357, to rescue the head of their expedition who is already there.  They arrive in the middle of a fictional battle, the Battle of Castelgard, in the Hundred Years War between the French and the English.    The film is very enjoyable for many reasons.  One is that it reveals the immense contrast between the medieval world with the modern one.  Although this exact battle is fictional, much of the film is historically accurate:  the costumes, the way rural cottages were built, etc.   As the film jumps up and back between 1357 and the present, it reveals the huge difference between the two ages.  Gerard Butler as Marek is dashing, loyal and and virtuous.  Anna Friel as Lady Claire manages to be both feminine and feisty.  We actually feel that she doesn't belong in the modern world, that she truly is from this past time.  Their romance, handled with great delicacy, is totally charming.  The combination of romance and action make it a fine date movie.  The cinematographer is Caleb Deschanel -- the man responsible for the beauty in such films as &#34;National Treasure,&#34; &#34;The Natural, &#34; The Right Stuff,&#34; and &#34;The Black Stallion.&#34; Both the costumes and the sets are very accurate for the times, and the special effects never jar you out of the movie.  Richard Donner's direction brings coherence to a movie that, because it jumps up and back from 1357 to modern times, could easily be confusing. Donner also directed &#34;Ladyhawke&#34;, another movie with a very good feel for life in the middle ages.  Donner's other films show his mastery of action scenes, including: &#34;Superman&#34; and &#34;Superman II&#34; (uncredited), the entire Lethal Weapon series, as well as &#34;Conspiracy Theory.&#34;  Donner at long last received an academy award in 2000 for Outstanding Achievement in Directing.  Yes, you need to suspend disbelief; it is a fantasy!  The &#34;science&#34;  is fantasy science; some of the history is true, but many of the historical details are pure fiction.    &#34;Timeline&#34; is a movie you will want to watch again and again.
B000002BYD|5.0|I would have to say that this is my favorite Pearl Jam album. I am aware that the majority of PJ fans would not share my opinion. Many prefer the more anthem and commerical based first two albums. This album did not really have any commercial singles, but many of their songs are the finest they ever did and did find their way to radio, even though the boys were not exactly pushing them there. This was a part of the unique turn the boys took after VS. and have since steered out of with their latest \\"Avacado\\" album. And many fans might be happy that they are back to their hard rock roots, but I will always cherish this album most.
B000002UZ1|5.0|Like many before me,this \\"blue\\" Beatles best-of served as my first,in-depth sampling of The Beatles' output from their post-'Revolver' era from early-1967 onward... You couldn't find a better 100+ minutes of music to listen to straight through than the superb 28 tracks that make up 'The Beatles 1967-1970'. I bought this initially back in the winter of 1988 (I was 18 at the time) on cassette,and it changed my life. True; the 2-cd version often retails at $34.00,which is a bit much,but the material contained is beyond priceless.. About the songs. The songs!! There's not a lame one among the batch of 28. What's even cooler is that -even as the songs unfurl chronologically- they pack a flow to rival any of anyone's favorite best-of albums... The flow of all 28 is remarkable... A fantastic mix of all their late '60's #1 hits as well as choice album cuts (\\"A Day In The Life\\",\\"I Am The Walrus\\")... Seriously folks; anyone who is feeling the itch to discover The Beatles' later output should get this \\"blue\\" best-of first,then graduate onto the studio albums themselves.. That's what happened to me and I wound up (so far) buying all of the albums from 'Rubber Soul' (1965) onwards... This blue '1967-1970' never disappoints. Because the liner notes/inlay booklet doesn't tell you which album each track is culled from,I'll happily fill you in: <br /> <br />Disc One: <br /> <br />1.)Strawberry Fields Forever(John in vocals) <br />2.)Penny Lane(Paul on vocals) <br />(Both originally released as a stand-alone single in early 1967 and both served as the first tracks recorded for what would be 1967's \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". However,the two songs weren't released on any Beatles' album until late-1967's 'Sgt. Pepper' follow-up 'Magical Mystery Tour'.) <br /> <br />3.)Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band(Paul on vocals) <br />4.)With A Little Help From My Friends (Ringo on vocals) <br />5.)Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds(John on vocals) <br />6.)A Day In The Life(John and Paul on vocals) <br /> <br />3-6 from the legendary 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'; 1967. <br /> <br />7.)All You Need Is Love (John on vocals) <br />8.)I Am The Walrus(John on vocals) <br />9.)Hello,Goodbye(Paul on vocals) <br />10.)The Fool On The Hill (Paul on vocals) <br />11.)Magical Mystery Tour(John on vocals) <br /> <br />7-11 from 'Magical Mystery Tour'; 1967 <br /> <br />12.)Lady Madonna(Paul on vocals) <br />13.)Hey Jude(Paul on vocals) <br />14.)Revolution(John on vocals) <br /> <br />12-14 all stand-alone singles released in 1968. All were/are <br />huge hits. Sweet! <br /> <br />Disc Two: <br /> <br />1.)Back In The U.S.S.R.(Paul on vocals) <br />2.)While My Guitar Gently Weeps(George on vocals) <br />3.)Ob-La-Di,Ob-La-Da(Paul on vocals) <br /> <br />1-3 taken from 1968's double-album 'The Beatles' (aka \\"The White Album\\"). <br /> <br />4.)Get Back(Paul on vocals) (Originally recorded 1969 as a single and not released on album until 1970's 'Let It Be'. Twistedly,'Let It Be' was recorded prior to 1969's final Beatles' studio album 'Abbey Road',but not released until later...) <br /> <br />5.)Don't Let Me Down(non-album b-side to the \\"Get Back\\" single; John on vocals) <br />6.)The Ballad Of John And Yoko (non-LP stand-alone single; John on vocals. One of the very few Beatles tracks recorded with only John and Paul playing all the instruments..) <br />7.)Old Brown Shoe(b-side to \\"The Ballad Of John And Yoko\\"; George on vocals) <br /> <br />All of the hits plus some choice b-sides as well.. Yeah!! <br /> <br />8.)Here Comes The Sun(George on vocals) <br />9.)Come Together(John on vocals) <br />10.)Something(George on vocals) <br />11.)Octopus's Garden (Ringo on vocals) <br /> <br />(All culled from 1969's *true* final Beatle masterpiece,'Abbey Road') <br /> <br />12.)Let It Be (Paul on vocals) <br />13.)Across The Universe(John on vocals) <br />14.)The Long And Winding Road (Paul on vocals) <br /> <br />12-14 from 1970's (actually recorded early1969) 'Let It Be'. <br /> <br /> <br />So there you go... 28 of THE very best music ever to grace the world... (Seriously.) Please do yourself a favor and check out *any* Beatles' music. But a choice place to start certainly is here. Have Fun/Enjoy/Peace! <br /> <br />Thanks for your time. <br /> <br />Tim Goyer <br />Albany,NY <br />USA <br />6/28/06
0670034711|1.0|\\"Eat Pray Love\\" can be compared to similar recent books by women who travel in the wake of devastating divorces, including \\"Around the World in 80 Dates,\\" \\"An Italian Affair\\" and \\"A Thousand Days in Venice.\\"<br /><br />\\"Eat Pray Love\\" seems to have the most limited outlook of any of the books in this genre.  It's not clear what was so awful about Elizabeth Gilbert's first husband, except for the fact that he wanted her to be the mother of his children. In the three comparable travel memoirs above, the husbands in each instance behaved in demonstrably reprehensible ways.  None were guilty of creating a vague angst in their wives.<br /><br />The author manages to _not_ have an affair in Italy, which may be a first for a female traveler given that Rome is the birthplace of women's sex tourism. (At least Gilbert admires the beauty of Rome's men.)<br /><br />She does attend a soccer game and provides an amusing translation of old man's \\"flower-chain of curses\\" directed at the players.<br /><br />Moving along to an ashram in India, Gilbert evolves spiritually after much effort to the point where she sees a blue light.

B000FUTQ8C|1.0|I did not buy this book for myself, I borrowed it from my son for whom it was bought as a birthday present; he now has the entire DUNE saga. <br />I think my title summed it up really.  This is an appalling book, where Anderson and Herbert have tried to conclude the storylines is some logical way that will lead into the \\"House of\\" trilogy.  The characters are one-dimensional, the violence gratuitous and the behaviour crass. <br />I fought on to the very unclimactic end.  I cared not for a single person in the book.  My emotions remained unchallenged apart from mind-numbing boredom. <br />How on Earth could such drivel be extended to 600+ pages?  About 100 could have wrapped it up quite succinctly. <br /> <br />I'm truly sorry to say the machines deserved to win.  The humans in this book are ignorant self-indulgent shadows. <br /> <br />Please do not buy this book, it will only encourage more rubbish like it to be inflicted on us.
B00005JOQS|4.0|I went into the theatre really not expecting alot, after seeing the trailers of the movie I found that it was very limited and honestly the only real thing that I knew about \\"Returns\\" was that Kevin Spacey plays the notorious villian, Lex Luther.  <br /> <br />Bryan Singer obviously took an advantage of his large budget of - 260 million and really put it to outstanding use, the special effects, visuals and Technology was obviously advanced from the beginning credits. I would say that it is up there with Peter Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" and George Lucas's \\"Star Wars: Episode 3\\". <br /> <br />The only flaw that I really noticed from this film was the acting - not that it was bad but I thought that lacked a certian Chistopher Reeve. It's not that Brandon Routh was a \\"Bad\\" Superman, but I thought that he lacked the heart and overall emotion that Christopher Reeve brought the charactor. I thought that they might have brought in a more experienced actor to play such an important role, but I have to admit that he sure did LOOK like Superman. I think that I am just such a Reeve fan that I would be saying this about anyone who played the part. I just think that it was a hard path for Routh to follow after Reeve had the uniform on for so long. Other than that the acting by everyone else was by far up to par,Kate Bosworth played a very good Lois Lane, Parker Posey was absolutly flawless in playing Kitty and of corse Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther was a perfect fit. Even the smaller roles were very well played. Overall though I do believe that this last installment of the Superman film series does lack the heart that it showed in the first couple of films. <br /> <br />Overall the story was just like any Super Hero movie should be, you know how they go. Villian wants to destroy the world, good guy fights bad guy to SAVE the world, good guy wins. So I just told you the VERY short version, the actual version is about two hours and thirty minutes long. Every Minute is worth watching. <br /> <br />This very well could be the Biggest Blockbuster film of the summer. You dont want to miss \\"Returns\\" it is alot of fun to watch on the big screen. <br /> <br />P.S This movie, though PG-13 is not rough what so ever and it is most definatly appropriate for Children of about 6 or 7 and above. It is possibly the lightest PG-13 film that I have ever seen. <br /> <br />Grade: B <br /> <br />     <br />

0790729628|4.0|After his Alien success and it was a 1979 revelation in movie special effects, Ridley Scott turns it up another notch to show us what 2019 LA might look like. The art direction is spectacular all right. The concept, which influenced every sci-fi after: mix futuristic fantasy with retro 1930's Fascist architecture, and turn on the strobe lights and fog machine. Give the actors a bag lady wardrobe and a flying car with DeLorean gull wing doors: That's the future kids, well, sort off. The 1979 take on future communications, a phone booth with a TV screen, ha ha - no cell phones envisioned. <br /> <br />Harrison Ford could give a Sam Spade Futurama performance back then. Today he sleepwalks through his lines. I have never seen a cocky actor disintegrate over time as Ford has declined. After all, Cary Grant, Clark Gable, or Jimmy Stewart played all their parts with gusto into their 70's. Ford was good in one decade. <br /> <br />What ever happened to Sean Young? What a knock-out with a sultry voice!

B00003CX97|5.0|with those words william holden sums up this movie,and what a movie.david lean was the master of taking a grand scale movie and still making it a very personel psychological battle of wills. <br />       this is really two stories in one,one being the battle between alec guinness as a british colonel and his his counter part sessue hayakawa who runs the japanese prison camp during world warII. their battle of wills is one of the most intense psycholgical battles ever put on screen,with both men unbinding and how the single-minded colonel takes his job of building a bridge over the title river as an excerise to prove that the british are better than their captiors,never seeing that he is in fact aiding his enemy. <br />      william holden is a p.o.w. who escapes only to be forced by jack hawkins to return to the camp to blow up that bridge. we follow both stories till they both converge at the end. sounds simple but nothing about this movie is simple. after repeat viewings you can find layer upon layer to the story and the soldiers. <br />     sir alec guinness won a richly deserved oscar for his amazing job as a soldier so blind to the code of honor that he can see nothing else. but william holden is the heart of the movie as the out for himself man who sees through guinness's and hawkins heroics and the all consuming quest for honor in a war when there isn't any. jack hawkins is a true joy to watch as leader of the men sent to blow up nicholson's bridge. and for once the enemy in the form of camp commander sessue hayakawa is showen as a well rounded person who finds no honor in his prisoners,but comes to understand and even like him. <br />      when the two stories join up this powerful movie sets up a classic final 25 mins. thathas never been equaled in movie history. the final shot of mr.guinness as he finaly sees and understands what he has done is both heartbreaking and will stay with you long after the movie ends. <br />     this two disc set is amazing,the film is lovingly restored and the credits have been restored to give carl forman and michael wilson as writers(the were blacklisted at the time so the french novelest pierre boulle,who wrote the book but spoke no english was credited as sole writer and picked up the oscar for screenplay for this). the extras are fantastic and that just makes the whole set that much better!! <br />      this is in the top 3 war movies of all time,winning SEVEN oscars for guinness,picture,director,editing,screenplay,and score. and this features the famous whistling tune \\"colonel bogey march\\" that you will also remember long after the movie ends. if you love movies this is one you must have!! get this one now!!!!!!
B000AP04MO|1.0|After purchasing this I have only been able to watch it once. Audrey Hepburn is my favorite all time actor/actress and she (Joanna in this) is brilliant as always. However, Albert Finney's roll (Mark), charactor and performance is in stark contrast. The further the movie goes the more I disliked Mark and was angry that Joanna was putting up with him. Mark's charactor is over the top and unbeliveable. Five stars Audrey, minus four Albert.

B00005JP01|4.0|This is a summer flick targeted squarely at young males. It pushes all the right hormonal hot buttons, sporting plenty of sexy cars, music and women. Plot? Who needs one when you're having this much fun? There is a story, by the way, albeit one so skeletal it's more like a tone poem on angst, rebellion and alienation. For maximum enjoyment, put your brain on cruise control, sit back and just enjoy the ride.

The torch has been successfully passed from Christopher Reeve to Brandon Routh.   Brandon gave an awesome outstanding performance.  He is defintley a great actor and playing the man of steel is surley gonna make him a big star.  I look for great things ahead of him in his future.   <br /> <br />Overall, HIGHLY Recommended!!!  Lots of action, suspense, awesome visuals and special effects! This is defintley the big summer movie of 2006.
B000E0LB7C|5.0|From the first sonata to the last, Backhaus plays these works with all the seriousness and intensity they demand. His tone, not usually mentioned, is incredible and the recorded sound is nearly ideal. His playing may lack charm and lightheartedness, but after all, this is Beethoven, not Mozart. He has a classical approach to the early works, though it should be mentioned that he observes very few of the repeats. The middle works are even better, he presents such favorites as the Pathetique and Waldstein works in such a compelling way that its like hearing them for the first time. In the late works he is a bit less at home, but in my opinion much can still be enjoyed in his performances of them. Backhaus recorded this cycle twice and played them throughout his life. In fact, some of the performances were recorded just a few months before he died, though you would never know it. Another interesting fact is that he was actually EMI's second pick to be the first pianist to record the 32 sonatas, Schnabel of course was the first. This shows that thirty years before he recorded this cycle, EMI recognized his greatness. Imagine then, what 30 years of performing and recording (this is his second time recording the 32 sonatas) these works did for him. They are incredible recordings that show a master who understands these works like so very few do.<br /><br />This is a reissue of his stereo set, which has far better sound than his very similar mono cycle, currently unavailable in the USA. The liner notes are illuminating as well. This set is worth twice the asking price and will surely not be around forever, so do yourself a favor and get this cycle. You won't be disappointed.
B000002GBK|5.0|Believe it or not, it was my mom that introduced me to this album. She told me that when she was about my age she had it on tape and loved it. Since then I wanted it and I have finally got it. I really don't think to many people have heard of Rick Wakeman's solo projects. I'm sure they know him from Yes and the album he did with Black Sabbath but not of his own works, I could be wrong though. From what I've gathered, this is his third album the first being The six Wives Of Henry VIII and the second Journey To The Center Of The Earth. If this album is any indacation of how good his solo works are, I need to pick those other two up. On to the music. The story is about Arthur and his companions and their many exploits and I think he loosly based this album on Thomas Mallory's Le Morte D'Arthur in particular. This album shows that Wakeman is a master (if not the master) of the synthisizer and keyboard. Each song is distinct from the previous which is good in my book. And while there isn't a whole lot of singing, the songs themselves do a good job of telling the story and characters. I just love the different arrangements that go with the different characters, especially Merlin and Guinevere. Plus Rick is accompinied by an orchrastra and The English Chamber Choir which is totaly cool. I've read some reviews saying that some of the singing isn't that great but I have to disagree. While it's not the best singing I've ever heard it's still pretty good. The use of jazz and fusion jazz is also good and in my opinion really helps this already excellent album out. If I have any complaints it is that this album is too short and that it comes with no lyrics. For the first, it doesn't really matter because even though it is over forty-two minutes, I've got other cds that are good but are shorter. And as for the lyrics, I'll get over it because there isn't a whole lot of singing and what singing that is there is pretty much understandable. Definitely an excellent album that shouldn't be passed up.'t be passed up.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|It amazes me how incredibly well this 1969 western has held up after all these years. At once classically structured and satirically executed, director George Roy Hill and screenwriter William Goldman have pulled together a supremely entertaining period picture that caters to contemporary sensibilities to this day. It is to their credit that the film remains true to the characters and never gets too broad during its quickly paced 110-minute running time. The story naturally revolves around the legendary outlaws who robbed banks at the turn of the last century. Their escapades are divided roughly into three sections in the film. The first is the introductory set-up where their opposite yet complementary personalities are established. Leading the motley Hole in the Wall Gang, they ultimately pull off a train robbery with an excess of dynamite. The second part is an extended chase sequence where Butch and Sundance are chased relentlessly by a group of unknown bounty hunters.<br /><br />The third and final part details their escape to Bolivia where they are determined to go straight but get caught up with local bandits and find their infamous past catching up with them. It seems inconceivable to have anyone other than Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the title roles. As the more established star at the time, Newman is characteristically laconic as Butch. His innate likeability is enhanced by his rascally manner and crack comedy timing. In the more traditional gunslinger role, Redford provides the ideal partner with his flinty manner and unavoidable charisma. In between them is Katharine Ross, fresh from \\"The Graduate\\", who plays Etta with sensual &eacute;lan, though she does not figure in the most critical scenes. Of course, Burt Bacharach's instantly recognizable musical score is here, and while there is an anachronistic feel to such 1960's-sounding pop music over a western, it somehow works because the attitude of the film seems so modern. Even the comically romantic bicycle sequence manages to preserve its buoyancy thanks to the inane but undeniably catchy \\"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\\".<br /><br />Conrad Hall's vibrant, burnished cinematography deserves special mention as it has been preserved well in the 2006 Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD package. The rest of the two-disc package is robust though bordering on overkill, adding on to the features that were already included in the previous 2000 Special Edition DVD. Retained from that edition is the interesting combination of perspectives provided by Hill, Hall, lyricist Hal David and associate producer Bob Crawford in their joint commentary track. New is separate and equally insightful commentary from Goldman. Another holdover from the previous edition is the forty-minute vintage documentary, \\"The Making of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid\\", a still terrific featurette from 1970 with participation from Newman, Goldman, Hill and Redford.<br /><br />There are three new documentaries - a 2005 retrospective look at the film called \\"All of What Follows is True: The Making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\"; a fact-check featurette called \\"The Wild Bunch: The True Tale of Butch & Sundance\\"; and the somewhat repetitive \\"History Through the Lens: Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid: Outlaws Out of Time\\", a cumulative effort which combines elements of all the other documentaries into one ninety-minute feature. Lots of great insight is provided on the 1994 interviews with Newman, Redford, Ross, Goldman and Bacharach. A deleted scene is also included with Hill's commentary (since the audio had been lost) - it is a disposable transitional scene where Butch and Sundance are watching newsreel footage of themselves in a Bolivian theater while Etta quietly leaves to the train station.

Well worth another look if you haven't seen it since it first came out.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|Soy un fanático de Rush desde principios de los 80's y por supuesto tengo todos sus discos. Para mí COUNTERPARTS es uno de sus mejores discos, por supuesto el mejor de los noventa. Todas las canciones son sets cortos donde se demuestra a las claras por qué les llaman power trío. La producción es fantástica, con muy buenos arreglos de guitarra; estamos de acuerdo que es probablemente la mejor sección rítmica del rock pero también es verdad que al pobre LERXST le tenían desde MOVING PICTURES bastante en la sombra y aquí consigue desmelenarse bastante; esos riffs heavymetaleros son tremendos. Por destacar una canción ANIMATE (que significa lo mismo en castellano que en inglés). La pena más grande que tengo es que no los voy a poder ver tocar en España (no porque no tenga ganas, sino porque se retirarán antes). <br />

0596009208|5.0|As an entry level software engineer, I can safely say that this book was a MUST-HAVE for me.

The use of diagrams and examples makes this book stand out above other text-heavy books. <br /> <br />I would not consider myself a fast reader, but I blew through this book in 3 weeks, reading every page and completing every excercise.  I only wish that I had read this sooner.
B00005JOQS|3.0|I love comic book movies, but this one just didn't do much for me.  At almost 3 hours long, I was expecting much more.  Brandon Routh did a great job as Superman and Clark Kent, and I was able to buy Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, but Kevin Spacey was a little too over the top as Lex Luthor.  He came off too much as a \\"bumbling genius\\" and the film never really portrayed him as much of a real threat.  In fact, the entire Lex Luthor plot could have been removed from the film entirely and it would not have made too much of a difference.<br /><br />This film is mainly about Superman's five year absence from Earth and his relationship with Lois Lane and her son.  There are a lot of scenes of Superman defeating various crimes and people cheering, all of which has been done before in the previous films.  The only new take on this we have are better special effects.  Now I know you have to show this in a Superman movie, but there was nothing that jumped out at me to give me that inner excitement and say to myself \\"wow, awesome!.\\"<br /><br />While not a bad movie, \\"Superman Returns\\" just doesn't live up to the hype of 10 years of production and a huge budget.  There are too many plot holes, too much camp (Lois Lane's son kissing superman on the forehead when he's sick...), and not enough of a villain.  This movie really could have done better if Bryan Singer had demonstrated more weakness in Superman.  Where's the suspense if Superman is never really shown in danger?<br /><br />Ultimately, most general audiences will enjoy this film and I am glad I saw it, but I don't have any interest in sitting through it again or owning it on DVD.  But if you're expecting this to be one of the best films of the year and you've been waiting to see it for a decade, you'll likely be disappointed.
B00005JNRY|4.0|The Pixar team has infinite creative brain cells. They are an always-in-evolution machine, capable of providing us with the most unimaginable but amazing stories. Every Pixar movie is an exercise in universe creation, and Cars is not an exception.<br /><br />This is a world populated entirely by automobiles. No drivers, passengers or people; their windshields are eyes, their grills are mouths.<br /><br />The protagonist is a hotshot rookie race car named Lightning McQueen, an arrogant who thinks he doesn't need anyone but himself to conquer the world (and some trophy called The Piston Cup). With him, we get very early, that this is the story of how McQueen will learn what's really important in life.<br /><br />\\"Cars\\" is about enjoying the journey, not getting fast to the destination.<br /><br />While McQueen is on his way to the final showdown in California, he gets lost and ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs where he gets sentenced to community service. Eventually, the hotshot befriends the \\"weird\\" locals, who will teach him exactly what he needs to learn; the importance of having friends to support you, the loveliness and charm of small-town values and the most important one: how shallow and meaningless are the notions of fame and prestige.<br /><br />That a coveted trophy is -after all- \\"just an empty cup\\".<br /><br />Cars have that Pixar/Disney charm and good vibe, but it doesn't capture the emotional resonance offered in their past films. The animation looks amazing, showing us how vast and unforgettable the world can be. It's good and it entertains. It has heart and spunk. But it's just not enough. Maybe it's because the storyline is not that original, maybe it's something else. But it's certainly a lovely movie, and one hell of a ride.
B00009UW0N|5.0|When John Carpentar got the job of directing a horror picture for Irwin Yablans, he had no idea that it would launch his career.  HALLOWEEN did not redefine horror, that title goes only to select few, but it did rejuvinate it.<br /><br />Basically everyone knows the story, but for those of you who don't, I'll keep the summary simple.  A mental patient escapes, and stalks and kills teenage babysitters on Halloween night.  That's all there is to it, but what Carpenter did effectivily is he created a tension from the very beginning and kept it till the end.<br /><br />The acting is very good in this movie, better than would be suspected in a horror movie.  Jamie Lee Curtis is very believable as the virgin, and you root for her throughout the film.<br /><br />In Anchor Bay's 2-disc release of Halloween for the 25th anneversary of the film, they came out with great bonus features.  A feature length audio commentary with John Carpentar, Debra Hill, and Jamie Lee Curtis.  Carpentar's commentary is clevar and interesting.  I was looking forward to Jamie discussing the movie, but she didn't really add any interesting comments.<br /><br />The making of feature, which lasts 87 minutes, is very informative on all the hard work that made this picture great.<br /><br />Overall, Halloween is an above average picture.  The mood, the acting, and the music are all excellant.  The story was weak, but that does not in any way hurt this film.  We had seen the story before in Pyscho.<br /><br />John Carpentea's Halloween is a film not to be missed.  He has created a very entertaining horror movie that set the standard for the next 25 years of horror.
159413023X|4.0|They say that a ghost remains tied to the world of the living either to avenge its death or to comfort those left behind. The heroine of Alice Sebold's haunting, sweet novel \\"The Lovely Bones\\" isn't out for revenge, but her ties to the living family and friends make debut an amazing, uplifting story.<br /><br />Susie Salmon is dead. On a day like any other, she was raped and brutally murdered by a seemingly harmless neighbor, who hacked up her body and buried it. Now she exists in a surprisingly simple and pleasant heaven, watching her family and friends after she vanished, and watching their lives unfold even after hers has ended.<br /><br />Her parents cling to hope that even though a lot of blood and part of an arm has been found, that Susie is still alive. But eventually, they must give up hope. Susie watches the police investigate her death, while her father pokes around to find out whodunnit. And just as importantly her family and friends stumble through the various stages of grief, trying to deal with a horrible, senseless crime that has touched each of them.<br /><br />When someone is kidnapped and/or murdered, the news usually focuses on the criminals and the gory details. Not much attention is given to the victims and the lives they once led, or how their loves ones are dealing with the tragedy. Other books would be self-conscious or miserable dealing with that kind of story, but \\"Lovely Bones\\" is something very different.<br /><br />Instead, this book possesses a quiet, comforting tone and a poetic style. Sebold's writing has an innocent charm; one enchanting scene has Susie trying to make a flower bloom for her father, and filling a celestial room with flower petals instead. The only really gritty scene is the rape-and-murder, which is all the more shocking when you realize that things like this happen in real life.<br /><br />Susie herself is a truly unique character, a narrator completely removed from the events she describes, and yet so wrapped up in the people she loves, and has left behind. And Sebold explores the many characters as they go through the grieving process, with different thoughts and actions as they try to deal with it. The parents, the siblings, the teachers, and even the kid who was enamored of Susie.<br /><br />Alice Sebold's \\"Lovely Bones\\" shocks you at the beginning, and spends the rest of the book drying your tears.

Right off the bat, I liked the tune - I thought what a cool and breezy song for summer.  She was also on Jay Leno last night (June 28) singing her new song, and did an awesome job.  I remember watching Norah Jones first appearance on the Tonight Show, and saying, \\"This girl is going to be big,\\" sure enough Norah's first CD was a Grammy award winning album.  I see big things happening for Corrine Bailey Rae too - it's great to hear some new and refreshing talent in today's music scene. <br /> <br />
B00005JOX6|5.0|I went to see Click because I am a big Adam Sandler fan. I've seen most of his movies and I always enjoy them. This one was no exception. Adam Sandler dilivers big time. The story is about a guy named Michael who is stressed out do to work and other things. He thinks that work comes before family. One night he goes to Bed, Bath and Beyond. He gets this universal remote that he can use to pause, fast forward, rewind time. It seems too good to be true at first and everything really works out for him. Later, things get awful and time keeps fast forwarding autiomatically and things get crazy for him without even knowing what happened. This movie gets sad at the end but mostly it is a funny movie that everyone will enjoy. Go see this movie fast!
B00005JOQS|5.0|Superman is, indeed, always around in different forms.  Some of us who loved the Christopher Reeves' Superman expressed reservations about this latest version.  There is no need to be concerned.  Brandon Routh takes a few scenes to get used to but ultimately was quite good and fits well into the mythic pantheon of Superman.  He is a young Superman and though very handsome his appearance is not perfect.  In some shots his nose looks a bit large for his face and his eyebrows distractingly thick; from other angles he has the perfect profile.  This does not detract from his screen presence, quite the reverse; it created an interesting tension as to how he would appear next.<br /><br />The story is well-crafted and provides the right touches at the right times.  Superman has never been quite so human; he is clearly moved and tears come to his eyes at a key moment in the story.  His devotion to humanity is conveyed by his gentle touch--he very tenderly and slowly sets rescued victims down, commences to fly softly without excess noise and fuss.  This makes his feats of speed and strength by contrast even more astonishing.  A wonderful moment is when a villain shoots him in the eye and we are shown a close-up of the bullet flattening on his retina--a special effect applauded with glee in the movie theatre.<br /><br />Superman is a superhero of contrasts--he has several moments where he uses all his strength and needs human aid but quickly recovers.  Yet he can be stern.  When he pursues a particular villain he cracks the earth when he touches down.  His flying scene with Lois Lane, while manifestly erotic, does not overplay the moment leaving you wanting more.<br /><br />Casting Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor is a masterly touch.  While it seems like Spacey plays this role with consummate ease, he nevertheless provides the right touch of supercilious villainy to keeps the role from being a caricature.  Kate Bosworth as Lois is fine, she neither captivates nor annoys and there is reasonably good chemistry between her and Superman.  Eva Marie Saint provides a charismatic Martha, unfortunately we don't see enough of her.<br /><br />In sum, all you can expect from a good summer movie--action, suspense, romance and a surprise ending.chemistry between her and Superman.

B000053VAZ|5.0|I LOVE this movie. It is one of my favorites. When I first heard of it I thought it was going to be corny and just another boring movie. But I couldn't have been more wrong. The charactors fit so well together. Johnny Depp, as usual, is amazing as Sam. And the people who play Benny and Joon, Mary Stuart Masterson and Aiden Quinn, did a superb job. I think it is absolutly worth buying. I watch it over and over again.

055357342X|5.0|I thought I had finally closed the cover on my last fantasy book and would thereafter move onto more \\"mature\\" reading.  The genre had worn itself out--I thought I was just too old for it.  These books, however, are surprisingly sophisticated.  The difference is the approach that the author takes to his story.  Instead of a plotline with a single hero, the story is told from the subjective points of view of many different characters. It focuses much more on character development than I have usually seen in fantasy. The characters' perceptions are often inaccurate or at odds with each other. A character does not turn out to be what another character thinks he is. My own perceptions of the characters were also constantly shifting as a result.  In a more typical plot, I would subconsciously know that the hero, whatever the odds, would make it through, so long as there were additional pages to go--otherwise the book would just end. In Song of Ice and Fire, since there are so many \\"heroes,\\" the author is free to kill them off, and does so.  Good people don't necessarily triumph over evil ones. Or their triumph turns out to be temporary. Or they fail miserably. Or their plans are delayed, go nowhere or switch directions. The plot is completely unpredictable. It is difficult to figure out who is good and who bad. In fact, no one is truly either, and each character has its own, carefully delineated personality. In other words, much like real life. I was grateful that (at least so far) the facile use of magic to facilitate plot hasn't played a significant role, and that no sappy, overly simplistic romances have developed. (Due the Harlequin romance covers, I had expected it at every turn, and wrongly predicted a number of outcomes as a result.)  My biggest complaint was that I couldn't seem to focus on anything else when I was in the middle of one of the books.  Reading fantasy novels is, after all, frivilous and immature, and there are much more important things to do.   <br/>
B000062XGD|5.0|This is one of the best films of loss, personal journey and redemption I've ever seen! <br /> <br />Tom Hanks clearly deserved the Oscar for best actor of 2000 that year.  Faced with the challange of having to act through most of the movie with only himself, a volleyball and the brutalities of nature, he pulled it off miraculously. <br /> <br />From the moment he is stranded on that deserted island, you're there with him, feeling every pain and every frustration he feels.  You feel every joy and every sense of excitement when he finally cracks that coconut open and when he finally creates a roaring fire.  How good that cooked crab must taste! <br /> <br />When Hanks develops his personal relationship with his volleyball, Wilson, suspension of disbelief is not necessary.  You buy all of it, because you only need to image for a moment the madness and the yearning to talk to someone (or something) one must have to endure to survive on an island for four years. <br /> <br />

1400062756|5.0|Like many middle school teachers I struggle to motivate my students every year.  That struggle grew into The Middle School Archive Project described at [...]. Now, reading Dr. Dweck's wonderful description of what every middle school teacher faces every day in class also shows the way to re-frame what we are doing with the Archive Project. It fits!     The Middle School Archive Project involves students writing stories from their lives, as well as their goals for the next 10 years, into a letter to themselves. They seal it into a self-addressed envelope and place it into a centrally located vault in the school just before graduating the 8th grade.  They then return in 10 years to reopen their letter and speak with the then current students about what they would do if they were 13 again. The message of working for change must dominate.    The foundation to the Archive Project is a growth mindset, but it had not been so expressed.  \\"Mindset\\" provides a way to better describe what is being done through the Archive Project. The studentmotivation.org web pages must now be rewritten to reflect more directly a growth mindset.     Hopefully the Middle School Archive Project can be another of the many forces helping ALL teachers and students move toward obtaining the \\"growth mindset\\" described in Dr. Dweck's masterpiece. If this happens then the world of education will enjoy a sustained revolution in achievement.
B000002B1M|5.0|From a lyrical standpoint, this album is probably one of the best of all time, superior in that area even to illmatic (although that album probably had better production). It's a pure old school street album though, everyone will not be able to appreciate it.

B000ESSTKG|2.0|I ordered the import SACD version (shakes fist at Rhino) I guess US audiences do not merit the SACD release. Shrug. Regardless, I'd like to comment on the sound quality of Music for the Masses. <br /> <br />First of all, true remasters take the 2-track master, bring it into a mastering studio, and work from there. Don't expect a remix from the multitrack, although the 5.1 mixes obviously have to be remixed from the multitrack, unless they take the ultra cheap way out and synthesize a surround mix out of the 2-track master. Anyway, I'm not commenting on the surround mix. This is strictly about the stereo remaster.  <br /> <br />With today's mastering technology, working on something that is 20 years old noticeably improves the sound quality - regardless of delivery format, CD, SACD, whatever. You're going to hear the difference. The Violator and Speak & Spell remasters benefitted from the remastering. Music for the Masses... not so much.  I don't think this is the fault of the mastering engineer, I suspect this is simply the best they could do with the material. Overall, and I'm speculating here, it sounds like early digital. Somewhere along the signal path it sounds like it has been irrevocably committed to an early digital technology. <br /> <br />Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of digital recording, but some early systems really didn't sound so great, and this is a big reason why digital adopted an early reputation of sounding rather harsh. This release really sounds like that kind of technology in the original recording, and if that is the case, all the mastering kung-fu in the world isn't going to make it sound appreciably better.  <br /> <br />\\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" should sound huge. It doesn't. It sounds pinched. And flat. Some of the quieter songs revel more detail. You can hear the reverb on the kick drum of \\"The Things You Said\\" more clearly, for example. Every sample edge is clear on \\"I Want You Now\\", due to the increased average level. It is the 'big' songs that seem to suffer: \\"Strangelove\\" sounds pretty much as it did before, but with less dynamic range, and less punch.  <br /> <br />I'm really looking forward to Black Celebration, which I feel is Depeche Mode's worst-mastered album. However, from my experience with other remasters from that era, I'm afraid the quieter details, like reverb, will become overwhelming when mastered to today's standards. A new stereo remix is really warranted under those circumstances.

B000F1IQN2|4.0|Despite the revenues that his films have produced, I believe Steven Spielberg is very overrated as a moviemaker.  It took me years to watch \\"Jurassic Park\\"; and when I finally did, it has to be one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.  Like the Emperor with no clothes in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, apparently no one has had the guts to tell Spielberg that it is t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e, but it is.  It makes the \\"King Kong\\" movies look brilliant by comparison.  Also, his movie \\"Gremlins\\" has got to have given little kids horrible nightmares for years.<br /><br />With respect to \\"Munich,\\" however, it was beautifully done.  When it was released, I did not wish to see it because I deemed it too political and depressing, although I watched it finally.  Spielberg is to be congratulated.  This and \\"Schindler's List\\" are the two finest films that he has made.  He dealt with this subject eloquently.<br /><br />For every action, such as the killings in Munich, there is generally a reaction; and one message of this film is that such actions and reactions go on and on, and assume a life of their own, and never stop.  Also, the world of international espionage is murky at best, and truth and justice are often in the eye of the beholder.  Families are torn apart, and honor is illusive.<br /><br />Spielberg paints an opaque picture, closer to the truth than is comfortable for many people.  It was worth waiting . . . and watching.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This Is NOT The Soft Bulletin Part 2, what its is brilliant      The Flaming Lips found even more fame with breathtaking \\"The Soft Bulletin\\" they now found themselves more in the spotlight than ever before, and people were now expecting the band to repeat this a second time around.      So how do you follow up the level of expectation of a follow up to the instant classic that was The Soft Bulletin? Most other bands would crumble under the pressure of trying to surmount such a task; The Flaming Lips are not like most other bands came back with this, which is every bit of good as a its predecessor.        With an Album Title like \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots\\" and a concept of a young Japanese woman battling pink robots hell-bent on destroying the earth, you would be forgiven for thinking, dear god that is one of the most pretentious concepts, EVER, thankfully its not, as pretentious as it sounds.    As soon as \\"The Test Begins Now\\" is uttered it  you know that this is going to be something different (but its The Flaming Lips, so different is to be expected). The song that follows is a bittersweet track of losing the one you love to another man, and the feeling that you didn't do enough keeps her.     That is but one of the many fantastic tunes that are on the album the title track \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots\\", is a great fun tune, I particularly love the kinda cheesy lyric, \\"She Gotta be strong to fight them/ so she's taken lots of vitamins\\" \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots Part 2 \\" is one of the greatest instrumental tracks that I have ever heard.      For me the highlights of this album has go to be \\"Do you Realise??\\" which a bittersweet song dealing with the beauty of the world and dealing with something that we will all have to face, death. The simple lyrics \\" do you realise that every one you know some day will die/and instead of sayin all of your goodbyes/let them know that you realise that time moves fast its hard to make the good times last. So simply written but so beautiful and moving and defiantly puts you in touch with your own mortality. It extremely refreshing to hear a song about such a grim subject matter that's not all doom and gloom.     This is a master class in how an album should be made, it fun, sad, quirky. The lyrics written by Wayne whilst somewhat out their at times, still manage to hit a chord.  This is just fantastic, fantastic stuff.   The soft bulletin was all about cramming as much sound into one song as possible, this is a much mellower affair. The Flaming Lips have done the impossible release a follow up that is on par with \\" The Soft Bulletin\\".     What makes this all the more remarkable, is that this album is the 11th that The Flaming Lip 11th release, like a fine wine this band are getting better with age

0345350499|5.0|If you read this book, it will ruin all other Arthurian books for you. Why? Because this book is simply the best one of all. It is masterful, compelling, heroic, and tragic. And the story angle is completely different than what you've read before. This is one of those books that just stays with you forever, and one that you will re-read several times. <br /> <br />The book is narrated by Morgaine, Arthur's half sister. Think you know Morgaine? Think again, my friend.  Marion Zimmer Bradley's Morgaine is unlike anything you've seen before. She is dignified, loving, selfless, sometimes troubled and vulnerable, but not a shrinking violet. <br /> <br />So how does this book differ from the other Arthurian works out there? For one thing, the Merlin/Talisman is sort of in the background. This version focuses on the motives, beliefs, and actions of the women behind Arthur's throne: <br /> <br />MORGAINE. Arthur's beloved half sister and a priestess of Avalon. She is torn between her duties in Avalon and her duties in the \\"real\\" world. Steadfastly holds to her Avalon beliefs, but is knowledgable of the new religion (Christianity) and tolerant of it. <br /> <br />VIVIANNE. Arthur and Morgaine's aunt, oldest of her three sisters, and the powerful High Priestess of Avalon. She is the woman to whom Arthur and his father owe their respective thrones. She raised and trained Morgaine on the island of Avalon.  <br /> <br />IGRAINE.  Arthur and Morgaine's mother, second of the three sisters. Underneath that placating and docile surface, she is clever and a bit self-serving. Basically a kind woman, but wasn't exactly a loving mother. Doesn't much care for Avalon.  <br /> <br />MORGUESE.  Arthur and Morgaine's aunt, youngest of the three sisters. Cunning, cruel, frighteningly ambitious, and only interested in the magic of Avalon for what it can do for HER. Interestingly, she was more of a mother to little Morgaine than Igraine ever was. Unfortunately, whatever love she has for anyoneis overshadowed by her lust for power. <br /> <br />GWENHYFER. Wife of Arthur. Starts out as a sweet, timid girl and grows into a fanatically Christian, intolerant woman. Hates the old religion of Avalon, thinks of Morgaine as a \\"witch\\". She falls in love with Lancelot (son of Vivianne, and cousin to Arthur and Morgaine)  before she ever meets Arthur. She remains in love with Lancelot and becomes his lover.  <br /> <br />There are more characters of course (male and female) but these are the main ones. Their motives and stories intertwine and intersect throughout the book.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend (in fact, I beg) that you read this book before watching the mini series they came out with a few years ago. The mini series is nice in terms of costuming, action, etc., but they change around a few things and of course they left a lot out. (which I understand, since a movie can only be so long)
0440180295|4.0|A 2006 Summer Reading List - Mini Review <br /> <br />Kurt Vonnegut experienced the atrocities of the fire bombing of Dresden in World War II. He was sheltered in Slaughterhouse-Five (A meat processing plant) during the assault. In the same way I and all his other readers experience The Dresden Bombing, WWII and the surreal in his novel Slaughterhouse-Five.  <br /> <br />Billy Pilgrim is the main character an aptly name observer of the human condition. Vonnegut takes his subject seriously by not taking his subject seriously. The book is a crazy jumble of Pilgrim's travels in war, space, and time. It does not hit you immediately, but amid the craziness, Vonnegut is making solid points about the absurdity of war.  <br /> <br />This is a funny and thought provoking book worth several readings. <br /> <br />
B000002JR8|5.0|No time for pretty tunes, harmonies or power ballads. Thank God the \\"Power Metal\\" days are gone. Just after the great \\"Vulgar display of power\\", Phil and co. realized that they were, lacking better words, true displays of power. Up to date, this is still in my opinion one of the heaviest mainstream albums made in the last 15 years. The mainstream is here because most of the heavy music is still being made underground and it has to wait some time before coming to everybody's knowledge. I know that \\"Grammies\\" are not much of a reason to catalogue something as very good, but in this case they are. The sense of rage, the lyrics, the music, they are simply amazing. I always liked Pantera since \\"Vulgar...\\", especially because of the vocal change that Phil Anselmo made, running away from those Manowar kind of screams. And \\"Far beyond driven\\" tops it all. Songs like \\"Use my third arm\\", \\"Slaughtered\\", and \\"Strength beyond strength\\" are real head banging pearls. For those that like to listen to perfect musicmanship, Vinnie Paul is the master on those hellish drums and Dimebag (R.I.P., man!!) is an experimentalist, fleeing from those standard solos some guitarists play, taking distortion one step further and creating an amazing sound landscape, sometimes raw, sometimes atmospheric. Rex Brown is very discreet but don't think this means absent. Just listen to \\"Good friends and a bottle of pills\\" to see how important he is in Pantera's groove. And Phil is at his best, screaming poems, of sorts, that are impossible to be dissed ranging from society criticism, to personal relationships, to (always) controverse opinions. If ever there was an heavy metal album that is food for thought, this is it. Just a last reminder: don't forget to check the lyrics. And don't forget to own this.

Told in flashback, the film recounts how five individuals on the wrong side of the law hook up to steal a multi-million dollar cache of cocaine from a docked vessel.<br /><br />Led by former Los Angeles detective turned bad guy, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Roger \\"Verbal\\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockey ((Kevin Pollack), and Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), proceed to their rendevous point and begin executing their plan of action. Their foray into this million dollar drug heist turns bad almost immediately. Something or someone is afoot who does not want them to succeed, and who seems to know their every move.<br /><br />The story is told in flashback by \\"Verbal\\" Kint, a club footed, crestfallen, soft spoken, unlikely looking criminal. He recounts the details of the doomed heist to hardnosed Detective, David Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri), building his story around an almost mythic, Hungarian crime lord named Keyser Soze. As \\"Verbal\\" details what happened, the viewer is mesmerized by his compelling narrative of how he and his partners in crime were inveigled into attempting this daring heist, which ultimately led to the disastrous events that culminated on the ship. It seems that their heist was probably destined to be doomed from the start, as another agenda may have been paramount to theirs.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey won a 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his low key, ingratiating portrayal of \\"Verbal\\" Kint. Gabriel Byrne also gives a compelling performance as the cop who ended on the wrong side of the law. The rest of the cast also give stellar performances, with the exception of Benicio Del Toro, who gives an odd, marble mouthed performance. Notwithstanding this, the film is really a splendid tour de force that is sure to captivate the viewer. Who is the mythic Keyser Soze? Watch the film and find out.o is the mythic Keyser Soze? Watch the film and find out.

B000ESSTL0|5.0|Technology is moving forward and who wouldn't love to have their favorite albums remastered?  This is genius!  I hope they plan to have each of their albums redone in this manner.  The true prize is the DVD.  If you appreciate viewing intimate interviews with the songwriter, producers, musicans, and other key players as well as an insight into each track and how they came about, this is a must have.  Best of all, the DVD features current interviews of Alan Wilder and for those who appreciate his past contribution to Depeche's music, it is certainly a treat to see him again. I did heed the advice of others who suggested purchasing the import. A great addition for collectors and fans of Depeche Mode.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|After all those months of propaganda activits spreading negative hype on Brokeback Mountain, the movie is still standing, and finally, society has embraced it, and transformed itself to make sure the tragedy within the movie never occurs. <br /> <br />Why you may ask? <br /> <br />Because Brokeback Mountain is more than a Gay Cowboy Movie. It is a romance movie that protrays humanity's best and worst. As you will see in this DVD, this movie is made from the soul and actually means something, as oppose to all the action movies that use action to hide a lack of understanding in humanity and arts. This is the movie of a lifetime, and if you do not see it, you will be sorry.

B000EULJLU|3.0|I've been a Tool fan for a while, and was pretty much foaming at the mouth when I learned of a new CD. When I bought it, I was let down a bit. Others have highlighted the CD overall, so I'll leave that be. I think one of the main turnoffs for me is that 10,000 days does sound a lot like Lateralus, and maybe a bit too much like Lateralus. For the best example, I point to Vicarious. It is a good song, but it reminds me too much of Schism. It has similar riffs and some of the same movements within it. In small ways it sounds like they just dissected Schism, changed a few things around, and put it back together in a different order, different notes and chords, and new lyrics. Granted, the whole cd does not sound like Lateralus. I personally couldn't get over the resemblance though. Maybe a few more listen-throughs and I will think differently.

1592400876|4.0|How amazing it is that someone wrote a bestselling book about punctuation!  Truss brings the language to life, describing the peculiar evolution of grammar rules with a tone of curiosity above pedantry. <br /> <br />Did you know that an ill-fated raid just before the Second Boer War was triggered by a punctuation mistake?  That it's possible to change a love letter to hate letter with only punctuation changes?  That only Americans always put punctuation marks inside closed quotes?  That there is a general rule that possessives of ancient names ending in 's' end with apostrophes, while modern ones add an extra 's'?  (Think of \\"Achilles' heel\\" and \\"Lynne Truss's book.\\")  That Truss thinks the New Yorker uses far too many commas?  Such examples of the uses, misuses, triumphs and defeats of punctuation appear on nearly every page and keep the book fresh and fast-paced. <br /> <br />But the book is not without flaws.  The author's rallying cries about greengrocers' misplaced apostrophes and the movie \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" are repeated often enough to overshadow the freshness and novelty of the book's other vignettes.  And the small size of the book, large font, ample margins, and generous spacing mean you'll finish reading when you've hardly begun. <br /> <br />The book closes with Truss's musings on the future of punctutation.  She bemoans emoticons and delights in the fable of the Strunkenwhite virus, which prohibits people from sending ungrammatical email.  She leaves her readers with a sense of anticipation, maybe even excitement, as to what will happen to our language next.
B00005JNJV|4.0|To really appreciate Chris Nolan's \\"Batman Begins,\\" one has to also understand two other things.  The first is the character of Batman, his core and the continuing appeal.  The second is Hollywood's dawning comprehension of how to make a superhero movie.<br /><br />As to Batman (or The Batman, if you like), his enduring appeal has always been based upon his nature: tortured, borderline psychotic...and DARK.  From his earliest days, the selection of the bat costume and motif, his preference for working from the shadows, and his utter grimness, were intended to strike FEAR into the hearts of evil doers.  Unfortunately, the backlash against dark, morbid comics in the 50's led Batman's publishers to \\"lighten\\" him up.  Garish colors replaced the shadows, Batman became a daylight figure in Gotham City, and the stories became downright silly.  It was THIS thread that Hollywood picked up on the 60s during the 1964-66 \\"Batmania\\" craze...but it had NOTHING to do with the original concept of Batman.<br /><br />Unfortunately for all concerned, however, the Batmania craze sold a lot of toys and other licensed materials...so it was only natural that when Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" debuted in 1989, the Warner Brothers licensing people would again look to sell oodles of toys and other assorted goodies.  But Burton's vision, while taking distinct liberties with the Batman canon, was nonetheless dark...and tykes were scared by the movie.  They were even more rattled when \\"Batman Returns\\" came out and Danny DiVito was gobbling raw, bloody fish.  Thus, the studio honchos put down their corporate feet and said \\"No more...you're alienating Mommies and ruining a perfectly good money-making enterprise...let's get back to movies that kids will like so we can sell toys.\\"<br /><br />That was (as it had been for the two latter sequels of the Superman movie franchise) the death knell.  The resulting movies were awful and, while the five year-olds might have been entertained, older movie-goers stayed away in droves.  It was not until the first Spider-Man movie debuted that the studios got it: leave the movie-making to directors and writers who respect the core material, and you will sell movie tickets AND toys.<br /><br />So the suits got out of the way, and in their place entered Chris Nolan, a director who respected the source material, and one who had a vision of the story he wanted to tell.  Batman's origin, the death of his parents as the event that dictated his path in life, had been told more than once. There was no need to go back there again, and Nolan wisely chose to almost gloss over that part of the story, and focused instead on how Bruce Wayne BECAME The Batman...and THAT was a story that had NOT been told before.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Nolan's depiction of the birth of the Batman was almost told in real time.  The film is half over before Batman even makes an appearance...but what a first appearance it is.  This Batman IS shadow...this Batman IS terror.  This Batman IS a criminal's worst nightmare.  Inspirationally eschewing the third person POV, Nolan has us see Batman as his opponents see him...or rather, as they DON'T see him.  The impact is palpable.<br /><br />For his part, Chris Bale, the latest actor to don the Cape and Cowl, also has an obvious respect for the legend he has taken upon his shoulders.  There are no winks, asides or clever remarks.  This Batman is all business.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is magnificent, with the glaring exception of Katie Holmes, an \\"actress' whose least egregious sin is being just too darn young for the part she is portraying.  Add the facts that she has little talent, no range and little expression, and you have Nolan's one true miscue in the movie.  The rest of the casting, however, is sheer genius.<br /><br />This is a movie for both fanboys and casual viewers alike.  Geeks will get goose bumps watching the origin of all the Bat-toys told for the first time ever, and less involved viewers (IF theycan sit through the first half of the film) will find themselves glued to the edge of their seats as a truly memorable story is told.  In this movie Batman truly and finally BEGINS, and it is very good to have him back.viewers (IF they can sit through the first half of the film) will find themselves glued to the edge of their seats as a truly memorable story is told.

B00005JOQS|5.0|Bryan Singer is possibly the best person to take the helm of a comic book film.  His direction brought heart to X-Men and X2, which Brett Ratner just destroyed with X3.  Singer treats Donner's vision of Superman with respect and heart.  People I know are complaining about the speed of the film and there not being enough action.  This is Superman we are talking about.  The original was a slower paced movie than other's because it didn't depend upon action, but heart.  My one complaint in the whole film was Lois Lane, played by Kate Bosworth.  She lacked entusiasm for the role and had very little chemistry with newcomer Brandon Routh.  All other roles were perfectly cast for the film.  Kevin Spacey's Lex Luther is very close with Gene Hackman's with the sense of humor, and at the same time, menacing evil with Lex's superiorty complex at play as well, surrounding himself with people of obvious stupidity.  And he seems to be having a great time doing it.  This goes right back to Gene Hackman's Lex.  Parker Posey's airhead Kitty was a great comic relief in the film and as funny as all get out.  Sam Huntington plays the overly eager Jimmy Olsen, played much like Marc McClure's Jimmy.  And finally, Brandon Routh as the Man of Steel himself, Superman.  He steps in with confidence the role that was defined truly by Christopher Reeve and does a great job.  While he looks a little too skinny in the suit itself, he pulls of the job very well.  But where he excells is in the role of Clark Kent.  He looked so much like Reeve, it almost scared me.  And he even had the mannerism down perfectly, right to the arching of the eyebrows.  He clearly had done his homework.  And finally we come to Singer's direction of the film.  While the look is different from the first two, Singer clearly captures the feeling of the series.  And the special effects just blew me away.  The one problem with the story is that the best action sequence happens early on in the film, and the end is a little bit anti-climatic and drags on for ten minutes longer than it should have.  But beginning and ending the film in the manner of the first two was a brillant stroke of genius that won me over and made it feel as if I was a kid again.  By the way, if you stay for a little bit of the ending credits, the film was dedicated to Christopher and Dana Reeve, which made those who are true fans of the original two films applaude.  Superman Returns stays behind only the original film and Batman Begins in the great comic book films of all time.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool's last album was lateralus, a masterpiece that is so good i sacrificed a goat to the gods that are tool for making my life even more complete by making such a fine work of art. After hearing this album, i thought it wasn't possible for tool to create another album that even broke the same plane of creativity and innovation as lateralus. For what seemed like an eternity, i awaited tools next release. I put a drop of my own blood in a jar every day untill the new album, and placed it in my tool shrine in my room (i went through four jars!!). Every night i prayed to maynard james keenan that he would be so generous to give the world even just one more tiny shred of his everylasting genius in his next album. Well this year when the album came out i can say my prayers had been answered. I got the album the day of its release, but i waited untill the weekend to listen to it so i could expererience it the way i should: alone and naked in my room with no light but the candles of my tool shrine. When the album finneshed, I had to vomit because i was so overwhelmed by it's staggering brilliance. tool had done the unthinkinkable, they had surpassed themselves to create the single greatest collection of sounds ever composed. i quickly put hot coals on my ears because i knew that they were unworthy of the greatness they had just heard. tool's album is so ahead of its time. i feel like tool could very well be a band from the future that come back in time every six years or so to enlighten people of the past. that's how innovative their music is. much of the songs on their new album are long repetitive droning noises that change very subtely and slowly. thay are so long and unchanging that you literally have to will yourself to listen to the entire song. why no one has ever thought of doing that before is beyond me because it's so perfect. tool is challenging to turn off your stereo and stop listening because only the worthy can understand them. only if you listen to one of the 17 minute songs straight through and attempt to hold your breath for the majority of it can you truly appreciate what tool is doing. everything tool does/ has ever done is perfect. tool could defocate on a plate and it would be the greatest single thing ever done. thats how good they are. i would let any member of tool sleep with my wife just so i could be closer to them. to all of you who say tool is boring or not fun to listen to or that they sound the same in every song or that they are cruel to their fans for making them wait years fo only decent cd's, i've got news for you, you're wrong. dead wrong. music isn't supposed to be \\"cool\\" or \\"enjoyable\\" or \\"pleasant\\". it's supposed to be innovative and unique and that is what tool is. tool is the greatest thing that has ever happened to the world. their new album can't be bad because they can do no wrong. they are infallible. i am a tool fan and this is what i believe.

B00003CXB2|5.0|Robert Harris spent two years assembling the restored version we have been so graciously bestowed with only too recently.  there was no original negative even... only hacked and re-hacked-hacked for/from TV versions.  he had to go thru hundreds of negatives in order to restore the full, theatrical + uncut + widescreen version... editors never seem to get credit where there is SOOOOO much we owe them, ESPECIALLY IN THE EDUCATED DIGITAL ERA WE EXIST IN TODAY.   <br /> <br />having said that, i can now feel free to speak on the work itself.  David Lean, i thank you for being alive.  Peter O'Toole, thank you for putting your all into this film... et al.  /bow <br /> <br />this is the tale of actuation of the soul and the spirit of man.  it is treacherous and yet as desolate and bleak as the desert.  the man and the desert are one, before they even meet... they collide like a spiritual highway pile-up.  This film is the closest i've ever experienced to capturing the universalism ideal and also the concept of man breaking the boundries and freeing himself in order to allow the explosion of actuation occur.  while dealing with all this weight, he finds that the same door opens to the horrifying reality of human carnal lust.  Lawerence exists with his fear of truly finding himself only to find that he loses himself at the same time; becoming enlightened and elated but only to find that he can view it with a detached heart... the macro and microcosm of true being. <br /> <br />a man finds a thing only to lose it.  and in losing it, has he ever known having had a thing. <br /> <br />please excuse my feeble attempt to express what this film reveals.  i am only a man and these concepts are better felt than explained. <br /> <br />if i could give one thing to mankind and have them all understand like i wish they would, it would be this film. <br />and so, i leave the rest of you...

B00005JOQS|4.0|The Man of Steel is back!  Superman Returns is visually stunning, taking advantage of all the latest technology to make the story believeable, the settings real looking and true to the comics.<br /><br />More than that, the film recasts the hero in the mold set by Christopher Reeve.  Unlike the Batman films, where there is no continuity of character after Batman Returns, Superman Returns does as good a job as possible of picking up the story where it left off with the last Christopher Reeve film, at least in terms of the Superman character.  In the film moreso than the promotional material, Brandon Routh bears a striking similarity to Mr. Reeve's Superman.  He even sounds like him and did a great job of copying Reeve's Clark Kent twitches, eyebrow-raises and awkwardness.*<br /><br />There is no continuity with the rest of the characters.  Kate Bosworth, as Lois Lane, is cute but lacks the sassiness of Margot Kidder's Lois.  Frank Langella's Perry White lacks the crabbiness of Jackie Cooper's portrayal.  Jimmy Olsen is, well, still Jimmy Olsen.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is a great villain and does a fine job as Lex Luthor.  He's brilliant and clearly evil.  But his portrayal lacks the charm and fun brought to the part by Gene Hackman.  Perhaps this is the script and not the actor.<br /><br />All in all, Superman Returns is darker, less light-hearted than the previous Superman films.  Gone are the one-liners and bits of comic relief.  In their place are more pieces of the love quadrangle between Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Superman and Lois's current love, Richard White (Perry's nephew.)  Lois, now a mother, has her heart tugged in three different directions after Superman returns (thus the title) from a five year hiatus from planet Earth.<br /><br />Superman Returns is a fun film.  Though darker, there was little killing (mostly bad guys being crushed by heavy objects.)  It may not be appropriate for smaller kids, but it is family-friendly if your children are older.  One caution for those with more traditional values: Lois has a child out of wedlock and lives, unmarried, with Richard.  That is presented tastefully, however.<br /><br />*[While Routh's recreation of the Christopher Reeve Superman is masterful, it may be a detriment to his career in the long run.  Rather than bringing his own interpretation of the character to the screen, Routh simply imitates -- again, probably what the writers, director and producer wanted -- Reeve playing Superman.  He's good at it, to be sure, but it is hard to imagine what he has shown to people looking at him for another (non-Superman) part.]older.

B000002513|5.0|'The Wild,The Innocent & The E-Street Shuffle' is Bruce Springteen's second release,from 1973.It's also,if not his very best releases definately the top two and one of pinnacles as an artist.\\"E-Street Shuffle\\" is a funky groove,a lot of fun and points out what makes the E-Street band so great at this early point-David Sancious.His keyboard work can be playful (such as on that song or simply beautiful and flowing such as on the reflective \\"4'th Of July\\" or just plain good as on \\"Incident On 57'th Street\\".These songs are character skethes-mostly happy ones and Bruce also goes a little deeper into his journey to musical success.Although from the sound of things Bruce possition as 'the new Dylan' is just hype-he couldn't be a different singer-he's gutteraln yes-but also gushes out wordplay a lot faster-he imparts more information in the time given and it's a lot-most of these songs are over five minutes.This album has two big highlites-\\"Kitty's Back\\" and \\"Rosalita\\"-on these songs the 'E Street' sound was born.It's all about classic rock n' soul here,you can dance to them,get into Clerence Clemonds sax or just listen to the wordplay-two of the greatest songs written just about a couple girls!\\"Wild Billy's Circus Party\\" has a great tuba solo and is very celebratory and he leaves the best for last with the winding \\"New York Serenade\\"-a lenghy story song for sure.Yes this music has a lot of ideas and styles packed into it but the character tales he weaves so well are done mostly for the fun of it this time out.But mainly these songs have a lot of soul and a great fun rock n roll kick-back to basics all the way,as well as being coyly funky here and there.When people refer to this is being one of Bruce's masterpieces THAT isn't hype-it's the truth.So if you want to get into more Springsteen after 'Born To Run',go no further then the E Street shuffle!
B0009W5K0Y|3.0|All we know is falling is a decent cd. I'm not quite sure it's worth the 14 dollars but it isn't that bad.  <br /> <br />The only way I can think of describing the songs on this cd is like taking butter and churning it. Yeah, it's a weird description but that's what it reminds me of... it's like, thick. <br /> <br />Haley has a great voice to listen to and considering they're aren't very many bands in the whole emo scene with female vocals, this is something new and better to listen to. It's not whiny rock, but don't expect loud guitars and screaming.. it's a really mellow cd. <br /> <br />Although the songs tend to blend together after a while, the last song has great lyrics and really stands out. I loved it.  <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Jamisonparker or the forecast you'll more than likely love the cd.

B000002KIK|4.0|Picking up right where \\"Technical Ecstacy\\" left off Black Sabbath continued to experiment more on \\"Never Say Die\\" with their tonality, style, and songwriting. In someways this is what makes \\"Never Say Die\\" such a success, but in other ways when they fail to pull it off it sounds bad. Let me explain: <br /> <br />The guitar tone on the record is very light compared to other Sabbath songs and it works well on the upbeat opener but on the other heavier songs like \\"Shockwave\\" and \\"Johnny Blade\\" it doesn't give them the power that the song needs. It doesn't deter from the greatness of the songs due to their catchy riffs but we can only imagine how much better the heavier songs on the record would have sounded if the tone was a little different. It seems at this point in Black Sabbath's career Toni Iommi was trying to create a better balance between melody and heaviness. After two failed attempts at this he definitely got it right on \\"Heaven and Hell\\" but not here. <br /> <br />Although you don't find the same degree of experimentation on here as you do on \\"Technical Ecstasy\\" you definetely find a much better group of songs. The only song I don't particulary care for is \\"The Hard Road\\". The rest of the record is pretty solid up till \\"Over to You\\". I do like how it switches from a hard number to the chorus replete with a beautiful piano crescendo, however the song is a little boring and wears on you after a while. The horn drenched instrumental that follows and the Bill Ward number \\"Swinging the Chain\\" aren't particulary interesting either, more filler than anything else. But excluding those songs you find some of Black Sabbath's best work like \\"Air Dance\\" which is my favorite Black Sabbath song. Actually, it is more like a mini epic in the vein of \\"Dirty Women\\" than a song. First it starts out with a tasty blues jam and then switches headfirst into a beautiful and dreamy acoustic melody, switches to an incredible jazz improv at the end (with an incredible trade off between Iommi and the keyboard player) and ends with a haunting fade out at which you will never be able to shake off. Another great number that must be mentioned is \\"Junior's Eyes\\". For starters it has one of rocks greatest bass riffs ever and Iommi's wah-wah drenchted guitar sound is demanding. But the greatness of the song lies in its lyrics. Sadly, the only people that will probably truly appreciate the song and those who lost a loved one at a young age. <br /> <br />I seriously don't understand when people are hard on this record. It definitely isn't a \\"Paranoid\\" but it is what it is--a band that is stretching its bounds and experimenting. If they hadn't they would be making the same record over and over. If you want \\"Paranoid\\" again then maybe you should by a second copy. Appreciate it for what it is and it will mean more to you.

The Old Man's War is an amazing new look at an old theme, defending humanity against aliens and the cost to the humanity of the men and women fighting for homo sapiens.

No, not 18, not 21, not even 16.  75 years old and not a day younger.  This sets the tone for a thinking mans look at warfare and its alienating efffects on the troopers sense of moral behavior.  An AMAZING first novel, I cannot wait to see how this writer develops.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|S.O.A.D get better and better with each and every album. One thing about SOAD i find is that each album sounds different to the other, but keeps the SOAD sound, if that makes sense. The experiment, keeping there music fresh and new. <br /> <br />Hypnotize (part of a double album with Mezmarize) is a briliiant addition to the SOAD track list. This album, at first sounds a little different to anything they've done, but you'll quickly hear SOAD in there. This is deffiantly not the hheaviest stuff they've done, instead going down a different route. There's planty of heavey songs on this album, but not like with the first two. But, you listen to the songs, and realise how wonderful they are. <br /> <br />I can';t recommend this album enough. SOAD are the best band on the plannet by far. They are thought provocative, and fresh all the time, as well as experimentalwhich some bands are scared to do, and many fans don't like, rather listening to similar sounding songs.  <br /> <br />SOAD... geniuses... MUSIC GODS.
B00005JOQS|4.0|This is, if nothing else, a Superman fan's film. \\"Superman Returns\\" begins with an updating of the cosmic opening credits sequence from the 1978 Richard Donner film, and proceeds with two and a half hours of nods to nearly seventy years of Superman tradition. There's homage to just about every incarnation of the Man of Steel's deep oeuvre, and they still manage to fit a story in between the throwaway lines and the cameos.    \\"Superman Returns\\" chronicles, well, the return of our caped visitor from another planet after an unexplained, five-year absence. I'm not sure \\"I had to go see the remains of my dead home planet for myself\\" would hold up well to close scrutiny as an excuse for vanishing without so much as a word, never mind the hard-to-miss overlap of Clark Kent's absence from work visiting llamas, but the filmmakers don't dwell on it -- they just get it out there and get back to the story.     Newcomer Brandon Routh fills the updated uniform admirably, if not with the stunning ease of Christopher Reeve. Unlike George Reeves, whose TV portrayal of the dual character differed mainly in attire, Routh's predecessor on the silver screen managed to be both Superman and the mild-mannered Kent, so much so that he didn't need the change of clothes to switch roles. His most masterful performance came in \\"Superman II\\" when, still in Clark's sweater, Reeve pulled off the glasses, stood up a little straighter, and straightened his jaw and brow to become the Man of Steel. Without a spoken word, a ripped-open shirt, or a phone booth, Reeve transformed.    Routh, on the other hand, is a far better Superman than he is Clark Kent. Early production photos really didn't do justice to the way the newcomer has stepped into the role of the Man of Steel. His stance mimics that of the vintage comic art even better than Reeve's, and his mop of windswept hair seems to land effortlessly with the trademark curl across his forehead.     Routh's rooftop scene with Kate Bosworth as Lois Lanemarked the first moment I believed her in that role. She's the most clearly too young, of the ensemble, to have just had five years go by; Sam Huntington, playing the fresh-faced Jimmy Olson, is older. Worse, she suffers the movie's biggest lapse in continuity -- she doesn't appear to be injured, even a little, by her rattling experience aboard a Boeing 777 that NASA's using as a launch pad for an experimental shuttle. (My suspension of disbelief isn't that generous.) The actress, who reportedly modeled her portrayal on old Katharine Hepburn films, was more convincing as concerned mom and deserted lover than as intrepid reporter. I hope she has a chance to grow into this role and flesh it out in an upcoming film.    Bryan Singer, whose regular video blogs at Bluetights.net marked a refreshing change of pace from the usual tight-lipped production, clearly loves Superman, and obviously respects the franchise and his role in continuing the legend. His reverence shows in everything from the inside jokes to the generous use of Marlon Brando's lines from the '70s and the musical tributes, throughout, to the last set of films and their John Williams score. I think that's one reason this feels like just one episode of an ongoing story. I'm looking forward to the next episode.
B0002858YS|5.0|I have bought the album \\"Hot Fuss\\" just so I could listen to the song \\"Somebody Told Me.\\" But when I listened to it, I was listening to all the other songs instead of the song that I cared to listen for! The music is so unique and I can't get enough of it! I can't explain to you what the music sounds like; I guess it's a little bit of rock/pop.  <br />What really makes this band special though is that it's for everyone. My friends AND their parents listen to The Killers. For once I can have my mom stop telling me that my generation of music is all a waste! So yeah, you've probably heard the radio hits now; if you like what you hear on the radio, then go by the album. It's as simple as that, because you'll get more great songs that aren't even played; you're missing out.  <br />
B0001L3MI0|1.0|I stopped watchng after half an hour.  The screenplay is literally unrecognizable to those who have read the novel - I am frankly surprised that Richard Ford let this movie be made at all.  Far worse even than \\"Adaptation\\" on that account. <br /> <br />Worse still, no sign of the Bruce Springsteen title song anywhere on the DVD.  What a total ripoff.
B00005JOQS|5.0|Superman has always been my favorite superhero but lets face it. Christopher Reeve might have looked the part, but the old movies were so cheesy and dated it left you wanting something more real. Smallville is ok but the storyline is messed up, and other super hero moives coming out recently have rocked. But Superman still comes out on top and while i believe a few events have been changed (I am not a fan of the comics) the true essence to the Superman mythos is still there and Brandon Routh is a better Superman then anyone else I've seen so far. Tom Welling may be a good clark kent/farmboy but I could not imagine him being a good Superman like this guy. Everything about this movie rocked. The storyline, character building, realistic special effects that left you breathless. This movie soared!
B000002UA2|3.0|One of Floyd's lesser inspired albums, Obscured cannot be faulted too much due to the soundtrack nature, although it will always be difficult to stomach some of their poppier stale songs on this one. This is pretty much their dullest early recording (yet to hear another earlier soundtrack \\"More\\" though)  although unlike the later much bemoaned post-Waters era stuff, the songs that aren't straightforward ho-hum rock can truly begin to formulate some of the electronically melodic induced beauty that was to shortly engulf this and much of their other material with next year's Dark sided triumph.
B000000OR9|5.0|John Sykes, Tony Franklin, and Carmine Appice are all world class musicians.
B00005JLF5|4.0|Star Trek's third full series, Deep Space Nine, was in many ways an anti-Trek. For starters, the main location is a space station, not a ship of exploration. The cultures come to the characters, not vice versa. Most importantly, this show is as likely to end on a downer as it is to have everything resolved. The view of humanity is generally dimmer and the world of the previous Treks, formerly so optimistic and utopian, turns toward its darker side. Yet the characters are also warmer and more human than on many Trek series, with understandable flaws and neuroses, and their conversations are wittier. All told, Deep Space Nine, even at this early stage, is considerably more entertaining than concurrent Next Generation episodes.  <br /> <br />Deep Space Nine has a far stronger opening season than The Next Generation. The plotting moves at a faster pace than your average Trek, mainly because there isn't a whole lot of phony technobabble in the way. Twists come fast and furious, with striking regularity. The frequent conflicts among the characters also draw a contrast between previous Treks, where harmony between the principals was the rule. Their sharp exchanges keep the energy level up and keep audiences enthralled. <br /> <br />Highlight episodes include Emissary, the pilot. The strongest of all Trek openers, it introduces the show's heady and satisfying stew of action, politics, and religion with a typically exciting plot. Also entertaining is Dax, a typically satisfying trial episode that is perfect right up until an unfortunate deus ex ending. Progress pits former resistance fighter Kira against her own conscience. The unquestionable highlight of the season (and one of the top 2-3 of the series) is Duet, an electrifying and sometimes terrifying meditation on war crimes with an excellent performance by journeyman actor Harris Yulin. With more plot twists than you can count on one hand, very well-written dialogue, and a compelling point, this episode entertains and disturbs simultaneously. It's as good as anything The West Wing ever cooked up. <br /> <br />Whether you love or hate Star Trek in general, Deep Space Nine is worth your while. If you hate Trek, you'll find that it counteracts most of the franchise's worst tendencies. If you love it, you'll enjoy a change of perspective. Either way, take a look. Recommended, now that the price has dropped.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Since Metallica came to South Africa and I saw them Live, I'm making every effort to listen to their S&M (and watching Cunning Stunts) to get some more Metallica live.  I just can't get enough.  I want to cry when I hear this masterpiece.  They are just so amazing and I'll pay a fortune and make myself broke just to fly across the world and see them again.
B000003BF4|5.0|I was fortunate enough to have seen The Stones on the 69 tour.  Saw them @ The Inglewood Forum in LA.  They were two hours late for the show but did they ever make up for it.  Get Your Ya Ya's Out is a perfect history of the tour and of the era.  The boys were definitely in great form and were playing like there was no tomorrow.  The guitar solo in Sympathy For The Devil is one of the all time great solo's by anyone.  Every time I get a new car, the first song I play is Sympathy from Get Your Ya Ya's out.  I also have Liver Than You'll Ever Be and it is good.  Especially Gimme Shelter (Waitin on you) and I'm Free.  I only wish it was availabe on CD and cleaned up a little.  The movie is great but not enough music.  This is the album to have and to hold till death us do part.
B000002LRX|5.0|Personally, my favorite album from my favorite band. Unfortunately, I'm too young to have had the plessure of experiencing Faith No More when they were together. This was the first Faith No More album I purchased, and after listening to it and the other Faith No More CD's I've come to have more appreciation for the genius and complexity of albums and songs. This CD and Faith No More in general is the perfect example of just how, for lack of better words, \\"awesome\\" and \\"entertaing\\" music can be. <br /> <br />Land Of Sunshine - 5/5 <br />   One of the first songs I've heard on this album prior to purchasing it and one of the best ones on it. Good fast-paced beat with a great range of vocals throughout. The fortune cookie and self-help lyrics are a joy to listen to <br />Caffeine - 5/5 <br />   One of the more aggressive songs on the CD. Heavy rhythm that you can really get into. <br />Midlife Crisis - 5/5 <br />   Probably the most popular and and most mainstream song on the album, but for good reason. This song has FNM's press-titled \\"rap-metal\\" beat and lyrics in the beginning, which perfectly changes into a more alt-pop chorus. <br />RV - 5/5 <br />   This is hilarious, but just a good all around song at the same time. Crazy lyrics and a rhythm that transitions from a slow narrative to a faster, louder chorus. <br />Smaller And Smaller - 4/5 <br />   Another good heavy song with Mike's \\"Pattonted\\" growling scream. <br />Everything's Ruined - 5/5 <br />   Tied with From Out Of Nowhere as my favorite Faith No More song. Everything's Ruined simple has everything. It starts off with Patton's slow, moody voice, which       transitions into a heavy metal chorus, which again transitions into melodic singing with incredible background instrumentals. This song is truly an epic that must be heard. <br />Malpractice - 4/5 <br />   A straight up aggressive song with some crazy guitar riffs and a nice surprise in the middle. <br />Kindergarten - 4/5 <br />   A semi-slow, semi-heavy song with some enjoyable aution lyrics in the background. <br />Be Aggressive - 3/5 <br />   Not a bad song, but one of the few Faith No More songs that never really grew on me. Some interesting lyrics however. Oh, Roddy, and your crazy lyrics, :) <br />A Small Victory - 5/5 <br />   Another incredible and epic song that really adds to the variety of the CD. Great melodic guitar throughout and incredible vocals. <br />Crack Hitler - 3/5 <br />   Another good song, but one that I never really gave enough attention. The more I listen to it the more I like it though.  <br />Jizzlobber - 5/5 <br />   A pure heavy, aggressive, and loud song. Quite a treat for the metal fans. It's another good song that adds to the variety of the CD. After listening to this song and backing up only two tracks, you can understand the complexity and variety of this album. <br />Midnight Cowboy - 4/5 <br />   A perfect ending for the perfect CD. This slow instrumental song just fits as the conclusion to this CD perfectly.
B00008NRI8|3.0|cute though predictable romantic comedy. <br />(the plastic pieces that hold the disc in place were broken)
B00099BRUO|4.0|Este es finalmente el esperado Ultimo Album de Manowar. De entrada, quiero decir que me parece muy dificil que algun album posterior supere lo que considero el mejor album de la banda: Louder Than Hell, pese a ello este es un album muy interesante. Es cierto que tiene varias interpretaciones de otros artistas, y temas instrumentales, pero esto no va en detrimento de la musica, ademas creo que son muy buenas ejecuciones realmente. Call To Arms es el tema inicial, y realmente a uno le llena de alegria de haber comprado el disco al escucharlo, es como decir: \\"Dejense de mariconadas, llego el verdadero metal Guerrero!!\\". Vienen algunos temas melodicos y algo de Paz con Nessum Dorma, Valhalla no entiendo porque es incluido como tema, parece mas bien una intro. despues un tema con mucha pasion como lo es \\"Swords in the Winds\\", Y con \\"The March\\", me pregunte si no habia vuelto de su mismisima Tumba Richard Wagner!, Me remite en mi memoria a Pasajes de las cabalgatas de las walkirias, del citado compositor clasico del siglo XIX. Monstruoso tema, con esa musica, uno queda convencido, que \\"hoy es un buen dia para morir\\". <br />El tema del nombre del album, es muy Manowar, con lo cual me gusta mucho. Los otros tres temas finales no me merecen mayor comentario, y le bajan una estrella a mi calificacion. Creo que estan poco inspirados, un tanto reiterativos. me imagino que intentan seguir la linea de Outlaw y The Power, pero en esots dos temas del album anterior, hay poder y alta velocidad, con melodia. <br />Conclusion, el album es una experiencia innovadora y refrescante, recomendado si queres disfrutar de musica heavy con pausa.
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|They enjoy playing it and people seem to enjoy listening, which makes everything alright.  After all, imitation is the highest form of flattery, it is said.  I just hope the original bands from the early '70s eventually get their due royalties from the Wolfmother.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|They've inducted that Macolm Mclaren money-making hype \\"punk\\" band the Sex Pistols into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame (McLaren's other great creation was Bow Wow Wow) who arrived two years after the CBGB thing in New York in '74 (Brit kids seeing the Ramones on tour was far more influential on the punk scene there than anything the pistols did). Those laughable geezers Black Sabbath have been inducted (though they had their moments in their early albums). Even Billy Joel is an inductee (thanks to the evil & damned for eternity Jann Wenner)!! But neither the Stooges nor Iggy are to be found listed; their first album came out in 1969, which would have made them elegible in 1994; 12 years of tripe. A lot of people need to get a lot of hate mail for this omission. Then again, perhaps NOT being in the R'nR hall of fame is the last sign of integrity as this genre of music truly dies a slow, ugly, painful death (see \\"alternative\\" music since the early '90's leading to the likes of Avril Levine or . . . or any other \\"serious\\", \\"sensitive\\" \\"hip\\" whiney, over-hyped, worthless bands these days).
B000EGCITG|4.0|Pink may not have reached the heights she did on her second CD, Missundastood, but she comes close.  <br /> <br />Her lyrics again our straight to the point and speak of something besides sex, rare in pop music today. The track, Stupid Girls, is something that needs to be said, though I wish she hadn't 'become' a stupid girl on the video. Where are the young girls in this country who want to be more than objects?  <br /> <br />The CD also contains quite a bit of profanity. A wise man once told me that an intelligent person could express themselves without resorting to profanity. It's a lazy shortcut. <br /> <br />Overall, however, a good work by Pink.
B000002INJ|5.0|Este Album de Manowar, creo que es consagratorio, temas tocados con mucha furia, como Whells of Fire o Hail and Kill, con Eric exigiendo su voz en forma certera y en los momentos adecuados. Temas ademas epicos consagratorios, que nos remiten a antiguas leyendas nordicas envolviendo al oyente en un verdadero clima guerrero.  <br />Temas melodicos muy bien ejecutados, en resumen, heavy de alta calidad. No me gusta mucho el solo de Bajo de De Maio, pero creo que apunta a mostrarnos que es muy veloz... <br />Altamente recomendado.
0767834739|4.0|Anyone who has watched \\"The Claim,\\" with Milla Jovavich, and then the \\"Resident Evil,\\" movies, would have to shake their head a few times and say, Is this the same actress?  Well, yes it is.  And I like both.  In the Claim, a retelling of Thomas Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge, you see MJ give a performance that should of at least netted her an academy award nomination (and she can sing!).  But the Academy, being the sink hole it now is, ignored that wonderful movie and the performances in it.  Fast forward things a few years, and Milla is kicking tail in better than Tomb Raider style.  A business decision on MJ's part?  Who knows?  But Hollywood can be cruel to women as they age.  For my money, it's clear MJ can do anything, and if B-movie Superchick is her choice, then enjoy the ride.    Resident Evil: Apocalypse is the kind of movie that critics hate, and movie goers love.  It's fast, it's furious, and don't try to make much sense of it (Example: the motorcycle crashing through the church window.  But hey!  It LOOKED great!).  Devil dogs, zombies (very lame ones, who fail the Romero zombie shuffle test), evil corporate scientists, and a band of heros out to save a little girl.  That's all you probably need to know.  This particular chapter of the RE series is probably closer than the original as far as aping the game, with various moments in various rooms where something hideous awaits.  As genre work, this movie is pretty good, with one star missing due to zombies being used as only background noise. Check it out!
B0000027RL|5.0|Okay, fist off Pearl Jam is NOT Nirvana so stop compairing them.  Second, this is one of the greatest albums to ever be released and the love each single, and subsiquently the band, recieved proves that.  Singles like 'Evenflow' and 'Alive' pushed this band out from under a rock and into the mainstream so we all could enjoy it's brilliance.  From the creepy love song 'Black' to the angry lyrics to 'Jeremy' TEN as a whole pushes the envelope and delivers one solid -one-two-punch that will leave the listener begging for more.  Even the not so recognized tracks like 'Ocean' and 'Deep' are pricless.  Out of every Pearl Jam album released this would have to be their most famous, and rightfully so for collectivly it is truly thier best effort.
B000000OSE|1.0|ZERO STARS ARE MORE APPROPRIATE AS G'N'R ARE REALLY AN AWFUL BAND.NOVEMBER RAIN AND DUST'N'BONES SUCK!!!!!.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS AWFUL ALBUM.CONSERVE YOUR MONEY AND GET STICKY FINGERS FROM THE ROLLING STONES INSTEAD. <br />PS:G'N'R ARE TERRIBLE,G'N'R ARE TERRIBLE.
0679882820|5.0|Very fun book.  I would say kids from the age of 4 to 6, maybe 7 get a kick out of it.  This book keeps getting passed around in my family, it's cute.
B000059LGC|5.0|Although may be David Suchet (the also british actor responsible for the superb Granada released Poirot Series) is more like the real Poirot, this movie with Ustinov is a Masterpiece!, with all stars cast.  Excelent, enjoyable, to be viewed once and again, look for details on the sets, actors, go over again some brilliant dialogues, etc. <br /> <br />An excellent introduction to the Agatha Christie's works and movies, to be enjoyed with the family.
B000803PKY|5.0|It was worth the wait for the release, the sound quality for the album is fantastic. Crisp highs, excellent bass. I highly recommend.
B000000W5N|5.0|STICKY FINGERS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS FROM THE STONES FEATURING BROWN SUGAR ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK SONGS EVER.BUY THIS AND AVOID CD'S BY DIRE STRAITS,G'N'R AND NIRVANA.
B000002L80|4.0|By the time Little Creatures was released, Talking Heads were pretty much a household name.  With the success of songs like Burning Down The House and the Stop Making Sense movie, the Heads had been propelled into the spotlight. <br /> <br />David Byrne's quirky demeanor, slightly skewed lyrical style, and the Heads' forays into world-music are a great combination that came together to provide us with a wonderfully crafted album of not-average-but-still pop. <br /> <br />The pop influence was evident in Speaking In Tongues, but definitely takes a front seat here.  That's not to say this isn't a great Talking Heads album.  It is.  It may be their last truly great album.  There's no I Zimbra here, no Seen and Not Seen.  This isn't the same Heads music that broke new ground several years ago.  It is, however, the cream of the crop as far as pop music in the mid '80s goes.  There are some great songs here, even in addition to the already well-known \\"Road To Nowhere\\" and \\"And She Was\\".  Check out \\"Perfect World\\" and \\"Walk It Down\\". <br /> <br />If you want a recommendation on some great Talking Heads music, check out Fear of Music or Remain In Light.  If, on the other hand, you're looking for some great '80s pop music with a bit of a twist, by all means pick up Little Creatures.
B00003CX96|4.0|An excellent film with really funny scenes of growing up in the 70's. For a Brit of 31 years I grew up on films like this so this is my view of the U.S., probably a little rose tinted, but I don't care. <br />If you liked American Grafitti, E.T., Stand By Me, The Goonies, Etc you'll love this, and if you like cycling you'll really love it as it has some great stuff, a nice Masi bike and the 70's Cinzano team riding. Plus drafting behind the team lorry! <br />Even my wife loved it and her eyes usually glaze over within 5 minutes of cycling films.
B000A6CLL0|2.0|Season three of Enterprise is one of the primary reasons the show was cancelled.  Ratings dropped during this season and the announcement of the show's cancellation came before the superior season 4 could save it. <br /> <br />The problem with season three is that nearly every episode deals directly with the Xindi threat.  Long story arcs have happened in Star Trek before, such as the Dominion Wars in DS9.  The problem with the Xindi arc is that there are too few \\"change of pace\\" episodes.  Having three out of every four episodes about the same stroyline is boring.  There was not enough variety in this season.  It became quite redundant and I was quite happy when it ended.  Plus, there was no real suspense.  It was obvious that Earth was not going to be destroyed, so the outcome was not enough to keep one on the seat of his/her pants. <br /> <br />Season 4 was much better, but unfortunately couldn't save the show.  The idea of shorter story arcs was excellent, given the poor ratings they got in the previous season.  These mini-arcs were somewhat unique in the world of Star Trek, but worked much better than the mega-arc that was season 3.
0060853964|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of it, truly couldn't put it down.  It was recommended to me by a terrific friend, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />As always, shipping from Amazon was faster than expected; all-in-all, a good experience.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I remember hearing Dookie when it first came out.  It's hard to believe that was over 10 years ago now.  Even back then people were complaining about how Green Day had \\"sold out\\" and was no longer a punk band.<br /><br />I can agree with the argument that they are no longer a punk band.  If they were, chances are I wouldn't even give them a listen.  The issue of \\"selling out\\" is a lot more subjective, though, so I'm not going to go there.<br /><br />If Dookie was a great crossover album -- smart, up-tempo pop music with more than a hint of punk, then just what exactly is American Idiot?  It's the sound of three people who used to be hardcore punks doing something unusual: growing up.<br /><br />If American Idiot had been released by any band other than Green Day, it would likely have garnered even more praise than it already has.  Regardless, not every song is first class.  I seem to be in the majority since I don't care much for the song American Idiot.  Looking beyond that though, songs like Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, and Wake Me Up When September Ends are clear evidence that Green Day is a serious musical force and not just a trio of disaffected kids who managed to break through to some form of popularity by sheer perseverence.  The fact that they're here and more relevant than ever with American Idiot 15+ years after they got their start certainly earns my respect.<br /><br />By all accounts, Dookie was a great album when it came out, but in my opinion, it's simply juvenile in comparison to American Idiot.  Don't be embarrassed to be over 20 and listen to this album.  I'm not.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|In short... the extended version is amazing.  This extended version of Kingdom of Heaven is what should have been released in theatres.  Not only is the film excellent, but the extra features are extensive and very interesting.
B00005V9IL|5.0|This is probably the first movie I have seen with underwater aliens in it, plus the correct science in portraying underwater pressure and deep water darkness, excellent science prediction. <br /> <br />I give this movie 5 stars because of the well done ending. Most science fiction movies start good but completely mess up the ending, but not this one (very touching). Also, the villain is very believable, considering he is a navy seal and very pissed off. Overall, very good movie, excellent special effects (considering it was made in the 80's) and superb acting.
B000A7S4B0|4.0|Wow, nobody could have guessed this album was coming. It's a pretty amazing transformation for the band and a wonderful listening experience. They are still pissed at the world, but a little more resigned to it, thus the relaxed instrumentation and turned-down amps. A fantastic album.<br /><br />And I've put it on two computers and an iPod, so I don't know what that one guy did wrong, but it isn't Howl's fault.
0684824906|5.0|There have been hundreds of serious books written about Abraham Lincoln, so it is almost hard to imagine Doris Kearns Goodwin could offer new insights into Lincoln's life and presidency, but in fact she does just that. What seems to be original about this book is the manner in which Doris Kearns Goodwin focuses on the personal and political relationships between Abraham Lincoln and four leading officials in his cabinet, three of whom were also his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination in 1860. <br /> <br />   Doris Kearns Goodwin is persuasive in demonstrating how Lincoln's nomination in 1860 was a suprise, no less than a shock, to many people in the north, especially to William Seward, the presumed favorite for the nomination and his supporters. Seward during his first months as Secretary of State was often very condescending toward President Lincoln, but as Goodwin points out, this did not prevent Lincoln and Seward from later becoming very close political allies, friends and having strong respect for each other. <br /> <br />   Abraham Lincoln, in my opinion, is one of the greatest Americans and human beings in the world who existed in history. I don't mind at all the details of his life as presented by Doris Kearns Goodwin. Lincoln, in my opinion, was clearly our greatest president. However, he did make mistakes and Goodwin seems to gloss over the significant infringements in civil liberties that occurred while Lincoln was president.  <br /> <br />   General George McClellan, whom I have long considered excessively cautious and often incompetent in battles, especially during the Peninsula campaign near Richmond and the battle of Antietam, comes across as being virtually a traitor when he refuses to send troops to help General Pope's forces during the second battle of Manassas.  <br /> <br />    I learned a lot from this book about the lives and careers of William Seward, Salmon Chase and Edwin Stanton.I would have enjoyed the book even more thoughif there had been less details about the personal lives of Seward, Chase, Bates and Stanton.  I came away with a generally favorable view of Seward for his courageous anti-slavery positions and generally loyal support to President Lincoln. Chase, on the other hand, while to be commended for his even stronger anti-slavery positions, comes across as a mean spirited, arrogant person, as well as often not a very effective politician. It is truly remarkable given his frequent public and private criticism of the president he served as Secretary of Treasury, that Lincoln tolerated for so long his inappropriate conduct. <br /> <br />   Doris Kearns Goodwin often makes a point about how Abraham Lincoln as a young adult and well before becoming president yearned to play a great role in the history of our country, to make a difference in people's lives and to be remembered by generations to come, to make his own life more meaningful. Probably as much or more than any other American, Abraham Lincoln succeeded in achieving these desires and made the United States a noticeably better place for our people.   <br /> <br />
B0002O0CM0|2.0|The ambiguity, poetic verses and dark musical nature of the original albums are all gone here. This sounds closest in approach to the previous album \\"The Soft Parade\\" (which was still miles ahead), with all types of instruments and cheery vocals. Songs like \\"Get Up and Dance\\" sound like uninspired hippie nonsense.     I'm not the type of Doors fan who attributes all their success to Jim Morrison, but without Morrison's vocals, writing and general presence, you would never even know these albums are by the same band that brought us masterpieces like \\"The End\\" or \\"Light My Fire\\" (which was written by Manzarek - but nothing here comes close!).    Stay away, unless you're a completist.
B0000UJDLM|3.0|Good movie, but not my type. This is a science fiction, happy going, sometimes touching movie for the youngsters. The acting is not serious and the robots are not as dangerous as they are supposed to be. <br /> <br />My type is the Terminator, a science fiction movie with terrifying robots from the future and a lot of serious action. Although kids these days will prefer these types of movies.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|This movie is great, I like it better than the first Batman. But there is a minor glitch in the disc that I have. It involves the audio synchronization and it only occurs in the first chapter. The audio in the whole chapter seems to be out of sync for about half a second. It's really noticable in a few scenes. When the Penguin pulls the cat into his cage, the cat's scream is heard half a second later. Also, when his parents dump his carriage into the river, the sound of the splash occurs about half a second after you see the carriage hit the water. But the rest of the disc is fine, the actors' lips match the dialogue perfectly, sound effects occur at the exact moment an action occurs. I returned this disc, but the new one I received still had this problem. So either there's a bad batch out there, or somebody who worked on the DVD screwed up. (BTW, this review is for the 2-disc special edition)
B000002W9Q|5.0|This cd is a winner just like the movie. Patrick and Jennifer rock my world with their tender love story and \\"moving\\" music. It's not hard to watch this movie over and over and the soundtrack makes it possible to listen and visualize anytime. <br />I was a bit disappointed not to find Love Man and the song by the Contours, Do You Love Me, Now That I Can Dance. However, buy this cd without hesitation. <br />Thanks to the reviewers who let me know that I can get \\"More Dirty Dancing\\" and \\"Ultimate Dirty Dancing\\". The search is ON!!!
B000FGGE68|3.0|I have been a big fan of Milla Jovovich from her [...]kicking days in The Fifth Element so I was looking forward to seeing this flick where she plays the lead, Violet, in a futuristic world where no viruses exist except one.<br /><br />The last surviving virus was human made and causes an early death within twelve years. It also causes an abnormal canine tooth growth causing the virus to be called the vampire virus. It's very contagious and puts the rest of the human population on high alert and forced segregation. Violet is part of an underground team that is fighting back.<br /><br />The movie opens with her on her current mission. Breaking into the dictator's (played by the always exceptionally evil Nick Chinlund) fortress to steal a package. The package contains a child with an antigen and everyone wants to kill him except Violet. With 36 hours left to live she makes it her mission to protect the child.<br /><br />The action scenes are a work of art to witness but more time should have been spent on the storyline development. Cameron Bright (Birth) who plays the cloned boy was really underused and probably too talented for such a minor role. If you want to see a chick kick lots of male [...] to pieces then this is your movie.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|...if you need your music in 4/4, with a drumkit dutifully bashing away, and reliable chord changes every two bars or so. Don't buy this if you prefer stadium-friendly bombast. That's all fine of course, I'm just pointing out that you might struggle with this CD.  <br /> <br />If however, you enjoy imaginative, unorthodox compositions, with diverse instrumentation, unusual time signatures and engaging lyrics, I urge you to check out Illinoise. <br /> <br />I've played this CD a great many times over the last few months and enjoy it more than ever. So many good songs to enjoy. <br /> <br />Which brings me to my only complaint. 74 minutes is very generous, but it's really too long to create a meaningful sequence. I'd rather have a perfectly-paced 45 minutes. <br /> <br />I subsequently purchased Greetings from Michigan and Seven Swans and am equally impressed with both.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Never a fan of concept albums per se, but here's a new moniker - `Punk-Opera.' There's a novelty, right? Well, no - this is an operatic work - stunning, daringly deftly funny, and musically one of the few CDs of the year that feels it's in-the-nowness.  All in it's three-chord, aging punkster prowess.  Grandiose, without a doubt, and blatantly political, but it's ideology lives and breathes and chokes and wheezes and drums right along.  My grade:  A-
B000062YAZ|3.0|Slayer's most overrated album, definatly much better thrash acts out there, go search some up.  There is really only two noteable tracks on here, which I'm sure you all know.  Every other song just blends in with the CD, and it will get boring.  My friend even believed the whole CD was one song, when I played it over his house.
B000000OUJ|5.0|this is one of the best rap albums ever made, and ranks up there with the likes of illmatic, ready to die, and reasonable doubt, all of this album is produced by RZA, and he does a fantastic job, the production is all dark, grimy, with lots of martial art movie samples thrown in, its suits the mood of the album, the lyrics are some of the best ever written, with gzas amazing metaphors, similes, and double meanings, gza has one of those voices that are unique, noone could imitate gzas voice, his delivery and timing are perfect, the albums subject matter is dark but very interesting, gza raps about the sadness and endless cycle of violence in his environment, he tells stories of shootings and stabbings and how he wishes it would stop and gives a vivid picture of the new york he grew up in, when he is not rapping about this he delivers devastating battle raps, using, as i said earlier in the review, unbelievable metaphors, similes, and punchlines, this is arguably the best wu-tang album, along with only built 4 cuban linx, and 36 chambers, and i urge you to get this if you are a hip hop fan, and if you are a wu tang fan, it is essential, if you are a fan of crap hip hop, like lil john, T.I., chingy, etc. you probably wouldnt like this, as it is not overcommercialized rubbish, with radio-friendly beats, this is definitely in my top 5 rap albums ever, and maybe the best, get it, because if you dont, you are missing out on a brilliant album <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006GAO5Y|2.0|I know many people consider this an inspirational movie. I remember seeing a group of students at school discussing just how great this movie was, how inspiring, how positive. After viewing the movie myself, and trying my best to be upbeat about it too, I never felt this way about the movie. In fact, I thought it was stinko. Seldom could I understand just what rocky was saying, since he seemed to be talking with a mouth full of ham sandwich all the time. <br /> <br />What is the basis of this story? A guy, severely outclassed in ability and experience goes up against an impossible foe. It is an old plot of amature vs pro and the amature winning. So what. There are so many movies that use this plot - outnumbered, outclassed, outeverything vs what appears to be an unbeatable foe. Many of these movies do carry this through and show how the beaten down can sometimes come back and win it all. These are the ones to see, not rocky.  <br />  <br />I do not recommend this movie to anyone seeking an inspirational movie.  <br /> <br />Joe
B00005JOQS|5.0|Bryan Singer has undertaken a potentially nightmarish gig for a director in taking on the film that is Superman Returns.  The production had a long and very well-documented road to seeing the light of day, having gone through the Tim Burton/Nicolas Cage proposal, signing and losing Brett Ratner and McG as directors, and commissioning scripts or treatments from the likes of Kevin Smith and JJ Abrams.  Singer, along with scribes Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty, goes the route of paying homage to the 1978 blockbuster that launched the career of Christopher Reeve.  \\"Returns\\" takes place five years after the events of Superman II (1980), but is set in the present.  Why? My theory is because Superman, like most of his superhero compatriots, works best when we can relate to him.  Superman (Brandon Routh, bearibng a striking resemblance to Reeve) has been gone for over five years, investigating the possibility that his homeworld of Krypton did not explode, only to return to a world that has mostly forgotten him.  Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth)is partially to blame for that, having won a Pulitzer for her editorial \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\\"  She's engaged to a sort of human version of Superman, Richard White (James Marsden, who gives a nice, subtle performance), and has a 5 year old son, Jason(Tristan Lake Leabu).  Gruff Daily Planet Editor-In Chief Perry White (Frank Langella, a nice bit of casting) is glad to see one of his top reporters return, as is Clark's (and Superman's) pal, Jimmy Olsen(Sam Huntington, who is very fun to watch).  Not everyone is happy about the return of Supes, particularly Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey, unbelievably joyful to watch), who is hatching yet another scheme.  Lex's brilliance is hampered slightly by a new bumbling gang of idiots, headed by Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski.    The real treat is that Superman Returns maintains a lighthearted quality while embracing a slightly darker world.  Superman/Clark and Lois have more to contend withemotionally, and the world does seem a bit more cynical.  In the face of all this, there's a certain whimsy to it all, helped by the recycling of John Williams' themes in a new score by John Ottman.  This Superman is more drama, and a bit less action, but the action is quite a sight.  Singer clearly has great affection for Richard Donner's vision of the Man of Steel, but while he does capture some of the qualities of the character's 1978 incarnation, there's more exploration here of the internal troubles that our hero might be dealing with, namely isolation and the need to belong.  Only at teh end of the film do we feel like these issues are resolved for Superman, in a touching twist that may leave purists in an uproar.  With the exception of Kate Bosworth, all of the actors are brilliantly cast and shine in their roles.  Brandon Routh carries some of Christopher Reeve's mannerisms into Clark and Superman, but imbues the character with a deeper sense of personal anguish when it comes to his apparently failed relationship with Lois and his undying love for her.  He is clearly a star in the making.  Kevin Spacey was an obvious choice as Lex, and he brings both humor and menace to the classic villian, conveying a wonderfully nuanced and individual riff on Superman's most iconic nemesis.    The reviews of this film have been widely divided: some love, some hate, some are indifferent.  As a kid who first saw the 1978 film, my first,  at a drive-in wearing Superman Pjs and a tie on cape at the age of 3 and a half and is a lifelong DC comics geek, I can't help but love this movie.  There are some bits that don't work, but they are brief.  The film does not achieve perfection, and it is not the definitive Superman film.  With the large mythology that has been built around the character, I doubt that such a thing could be made.  But it is to me a different version of what the Donner Superman is: a fantastical tale that breathes life into my first hero.  In my mind, it is awirthy sequel to the first two films.  I would say it is a much better film than number two, which delved into more outright campiness and lost its hero (maybe the Richard Donner cut of film 2 will rectify that).  This is one of the better Superhero films to have been made, and is worth your money if you love the characters and are willing to allow them to mature. Final grade: A
B00006AUIG|5.0|This was an awesome movie and I think its very sad that the Danvers State Hospital got torn down, it was a beautiful building, and was very historic, now its going to be apartment complexes, it's very sad.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|<br />As a fan of the franchise,after the Prequels and the 2004 edition,this is the one thing I havent on Star Wars DVD yet and was pleased at the announcement and wanted the Theatrical films that started it all, I have two sets of 2004 edition which I like, I dont need a third especially as now the Thetarical films are only presented as laserdisc transfers and as  I have to buy each individual OT film separately it isnt really worth spending my money on something I have twice over and a on bonus laserdisc transfer which is of dubious quality.
B000E8QVWY|2.0|As my name here suggests I'm more of a Sci-Fi fan than anything else but I do take in some other films when they seem to get solid reviews and I enjoy the subject matter.  Well, I do like Johnny Cash's music and felt that this movie was worth my time. <br /> <br />Nope, not really.... <br /> <br />The beginning was pretty good and had me hooked a bit, but then like most movies about musicians/bands, it fell apart and they WAY overdid the drugs and drinking. For a good hour this movie was nothing but Johnny taking pills, Johnny getting mad, June not marrying him, and finally Johnny taking more pills sleeping too long.  Thats about it. There was not nearly enough about the music, the creation of the great songs, and other personal events in Johnny's life.  The movie missed out on details that would have contributed more to the story than the cliche \\"drink too much and get enraged\\" crap.   <br /> <br />Also, the film seemed to jump a little too quickly.  One minute, Johnny and his band were really struggling and the next minute they had songs in the top 20.  I missed something here.  It is a struggle to get to the top and this was not portrayed well at all.  He magically woke up one morning and was a star.  I dont expect a two hour movie to show every little step of the way...but c'mon!  There's no drama or intrigue in the \\"overnight superstar\\" concept. <br /> <br />Still though, some of the tunes were good and Phoenix played an OK Johnny Cash.  Reese Witherspoon as June Carter was decent as well.  However, it was NOT enough to save a weak script and a plot that really didnt know what to do with itself. <br /> <br />I think this film gets high ratings simply for whos in it. If it had unknown actors/actresses in it, it would have likely been trashed.  Oh well.... <br /> <br />NOT Recommended!
0780020685|5.0|I first saw Seven Samurai in 1955 when I began my tour of duty with the U.S. Army in Japan. What an excellent way to be intruduced to the Japanese culture. What a great story. After all these years, seeing the film on DVD is like reliving the moment when I first saw Kurosawa's masterpiece in Opama, Japan. If anything, the film is even more powerful today, for as you watch the story unfold, a story unadorned with needless and flashy special effects, you realize you are watching the power of simplicity, human courage, and selfless sacrifice for the greater good of humanity. Every DVD collection should contain this release. As the poet Keats said: \\"Beauty is truth, truth beauty....\\" In my opinion those words sum up the power of Kurosawa's epic film.
B00005JOQS|5.0|The best movie of the year and I'm glad it's Superman Returns. It's been so long since Superman's gotten the glory and it's about time he did. This had everything a blockbuster needs: action, romance, intrigue, comedy and drama. I can't wait for the sequel
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Notice I didn't say right WING audience; who are these reactionary reviewers anyway, and why are they here? And it would seem obvious to me that if you don't like musicals, you probably won't enjoy \\"Rent\\"; well, DUH.<br /><br />On the other hand, I had reservations about seeing the movie myself, because I DO enjoy musicals, but am aware that they often don't translate well to film. And I never did see the stage version of \\"Rent\\"; only \\"La Boheme\\". However, this fact didn't limit my appreciation for this (film version) of \\"Rent\\", and perhaps enhanced it. The movie was far better than I expected, with its subtle wit, energy, and surprisingly good music (which beckons repeated listening).<br /><br />I do concur with others who suggest that key scenes were deleted while others were prolonged; however, the DVD provides an extra disc which includes these scenes, along with the remarkable story of Jonathan Larson's life.<br /><br />In short, I was captivated from the opening of \\"Rent\\", through the conclusion of all of the generous supplementary material. This is several hours worth, more than I usually view in a week's time, never mind an evening. I'm a bit late getting aboard the \\"Rent\\" bandwagon, but now at last I see what all the fuss was about.

B00004RFFS|5.0|This movie has style,blood,a creepy girl,stupid victims,and Tom Cruise!. It is a very well done and artisticly directed film.

B000059XUI|5.0|Terrorists have planted an atomic bomb on the Eiffel Tower. Superman arrives in the nick of time and flings it into orbit, where it explodes. The detonation, however, sets free three Kryptonian criminals who have been languishing in the Phantom Zone, these renegades having been put there years ago by Jor-El, the father of Superman. Landing on Earth, the Kryptonians discover that the earth's sun grants them super powers. Immediately, they begin to enslave the planet. To make things worse, mastermind Lex Luthor escapes from prison and vows vengeance on Supes and joins the supervillains. Meanwhile, Daily Planet reporters Lois Lane & Clark Kent are on assignment on Niagara Falls, where Lois comes to suspect Clark of being the Man of Steel. Through a freak accident, Lois finds out she is right. Now, face to face, Lois & Clark own up to their feelings for each other. To be with Lois, Clark decides to relinquish his powers. It's not until afterwards that he becomes aware of the three supervillains from his home planet, but it's too late...With no Superman to protect our planet, it looks grim for Earthkind.<br /><br />This is one of those rare instances where the sequel actually is as good as the first movie. What's even more amazing is that they got it right despite all the behind-the-scenes wrangling and in-fighting that went on between  producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind, director Richard Donner and actor Marlon Brando. The Salkinds had early on decided to have Superman I & II shot simultaneously. However, the filming of Superman I proved to be troublesome. Things got worse when Marlon Brando filed suit against the producers for failure to pay up on his profits from Superman I. Then, with about two thirds of Superman II having been filmed,  Donner, who had issues with the Salkinds, was fired and replaced with Richard Lester. Yet, somehow, Superman II rises above its makers and succeeds as a worthy sequel and a great movie in its own right.<br /><br />This time, there isn't an opening half hour of foreplay with the overbearing Marlon Brando and scenes of sterile Krypton; we get right into the pertinent storyline: the release of General Zod & co. and a powerless Clark Kent in love with Lois Lane. Not as episodic as the first one, II is more consistently plot driven. Reeve and Kidder are again SUPERB in their iconic roles. The scene where Lois finds out Supe's real identity is still one of my favorite cinematic denouements. The supporting cast, with Terence Stamp (Zod), Sarah Douglas (Ursa) and Gene Hackman (Luthor) as standouts, plays it real. The only downside with the acting for me is Jack O'Halloran's Non, who is played too much for laughs.<br /><br />The special effects are even better than in the first Superman. While certainly not up to the standards of today's technology, they still hold up well. Remember, these effects are a quarter of a century old! Special mention goes out to the fantastic and devastating battle royale of super powers between Superman and the Phantom Zone fugitives. Also satisfying is Clark Kent's revenge on a mortal bully at the finale.<br /><br />The special features are utter diddly-squat, consisting of a \\"cast & crew\\" breakdown and a theatrical trailer. You'd think there'd be at least some feature commentary or one \\"making of\\" segment. Ah, well.<br /><br />For those who yet don't know, the new Superman Returns picks up after Superman II, totally discounting Superman III & IV (which is fine by me). For great comic book action and more than a touch of romance, watch this one.

B00006AW2M|4.0|This is my favorite Stones album, I actually cant stand almost all of the songs that they play on the radio by The Stones. They werent the best live either or at least what I've heard. That does matter. Their still in my top 5 favorite bands though.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|Both the Underworld movies are great.  This one may not be quite as good as the first one...but it's still awesome.  Yes, it's a dark movie - both figuratively and literally.  (It's about vampires, so there's not a lot of picnic scenes).<br /><br />It's entertaining!
B00005NB8K|4.0|This is a great quality product and quick shipping. The movie is great depicting the era of the great rock n roll bands. This type of musical talent no longer exists in \\"today's\\" bands.
B00005JOQS|5.0|Having been disappionted with all of the Star Wars, Matrix and even the last X-Men sequels, I was concerned about this movie. Not to worry, Bryan Singer and cast more than does the job. If you loved the original Christopher Reeve movie, you'll weep with joy at this one. The depth of the characters, and their relationships with each other combined with peerless special effects will have you on an emotional roller coster. It's great to see a movie not dominated by special effects. Yes there are some quibbles about how some of the side characters are handled, but these are minor. It's just a terrific feel good movie, which we can all use today. It's even more poignant when you consider how heroic Christopher Reeve and Dana Reeve were in spite of their tragedies. I'd have to say this movie is a wonderful tribute to them. Maybe we can all be inspired to be a little better. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002KB8|5.0|The heavy rain begins, the deep roll of thunder pounds in, and then the bell sounds the beginning.  The song Black Sabbath begins and it grows like an angry man slowly filling up with rage.  There you have it ladies and gentlemen heavy metal is born.  It has been said that Black Sabbath was not the start of heavy music.  Granted I am aware of Blue Cheer, early Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and the first Led Zeppelin record.  However, the look, the attitude, the sound and the dark lyrical content all belong to the lads from Birmingham England.  Hence in my book they are forever the grand fathers of heavy metal.  Every young person who heard their music that came from broken homes, poverty, or who just felt there were real problems in the world such as wrongful wars, disease, corrupt politicians, and the hypocrisies in life felt that Sabbath were playing to them.<br /><br />This album is just about perfect; every song just blows me away every time I listen.  I consider myself a bit of a hard rock/heavy metal connoisseur, and the music plays a big part in my life.  I like every form of metal such as speed, thrash, death, glam, hardcore, industral, and goth just to name a few.  But every time I put on a Black Sabbath record Iommi, Osbourne, Butler, and Ward show me how it's truely done.  Sabbath's music still gives me chills and I want to bang my head till it rips off my shoulders every time I hear it.<br /><br />After hearing Black Sabbath's debut album one cannot think it can not get any better, but wait there is still their sophomore release to listen to Paranoid.  If a person is into any form of heavy rock that was released anywhere from 1975 to the present whether he or she is enjoys Black Sabbath or not,it is Sabbath that person has to thank every time that music graces their stereo.<br /><br />Stay Heavy!
B00005JOQS|5.0|I can now forgive Bryan Singer for ditching X-Men - possibly even he couldn't have saved X-3, but what he did with Superman Returns puts him at the top of the heap of action film directors.  Quite simply Superman Returns is just about perfect.  It has nearly everything one could want in a 21st Century incarnation for the Man of Steel and the physical production is visually as eye-poppingly glorious as anyone could hope for.  The flying scenes (especially the Superman in space scenes) have a breadth and beauty around them that almost stops one's breath - absolutely stunning.      As we've come to expect, there is great humor throughout with winks to the comic books and previous Superman flicks and director Singer doesn't shrink from paying obvious homage to the Reeve flicks - a very nice touch, indeed.  Singer doesn't shrink, either, from going for broke in the second half of the film's more emotional content and the balance between action, love story, and pseudo-religious, philosophical storyline is just about perfect.    For all the pre-opening hype criticisms centering around an unknown actor portraying comic's most beloved hero, Brandon Routh proves the naysayers pretty much wrong.  He's got the look, the moves and the feel of the character down.  If his Clark Kent doesn't quite have the presence Reeve brought to the role - (this Clark isn't quite as endearingly bumbling or nerdy) he makes Clark likeable and believable - and makes fully plausible why Lois finds him slightly forgettable.  As The Man of Steel, however, Routh takes the challenge straight on and does not once disappoint his audience.      The opening sequences setting up the story have a classic old movie feel, a bit of exposition for history, hilarious snips of Lex Luthor beginning his bid for world domination, Lois and the rest of the world moving on in the years since Superman (and Clark's) leave of absence, all culminating in a breathtaking action sequence wherein our hero saves the lives of those aboard the space shuttle - and ties it all in with America's favorite pastime - Baseball!      Kate Bosworth's Lois is a bit bristley (Lois always was) but she always let's the vulnerable quality of her character crack through the tough-as-nails exterior.      Kevin Spacey's Lex starts off with a bang, but it isn't until the sequence with Lois aboard his yacht - the turning point of the film - that he gets to fully charm us with his evil craziness.  If up til then I thought Spacey hadn't quite captured the role (as I envisioned anyway), from this point on he OWNED Lex.      Parker Posey is an entirely different creature than was Valerie Perrine.  Where Perrine was all curves and opinions, Posey is all angles and dim.  A different spin on the character, but a worthy one.    It was terrific to see Eva Marie Saint - now in her 60th year of films, in the small role of Martha Kent.  Even washing dishes or driving her truck, Saint exudes movie star quality that proves the old adage \\"there are no small roles.\\"      The movie's more than two and a half hours fly by and everyone - at least at the screening I attended - is left feeling like a kid again.      This is probably going to be the hit of the summer and well it should.  It has just about everything one could want in a first \\"return\\" feature for this superhero and I'm already excited for 2009's sequel!  See it on a big screen.  Now!
B000EULJLU|5.0|One of the best TOOL albums, on the evolution after Lateralus and re-visiting some of the strong notes from the AEnima. <br />A must buy for any Tool fan.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|This is a really nice effort from the Foo Fighters. The idea of two discs with different sounds isn't really an original idea, but FF does it really well here. The first disc has been labeled \\"loud\\" and the second \\"quiet\\". Basically, the first disc rocks just as hard as any other Foo Fighters album, and the second disc is all acoustic-based. Which disc is better is really an opinion, but it almost seems as if Dave Grohl and the rest of the boys put more thought into the lyrics and song-structure of the second disc. Both CD's have their good songs, and their bad songs, but together, they make a really great album.<br /><br />NOTE: I'm sure you have heard about the Copy Protection on this album. Yes, it is quite annoying, but very easy to surpass. If you don't mind doing a little research to find out how, then you might find the copy protection tedious.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|They are two musicians who have collaborated on numerous songs.<br /><br />The perfect guitarist and the perfect folk singer!<br /><br />Their great harmonies makes this the best CD
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Let me get this out of the way first: A Perfect Cirlce is NOT Tool. They never were, and I hope they never will be.<br /><br />With their second album, APC puts any Tool similarities far behind them. On Mer De Noms, yes, the similarities were there, especially with their single \\"Judith.\\" However, here on Thirteenth Step, they have managed to step out of the Tool mold, and create a sound all their own. Maynard's vocals have never been better, and the instrumentation is incredible. The band often uses a bizarre arrangement of instruments, but they somehow manage to pull it off. Their songs range from epic (The Package), to dark (The Outsider), to melodic (The Nurse Who Loved Me [which is a cover]), to straight-up rock (Pet). There aren't very many albums you'll find anywhere with this kind of diversity, mostly because there aren't many bands who could pull it off.<br /><br />The lyrics, voice, and music fit together seamlessly, and the album really works with a \\"concept\\" as opposed to just a bunch of singles stuck together. Some might say that there are a few \\"filler\\" tracks. This is not the case, as all the songs work towards creating a concept or story.<br /><br />Really, this an exceptional album, and one that any fan of music will be happy to have in his/her collection.
B0002O37RM|4.0|I agree with the amazon.com editorial review and with \\"Longboard Jazzer.\\"  Those who are only giving this album 1 star just aren't getting it.  The emphasis in this album is on the songs themselves, which makes this album a little different from others.  Every song is interesting and beautiful, in a subtle kind of way.  With songs like this being the unifying factor of the album, the arrangements and solos should serve to complement them - and they do.  Rubalcaba has some very fine arrangements that, again, are interesting in a very subtle kind of way.  Really listen, and you'll get it.  There is fine playing throughout that is very sensible and appropriate for the music.  Rubalcaba's playing demonstrates these qualities throughout, and I must argue that Zenon's solo on the opening track is perhaps the best on the album.  He is a player who has a lot of great things going for him.  This is a must-have... but it warrants some serious, careful listening, or else you'll miss the importance of this album.
B000EULJLU|4.0|After buying all of Tool's cd's and absorbing as much as possible from them, I bought this cd and can tell you unbiasedly that I really do like this album.  Many of my friends have stated that it takes a lot of getting used to because of long introductions, lack of lyrics, etc.  To me though, that's almost the beauty of the album.  It leaves so much up to the imagination, and music can be music without lyrics (or not many).  The bass riffs and drums i feel run parallel with albums like Lateralus.  I think if you're willing to give something new by Tool a try, this would definitely qualify.  It's in my top 3.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Brilliant album from the RHCP. Both CD's are really good & well worth the money. Great to hear new stuff from such a great band.
B000002J09|5.0|\\"Stairway To Heaven\\" ensures the album's immortality, but the mandolin-driven \\"Battle Of Evermore\\", featuring the late Sandy Denny, ensures its immortal classiness.  And if \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Rock And Roll\\" and \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" don't define the term Heavy, then the name of this album isn't ZOSO.  Or LED ZEPPELIN IV.  Or maybe just LED ZEPPELIN.  Or just 4.  Or FOUR. Or IV.
B000BVD460|5.0|1. Intro- I dont rate Intro's/Skits   <br /> <br />2. Fack- When I first heard this I really didn't know what to think. It's no where near better than past songs but provides few laughs. <br />(2/5) <br /> <br />3. The Way I Am - Of course you know this song. In where Em tells the media to f**k off. I personally love this song.  <br />(5/5) <br /> <br />4. My Name Is- One of his most annoying songs ever next to The Real Slim Shady and Just lose It. But it is was his first single and was in my music rotation to the point of I got sick of hearing it.  <br />(4/5) <br /> <br />5. Stan - Guy obsessed with eminem. Writes him. Eminem doesnt write back. Guy gets mad and drives off of a bridge with his gf in the back seat. Eminem writes guy back. Eminem realizes the guy he saw on the news was Stan. Simple plot. Great Song.  <br />(5,5) <br /> <br />6. Lose Yourself- Has a great message. To never give up on your dreams and to take an good thing when it comes to you. Also shows conflicts from the movie 8 mile interjecting with conflicts that Em was facing at that moment in his career.  <br />(5/5) <br /> <br />7. Shake That- Not really lyrical but a song to dance with your friends to.  <br />(4/5) <br /> <br />8. Sing For The Moment- One of my favorites. I love this song! Talks about what he goes through with fans/media/Kim cheating. He really puts it in a way that everyone can understand.  <br />(5/5) <br /> <br />9. Without Me - Even though It has the same formula as My Name Is, Without Me is far less anoying. I often find myself riding in my car with my little nieces going crazy, dancing to it.  <br />(5/5) <br /> <br />10. Like Toy Soldiers- Trying to stop the beef with Ja/Benzino. Shows that he is just trying to be the bigger man by stepping away. <br />*Sadly In The video the person who got shot and died was Proof of D12, who if you don't know just passed away by getting shot at a night club. R.I.P* <br />(5/5) <br /> <br />11. The Real Slim Shady- The video is amazingly funny and still cracks me up to this day. The song eeh. Okay lyrics.  <br />(5/5) <br />  <br />12. Mockingbird- A song to his daughter showing why him and Kim are not together. A really touching song, that made me wish I had a dad around when I was growing up. You can truly see that he loves his daughter. <br />(5/5) <br /> <br />13. Guilty Conscience - \\"Dr. Dre, Mr. NWA, Coming Straight Outta Compton Ya'll better make way\\" hehe. That line still cracks me up.  <br />(5/5) <br /> <br />14. Cleanin' Out My Closet- A song to his mother which supposedly ended their relationship. In it Eminem suggests that his mom suffered from Munchausen Syndrome by proxy. A mental illness that makes parents (often mothers) make their child sick / makes their child undergo painful tests to get some attention for themselves. <br />(5/5) <br /> <br />15. Just Lose It- You all know it. \\"Grab your right nut make your left one jealous.\\" Good song to go crazy to. <br />(4/5) <br /> <br />16. When I'm Gone - A song to show why he is stepping away from the mic. Because of the guilt from leaving his daughter and niece for the stage. <br />(5/5) <br /> <br />17. Stan- A live performance with Elton John. <br />(5/5) <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JOQS|4.0|OK we all know the story, so I won't bore you with 9 paragraphs. Quickly I would like to point out 3 things.<br /><br />The crime and rescue scenes are wonderful. However, none of them gave me the chills like in the 1978 film, when Superman saves Lois Lane from falling to her death off the skyscraper and also catches the helicopter at the same time and lifts it back up, as the theme song blares when he catches the helicopter. To me that is the greatest movie scene in history.<br /><br />The new Lois doesn't measure up to Margot Kidder's quirky performance. Margot was beautiful in her own way and her character is what made the character so great. Seems like Margot didn't go for the glamorous side of Lois, but focused on giving her character. Kate Bosworth seems like she would freak if her hair got messed up while flying with Superman. Yawn.<br /><br />Finally, some of the scenes from the 1978 film that showed Superman landing and taking off seemed more real. Because he was suspended on wires and there were no special effects involved. the new one totally uses FX and it looks kinda fake. They should have stuck with the wiring.<br /><br />Still, it is a great film and I can't wait for sequels.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|When I first heard S.O.S I thought that Rihanna's cd was going to be horrible. Quite frankly, S.O.S  was repetitive and made me think Rihanna was just another teen act with no talent. Then I heard \\"Unfaithful\\" and my mind changed. In this cd Rihanna works with what she has and the result is good. She has good beats and great slow jams. It is worth your money.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|The value of this movie for me was the emphasis on Middle Eastern culture and the variety of languages spoken throughout the film. If you are an international intrigue, culture or language buff, this movie will probably interest you. Otherwise, you'll probably be bored to tears. So, the three star rating I give it has mostly to do with being able to practice my Arabic! It was also kind of cool to see George Clooney speak the language.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I'm not surprising anyone by saying that this is not their best album, because it isn't. That's not saying much though. This is a great album in itself. I like to see them getting away from the sounds of Kid A and Amnesiac, great albums but definately a different sound from the previous albums. In my opinion if Radiohead had never released an album and this was their debut everyone would love this. But, as we all know Radiohead has released a couple of the greatest albums released in the recent past, with The Bends and OK computer. Final Verdict: Good Album, not their best.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Wow!! What a release. This has got to be one of the most interesting albums this year. It's Hip Hop, but then its not. It's Pop music, but then its not. What is it?? It's totally genre less. It's Gnarls Barkley. It's just good damn music. It's definitely a repeat listen. I love this album and I think anyone who enjoys good music will love it as well. It's not about genre with this album. D
B00005JOQS|5.0|Where to start? It is simply speaking phenomenal. Bryan Singer was already at the top of my list for director/producers that I admire. He's stepped it up here. <br /> <br />If you didn't already know, the movie assumes Superman: The Movie and Superman II occurred. Superman III and Superman IV did not. It is not a reinvention of the character or story. It's a continuation. If it has been a while since you've seen the first two movies, you'll benefit by re watching before you see Superman Returns. You won't miss anything if you don't have time though. It simply adds to the experience. <br /> <br />John Williams' Superman theme music remains the Superman theme. I'm pleased they didn't try to create a new theme for Superman, because Williams' theme is iconic. While creating a new score for the Superman Returns, the composer, John Ottman draws inspiration from Williams' original score and you'll catch reflections of that throughout the film. It's nicely done and I'll be purchasing the CD as soon as possible. <br /> <br />All the effects are wonderful. The special effects in the action sequences are breathtaking. They kept me on the edge of my seat. But I was also impressed by the less noticeable special effects such as the city of Metropolis. It looks like a real city. It's big. It's sprawling. It's old and new. Unlike previous movies, Metropolis is more than the gritty bustle surrounding the Daily Planet. It has added depth and dimension to the character of the city. <br /> <br />Brandon Routh is the new Superman. He draws inspiration from Christopher Reeve's performance as both Superman and Clark Kent (more noticeably Clark) but he isn't simply mimicking Chris Reeve. He makes it his own. (The film is dedicated to Chris and Dana Reeve toward the beginning of the end credits.) I was overwhelmed when he first appears in The Suit as Superman. And charmed by his bumbling Clark Kent. The physical change he makes between the two is amazing, with little more than a change of posture and removal of the glasses. You can believe people would look past Clark if they speculated on Superman's alternate identity. <br /> <br />I initially wasn't sure of Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane but she works in the role. It didn't help that I kept seeing pictures of her as a blonde and while the trailers showed her in character and brunette, it wasn't enough to gauge her character. But I actually believe in her Lois Lane more than I could in the original movies, both as an investigative reporter and romantic interest. The chemistry between this Lois and Superman is strong and the chemistry between Lois and her fiance is also good which strengthens the emotional conflict of the film. <br /> <br />Kevin Spacey is perfect as Lex Luther. In the earlier films, I felt the comedy aspect overshadowed Lex's power and potential menace. Kevin Spacey gives that to Lex. Like his role in Usual Suspects, he disappears in to the character and despite being easily recognisable you don't see Kevin Spacey as Lex...you see Lex. He is powerful. He is menacing. He is a threat. There are comic touches to him. You can't have Lex Luther on the screen without those touches, but the balance is different. Instead of slapstick, it is ironic humor borne out of the truth of his intent...a much darker comic element. <br /> <br />To touch on a few of the other characters: Sam Huntington is exactly right as Jimmy. He's geeky and charming in a funny sort of way. His Jimmy fits well in the history of his character. It was wonderful to see him get to have a small scene played against the original Jimmy, Jack Larson. Unless familiar with the George Reeves' Adventures of Superman series and what Jack Larson looks like today versus then, you wouldn't realise the underlying significance of the scene so it mainly adds another element for the hardcore Superman fan. The same can be said of Noel Neill, the original Lois Lane in another small part. Frank Langella is a fantastic actor and does Perry Whiteproud. I would like for him to have had more time onscreen but there was so much going on it would have been difficult to make the film longer just to do that. And since all of the actors are committed to two more Superman movies, I'm sure we'll see more of him. (I just hope Bryan Singer agrees to do the next two films as well.) Another significant character in the form of Jor-El also returns and I'll just say I am happy with the way they did this. I also liked Eva Marie Saint as Martha and look forward to some expansion of her role in the next film. Despite her limited time onscreen, she gave an honest performance that added layers to the time she did have. <br /> <br />Superman Returns is a fantastic movie. <br /> <br />While I doubt it will become a classic in the way of the original movie, it honors, enhances and expands it and the second film. It deserves to be part of the Superman mythology, as I have no doubt it will, and I'm looking forward to the sequels. <br /> <br />Superman is back! And in a big way.
0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins and his research team did a great job analyzings the \\"how's\\" and \\"why's\\" of great companies.  Through comparison data, \\"Good to Great\\" really digs deep into why certain companies reach greatness and why others can't.  Through ideas and theories based on countless hours of research, one learns what great leadership is, how that leads to superiour performance, and the overall steps and recurring themes that show up time and time again with regards to great leadership. Collins spends a great deal of time describing great leaders and the right people, but never does he describe who the \\"right people\\" are to hire and how one becomes a great leader.  Collins also lacks in describing how these great leaders were able to trickle their initatives to every level of the organization. Overall, it was an easy read and great concepts were discussed. Anyone with an interest in leadership and learning why certain companies thrive and others don't should check this book out.

068987474X|2.0|I get Greg is all Mr. Sensitive and Mr. Feminine yet Masculine.  I get it.  I get he's not good looking but married a hottie and loves her to death while she loves him to death.  I get it's the heart that matters and not the games that people play that makes and not breaks a relationship.  I get it.  We all get it, after the first 50 pages, but the authors drill it in over and over again.  It's basically a book of one topic with 50 different stories.  I.E., it gets boring and repititous.   <br /> <br />Greg got the golden pot.  Cool. <br /> <br />Now he's spewing this nonsense that guys aren't interested if he doesn't call, give his 90% attention, or looks at another female.  He's not \\"speaking\\" to us, he's speaking to the ideal boyfriend every girl deserves, should be able to get, and is out there.  I don't believe so.  I believe there's a lot more than meets the eye.  Girls constitute 50% of the relationship and females are known to play just as much as guys.  I don't get it, is the relationship a pure hell/heaven possibility just because the guy is perfect/horrific? <br /> <br />This book gives a great consolation read when one is recovering from a breakup.  Sure, tell yourself just that.  Nothing about chemistry or compatibility or circumstances that is so dictating in ANY relationship.   <br /> <br />I like the read and I like the style of the writing.  But this book is ho-hum and I must admit that books like this is written for the quick read but not for the practical aspect. <br /> <br />I also agree with many male reviewers of the book.  Greg's a pansy.

He's young, he's ambitious, he's curious, he's brave, he's book smart and street smart, and he's open-minded.  He's all of us at our peak.   <br /> <br />This book shows us that even the best of us gets decieved, gets some good luck, meets some great/evil people, and encounters great decision making choices.  Great stuff for the rational yet curious animals we are. <br /> <br />I love this book because the message is so inspiring.  We are all ready for great fortune, but are we deserving and can we capture the opportunity??  That's the key point tot his book and to our lives.  Can we listen to our hearts and our destiny and use our potential to strive for our \\"treasure\\"?  Unless we do, we will end up like some of the charcters the boy encounters (and feels sorry for). <br /> <br /> <br />I hope this book becomes required reading for High Schools and for students of ESL.  This wonderful book is fun to read and full of global culture.  Without a doubt, this book is required reading.
B000089CJI|5.0|I am uber-pleased with this well-arranged album. The lyrics, vocals and melodies are fresh and I'm so looking forward to their next instalment. Great music to listen to driving to work in the morning. It automatically puts you in a happy mood.

B000002WMH|4.0|The songs are great, but they're not listed on the CD itself-only on the case. It's frustrating to put the disks in a multi-disk changer and not know what songs are on the disk.
B00006AW2G|5.0|The Stones continued their winning streak with '69's \\"Let It Bleed\\", the second disc in their holy trilogy that begins with '68's \\"Beggars Banquet\\" and ends with 1970's \\"Sticky Fingers\\". I'm aware that most fans also consider \\"Exile On Main Street\\" to be an essential part of the Stones' legacy and while I agree that it's a great album I find it a bit too rambling and sloppily recorded (precisely what those fans dig about it!) to be included among their very best. Ultimately, these late-'60's Stones discs show Mick & Keith stepping out of the Beatles' shadow as excellent songwriters to be reckoned with.<br /><br />This masterpiece begins with the swampy guitar lick of \\"Gimme Shelter\\" and Mick singing falsetto 'oohs' along with it. Then Keith's guitar kicks in and the song gets eerie/spooky as Mick and guest vocalist Merry Clayton sing about subjects like urban unrest, rape and murder. I especially love the way Merry's vocal cords sound like they're shreading when she sings the 'rape, murder' line and the honkin' harmonica solo in the bridge. Next the Stones do a fantastic job of reinventing Robert Johnson's sorrowful \\"Love In Vain\\". Dig that wonderfully expressive slide guitar. It my have irritated some fans that instead of the single version of \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\" being included on this record, they remade it as \\"Country Honk\\" but I think it fits right in with the tone of the album- some blues, some country, a bit of gospel and a lot of pure 'rawk'. Back in the day, it wasn't uncommon for the Stones and the Beatles to release singles that weren't to be found on their albums. This was due to record company pressures for new product. The Beatles did the same thing with \\"Revolution\\". The single rocks, the version on the \\"The Beatles\\" aka \\"The White Album\\" is a slowed down doo-wop number. \\"Country Honk\\" is followed by the totally rockin' \\"Live With Me\\" with the usual nasty lyrical wit of Mr. Jagger. This one's got a great walking bass line courtesy of Bill Wyman. The country-tinged title track again features some really tasty slide guitar and some nice, loose piano played by guest Nicky Hopkins. \\"Let It Bleed\\" is full of raunchy lyrics and pure stoner attitude. I can't count how many times cocaine is mentioned on this disc so if you're anti-drugs (and/or sex) you'll definitely be offended. This was way before the age of 'politically correct', thank God. \\"Midnight Rambler\\" is a bluesy gem and is lyrically dark with its depiction of serial killers on the loose. Keith slows things down a bit with another blues number, \\"You Got The Silver\\" which is the first lead vocal he'd done up to that point. \\"Monkey Man\\"is a lively, funky piece of work- a rock anthem soaked with sex & drugs. It's interesting to note that both this album and its predecessor end with gospel-influenced songs (\\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" and \\"Salt of the Earth\\" respectively). Are the boys looking for redemption amidst all the previously mentioned carnality? All I know is that it's only rock and roll and I LOVE it!ountry-tinged title track again features some really tasty slide guitar and some nice, loose piano played by guest Nicky Hopkins. \\"Let It Bleed\\" is full of raunchy lyrics and pure stoner attitude.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|As another reviewer has indicated, Pearl Jam's first album, TEN, was released 15 years ago!  That is a LONG time.  The current president's dad was the president then.  Computers were slow as hell, Harry Potter didn't exist and everyone had more hair. And yet, this band has to deal with comparisons to its first record.  I don't know of another band that gets treated this way.  If anyone thinks this band is outdated, or unimportant, listen to Life Wasted, the opening track and Unemployable, and tell me that these songs aren't valid musical statements about the world we live in.  Eddie and the boys have it going on, and all the bad mouthing in the world doesn't change the reality.  These guys, for all their flaws, have an ability to connect with the world in ways that few other bands can even come close to.

I don't know if I feel obligated to read the rest of Austen's work, but I do agree her work has withstood the test of time very well.

B00005JOQS|4.0|I'm incredibly torn over how I feel about Bryan Singer's \\"Superman Returns.\\" On the one hand, it has enough heart to render anyone within a five-mile radius deeply moved. It's not just a meaningless gathering of action, mayhem, and special effects; it actually goes deeper by presenting a story filled with complexity and emotion, all in the face of stylized danger. I'm afraid I can't describe that aspect any further because doing so would give away some really important plot points. Let's just say that Superman's return enables a wealth of repressed feelings to resurface, some of which have been kept secret for a long time. This alone is enough for a recommendation.     However, I had some major problems with the film as a whole, and that brings me to the other hand. As classic and well loved as Superman is, this new story doesn't do much to enhance his reputation. Nor does it make it worse; what it does do is prevent him from transcending his well-established image. It's so well established that he practically vanishes behind a gigantic cliche. As I watched \\"Superman Returns,\\" I came to the realization that he's really not that interesting a character anymore. We live in an age when heroes like Spider-Man, Batman, and the X-Men rake in the big bucks at the box office. True, they were all created in comic book stories many, many years ago. But through the talents of screenwriters and directors, they've been able to stay fresh, energetic, and edgy on the big screen. Superman, however, is exactly the same as he was when he started out back in the late 1930s. Even today, he can dodge bullets and lift heavy objects. He still has x-ray vision, and he can still shoot lasers from his eyes and blow frost onto a fire. And he still believes in truth, justice, and the American Way.    I suppose now you can see why I'm so torn over this film. I loved its humanity but was disappointed by its lack of originality. I was also disappointed by Superman's overall look. Replacing Christopher Reeve is Brandon Routh, a young man whose role called for him to be dressed in a rubberized suit and for his hair to be overly slick and shiny. I thought he looked more like a plastic Ken doll than a real person. Looking so fake and pristine doesn't exactly add to his credibility as a character. However, it does help that his physique and facial expressions bear a striking resemblance to Reeve's. Somehow, I found that it gave the entire project legitimacy; Routh recaptures a wonderful performance as established in Richard Donner's original 1978 film.     One of the best things about that film was the opening sequence. It showed the credits flying towards the camera amid shots of outer space, all the while playing John William's triumphant main theme. \\"Superman Returns\\" opens in much the same way, and it includes William's theme (interwoven throughout the film with John Ottman's original score). But this time, the credits move so quickly that you barely have time to notice any of the names. Luckily, few people care about reading names at the beginning of a movie; all they're really interested in is getting lost in the story, which in this case is incredibly interesting. Superman returns to Earth after an intergalactic journey to the remains of Krypton, his former home planet. Apparently, pieces of it had recently been discovered, and it forced him to wonder whether or not the planet was, in fact, completely destroyed. Of course, we all remember the destruction scene from the first movie (if you don't, this new movie takes a couple of seconds to remind you).    After reuniting with his widowed mother, Martha (Eva Marie Saint, whose character is barely developed), he returns to Metropolis as the clumsy Clark Kent and gets his old job back at the Daily Planet. All the important characters are still there. First, there's Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington), the good-natured but undeniably geeky photographer. Then there's the head honcho, Perry White (Frank Langella), a man that's always ready for the next big scoop. Finally, there's Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), the headstrong reporter. Upon his return, Clark is surprised to learn that Lois has since gotten involved in a relationship and has had a child. He also learns that she had written an article entitled \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman\\" (which, interestingly, earned her a Pulitzer Prize). He realizes then that his untimely disappearance turned her bitter and resentful. She even seems to behave strangely towards the Clark Kent alter ego, never really interested in giving him the time of day despite not seeing him in many years. (Why no one could see the coincidence there is beyond me; I think it's gotten to the point where not realizing Clark Kent and Superman are one and the same is implausible.)    Superman first reappears in public after he prevents a jet plane from crash landing. It was a plane that just happened to have Lois as a passenger (covering a story, no less). This heroic stunt is the first of many encounters that forces her to reassess her feelings. Yes, she does love her boyfriend, Richard (James Marsden), and rightfully so; he's a good-natured, friendly man, and he cares deeply for Lois and their son, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu). But Superman was always the one she truly loved, and that brings on a multitude of conflicting emotions. It gets even more intense when she begins to notice the way Superman and her son have formed a subtle yet significant connection.    Of course, no \\"Superman\\" story would be complete without the inclusion of Lex Luthor, the evil criminal mastermind whose hatred of the flying goody-two-shoes is only surpassed by his lust for world domination. Taking the reigns from Gene Hackman is Kevin Spacey, who gives Luthor a diabolical edge that served the film well. This is not just in terms of the story; it's also in terms of the genre. Only a comic book villain could think up grandiose schemes that could never be accomplished in real life. Mostof the time, they involve large gadgets, unheard of technologies, and the proposed death of millions.     Luthor adheres strictly to that mindset, always being able to conjure up delightfully over the top ideas. In the original film he attempted to sink the entire California coast by launching a missile into the San Andreas Fault. Now he intends to literally create his own continent in the middle of the ocean, a feat that can only be accomplished with special crystals. Specifically, he needs the self-generating crystals that make up the structure of Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Naturally, he has the power and resources to collect everything he needs. The most unnecessary resource was his Pomeranian-loving female companion, Kitty (Parker Posey). Her semi ditzy behavior is not at all compatible to his sophisticated demeanor, and I just couldn't believe he actually wanted to be around her.     His careful scheming sets into motion the comic book side of the story, the side that doesn't focus on complexity or meaning so much as it focuses on special effects and entertainment. It would be hypocritical of me to say that I didn't have fun watching those scenes. Let's face it; eye candy is great in a comic book adventure film. But they didn't enliven the experience for me, either. If anything, I felt like I was watching an undeveloped idea, one that never really took off because it was bogged down by unoriginal qualities (such as the fact that \\"Metropolis\\" is really Manhattan). But as I said before, the humanity it presents is so touching that it outweighs all the other flaws. It's that aspect of \\"Superman Returns\\" I want everyone to see, the one that delves into genuine emotion without getting overly sappy. So am I recommending this movie? Yeah, I guess I am, but just barely (if I could, I'd give it three and a half stars). It's a recommendation made in the hope that the emotional experience will be enough to satisfy you. If it isn't, then don't say I didn't warn you.
B000000OSE|5.0|A MILLION STARS COULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE GNR IS SUCH A GREAT BAND. ANYONE HATING THEM ARE LOSERS. YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS AS DUST N' BONES, AND NOVEMBER RAIN ROCK!!!! GO GET THIS WITH ANY DIRE STRAITS OR FOREIGNER ALBUM AS THEY ROCK!!! <br />GNR ARE BRILLIANT GNR ARE BRILLIANT,
B000002UJQ|5.0|I actually didn't appreciate this when it was released, but returning to Radiohead's earlier work has had a transformative effect on my enjoyment of music. This album stands as a genuine work of art.
B000EULJLU|2.0|Ive listened to the album several times and it bores the hell out of me.  I like instrumentals, but this album really only has a handful of actual songs.... the rest of the album is pretentious, self-indulgent garbage.  I cant believe all the positive reviews the tool slaves gave this album.  Its been how many years since Tool released their last boring CD ?  What is it; 6 years or so.<br /><br />And the packaging is a gimmick.  Oooooh, its so trippy (sarcasm, DUH !).  Give me a break.  The CD \\"case\\" will no doubt show a lot of wear in a few years.  Do they think about how the packaging will erode over time ?  I guess not.  They probably think the cool packaging will entice fans (sheep) to buy this; and they are probably right.<br /><br />Sorry folks, but the members of this band arent anywhere close to \\"gods\\" that you make them out to be.  They are just simple men making music.  To call them or any indiviual member a \\"god\\" is downright pathetic.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I  just got this CD and haven't taken it out of my stereo since. What a great voice Corinne has and the music is lively yet gentle. Although it's listed as an R&B album, I think it's a Pop/Jazz/R&B fusion. Very original. Highly recommended!<br /><br />And at the current price of under $8.00, you can't go wrong, as the price is sure to increase as she gains in recognition and popularity.
B000002IQW|4.0|'Bass as he is known now because of the Super Group TV show on VH 1,is a rock legend, and rightfully so. He has pipes and knows how to use them. This is a classic 80's rock fest with all the power and verve to make you grit your teeth. Production could use a little tweaking, like a lot of the 80's CD's. A little bright, not enough mids. There is a reason that Skid Row still sells. This is good,crafted, and well sung rock. More original sounding than Poison or Warrant. More melodic than Anthrax or Motorhead. Great to play over and over, which I think is what the hair bands gave us. Don't think, just rock. Check out the underated Blue Murder CD made by John Sykes who was the guitarist and side singer for Whitesnake. If you like the 'Row, you will love Blue Murder. Great vocals too!
0316172324|4.0|In just a few short days of reading I was able to understand that those moments of clarity of purpose, those insights to my understanding why people do what they do, is actually me making a judgement in a \\"Blink\\" of an eye.  Not based on ESP or clairvoyence but because my mind is preprogrammed through my lifes experiences and education to make instant judgements.  An eye opener for me was that within one week of reading Blink I was faced with reversing my opinions of several very fine people who I had underestimated based on their appearance or their mannerisms.
0201633612|5.0|Design Patterns is an essential book for every software developer or architect. It was ground breaking for it's time, describing reusable design patterns that recur in software development projects. <br /> <br />The presentation used makes reading and understanding the concepts easy, and allows one to learn and apply the patterns a few at a time. It's a great reference book, and the distilling and naming of the patterns really aids communication between developers.
0743424425|5.0|I loved this novel! It was thrilling, full of suspense, and wonderful! It kept me interested and shaking in my seat! As a teenager, I thought there were a few parts that were gross but overall a great read.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood is definitely one of the finest TV dramas ever.  The polished, brilliant acting combined with rich, believable storylines made this show remarkable.  It is one of few shows that did not cross over into the \\"sappy\\" or \\"hokey\\" territory even though much of the content could have caused it to do so.  It is a shame that it had to be canceled and that there is no plan at this time to release seasons 2 and 3 on DVD.  Come on people, wake up and realize what a treasure this show is!
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris leaves the religious with no ground upon which to stand. That's the truth. Religious people could not conceivably read this book, with an open mind, and not change their views about our world, which is currently steeped in religious dogma and resultant misery.  <br /> <br />Also, one need only read the awkward, inarticulate reviews presented here by detractors of this book to understand the type of ignorance the rational few are up against.
B00004W50T|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out. What stood out (and still does) is its elusive quality which makes it impossible to categorize this music (the modern day \\"Americana\\" moniker provides a hint but doesn't nearly say enough). The album conjures up, for me, images of an abandoned old house in the country with empty rooms, open windows, faded peeling wall paper, wind gently whistling through the rooms, filling the house with memories of the people who lived there. The haunting music, combining fender electrics with acoustic instruments, evokes a strange gumbo of some country/folk/spiritual time which exists only in the imagination. The Band's minimalist approach to playing enhances the strange aura of the recording. Snippits of phrases played on different instruments, Levon Helm's deadened drums, and the quirky,impassioned vocals have an immediate impact on the listener. The sonic quality of the way these instrumental and vocal instruments work together are as original as work by the Beatles and Geoff Emerick on Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's. In fact, this could reasonably be called a \\"back to the roots\\" Revolver. This is music from a world strangely different, but also uncannily familiar, like some alternate past. I disagree that this is not psychedelic music. THIS IS psychedelic music (in the best, artistic sense) of the highest order. The imagery evoked in these songs are the most stunning, original and clearly conceived of the era (and arguably beyond). If Helen of Troy \\"launched a thousand ships\\", this album \\"launched a thousand musicians\\" to take a second look at America's great musical tradition. Think about it. Without the Band, there would have not been a Bruce Springsteen, REM, Tom Petty, Eagles, post cream Eric Clapton, etc. Come to think of it, the band saved American music from teflon and plastic, confirming the value of traditional musical textures like wood, bone and leather. Music From Big Pink was the mellow feel of \\"the morning after\\" a great acid trip. We will never see the likes of it again. God bless Levon, Robbie, Richard, Rick and Garth for this gift to all of us.
B000000H40|5.0|I started listening to obituary around a year and a half ago and basically their albums are in heavy circulation in my radio, car stereo(love scaring all the emo kids) and my ipod. Obituary has a combination of thrash, death, melodic and even some tech in them which makes for a interesting and killer sound. Lead singer John Tardy has a very almost unique voice(a la Chuck Schuldiner of Death style) a combination of a screaming and screeching growl and can deliver some brutal melo death vocals that easilly scare the masses. The shredding abilities of twin axemen Trevor Peres and James Murphy deliver brutal riffs, and some skull crushing solos. Donald Tardy delivers a non stop onslought of double bass drumming is one of metals most underrated greats.Frank Watkin's bass is great too . <br /> <br />Infected 10/10 <br />Body Bag 10/10 <br />Chopped in Half 20/10 <br />Circle of Tyrants 15/10 <br />Dying 10/10 <br />Find the Arise 10/10 <br />Cause of Death 30/10 <br />Memories Remain 10/10 <br />Turnes Inside Out 10/10 <br /> <br />There you have it, a metal must along with Slowly We Rot and Frozen in Time and even Death's albums too.

0767821629|4.0|Tired of explosions and bad guys who shoot hundreds of bullets but still miss their main target?  Try this drama/sci fi movie.  The characters are the stars, not the sets nor the action sequences.  Bierko is great as the lead and has star quality.  Why can't he get more roles?  Gretchen Mol is beautiful and is convincing as the mysterious blonde with a hidden agenda.  I don't want to give much away as this is really a classical mystery.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Let me first say I was not into AFI, nor do i know any of thier older material...all i know is what ive heard from them on the radio a couple years back, and wasnt really impressed with it so I never looked into them. My friend said pick up this album its real good with somewhat of a 80's vibe to it. So reluctantly i picked it up and was pleasantly suprised. Almost every song is unique and memorable in its own way. There are some really catchy songs on here,but in a good way without being blantently pop sounding. I don't understand the neagtive reviews this album is getting...but i guess from the viewpoint of a long time fan, i can understand, bc I heard they changed thier sound alot. But all I can say is what I heard on this album is very good, and i def would recomend it to a fan rock/alternative
0671799320|5.0|The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power, by Daniel Yergin. It is a fascinating history of the oil industry beginning with John D. Rockefeller, who sought Kerosene for illumination and medicinal purposes in the Oil Fields of Western Pennsylvania near the end of the Civil War. It reads like a thriller as it describes the perpetual oil shortage that plagued the industry and consumer from day one; explains how nations such as Japan and Germany were affected profoundly by oil, or lack thereof, during World War II; and U.S. & European prospecting in the Middle East.  <br /> <br />Heavy as it may sound, it is an easy read with historical anecdotes throughout such as why Marcus Samuel named his oil company \\"Shell\\" and how Alfred Nobel instituted the Nobel Prize as a meaningful legacy after the media erroneously announced his death, published his obituary, and condemned him for creating dynamite. <br /> <br />As oil prices continue to rise and our president publicly announces that we must seek alternative energy sources, The Prize has been more than entertaining: it's been enlightening, educational and offered a manageable understanding of the industry and international relations.  <br /> <br />
1593553307|5.0|Not all of Dean Koontz's books are as wonderful, but all make for a good read or listen.  This one was exceptional, especially if you've ever dreamed of having your beloved dog actually communicate with you.  Genetic engineering at it's best and worst.  This is a riveting story from the first page (or cassette) to the last words.  It's the story of great love...of which a dog exhibits daily to its masters and it's a story of great love between two human beings who were alone and bereft before they met because of a wonderful animal.  It's also the story of a beast bred to kill, a monster truly.  It's the story of government experiments with genetic engineering that truly have no place in society.  Playing God requires justice and fairness, of which man is incapable without a solid moral compass.  Do you doubt the government has done experiments in America and other governments around the world? Don't doubt, it's factual and horrific and I could name many, which I've done in other reviews.  As with most fiction, this story has a basis is some truth, carried to extreme of course, but it's a wonderful book.  Don't hesitate to read or listen to it!  Kudos to Koontz for this one...he has to be a dog lover.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I think this is by far the best live album ever. Sarah McLachlan has created an album that will stay in my CD player forever. Unlike other live albums, this one somehow captures the feel of a concert and you can't help but cheer with the people blessed enough to have seen her perform live at the onset and end of each song. The renditions of 'Building a Mystery,' 'Hold On,' and 'Angel' are simply amazing. Buy this album and you'll have something to treasure for years.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Though many did not like this one as much as the first, I did. The beginning started out exciting and very emotional, and it never quit. I highly recc.
B00005JOQS|4.0|I must say that Superman Returns is a very good DC comic book movie, but it's not as entertaining as X-men. The film is a bit slow-paced for the first hour, but once things start to explode, it's non-stop action and spectacular visuals. The characters are not well written and developed. I don't really care for Kate Bosworth's rendition of Lois Lane. I thought that good girl/bad girl Parker Posey deserved more material to work with. Kevin Spacey is effortlessly stole many scenes, but his character is not evil enough to hate him. As for new comer Brandon Routh, I think he's very handsome, got a great body, and his performance is good enough. Isn't he a bit too young looking to have a kid(ops, spoiler)? The film lacked a heavy duty showdown battle between Superman and Lex. Perhaps they are saving it for the sequel.
B00005JOX6|2.0|When it comes to Adam Sandler, there's two different camps of people: those who think he's funny, and those who don't.  Click actually manages to provide some laugh out loud moments, but after the film reaches it's halfway point, those moments are few and far between, and the \\"lesson learned\\" just feels so cliche and tacked on as the film reaches way too far to make some kind of point.  Sandler stars as an overworked and underpaid architect who has put his family (including the ridiculously hot Kate Beckinsale as his wife) on the side in hopes of gaining a much longed for promotion from his womanizing boss (David Hasselhoff, perfectly cast).  One night, he gets a life altering remote control from a mysterious stranger (Christopher Walken) that allows him to fast forward, pause, and do other things of the type in his life, and he pays dearly for it.  For a comedy, Click is at times quite painful to watch and feels dragged out.  The characters are selfish and we feel nothing for them, with Sandler's hardly having any redeeming qualities at all.  Despite all that though, Click is once again more money in the bank for Sandler, and for those who aren't fans of him, Click won't change your mind.  Also featuring Henry Winkler and a Speedo clad Sean Astin.
B00004TH83|5.0|As a new Lara Fabian fan I recommend this English-speaking C.D.<br /><br />I also purchased a DVD that is in French. Her voice is beautiful in any language. This CD is very moving, full of emotion. Her voice is powerful, tender with good range. Anyone that likes Linda Eder would most likely like Lara as well.
0060853964|5.0|This was a great book, smart and funny.  If you read this and find yourself not amused you must not get the jokes, so start from scratch and just start reading books about history, the Bible and do yourself a favour and travel around the world a bit.  These two authors have combined their smarts and styles to create a fun, satire on the end of the world.  It's a great idea, making a mockery of the spiritual world, and how things are supposed to work.  There are also tons of great little insights into our modern world, and how we live and deal with all the frustrations we encounter in the daily grind. I love this one, on par with The Hitch Hikers Guide series.
B00000AFFF|5.0|I remember seeing Elvis in a small concert hall in the early 70/s, totally full of attitude, I think when we clapped for him to come back and sing one more song he gave us the bird. Well this elvis is mature and has harnessed his energy. I suggest this, grab a bottle of wine <br />dim the lights and hmmmmm ...........the man is smooth
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Quite simply Kingdom of Heaven as a theatrical release didn't quite cut it. It was edited on studio demands to make the film more palatable for mainstream audiences, on the claims that films in the 3 hour mark were box office poison (LOTR?). Instead what was offered was a much watered down version of the film as it should have been seen. I still enjoyed it but the characterisation was slight, motive glossed over, some poor scene transitions and I was sure there were scenes shown in the trailer that wern't in the film. <br /> <br />Thankfully the Director's Cut clears all this up and the film is restored to the way it should have been originally seen. <br />Watch again the first forest battle on the way to Messina that is not just an excuse for action but has become a veiled assassination attempt. This scene has sublime editing and now means so much more. <br />Kingdom of Heaven is definitely Oscar worthy material at least for directing, costumes, editing, cinematography, score etc, it is therefore a great pity that the theatrical version wasnt the complete version. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00005JOVH|4.0|I will agree with other reviewers that it's obvious what they were trying to do with X3: promote and emphasize Storm and Wolverine for possible spin-offs. That said, I think the ending leaves open the possibility of an X4. That said, I thought the movie was very well done, entertaining and with a great message. Definitely worth the $10 for two hours of amusement.
B000053W4R|5.0|This quote comes from Lawrence early in the film and it shows us that this story is basically a character study of Lawrence, which also applies to many other great warriors, explorers and others who confront great physical and psychological hardship while attempting to accomplish great and important things.  Lawrence states this when he puts out at match by snuffing it out with his fingers, seemlingly with ease.  When another soldier tries out he winces in pain and comments that it hurts.  Lawrence gives this reply. <br />Throughout the film we see Lawrence's immense will power, when in crossing the seemingly impassible desert with barely enough water, his decision to go back for a lost man, his decision to go into Turkish-occupied Dera'a in spite of the danger, his decision to go back to the battle after suffering a collapse and confronting the inner demons of his personality. <br />Regarding the film, I can only agree that it is a pleasure to watch.  The desert scenes, particularly in southern Jordan with its strange landforms protruding from the desert floor are stupendous.  Peter O'Toole puts in a fine performance, even looking a lot like Lawrence (only significantly taller!).  O'Toole does over do it though, particularly in the scene later in the film where he decides to attack and wipe out a retreating <br />Turkish column even though his friend Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) warns him not to do it.  Lawrence gets a crazed, agitated look before ordering the attack that just doesn't look right.  At the end of the massacre, there is a very overwrought scene where a blood-spattered Lawrence is staring with a deraged look at a dagger he is holding in his hand. <br />One other thing that I have problems with in the film is that attitude of Lawrence to Ali.  They first meet when Ali kills in cold blood Lawrence's Beduin guide. When Lawrence asks him why he did it, Ali's only reply is \\"this well belongs to me and members of his tribe are not allowed to drink from it\\" (apparently a capital crime!).  Yet, later, Ali becomes  Lawrence's closest companion and he is the one who tries to deter Lawrence from carrying out the massacre referred to above. <br />This strange, apparently inconsistent behavior is not explained but I assume that we are to attribute it to the alien culture of the Beduin in which life is cheap. <br />We also see the usual criticism of the British military mentality we have come to associate with David Lean films...the hypocrisy, the arrogance, the snobbery, the racism, and the ingratitude to those who serve it above  and beyond the call of duty. <br />All-in-all, a film that lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest of all time.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|There's no denying that what you hear when you listen to this record is not only extremely well done, but also very well arranged. Panic! at the Disco is great in the studio, but a rather disappointing live act. If I were reviewing the band in general I would give them 3 out of 5 stars. They've added in more different parts to their songs than they can play at once live so, unlike Angels and Airwaves (who has musicians playing every part of the song), they play along to the programmed parts. And, unlike Motion City Soundtrack, the singer is not as perfect as he sounds on the CD. They lyrics are witty and written in nearly the same style the author of Fight Club, Chuck Palahniuk example Time To Dance and London Beckoned. And, depending on how you take that it can be considered clever or unoriginal. Also, a lot of people believe they don't write all their music. If you listen to their demos, you will notice that there are some major changes in the songs, and at least one, formerly acoustic, was made all electronic.<br /><br />Imagine these songs after stripping away all the fluff. If their songs still spoke the same way when performed with just a voice and a single piano or single guitar, it would indicate that it was a well written song. I don't think any of these songs pass that test, but if you don't already know anything that I've written you will surely be impressed by this music. It's not true that they are a Fall Out Boy rip-off and certainly not true that they are a simplified version of. FOB is painfully simple and Panic! at the Disco is almost overly decorated with complex parts. To sum this up Panic! is a great studio band with an impressive record to show for themselves. I give the record taken by itself 5 stars.
B000AYELVA|2.0|I liked the second more but the first one sets up the background for the battle between good and evil.  The battle is in each of us as well as us against them.  I like the concept alot.
068987474X|1.0|My first thought was, \\"How the heck did this guy get to write a book?\\" Then I saw that he's one of the writers for that silly Sex in the City show, which NO guy would watch. All I had to do was read the first page to know that this book in complete bunk!  <br /> <br />Who the heck actually writes him letters? In response to the first letter, if a guy is single (or available) for 10 years, he either has problems asking girls out or he's gay. Another possibility is that he has no idea what he's really looking for, but is too afraid to admit it. That's just common sense! <br /> <br />The idea that if a guy doesn't ask you out immediately, he doesn't like you, is the exact opposite of the truth! A bit of psychology: A guy who asks you out right after meeting you has probably asked ten other girls out in the same week. He's probably still holding out his options, waiting for #9 to return his phone call, while he strings you along like a good shoe salesman. Guys are not shy about asking girls out, only when they don't feel the risk of being rejected. The more risk a guy perceives in asking you out, the longer it's going to take him. That too should be common sense! <br /> <br />A guy may ask five girls out in a row, and not ask you out because he has low stakes in the other five but high stakes in you! He knows that asking you out could ruin your friendship. Certainly in his mind it will. Very few guys can go back to being \\"just friends\\" after making a move. Realistically, if he's hanging around you and he doesn't have a girlfriend, it's because he hasn't ruled you out. True, there are some guys with high risk tolerance, but you can always identify them by their gambling debts. Successful guys take calculated risks, but even they falter in dating because there is very little calculation in romance. <br /> <br />Behrendt's idea that men will have sex with women who they consider their friends but are not attracted to is all but completely wrong. Men have sex with women whoare not their friends and who they are attracted to. It might be nothing more than physical attraction or lust, but a man is never going to have sex with a woman he doesn't feel is fit to carry his gene pool. That's biological. <br /> <br />The commenter who mentioned that women have good intuition about men is obviously wrong, if they actually take this book seriously. Common sense is the way to understand a guy; nothing less, nothing more.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The collection of Star Wars films are the best movies ever made.  Period.  No discussion.  No qualifiers.  These are the best movies ever made, and when the final installment was finished, all of the movie cameras in the world should have been smashed to pieces and sold for scrap.  At this point, film makers should just GIVE UP.  No one will ever top Star Wars.  It's impossible.  Not like Darth Vader isn't Luke Skywalker's father impossible (\\"That's not true!  That's impossible!\\") but like REALLY impossible.<br /><br />May the force be with you.
0143034901|4.0|This story took hold of me from the beginning when Daniel Sempere entered the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Within secret passageways of books long-forgotten, a young boy discovers an author who takes his breath away. As Daniel strives to learn more about the mysterious author, he lights a fuse at the end of his own path, not realizing the danger he puts himself into.<br /><br />The translations are a bit \\"funny\\" at times (like a when a foreigner uses incorrect grammar that you think is cute) but it does not happen so much that it takes away from the story. The Shadow of the Wind is a beautiful mystery that should be read by all book lovers.
068987474X|5.0|100% a great book!    Sometime you just need that kick to move on. For me, it was 18 months i've been trying to figure out that guy that's hot and cold.    Other reviewers have said the book is just common sense that you should know...which it is, but when your blinded by the emotions and justifications, what you know is rational in your head just doesn't seem to click without that second voice backing it up as the truth. This is what this book is. It's what you know, don't want to beleive and don't want to hear, but NEED to hear to move on.    It's also been said that it's repetitive...which it is, but I found that really helpful. I needed that message driven home again and again because I was afriad if I didn't keep hearing it, I would forget it, make more excuses and fall back into the hole again.    I never thought I would let myself fall into such a crappy situation where I wasn't happy and really wasn't being true to what I deserve. I wish I had read it earlier because I plan hopefully to never get into a position where it's all give on my part. And personally, I'm glad I don't have to make the first move. It makes that guy work a little harder (because do you really want to be with someone who doesn't have the guts to ask you out?) and the relationships where I have asked the guy out, don't end up. They always seem to take it for granted that they didn't make the first move.    Anyhow, a must read - if anything to help nip those bad relationships in the [...]!
B00009MGGP|4.0|What a great set! This set made me an Ian Richardson fan. Everything about these shows is wonderful. Plot twists...Character development...Cinematography...all of it. Ian Richardson's character is utterly cold-blooded, relentless and ruthless. And, he is clever. I highly recommend this series.

B00005JOQT|3.0|After a five-year absence, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Metropolis and finds Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) now has a child and a boyfriend, and archenemy Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is up to no good again.  Lex wants own the world and starts creating a new continent; Lois is on his trail, and Superman is after her.<br /><br />Brandon Routh is very good as Superman, mainly because he looks a lot like Christopher Reeve.  He's a beautiful man and does a fine job, especially as Clark Kent.  Unfortunately, he's given little dialogue.  I thought Bosworth and Spacey were both miscast.  His gloomy Luthor is also a man of (too) few words, and he's lethargic and boring to boot.  Bosworth looks like a glamorous 20-year old model and lacks the wonderful awkwardness that made Margot Kidder's Lois so endearing.  Even boy photographer Jimmy Olson and editor Perry White look wrong.  They should provide a little humor, but are bland and forgettable instead.  The film has so much computer-animation that nothing feels real.  There is no romance or sense of danger.  If you like non-stop action on a grand scale, you'll enjoy this movie, but if you're looking for memorable characters that are developed and ring true, you'll be disappointed.
B000EQH2QK|3.0|I got this CD as a Christmas present, and was very excited to listen to it. I was, and still am, in love with her English debut, Laundry Service. I popped the CD in and was very disappointed with what I heard. Some tracks, like Don't Bother, Hips Don't Lie (which actually wasn't on my album), Animal City, and Timor(my personal favorite); are amazing! However, the album overall was too ballad heavy and, sadly, didn't sound very different from anything else out there. I loved Shakira's first album because the songs were different from anything else out there. Unfortunately, many of the song's melodies seemed recycled. I hope that Shakira will realize (especially with Hips Don't Lie at the top of the charts) that her sucess lies in the fun, unique songs that got her started.
0312323867|2.0|The writing is fine, it's the plot that feels weak.  The spoiled, self-centered perfect beauty queen has a \\"revelation\\" as shallow as she is, enabling her to marry the nice stuggling (though not for long) writer -after getting knocked up and giving birth to 2 illegitimate babies.  That's basically all there is to it. Oh yeah, and she lives happily ever after.
B00000DGUG|5.0|Alanis Morissette, in my opinion, is an amazing songwriter. Her second major album is no exception. On this CD, her songwriting is a little more melancholy as she talks about suicide and marital problems. However, the songs carry positive messages and just like Jagged Little Pill,convey her emotions without the use of cliches and recycled melodies. While not as stunning as JLP, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is still an amazing CD. My personal favorites were: \\"Baba\\" (an interesting tongue-in-cheek song which talks about \\"religious priests\\" taking money from people to \\"save\\" them), \\"Would Not Come\\", \\"So Pure\\", \\"Joining You\\" and \\"UR\\". It's definitely worth a listen.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Knopfler and EmmyLou are both storytellers in their lyrics, to be sure.  And they both know how to steer a melody around your brain so it stays there long after the song ends.  Thing is, EmmyLou is Country and Knopfler is Rock n Roll. Donnie and Marie may have something to say to this... but this is the best duet combination from those two genres.   <br /> <br />These artists find a great sound in a new common ground.  Maybe it's because of Knopfler's work with The Notting Hillbillies and Chet Atkins, or perhaps it's EmmyLou's work in the biz since the late 60's.  There's plenty of sultry EmmyLou to be heard and the familiar Knopfler guitar riffs can be found. And then there's this great synthesis.  This CD is a testament to the maxim that one plus one is greater than two.
B000002MY3|5.0|I am a HUGE Alanis Morissette fan and I own 4 of her albums, so I know this is a slightly biased review.I love how unique and meaningful all of her songs are. The raw emotion is amazing to listen to. From the popular songs \\"You Oughta Know\\" and \\"Ironic\\" to the amazing \\"Wake Up\\", you see there is not a single \\"filler\\" song on this album. The things she addresses are real issues that people go through and not just obscure love songs. Her voice is powerful and angst-filled. On her album \\"So-Called Chaos\\", she has a much happier and \\"poppier\\" sound.  Though I still can enjoy the album, honestly, give me the angst-filled Alanis anyday!
0897500482|5.0|This book is great in terms of coming up with ideas for techniques and defense strategies.  Bruce Lee was studying and practicing with many martial artists from multiple fighting systems.  I think this book is written pretty well, and the very important and practical information is elaborated on more extensively. <br />I like how he wrote much Tao about the attitudes and virtues of a person in general, that will help to improve how you deal with confrontations in the psychological perspective.  He doesn't focus only on power, but on speed and evasion.  He emphasizes agility, combinations, evasiveness, and power. <br />There is an inclination that a fighter must get some basic foundations in all aspects of a fight, but that in the end the best way for one personally is one's OWN way.  Or else a cat would be doing a dog's job, and the dog would be doing the cat's job.  The dog can be a dog better than the cat can, and a cat can be a cat better than a dog can.  Basically, adapt to your natural feel and capitalize on your natural strengths, and then strengthen your weaknesses. <br /> <br />I like this book alot.  He put much time and thought into it and it shows. Please don't use this book as a \\"how to\\" book.  It wasn't designed nor written for such a purpose.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I thought Alicia's first album,Songs in a Minor, was okay but I was BLOWN AWAY by her second album! Alicia added AMAZING uptempo numbers like Karma and Heartburn(which I felt should have been a single). Alicia's writing is good, but even better is the way she crafts her melodies. Every song is unique and memorable. My personal favorites were \\"Karma\\", \\"Heartburn\\",\\"Dragon Days\\", and \\"So Simple\\". \\"Nobody, Not Really\\" was an amazing interlude that I feel should have been a full song! Give this CD a listen because she has matured for the better since Songs in a Minor.
B00006JKON|5.0|Every song on this CD grabs you with great instrumentation and singing. This CD really captures the spirit of the prog movement. Eventhough the songs are not long, they are certainly prog. Highly recommended!!!
B00005JOQS|4.0|I don't like Superman. There, I said it. I don't like him. To me, he's boring and uninteresting. His only weakness is a rock (what, is he a crack head? He freaks out when he's around rocks...), big deal. As you all know, Spidey's my kind of hero. He has problems and is more human than Supes (ok, besides the fact that he's an alien!). But, after finally seeing the first two movies and now this, my opinion of the Man of Steel has changed. <br /> <br />After a long visit to the lost remains of the planet Krypton, the Man of Steel returns to earth to become the peoples savior once again and reclaim the love of Lois Lane. That's all I'm going to go into for plot because it's best to go into this movie knowing pretty much no more than that. <br /> <br />This movie has a lot of things going for it. First, the cast is great. Many people doubted Brandon Routh because it was deemed impossible for him to replace Christopher Reeve (R.I.P.), let alone live up to his performance. Well, he does it. While I feel Reeve has a slightly better Clark Kent, both have wonderful Superman performances. Each is believable as Superman. The costume looks great, the dark red perfectly accents the deep blue, and the blue shows up very well on the screen. I'm not familiar with Kate Bosworth but she did a good job as Lois Lane. She's quite different from Margot Kidder's Lois but she gets the job done. Kevin Spacey. Here's a man who needs no introduction. He ruled as Lex Luthor. I prefer him to Hackman's Luthor. Hackman was mostly comical and you never felt threatened by him. Spacey though, he was comical but you got a sense of evil from him. You knew he was not a man to mess with. He has some great lines and really enjoys playing the part as much as we enjoy watching him play it. Sam Huntington plays a different but fun Jimmy Olsen and Frank Langella did a good job as Perry White. See if you can spot the original Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen from the 1950's TV series in cameos! The humor is very darkfor a Superman film but its still quite funny. I especially like the two with the dogs, the one at the beginning when they arrive at the mansion for the second time and at the very end. There are a lot of little quips and one-liners that will have you chuckling. <br /> <br />There is little action but when there is, its all fun. The effects are spot on. Very rarely, if at all, do things look off or out of place with the CGI. Everything is believable and doesn't take you out of the moment. The few action scenes are fun to see but they have one major thing going against them: no danger is felt. I felt no danger for anyone involved. Whether it was because we knew they'd all live or what, but very rarely was a true sense of danger ever felt. The film is beautifully shot though, the new Panavision Genesis HD camera helped too because everything is vibrant and crystal clear. One scene even contradicts itself. Early in the movie Superman is trying to stop a falling Airplane that is falling from space (so in other words, going really really fast!). He is hardly able to catch up to it and once he does, it takes him a while to stop it; so long he barely manages to do it. But, later in the movie he does something even more extraordinary under certain circumstances that, for him, are very challenging. So, you're telling me that a fully powerful Superman can barely stop an airplane, but a weakened one) who is getting weaker and weaker by the second) can do what he does at the end? I know this is a comic book about a flying man from another galaxy but come on, have at least some logic here. <br /> <br />The music. Oh the music. I got chills and goose bumps when the main titles came up. I was so happy they used the original title design from the original movies (big props to Kyle Cooper who designed the title sequence. He also designed MGS3's title sequence, I love this guy!) and the same ending, very nice there. But, back to the music. Hearing that Superman theme was amazing. Iloved the title sequence. The theme is so empowering and it is used to great effect throughout the whole movie. All the music is epic though and really helps the film. But damn if that main theme didn't make the movie. <br /> <br />For all the good, there is also the bad. First, the kid (STOP READING HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW SPOILERS!!!). We all know who's kid it was, it was plainly obvious. But this kid is a plot device but he's not implemented very well. Too many times did the camera show a close up of him for no damned reason. Example, near the end when they pick Superman out of the water, Richard cannot take off, the camera keeps focusing on the kid and I expected, no, wanted the kid to get out of the plane and push them off like Supes did earlier in the movie. Nothing. The kid did nothing and the close ups were completely irrelevant to what was happening and what did happen. What the hell Singer? Don't dangle a damned carrot in front of my face and then say \\"No meal for you!\\" It's annoying. Let's hope the kid is used a little bit better in the sequel. (END SPOILERS!!!) That brings me to my main beef with this movie. By the end, you don't feel like anything has been accomplished. This movie did exactly what it's titled: Superman Returns. That's basically all that happens. This movie felt like Superman Returns Vol. 1; a prologue of sorts to what is to come. Ok, Superman Returns, but he accomplished nothing. We go in knowing no more than by the time we leave. Batman Begins accomplished more and that had the whole origin story to tell. This one didn't because it takes place after the origin movie; plus, Begins had a shorter running time to boot. This sort of feels like a missed opportunity. This could have been something truly amazing, but instead, it was lost in itself and essentially accomplished nothing. This lack of accomplishment leaves a somewhat sour taste in our mouths. You kind of have to wonder why you just sat there for two hours. There was littleprogression and hardly anything changed from the beginning to the end. It almost feels as if you're just handing your money to WB for the sake of seeing Superman on the big screen once again. <br /> <br />In the original two movies (have not seen the third or fourth) Superman was the main focus. It was his movie. This one feels kind of like the original Batman in some ways. It goes from Clark to Lois to Lex to Superman, never focusing on one character or at least, the main character. The originals did that very well, we spent enough time with Lex to get to know him and know his plot and motivations but the main focus was Clark and Lois or Superman and Lois. Everyone is so torn apart in this one, its hard to care about...anyone. <br /> <br />But, I was entertained. Not once was I ever bored and that's why I'm giving this a higher grade. It kept my interest and I liked the film despite its flaws. The good easily outweigh the bad and its still a much smarter movie than most others released these days and it spent more time on its character than on mindless action, something that is hard to come by in movies these days. It also has a heart, which is equally rare in Hollywood. So, Superman is still not my favorite superhero but I like him a lot more than I did before I saw the movies (he still ranks lower than Spidey or Batman though). <br /> <br />After I left the theater I got into my vehicle and turned on the radio before leaving. The song that was on was Learn To Fly by The Foo Fighters. It think that was mighty appropriate. Now that we've learned how to fly again, take us on a truly epic journey Mr.Singer.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|This movie is excellent, a very nice second part..a lot of action..and a great scenaries..BUT why doesn't have spanish idiom or subtitles??
B000EQ47GS|5.0|This was, to me, the greates album ever to be played at parties!!  Dont mind what that little idiot Hellraiser says about this album, after all, he is a Jessica Simpson fan, nuff said.  This album still stands proud after 30 years. I love this c.d.
B00005V1B2|5.0|If you happen to be curious about the band Camel and have been lead to this page of reviews through your web search, please purchase this particular Camel album without any hesitation. It is flat out amazing. It is the musical equivalent of a fine glass of cognac. <br /> <br />The Snow Goose is a solid structured, cohesive and musically unified \\"product sum\\" of it's parts. This is a concept / project that just \\"worked\\" ... and it worked beautifully. The  musicians here are not trying to passive aggressively out duel each other with their sophisticated chops. The song writing is  superb. There are interesting melodies and unique rhythms here that are just plain beautiful.  <br /> <br />I enjoy a fair share of \\"Progressive\\" music, but I don't typically associate it with emphasising emotion over technical displays of innovation and skill. The Snow Goose swirls with emotion. This is an album your girlfriend / sig. other will dig. It is an album to drive the highway to on a sunny afternoon. Your mind will get lost in it and the major melodies will stick in your head for days. Trust me, the Snow Goose is THAT good. <br /> <br />If you already own this album, invest in a bottle of wine and play it again. Music like this is a rarity. Celebrate it!
0671042858|5.0|I've read about 10 of Stephen King's novels, and this one is my favorite. This riveting story of survival is scarier than most of his books dealing with the supernatural. The main character, a 9 year-old girl, comes alive in this great little novel. I strongly recommend this to both teens and adults, even those who would never think of reading a Stephen King novel because of his normal genre. If you like scary novels, or books about wilderness survival, you'll love this one. If you have some interest in baseball, it makes this even better.
B000089RVX|5.0|This caught me by suprise. The first time I heard Evanescence I thought, Here we go again, another Neu/Gothic Metal band with a chick singer doing the same thing over again! WRONG! This is an amazing album with a dark melancholy feeling. Far from goth and just very catchy. Amy Lee has an amazing voice, and the guitars really compliment it well. Great catch, I am glad I gave it a chance!
0790729628|1.0|I give this DVD 1 star not because of the movie quality but because the DVD version, as opposed to the Video, does not <br />have Harrison Fords Narrative thoughts and comments.  <br />As a result there are lots of long camera shots pointed at his face. Without the narration of what he's thinking, these long camera shots and musical breaks seem a bit silly. <br /> <br /> <br />Until they remaster this DVD I would not recommend the purchase of it. <br /> <br />
0800141660|5.0|Another wonderful adaptation of a Jane Austen novel--this time with bigger \\"stars!\\"  Totally safe for kids middle-school on up!  Well done overall with great scenery and good acting.  If you want a break from the usual idiocy that attempts to pass for \\"art\\" on TV or in the movie theaters, be sure to rent or purchase this film!  It is also a film that can be watched repeatedly, over the years, and doesn't get stale--even though you know the story.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This adaptation is quite disappointing.  I am a great fan of Jane Austen's work and this version is so drab and the actor's portrayals are unconvincing and boring. <br />  <br />The A&E version with Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle is far superior.
0767020308|5.0|A wonderful movie that youngsters can watch with NO ill effects from the attendant sex and violence that are hallmarks of Hollyweird.  An English novel put to film.  No breakneck pace--just a good, decent movie!
B00006AW2O|5.0|12X5 is the second Rolling Stones album to be released in US.  It is overall a better album than England's Newest Hitmakers but not quite as good as their later album like Aftermath or Between The Buttons.  The majority of this LP consists of covers, only three songs are penned by Jagger/Richards and two are \\"Nanker/Phelge\\".<br /><br />The album starts off strong with the Chuck Berry cover, Around And Around.  This is the highlight of the album by far; from beginning to end, it is a incredible rock 'n roll adventure.  Then comes the bluesy Confessin' The Blues; not that bad of a song.  Empty Heart, on the other hand, is an excellent toe-tapper that really shows how musically talented the band was, even in their early days.  Time On My Side is pretty good but a bit too overrated in my opinion.  Good Times, Bad Times is just total garbage.  I always skip this song because the over-the-top bluesiness is too painful to listen to.  It's All Over Now is the second best song with its great guitar work by Keith Richards and Brian Jones.  2120 South Michigan Avenue is an outstanding instrumental; much better than Now I've Got A Witness.  Under The Boardwark is VERY underrated in my opinion.  Everything about it is superb, Mick's vocals and Keith's backing vocals, just amazing.  Congratulations is an early Jagger/Richards composition and it actually isn't that bad.  Grown Up Wrong is another one of there songs but it, however, has some flaws.  It doesn't have the kick of their later songs.  I especially like If You Need Me.  Keith delivers some phenominal backing vocals in this song.  The album closes with Suzie Q, a song I've always hated.  It not The Rolling Stones' fault, I just hate this song period, no matter who sings it.<br /><br />Overall, not that bad of an album but if you're new to The Rolling Stones, you should buy either Between The Buttons or Aftermath.
B000AP04FG|5.0|This movie was just great from beginning to end. <br />I can't remember the last time I laughed all through <br />a movie. If you just want to sit back and laugh, this <br />is the movie for you.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This video was released on VHS and Laserdisc many years ago.  I bought the Laserdisc version and found only one problem with it. <br />The show that I saw in Nashville at the Vanderbilt stadium (and all of the American shows) was different from this show.  They did not perform \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" in its entirity as they did at the performance on this video.  The only reason I call this a problem is because I would have liked to have had a video of the show I saw.  Other than that, this show is a must have for any and all Pink Floyd fans.  And if David wanted to take a little extra time to make sure the DVD looked as good as it possibly could, all I can say to him is \\"Thank you for doing it right!\\" <br /> <br />To say that Pink Floyd is not as good without Roger Waters is ridiculous.  Granted Pink Floyd is not the same without him, but they are still as good.  Don't forget, Roger is the one who wrote \\"The Final Cut\\" which most Pink Floyd fans ignore.  Roger may have wrote better lyrics, but David is the one who gives Pink Floyd their unique sound. <br /> <br />Maybe one day Roger and David will patch up their differences and give us one more album and tour before they hang it up for good.
B0002KPIQY|4.0|This is an excellent film. Well acted, well thought-out.  It's steamy in some places, emotionally gripping in others. There's a lot being said here, and none of it is terribly uplifting, especially since it's based in a true story.  This movie will leave you thoughtful, maybe even introspective, but most of all you'll just be depressed.  A bottle of wine and a sink to soak your head in afterwards are a couple of good ideas here..... <br /> <br /> <br />
1881273156|4.0|I love this book and it's indepth new, to me at least, outlook on how it is we FEEL love, and how to learn to express love to others we care about in learning their language.<br /><br />There are a few people I've talked to that tell me that once you get to know a person intamatly all over, there really isn't ONE love language that stands out. BUT for the rest of us people who aren't in such relationships and are still learning to GET there. It's a great book to keep the GOOD feelings of acceptance and love open, available, and expressed.
B00004TH83|3.0|Adagio is wonderful.  I heard this in Costa Rica last month. I contacted the resturant the CD was played in and they gave me the name of the Album.  Adagio was beautifully performed (both in English and Italian).  I keep hearing the song in my head all day.  Unfortunately the rest of the CD was fair.  Ms. Fabian has a wonderful voice.  I did not care for most of the songs.  However I will be interested in hearing more of her music.
0393327655|1.0|Well-researched and well-written, this book ultimately suffers from Harris' apologist stance on America's political/military history and current actions.  As hard to believe as it is that Harris suffers from an amazing degree of naivete, given his thorough scholarship and obvious intelligence, this is the only conclusion I can come to in explanation of his lack of knowledge of our terrorist actions on the international scene since WWII.  He parrots the typical liberal doctrinal justification of America's murder and plunder, that we are a \\"well-meaning, if occasionally clumsy, gentle giant\\"....that we are basically a \\"good country\\" but are just \\"misunderstood\\" in the world.  He makes the amazing assertion that \\"when it comes to ethics, intentions are everything.\\"  The Project for a New American Century and our National Security Strategy (within which our intentions are clearly stated) aside, to give no weight to actions in discussions of ethics is simply idiotic.<br /><br />Harris makes statements about G.W. Bush's putative ethics that beggar the imagination; in order to defend his assertions he resorts to the construction of an imaginary \\"perfect weapon,\\" the use of which by Bush - Harris asserts - would vindicate Bush's ethical intentions AND actions.<br /><br />Harris also jumps on the \\"liberal\\" doctrinal bandwagon in a poorly-written and completely fanciful attack on Noam Chomsky's views on America's actions.  Curiously, as a means of characterizing Chomsky's views, he quotes another author (Arundati Roy) entirely. (?)<br /><br />Harris' giant blind spot is his failure to see that his OWN faith, a faith in both America's ignoble past and its murderous intentions going forward, justifies FAR greater danger to innocent lives than the particular religions he vilifies.
B000002UB3|5.0|I JUST LOVE THE BEATLES.THEY WERE THE GREATEST BAND EVER IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES WHICH WERE THE BEST YEARS FOR MUSIC.ALL THE SONGS ARE GREAT.BUY IT BUT AVOID NIRVANA,FOREIGNER AND G'N'R.

B000000W5L|5.0|EXILE ON MAIN STREET IS ONE OF THE FINEST ALBUM FROM THE STONES AFTER BEGGARS BANQUET AND LET IT BLEED.EACH SONG IS A GEM.BUY ALL THREE.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This CD delivers! Two great artists with huge talent come together and deliver an awesome musical experience. Emmylou could sing the phone book and sound like an angel and Mark has the deepest soultry voice, accompanied by that famous accoustic guitar. Each and every song is a delight, especially \\"This is Us\\" and \\"Love and Happiness\\". Especially haunting is \\"All the Roadrunning\\", sung by two veterans of traveling on the road to bring their music to the people. Every single song is great. I have listened to it many times already and still sing along and enjoy the music. I love it!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pink Floyd are Gods.  They are responsible for the best selling album in history (Dark Side). <br /> <br />Roger Waters is amazing.  David Gimour is amazing.  Together they are amazing.  Apart they are amazing. <br /> <br />You either get it or you don't.

B00005AAFS|5.0|This was the first Rammstein album I listened to.  Powerful sound and perfectly matched vocals blew me away. Surprisingly, ballads of this album have the same strong force that drives each song.  The music is skillfully mixed such that loud sound does not irritate your ear drums.  And you would want to turn up the volume listening to Mutter.  From powerful Feuer frei! to mellower Links 234 and Mutter the album is strong, bold and saturated with heavy and uncompromising sound.  I was not very impressed with previous albums and very disappointed with later ones: Reise, Reise and Rosenrot.
B000FMGTTE|1.0|Does John Ottman know what a memorable theme is?  Doubtful.<br /><br />None of this music stands out: it's all ambient filler.  None of these tracks stand out (other than the musical gems lifted from Williams original score... O, why couldn't Williams have scored this film?).  Ottman's score is like listening to the music from Deep Space 9 (I have no idea who wrote that either... Ottman, for all I know).  None of this is memorable.  None of this is something that you'll find yourself humming later, or discussing with others, or trying to recapture on the piano, and the beauty of a melody plays in your head.  Not Ottman's score.  Utterly forgettable.<br /><br />John Williams' original score to the 1978 film Superman is unsurpassed as a work of cinematic musical genious.  It's chilling how brilliant this work is.  There are times I listen to it and marvel at how someone can have such an uncanny command of the orchestral medium, and can so expertly explore the emotional realm of music, and do it so cleanly, so easily, so brilliantly.  Check out Williams' Superman score, not this horrible Ottman score.  This pabulum is a joke.
B000001ESP|5.0|How can any classic rock fan not praise this album?  Come on, it introduced the all-time classic, Tom Sawyer!  I love this cd, it has some of my favorite Rush tracks on it, such as Tom Sawyer and Limelight.  Any true fan could not live without this incredible Rush cd in their collection!
B000286S8S|4.0|i may not know much about the difference between the eras of Sammy Hager and David Lee Roth, but i know \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" is the definate Best of Van Halen. And it's definately alot better than \\"Best Of, Vol. 1\\". Buy this album, it's the best Van Halen compilation.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|THE BAND: Davey Havok (vocals), Jade Puget (guitars), Hunter (Bass), Adam Carson (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2006) 12 songs clocking in at approximately 45 minutes. Included with the disc is a 10-page booklet with band pictures, song credits & lyrics, and thank you's. Label - Interscope Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Took a gamble on this one after reading reviews in Rolling Stone and here on Amazon. Overall - good music... though I like the songs where Havok actually sings. Havok's screeching on a few tracks makes him sound like a Linkon Park or Limp Bizkit wannabe. Don't let their gothic Flock of Seagulls appearance lull you into a false sense of security. I believe the band has talent and they're not just a fad. AFI (\\"A Fire Inside\\") covers the gambit here - rock & pop to synth, industrial and techno. References and likenesses to The Killers (yes, I can agree with that... though AFI doesn't rock as hard), but I also hear some R.E.M., Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark, INXS, Echo & The Bunnymen, and Jon Crosby's V.A.S.T. A very 80's sounding band - but I don't see anything wrong with that since I grew up with 70's and 80's music. Give the disc several spins. I had to get past the minute-and-a-half \\"Prelude 12/21\\" as well as \\"Kill Caustic\\" - my least favorite tracks on the disc. The 3rd song, \\"Miss Murder\\", is the first hit released and for good reason... it's probably the finest song on the disc. \\"The Interview\\", \\"Love Like Winter\\" and \\"The Missing Frame\\" are simply beautiful songs... great melodies, nice vocals, and interesting stories/messages. This album didn't floor me, but it's head and shoulders above some of the mindless dribble that's being released today. Looking for new music - give this a try.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|A wonderful series - makes you think about a lot of things and is still fun to watch. I don't have to repeat what has been said already in all the other positive reviews - I totally agree with them all. Now, I have to admit, I don't even have the DVD because they are not available with code 2 (region 2) for Europe (yet). But the series was on TV here for awhile and it was one of the most enjoyable series I have ever seen (the plot is already well described by previous reviewers).  <br />So I hope this series will be released on DVD for Europe soon!
B00005JOQS|2.0|With `Batman's revived success and the ongoing small-screen success of `Smallville', the producers of this movie must have thought now was an opportune time to revive the `Superman' movie franchise.<br /><br />The last `Superman' movie was made in the 1980's. In that era, the Internet still was confined to government agencies, cell phones were extremely bulky contraptions only for the `super' wealthy alone, and the Cold War still existed.<br /><br />This screenplay attempted a tremendous feat of going back in time to an era, essentially before the last two movies were even made.<br /><br />Unfortunately doing this made Clark Kent into a very inept `nerd'. Because he is now effectively established in pop culture as `good looking' in his own right, Singer really should not have tampered with `Clark Kent'----instead leaving him as Dean Cain and Tom Welling  effectively reconfigured this part of the legend in public consciousness.<br /><br />Since Brandon Routh is a pretty decent looking guy himself, better `Clark' character development easily could have highlighted his own sex appeal throughout this entire film ultimately without alienating audiences. Even the earlier Christopher Reeves and George Reeves interpretations wanted their audiences to come away liking `Clark' as much as 'Superman'; Clark isn't supposed to be the buffoon leaving viewers wondering how he even got the Daily Planet's attention. .<br /><br />Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) having a kid is admittedly off cannon, but I've seen deeper goofs on television. It's an interesting proposition though: can Clark now be a parent to the same kid that he briefly fathered while a non-kryptonian but then never met until just now? Because he gets presented as the 'good guy' this technical revelation of Superman/Clark Kent as 'the absentee father' is a novel plot twist!<br /><br />Less convincing is Lois's relationship with Perry White's nephew, I've never ever heard of him until now! Plus, the idea that she would just happen to fall in love with the boss's relative is too coincidental for my tastes.

I couln't put it down and I did not stop reading until I finished. I thought this was a wonderful story with a major twist at the end and I loved how it was written.

0385512104|5.0|As a lover of math, I was immediately drawn into the character, Christopher John Francis Boone, who is autistic and excels at math. His character stands out a lot, and his voice is very natural and appropriate for his age. This book is creative and might make you think about autism in a different way; it changed my thoughts of autism, at least. And it's a fast read as well.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Converge is a respected band for good reason, and their album 'Jane Doe' solidified their status as a band truly at the forefront of their scene. Unlike most other bands in the hardcore genre, Converge has an honest punk rock element that is integral to their sound, which is completely stripped down (think Black Flag meets Slayer). Vocalist Jacob Bannon's unnerving, blood-curdling screams are at once horrifying and unique, and he is backed by one of the tighest bands playing music today.  <br /> <br />There is no way to understand what Converge are doing upon one or two listens, or even five. Some songs take longer to sink in than others, but rest assured, every track on 'Jane Doe' is significant, even the drum-and-vox attack of \\"Phoenix In Flames\\". \\"Concubine\\" opens like a declaration of war, but much of the album is moody and subdued, even in the midst of soaring punk rockers such as \\"Distance and Meaning\\" and \\"Homewrecker\\" (although the speed-metal assault of \\"Fault And Fracture\\" is some of the heaviest playing ever recorded).  <br /> <br />It's when the band indulges these conflicting elements (the bone-shredding heaviness and heartbreaking resignation) rather than toys with them, that the album truly shines. \\"Heaven In Her Arms\\" is hardcore punk at its moodiest, aptly expressing the rage that accompanies loss. \\"Hell To Pay\\" grooves reluctantly through its alone-at-night verses with guitar work that recalls the best of Alice In Chains. Jacob Bannon's signature panther-shrieks are at their most startling during the abrasive \\"Thaw,\\" accompanied by a wandering acid-core riff that sounds like the music of some insane circus. Meanwhile, the best song on the album, \\"Phoenix In Flight\\", is pure Sabbath-inspired doom-rock at its slowest and scariest, beginning like a death-sob and slowly drifting into a volcanic eruption of bleeding distortion and detuned chugging over galloping drums that march the listener towards the end of the line, passing up a crumbling galaxy along the way. \\"Jane Doe,\\" the title track, is rightfully one of the band's most legendary songs, offering over eleven minutes of intensity, resignation, catharsis...somehow balancing every element of what has come before in one all-encompassing track.  <br /> <br />When the album concludes, one can't help but be amazed by the performance of these musicians, who demonstrate a clear technical superiority over their peers while remaining true to a punk rock heritage. What one gets from Converge is raw, brutal power backed up by musical integrity. This is ugliness and despair at its most beautiful.
0156027321|5.0|I loved this book and rank it one of the best fiction books I've read in a long time. After reading lots of non-fiction, newspapers, textbooks, and study guides, it's nice to sit under a large tree in a college campus or park and just read fiction. This book is wonderful for that. Its character is fun and the plot is fun, though unrealistic, but that's what makes it enjoyable. It makes me just want to stop going about my hectic life and take a step back and relax and calm down. Overall, a great book for those who want to take a breather from non-fiction.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|If this is their new direction, maybe they should change their name to the Mild Chili Peppers or Sweet Chili Peppers.  Definitely NOT Red Hot. <br /> <br />While I am thrilled they made a double album, and are releasing new music, where are the all fearless jams?  The in-your-face rockers?  This high dose of safe, mid-tempo, non-offensive music that even soccer moms hum to is tolerable in small chunks, such as By The Way album, but over the course of a double disc it's just too much to bear.   <br /> <br />There aren't any bad tracks here, but there aren't too many \\"classics\\" either.  I've only transferred 13 tracks onto my ipod, whereas I have all tracks from their other albums (91-02) on there.   <br /> <br />And Anthony Kiedis calling this album the RHCP's \\"greatest thing they've ever done\\" is a bit of a stretch and really more for the hype/sales machine than a true coronation of this album. <br /> <br />Someone needs to give these guys some coffee or Red Bull to WAKE THEM UP! <br />

B000F9RB9Y|4.0|The new Blu-Ray version of The Terminator is presented in a glorious 1080P 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer. Although the film still suffers during the many night sequences, daytime sequences and close-ups look truly marvelous, and exhibit a depth of field and clarity that is rarely seen on a film of this age. The marring of the night sequences was present on the film in the theater, and it hasn't aged well. This not artifacting, nor is it any product of the transfer. Colors are rich and lifelike, and this really showcases how good HD can look.<br /><br />Wow...that's all I can say on the audio front. The MGM DVD has been improved ten fold here, as the uncompressed PCM 5.1 track is truly revolutionary. Incredibly deep bass, active surrounds and dynamic front sound fields make for one of the best home theater experiences you can have. Gunshots usually sound weak and fake in 5.1 remixes of mono films; not here. The gunshots are loud, bassy and crisp, exactly as they should be. This genuinely sounds like a new 5.1 track, so big props to MGM's top-notch audio house.<br /><br />The extras are sparse, but it does include a \\"making of\\" and several HD trailers including xXx and Underworld. The silly Java/Windows hourglass is still cracking me up on the Samsung BD-P1000, but that is not a reflection of the software, and so far I am equally as impressed as I am with HD-DVD. Good stuff.

B000F48CD8|4.0|The main reason I had to get this album, is I am a white stripes fan, and after hearing \\"steady as she goes\\", i realized I like Jack White better with a full group. The music sounds sort of retro, but fresh at the same time. Other then a couple slower songs, this album rocks, and even older listeners will be able to rock out to it as well as the younger, newer music fans.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I expect many hits from this CD Set, particularly from the first CD, although there are many worthy of note on the second.  A lot of thought seems to have gone into the package of lyrics, musicianship, structure, and package design; even the colors of each CD takes on meaning.  The songs have a connectivity from one to the next, making it a very listenable album.  Aside from the hit Dani California, other songs I'd like to point out are--okay, let's make this easy--the next four.  Snow and Stadium Arcadium, the title track, seem highly introspective, and Hump da Bump is bound to be a hit and has a very nice drum solo.  I heard brass on several of the tracks, as well.  Charlie has a nice funky rhythm.  Com'n Girl and Wet Sand are also favorites on the first CD.  On the second CD, Desecration Smile is a favorite, and Readymade takes on a classic rock sound.  This CD Set is a bargain for fans.  I can't believe they packaged so many good songs into one set for less than twenty bucks.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This movie starts you laughing and just keeps going.  It has humor, action and a good plot.
B000002UJQ|3.0|It's probably impossible to critique this album without addressing the context it's surrounded in: repeated critical praise on zounds of \\"Best of the year\\" lists at time of release and continual \\"Huzzah!\\" mentions on 'best of all times' aggregations. As such, this tends to engender only the extremes of opinion about this album which I think I can succinctly place in 4 camps:<br /><br />1) \\"Radiohead isn't so experimental! (Fill in band here) was doing it first and better...\\"<br /><br />2) \\"Radiohead isn't complex! Why, the worst album by (favoured band here) is better than the best twaddle those pretentious hipster Brits can muster!\\"<br /><br />3) \\"This is obviously the finest, most emotional, musically complex release of the 90s and perhaps of all time. If you dislike it, it's proof that you only have the patience to listen to easily digestible MTV pap.\\"<br /><br />4) \\"Man, when are they ever gonna ROCK? I just keep falling asleep. Well, there's that good part in \\"Paranoid Android\\" but, otherwise, snoozeville, man....\\"<br /><br />I'll attempt not to camp out in any of these schools of thought and review the album rather than the hype and backlash which are attached to it.<br /><br />Firstly, Thom Yorke is not the most evocative singer ever. His instrument is acceptable but by no means overwhelming so those touting his vocals as \\"expressive\\" are candycoating things quite a bit.<br /><br />Secondly, yes, the album DOES have a great sound musically and I agree with the reviewer who stated that the hooks in the album are mostly MUSICAL rather than lyrical..and that they frequently disappear as soon as they surface (as in \\"Paranoid Android\\"'s crunchy guitar riff that quickly subsumes into the background).<br /><br />Thirdly, the album is not immediately accessible. That's not necessarily the kiss of death...I didn't really like THE JOSHUA TREE all that much on 1st..or 2nd..or 3rd..listen. But once you hit about 5 listens, it had BETTER start to dig its tendrils into my cerebellum or I'll be looking to push EJECT and swap for something else.<br /><br />For myself, I'm looking for some sort of verse-chorus-verse structure to the music I listen to (unless I'm listening to jazz or new age). As such, music whose biggest selling point is that it 'washes over you' aurally doesn't tend to interest me. In the end, I didn't come away with a whole lot from this album.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br /><br />Far and away, \\"Karma Police\\" is the most realized tune on the album melodically and it's the one I would keep coming back to. The song appears to be indicting intolerance in others while admitting the allure. (\\"And for a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself\\") Besides that one, \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" is a great look at the psyche of an outsider (\\"I wish that they'd swoop down in the country lane late at night when I'm driving/Take me onboard their beautiful ship, show me the weird world as I'd love to see it/I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me\\") and another rumination on that theme (\\"Let Down\\") also stands out. The band finds a rock pulse for the bitter political jibe in \\"Electioneering\\" and comes away with a decent hook in the candidates' cynical pragmatism \\"When I go forwards you go backwards/And somewhere we will meet.\\". \\"No Surprises\\" could be an outtake from the first Velvet Underground album with its tinkling xylophone and muted midtempo pace.<br /><br />LOWS:<br /><br />\\"Airbag\\" is completely uninvolving and a poor choice to open the album with. You want a solid right cross to knock the listener off-balance but this one doesn't get the job done. The coda of \\"Climbing Up the Walls\\" engages in the sort of overdriven amp feedback done by the Beatles first on \\"Revolution\\" but pushes it far past the logical end.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />This album is not the worst ever made. It's not the best either. Right now, I don't \\"get it\\" and frankly I don't think any future listens will change that. Perhaps the best I can do is to say this is a \\"love it or hate it\\" work and under no circumstances should you buy this without having heard it first.is to say this is a \\"love it or hate it\\" work and under no circumstances should you buy this without having heard it first.
B000055Y0X|5.0|It is the midst of the Cold War, and America has Russia surrounded by B-52 bombers each equipped with a H-Bomb, just in case. A psychotic, fluid and fluoride obsessed general (Sterling Hayden) one day decides to let them fly, and gives the command to the pilots, which he does without the permission of the President. This sends the US government, deep within their war room, into a panic. Will the President (Peter Sellers), with the help of the creepily grinning Dr Strangelove (Peter Sellers), be able to stop the H Bombs, or will the world be obliterated in a Nuclear holocaust? <br /> <br />This is the world of \\"Dr Strangelove\\", Stanley Kubrick's 1963 film. This dark satire at the time was a very topical film, and a film I've been meaning to see for some time, being interested in Kubrick and a fan of Peter Sellers. I'm really glad I managed to get a hold of this DVD and see it. It is a very witty, well thought out film. <br /> <br />The acting's pretty interesting. The characters of the politicians and generals are often pretty petty, not the kinds of people you'd want handling a dire situation like this, but they aren't exactly parodies, they try to keep their serious face on, you could see politicans and generals acting like this in such a crisis. For a film whose plot involves politics, protocols and special aircraft controls, it's very easy to understand and to follow. It could have been a lot more complicated, but its not, and the satirical parts get to shine through. The aircraft controls, for instance, which are vital plot elements, are clearly marked and given their own shots. Though times have changed since 1963, I wouldn't say the film has dated that much either. <br /> <br />On this version of the DVD, there's a nice little selection of special features. Theres a featurette called \\"The Art of Stanley Kurbrick\\", which briefly documents Kubrick's early life, his first job as a photographer, and his films up to \\"Dr Strangelove\\". There's a meatier, 45 minute documentary called \\"Inside The Making of Doctor Strangelove\\" which documents the production and controversies of the film. It was interesting to discover that the set for the B-52 cockpit was so accurate, that Kubrick was confronted by the FBI. There's a few little tidbits like this, and its fascinating. There's also a \\"split screen\\" interview with George C. Scott and Peter Sellers, where the screen is split in half, and the actor gives pre recorded answers to scripted questions, which a presenter of the show reads, appearing on the other side of the screen (though in this feature it is blank and there is no one). I have never seen one of these kinds of interviews before, apparently they happened quite often at the time, and it was intriguing to watch. I particularly like the Peter Sellers part of the interview, which he does with his President character's accent, then goes on to discuss and act out accents of the English speaking world, shifting fluidly from one to another. A talented guy. There's also a picture gallery of promotional material (original posters, lobby cards, etc), some talent profiles, selected filmographies of the cast and Kubrick and the very original 1960s trailer with its ever flicking frames and words, which is just as quirky as the film. <br /> <br />Highly recommended to fans of Kubrick and lovers of satire.
B00005JOX6|2.0|MOVIE: Adam Sandler has proven to be very successful at the box office. All of his films have been huge successes and I have enjoyed all of them despite some of them being rediculously stupid. In fact, the only Adam Sandler movie that I truly found unfunny was The Longest Yard, oh yeah, and Click. Adam Sandler's latest effort fails only on one level, but that one thing costs this movie everything that it has going for it. I mean, the premise is very interesting. We've all wished at one time or another that we could pause, rewind, or fast forward moments in life. So, Adam Sandler decides to make a comedy about it . . . or wait, maybe he wanted to make a drama. The film tries to be a comedy and a drama and that absolutely kills it. There is a difference between a comic drama (also known as a dramedy) and a movie that switches from comedy to drama instantly. It was awkward too because when the film becomes straight forward drama they still sneak in a joke now and then and no one in the theater laughs because no one wants to break the silence. The bottom line here is that the film has bad direction. It doesn't know if it wants to make you laugh or make you cry. They get the movie's message out though, which is simply to cherish life and family and not take it for granted. If you want to see movies that blend comedy and drama seamlessly then see The Weather Man or The Station Agent. Click is divided right in the middle, first half = comedy, second half = drama. The movie's funny moments are far and between though. I laughed a couple of times but nothing more than a chuckle now and then. The only thing about the film that I found remarkable was the makeup. Six time Academy Award winning makeup artist Rick Baker did the makeup for Click and it was amazing. Usually when you try to make actors look old it looks artificial and very stiff. Almost every actor and actress in the movie had to be shown as their older self at different stages of their lives, and the makeup work was so realistic and natural. Call me crazy, but I would not be shocked to see a nomination for Baker come Oscar time next year.<br /><br />ACTING: Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler and will always be Adam Sandler. He is the same in all of his roles and that right there is not a bad thing at all. We've come to love Sandler's brand of comedy so much that we would criticize him more if he were to change acting styles. He carries his character well and we believe his struggle and personal journey, but too bad the movie was poorly executed. Kate Beckinsale plays his wife, and while she has a presence onscreen she really has no chemistry with Sandler. I found her to be only eye candy for the movie since in almost every shot of her at home she is in a tight t-shirt and very short shorts. The film also has a bunch of great supporting roles mostly from Sandler's friends. You have Henry Winkler, Sean Astin, David Hasselhoff, and even Rob Schnieder has a cameo. We also can't forget Christopher Walken who is a perfect fit for Morty, the kooky scientist. A good cast that unfortunetly cannot save the movie's poor execution and direction.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Bad direction leads to an overall awkward and unfunny experience. We start as a comedy and turn immediately into a drama. The tone shift is too drastic and it ruins the movie. The only notable things about the movie are Rick Baker's detailed makeup design and Rupert Gregson-Williams' light and supportive score. Pass this movie if you haven't seen it yet and just wait for DVD or HBO, because it really isn't anything special.so realistic and natural.

B0009I7NNA|2.0|This album was a huge disappointment to say the least.  I realize that M. Shadows hurt his throat somehow, but try letting one of the other guys do vocals along with him to give it a dual vocalist approach so there will be something other than singing the whole time.  Dying Fetus uses two vocalists, and they are one of the most talented bands out there.  Anyway, Beast and the Harlot is one of my favorite songs by them.  It's a good opener, but then the goodness stops and never gets started again.  With the exception of Bat Country (maybe), all the songs suck and sound like punk music.  What happened to the metal-ish sound these guys used to have?  If you like this style, then go for it.  But if you're like me and you like vintage A7X, you'll stay away from this album.

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Don't get me wrong, Advent Children is an exceptional film, it's just not for everyone. If you appreciate 3D animation, you'll get something out of this film. If you love impossible action sequences ala \\"The Matrix\\" and the far east legacy that inspired it, you'll get something out of this film. If you are a fan of the original PlayStation game, Final Fantasy VII, you'll really appreciate this film. If you enjoy all three of these elements, then you will be tickled with this offering. <br /> <br />However, for those of you who aren't interested in any of the above, I'm afraid that you may find this film rather disjunct and strange. <br /> <br />There are unquestionably scenes that will be virtually meaningless to anyone who doesn't have a background with the original story from the game. Yet, that doesn't invalidate the whole film for this group - it just means that it won't have the same impact. Also, as an effort to give the viewer some context, the DVD includes a collection of scenes from the game that attempts to outline the plot of the original story. This could have been re-rendered in such a fashion to provide a good reference that would be intriguing and refreshing to all (even those who played the game). However, instead we have video capture of the Japanese game sequences with English subtitles. This too is a little disjunct, but at least it's an effort. <br /> <br />I gave the film 4 stars because the true fan in me would give it a 5 and the responsible reviewer in me would want it to have a 3 for the average viewer. <br /> <br />If you have a chance to see it, do so. If nothing else, it has some truly remarkable 3D animation and some breathtaking scenes. But if you are unfamiliar with the original story from the game, set aside the time and view the \\"Reminiscence of \\"Final Fantasy VII\\" to give you some background. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B000ETQPYM|5.0|I don't know how anyone could give it a bad review.  The lead character is witty and totally relatable.  I read the whole thing in one sitting and immediately shipped it off to a friend.  It's one of those books you want everyone you know to read.  Happy and tragic all at the same time. <br /> <br />
B00005JO20|2.0|Hype can be a dangerous thing, look at Star Wars Episode 1 for the best example. In this case however the hype for King Kong never really drew me in to seeing it. Being a huge LOTR fan I started watching this film expecting Peter Jackson to present me with a Epic that had a strong cast with emotional and spine chilling moments.<br /><br />  What I got was 3 hours of subpar acting and some of the cheesiest camera angles and shots I have ever seen on film. For example:<br /><br /> The overuse of the \\" Saving Private Ryan\\" invading Normandy beach slowed down shot every time they showed a skull.<br /><br /> The HORRIBLE scene where Adrian Brody's character slowly types in the words \\"Skull Island\\" into his typewriter and you hear him Slowly saying  S.....K......U......L.....L.....etc etc. It is cringe worthy.<br /><br />  The CGI is laughable, the dinosaurs are horribly done and Kong is nothing to freak out about. I am still trying to figuire out how this film won an oscar for special effects. Most scenes in this film are either over done or just not polished enough. The native scenes are ridiculously slow and boring and the scene where they fall into the pit of bugs gets old after 30 seconds. They do not spend enough time developing characters but expect you to care when they perish, the boy on the ship is a unnecessary character that goes absolutely no where.<br /><br />This film tries very hard but does not deliver in any of the aspects I was hoping it to. Kong is never presented as a MONSTER that he should be presented as in the beginning. It is overall a goofy film that tried to be deep and be 3 hours long whenin reality this film should have been no longer than 2 hours.<br /><br />  At the very most this is a rental and should not be approached expecting a timeless classic. This film will be forgotten in 10 years. People have called this film \\"Brilliant\\" and a \\"Classic\\", labeling this version of King Kong anyone of those is about as legit as calling the Holocaust fake.ake.

0345409671|5.0|i would give this book an A+++ if i had to give it a grade (but we work with stars here.) after reading the Queen of the Damned i thought i'd seen Anne rice's best work. apparently, i was wrong. though being registered under th vampire chronicles, Memnoch the devil is not as vampiric as it's predecessors...but it's oh so good. Lestat goes up against the two entities he has big agendas with, God and the Devil. and in here lies the most wonderful tale of Creation and reflections of good and evil. undeniably, this book is controvertial, in my opinion closer to profane than the Davinci code. Anne Rice holds nothing back on this story and for anyone who approaches the text with an open mind, anne rice has created a truly unforgettable story. sensual, romantic, gothic, erotic and bordering profane Rice has created what should be a modern day classic.

B000FMGTTE|5.0|While the name may be unfamiliar to some, John Williams vast volume of work speaks for itself. Hardly a person alive today will fail to recognize the themes to Star Wars, Indiana Jones, ET, Jaws, and yes, Superman.<br /><br />Now, enter a man that even lovers of movie scores, such as myself, have heard little of, and give him an impossible task. Let him fill William's shoes and remake the Superman score. Ottman knew that millions would hold his composition up to Williams, and judge it on that, without even seeing how it related to the movie. As I write this, I have not yet seen the movie. I, in fact, did just what many will do. I listened to the original score, and then to this one.<br /><br />I must admit, that Ottman rose to the occasion spectacularly. Hopefully, he would consider it the compliment I intend this as, to say that halfway through listening to the score, I forgot that it WASN'T Williams I was listening too.<br /><br />The mood, the flavor, the imagry of Chris Reeve flying through Metropolis was brought to mind yet again by the haunting familiar, yet strangely new tones Ottman employed.<br /><br />Now if the movie is only as good as the score.<br /><br />-Dawn

I would usally read a book to do with what we were studing for the week and then let the star student pick out a book after finishing the first book and I found myself reading this book almost everyday or every other day. I think the kids and I both new the words by heart. Its great though because the kids never got tired of it and I didnt eighter.
1400079179|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I kept me interested the whole time.  I didn't want to put it down.  I wish I had an encyclopedia with me when I read it, just to do some research, but it kept me so interested, I didn't even want to put it down to research certain things.  I highly recommend it to everybody with an open mind.
B00005JOQS|4.0|In a post 9-11 world, we have usually taken our heroes (comic book or otherwise) with a healthy dose of derangement.  Comic book hits like \\"Spiderman,\\" \\"Batman Begins\\" and Bryan Singer's \\"X-Men\\" films thrived and fostered on the darker, deformed sides of their eponymous superpowered warriors and the weighty themes of their stories.  And usually, the films were tremendous, as superhero, comic book flicks grew and matured beyond the juvenile stereotypes that the general public had for them.  But, for a while, it seemed we would no longer buy into heroes who were earnestly virtuous, and who did righteous deeds because they felt they had a responsibility to a higher cause.      But then, \\"Superman Returns\\" rolled around.  And even though it bears a couple nagging flaws, the most glaring of which is a somewhat sluggish pace, \\"Superman Returns\\" is by far one of the most ravishing, bustling and joyous films in years.  Its' by equal turns exciting and romantic, and in a refreshing change of pace, director Bryan Singer does not drive his film with angst, but with sincerity.  Not only will you believe again that a man can fly (the special effects and set pieces are spectacular), but that a man can be unambiguously moral.  The biggest triumph of this new \\"Superman\\" is it reminds all of us that it just might be possible to be Supermen on our own.      The film opens with the return of Superman (Brandon Routh, ably filling the shoes of the late Christopher Reeves) after a five year search to find the devastated remains of his homeworld.  Back in Metropolis, the Man of Steel, tries to reconnect with Lois Lane (a superb Kate Bosworth), only to find she has moved on to a new man (James Marsden) with whom she has sired a child.  But in the background, the malevolent Lex Luthor (a smarmy, gleefully vicious Kevin Spacey) has bought his way out of prison to fashion a new scheme to kill Superman and conquer the world.    Singer, and his writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, work hard, and succeed, to reestablish Superman for a new generation by first and foremost breathing new life into the romance between Supes and Lois Lane.  Routh and Bosworth are dynamic as two star-crossed lovers learning to how to relate to one another again and their performances yield emotional, heartfelt dividends.  Meanwhile, Spacey, a Singer Veteran from \\"The Usual Suspects,\\" has a ball as Lex Luthor, happily chewing scenery with the efficiency of a born baddie.  All told, \\"Superman Returns\\" with  surely be fondly remembered as one of the best films of the summer.
0736063684|5.0|Great book at a great price.  Everyone I've shown it to goes out and buys it.  The illustrations in it are so perfect even if you knowwhat you are working out it is an awesome resource to access simply because it is so full of detail.
B000FMGTTE|5.0|Once I saw Superman Returns, I went out and got the soundtrack.  Talk about outstanding score writing, Ottman is turning ears towards his style of music writing.  What makes it outstanding for me, is how much he does both his own style, and keeps the style of John Williams from the orginal Superman.  Very thematic, like Richard Wagner or Gustav Mahler.  You hear the theme over and over, and yet you still here new and fuller music as well.  Just another addition to the list of wonderful soundtracks out there.
B000F5GNX8|3.0|\\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" is a comedic murder mystery written and directed by Shane Black, based in part on the novel \\"Bodies are Where You Find Them\\" by Brett Halliday. It honors and spoofs many of the stylistic conventions of film noir and hard-boiled detective fiction: subjective voice-over narration, flashback sequences, an Everyman caught in desperate circumstances, an aloof, savvy private detective, tough-guy masculinity, and six-shooters. The titles that introduce each chapter as the mystery unfolds are titles of Raymond Chandler stories.<br /><br />Harry Lockart (Robert Downey, Jr.) was a small-time crook in New York when he stumbled into an audition for a detective film, was snatched up by an agent, and whisked to Los Angeles. Attending a party at the home of socialite Harlan Dexter (Corbin Bernsen), Harry is introduced to private detective Perry Van Shrike (Val Kilmer), who is consulting on the detective film. Harry also spots a pretty aspiring actress at the party, Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan), whom he discovers is his old friend and big crush from high school. Harry's agent has arranged for him to take detective lessons from Perry, so he accompanies Perry on a surveillance job. It turns out to be a harrowing evening when they witness the disposal of a murdered corpse and then learn that Harmony may have killed herself. Are the incidents unrelated, or is everything connected, in the style of a pulp detective novel?<br /><br />\\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" has some fun moments. It sends up both film noir and Hollywood culture but seems to be primarily concerned with getting laughs. I don't think I laughed. The parody is a little too in-your-face, cheesy, and superficial. Film noir and Hollywood lifestyles are so present in American media that I think audiences will find the spoofs in \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" too simplistic. People have a relatively sophisticated view of these subjects at this point. I was distracted by the film's lighting, which is oddly inappropriate in some scenes -to the extent that I repeatedly found myself wondering where the light was coming from. Harry and Harmony could not have attended high school together. The actors are 10 years apart and look it. \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" does have a quick enough pace that it didn't bore me. But it never engaged me either, so details that are amiss became glaring.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006): There is a \\"Gag Reel\\" (4 min), a theatrical trailer (2 min), and an audio commentary with writer/director Shane Black, Val Kilmer, and Robert Downey Jr. The commentary is conversational, with Kilmer talking a lot, Downey hardly ever, and Shane Black contributing some comments on camera work, audience reactions, performances, and filming. There is some commentary in every scene, though it isn't always informative. Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.y inappropriate in some scenes -to the extent that I repeatedly found myself wondering where the light was coming from.

B00005JP03|4.0|The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift gives the film watcher beautiful scenes of Tokyo, Japan.  Sean Boswell goes to live with his father to escape a jail sentence.  The viewer sees the interior of a typical small Japanese apartment.  There are scenes of all of the cramp rooms including the bath.  We with Sean attend a Toyko high school where the students' street shoes are placed in a cubicle located outside the classroom door.  Special slippers are worn in the classroom.  Sean encounters Japanese cafetria food.  He is put off by look of the food, but he tastes it and likes it.  There are shots a Japanese bath, parking garage, capsule sleeping quarters, Pachinko parlors, street vending machines and much more.  The film is great for those interested in life in modern Tokyo, Japan.  Also, The Fast and the Furious gives the viewer insight into the world of underground street drift racing.  The racing scenes on the mountain and street are awesome.

B000FMGTTE|3.0|Where is the Planet Krypton theme in the soundtrack? That is a must have for any Superman soundtrack. Other than that it was an ok soundtrack it didn't really pull me in. John Williams should have continued his role as the music composer he knows how to do it.
B000002AGM|5.0|When I get in my artsy-fartsy moods as I am prone to do on many occasions, I put on my old clothes, get my paints and brushes and a blank canvas, grab this CD and end on out to my garage/art studio. I put this thing on, and I get to work.<br /><br />I let the Spirit of all that is seen as well as all that is unseen move through me. I know about things creative, but still I think to myself when I hear this superb recording, \\"Oh, my God...where did he come up with this stuff?\\" Of course, Miles and Friends' really didn't come up with anything as much as they let the God of all that is seen as well as all that is unseen move through them, as them.<br /><br />And after a few hours of just creating and listening to this CD over and over and over again, I am Dizzy like a Sufi Mystic, reeling with joy what God has given me to be in my life.<br /><br />Make this recording a part of your heart...a part of your art...a part of your soul...a part of your life. Even if you're not a big jazz fan, you'll find it is agreeable in every way.<br /><br />Peace and Blessings
B000F48CD8|4.0|The obvious attraction for most will be the presence of Jack White but this is by no means a Jack White solo album or the kind of \\"group\\" albums made by Buffalo Springfield, CSN&Y, Eagles or latter day Beatles or Fleetwood Mac that ended up being mini solo albums. Jack is an organic part of a band with other significant talent here, one of which I'm excited to hear more. It harks back to the days when groups abundant with talent put all their eggs in the group basket rather than withhold their best for subsequent solo albums. The writing is the real star here. Clever, fresh, catchy and original at a time when derivation has never been more prevalent. The kind of songs that make you wonder why it took so long for someone to come up with something like that. The Raconteurs have been called a garage band but that's only if you played the likes of Led Zeppelin and Bad Company as well as the Stones, Zombies and Beatles in your garage.  If I had to fault this record at all, it would be for the band's adherence to a mid-60's garage band album length, about thirty minutes. But don't let that stop you, it's thirty worthwhile minutes.
B000002GYR|5.0|Tom Waits' first album sounds completely different than anything else he has done (except The Heart of Saturday Night). The music is jazzier, there is much more of an emphasis on the piano (which is usually very slow and pleasant) and he actually sings. There is almost no gruff to his voice at all, and it is surprising how much different of a sound it gives. The second half of the album is almost all slow sad songs that are almost primarily piano. It gives the feel of closing time for a lowlife kind of guy with nowhere else to go. Surprisingly to me, when I was first getting into to Tom Waits I listened to this album and I didn't like it, luckily I gave it another try recently and found that I was greatly mistaken. <br />All in all, a new favorite Waits album of mine, with some the most beautiful piano work of his career. A must for any fan.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|Gilmore Girls is the best show ever, and Season 5, in my opinion, is the best season so far. If you only buy 1 season, buy this one. Luke and Lorelai are finally together!!!! I'm so happy! So anyway, this is the best season of Gilmore Girls, so if you like G.G. , buy this now!
B000001E29|5.0|The most overlooked album Tom Waits has ever been a part of. The album is a mixture of maddening melodies with much emphasis on percussion, telling the story of the black rider. Songs like \\"Just the Right Bullets\\" help give listeners who haven't seen the play a chance to pick up on the story, where songs like \\"Oily Nights\\" just seem insane. But what is truly amazing about this album is that if you sit down and listen to it from beginning to end, then though the songs are all very different, they flow together very well. This seems to be the perfect project for Tom Waits, even more perfect for him than Franks Wild Years which he starred in. This music may be incredibly overlooked, but I have grown to find that it has become one of my favorite Tom Waits albums, because it is so unique. <br />Overall, I wish I could give it six stars, and that might lead people to actually listen to this album.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|Everyone knows and loves disc one, but disc 2 didn't turn my wheels too much. That's probably because I bought it because I loved the recorded versions of the songs on disc one as I remembered them when I originally bought this album.

B000FS9FC6|5.0|I've never read the graphic novel (and I never will cause reading SUCKS), but I don't think you need to read it to appericate the movie. I saw the film at it's premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival. Though it became a little weightly in experience. The story got so topical that I got seriously emotional during a lot of parts. Weaving did an excellent job with the mysterious title character \\"V\\", creating a poetic, intelligent, and compassionate yet ruthless character. Portman always seems to surprise me, except with her Star Wars character. She transforms completely throughout the movie. This movie also looked good in IMAX. Who I know cause I went and saw it again this time at the IMAX theater.

0446604844|2.0|This book was simply not up to Baldacci's usual quality.  The story goes all over the place, but doesn't get anywhere until the last 50 pages.  Even after 200, 300, and even 400 pages we are still chasing dead ends and no closer to figuring out where this thing is going.  I don't mind suspense, but you can stay \\"suspended\\" only so long until it becomes boredom.    The main character is the worst one Baldacci has ever created.  One minute she is crying her eyes out, and puking her guts out totally paralyzed by fear, and the next minute she is tracking down trained bad guys and saving the lives of the inept FBI agents and police.  This is repeated throughout the story.........I would think she had worn out all the emotional crap by the end of the book.  She makes one blunder after another resulting in the deaths of innocent people, but at the same time comes up with brilliant deductions that help her stay one step ahead of the mastermind killers.  By the end of the book I found myself pulling for the sadistic killer to finally finish this stupid [...] off.      This is one of those books to keep next to the bed in case you are having trouble sleeping.
