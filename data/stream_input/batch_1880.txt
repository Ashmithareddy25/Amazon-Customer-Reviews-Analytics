B00AA7O22U|5.0|Great to see these legends team up.  Enjoyed the jokes and inside humor too.  Glad to see Chuck Norris play a part.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Good movie, although, as always don't judge a book by it's movie. The book is better and I would suggest reading it if you like the movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Most enjoyable. My new addiction. Didn't think I would like this game so much. I was wrong. Gonna get back to playing.
0817439390|4.0|This was very helpful for me as a beginner to understand the camera functions and how it works best. I'd like to see more dedicatd to photographing indoor sports though. I got basic pointers from her and working knowledge of the camera, but had to look up additional help on line.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A wonderful story that makes me love my dog even more, beautifully written. I laughed, cried and wondered when I had last read such a magnificent read.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|I can't seem to review this book without giving a few major things away, so if you aren't a fan of spoilers you might want to skip this review... I am a disgustingly fast reader, and I read all three of these books within 2 weeks. The first two were intriguing and captivating, but by the start of this third one, I was exhausted. These poor kids are just screwed over and over and never seem to catch a break until they break out themselves, but even then they are tracked and followed by WICKED. I was hoping that by this book these kids would have discovered something useful or that their breakout would have stirred something bigger, but it just seems like the same ol' WICKED routine. Also, the concept of this last book seemed a little far fetched, with WICKED needing to kill of Thomas in order to succeed.. I guess I just felt like the science fiction began to wobble in this third book because there was no possible cure for the Flare. Any way, I still enjoyed this book but I was happy it was over and slightly disappointed with the way it ended even though the ending was super exciting. I guess I could see this book having a lot of different avenues it could take, and it took the same avenue as the last two.. I was hoping for some curve ball events. I also am attempting to read the prequel: The Kill Order and I just can't do it. I'm getting sick of cranks and story lines that are too similar.<br /><br />SPOILERS OVER- BUT I STILL LIKED THE SERIES. If your young teenagers have nightmares, don't let them read this before bed, and keep an eye on their mood when reading because this series does have the potential to affect young readers who get too deep into the story. Reviews are important and I read them myself too, but this is a personal evaluation- if you're interested take a chance and see how you like it!
B008L1DNGI|3.0|Great port of the Dreamcast original. Tons of puzzles, maybe not as many as the Gameboy Advance version though, which is kind of disappointing. No online multiplayer, which was on both the Dreamcast and iOS versions, is a pretty huge miss as well. Would go up to a 5 if it had online multiplayer.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|I'm so tired of Dashner's similar story lines and scary scenes... I can't even finish this. I've moved on to another book. Maybe it would've been different if I had read this prequel first rather than the Maze Runner Trilogy, but it's just too much, too sad. And I'm so sick of cranks!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I grabbed this app for my phone, and it works great! A+++ on this one!  I definitely recommended this game to people of all ages.  I love it as much as my kids.
0307592731|5.0|I completely enjoyed this book.  She did something that many of us admire but would never do, mainly because of fear of the unknown.  Hat's off to you Cheryl!
B0036BP6XQ|5.0|Great movie!Sandra Bullock does a great job playing her part!My son is 9 and loves to watch this movie over and over again.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Not the greatest headset in the world soundwise, but it really is worth the money. The microphone is very clear to all the people I am talking to and every feature works as advertised. The sound is very clear, the only reason I say it isn't the best is because there are much more expensive headsets that outdo this one.
0064430227|5.0|It will be a book that will remain in the child's library.  Enjoyed it a lot when checking it out.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|You pretty much know what's going to happen in the first 5 minutes, Giovanni's dance scene is creepy in the best way
0060254920|5.0|The book was a favorite of my children and will be great for my grandchild.  Looked for some time to get it.
0307474259|5.0|Great read  and very informative book. Helpful to me for my understanding and setting goals. Would recommend for sure to all
B004QBL4R2|4.0|A recent convert to the house of Paul.  Beck and gang evoke Paul very well, though other<br />influences (e.g. Elvis) are also in the song choice.  Beyond Beck and his masterful covers of<br />Paul tunes (How High the Moon, etc., what can't that guy play?), Imelda May is a remarkable new<br />talent.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|This book was recommended to me by Amazon for a long time, but it wasn't until I read how much Pat Rothfuss had enjoyed it that I decided to pick it up. I am so glad I did.<br /><br />Hounded has to have one of the most creative plots I've ever read. I'd always heard of Druids, but in the Stonehenge-building, humming sort of way. I never thought that a Druid could be badass and sexy, but boy, is Atticus ever!<br /><br />I thought the Earth-magic was really interesting and cool and I also love the way the character interacts with other supernatural beings and humans. Best of all, Atticus has a wicked sense of humor. There were several truly laugh-out-loud moments.<br /><br />I will be returning for the rest of the series. I can't wait to see what trouble Atticus gets into next!
B006O3MU96|4.0|I like the original Doodle Jump, so this was fun to play over the holidays. iThe game works well-I have had no problems.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I'm an avid oatmeal follower so naturally I had to buy this book. Matthew knows how to keep the masses happy. And I know if my cat is going to kill me. It's a win-win.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved this book! Had comedy and romance it it that truly made this reading experience great! Couldn't put the book down!
B006O6F932|1.0|I bought this for my 8 yr old daughter.  She couldn't even play with it cause it kept falling down. It's like a paper doll house. I don't understand why people are giving it such good reviews. It's junk. I'm just going to buy an old Barbie house and print it..lol
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game has always been rated highly. I finally had the chance to play it and am very impressed with it. I've only played a few levels but no problems so far. The game runs just fine on my Galaxy S3.
0525478817|5.0|I don't think a book has touched me this much in a long time.  Where to begin?<br /><br />First of all, this book is considered young adult, but I am 34 and read it because I was looking for something good to read.  I saw that it had been voted the best young adult novel of the year by Goodreads.com (I hope I'm accurate here; will have to double-check).  I had read the adult winners already, and the summary intrigued me.<br /><br />Hazel is a 16 year old girl who has had terminal cancer for the last three years.  Basically, she knows she is dying, doesn't know how much time she has left, and is understandably depressed and grappling with this and all that comes along with it.  At a cancer support group, she meets a survivor named Augustus Waters.  He has been cancer-free for over a year, had his leg amputated, but is otherwise in pretty good shape. The two of them become very good friends, and are obviously attracted to each other and want more.  However, Hazel is resisting this- becoming romantically involved- because she knows she's not going to be around forever (how much time she has is kind of vague, but it doesn't sound good), and wants to minimize the pain she causes him.<br /><br />What I like about this book as that, while the subject matter is depressing, Hazel and Augustus are so smart.  I love the way Green wrote them as these extremely smart and funny teenagers with all this insight and wisdom into the world, their disease, and human nature.  I have had family members with cancer, and the way he writes about their families is so honest.  While it was sad, parts felt so triumphant and had me laughing out loud.<br /><br />This is a love story that I feel resonates with all ages.  I couldn't put it down, and I know that Hazel and Gus will stay with me for a long time.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|The word \\"y'all\\" stands for you all.  As in it's plural.<br /><br />I have been with Mr. King since Firestarter.  I loved the tone and richness of this book as well.  The story is wonderful.<br /><br />However, whoever did his research on the setting in Texas was sloppy.  He doesn't know his \\"heinie\\" from wild honey.  The accents are all wrong.  The characters don't behave like the people who lived in Texas in this era.  After the 8th blunder, it became painful.<br /><br />I hope you like the phrase \\"the past is obdurate.\\"  The word \\"obdurate\\" occurs twenty-six (26) times in this book.  Ditto for \\"the land of ago\\", which occurs sixteen (16) times.  Harmonize and its other tenses, as in \\"the past harmonizes\\", appears 22 times.  *Sighs*<br /><br />Five stars for the story.  One star for laziness.
B001IXSU8M|5.0|Lady GaGa is fun to listen to and energetic. I greatly enjoy her music. Creative and fun to listen to.
B00902MCVY|5.0|If you like any form of music whatsoever, buy this and you will like them all less because its that epic.
B00330UFQS|5.0|Need You Now is a great song and a great CD. Lady A is pone of the very best country groups around, highly recommend them!
B008OOYALE|4.0|It is a fun game,  but I wish there was a way to give gold to more than one person a day.
B000002LSV|5.0|Excellent CD! I wore out my previous copy and look forward to doing the same with this one! All the great old hits!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|great cast ( i met them about 8 months ago) and a top notch show!!!! can't wait to buy season 3!!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Uno de los mejores BoxSet que se han hecho en BluRay a la fecha, todo es destacable y que decir del material adicional es un kick ass. Muchas horas de información.<br />Es un DEBER de TENER
B008RC72G8|5.0|great movie. good for the hole family!!  johnny depp is great as always! even the wife like it. and she was a fan of the old tv show.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Haber comprado la preventa de este filme fue lo mejor, a un precio muy economico e inferior al actual. Posee bastante material adicional y la calidad en audio e imagen es sorprendente. Una de las mejores trilogías filmadas. Un deber!
1449410243|5.0|The artist and author understands cats! One of the best cat books I've read. Ever cat-lover will recognize his/her own animal. Highly recommended!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Such an awesome inspirational movie!!<br />A Recommended movie for everyone.<br />Would also recommend Fireproof & Facing the Giants DVDs too.
B004HWKWL4|5.0|Have read this book 20 years ago and found it calming. Since then, I buy one for close friends who have recently lost a loved one.
B009JBZH54|3.0|If I had paid for just the blu-ray discs of the movies, this review would be five stars.  But when one of the selling points is a digital copy, I want my digital copy to actually be useful to me.  UltraViolet is not.  It's a pain to create an account, and a much bigger pain to actually watch the content that you've paid for.  Just trying to use the UltraViolet digital copy is one of the worst customer experiences I've ever had with a product.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|Pretty good performance for the money. Running windows 8, idling at 8 -10 degrees. easy install. What more can I say.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|One would think Dark Shadows with Johnny Depp directed by Tim Burton would be thoroughly entertaining, but it just doesn't turn out that way. The movie starts out as a campy, nostalgic and fun comedy, but it runs out of humor after about the first 15 or 20 minutes. After the charming introduction is over, the movie proceeds to laboriously suck the life out of anyone watching it and everyone in it. The weak script relies on way too much gratuitous action that seems meaningless and boring.  If you are planning on watching this movie, prepare to be disappointed.
1250027624|5.0|Gorgeous, gorgeous book!  I LOVE this complete digest of who's who, their backstories, their lives, why they do what they do, their clothing, their customs of the times, everything you wanted to know about Downton Abbey and more.  This book is full of full color photos from the series.  I highly recommend this book for the serious DA fan.  Be aware, for the US fan who has not yet seen Season 3, there are spoiler alerts, but this is a beautiful book and well worth the small price for a large hardbound book.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|This book was sooo funny and honest. I love David's stories and read all his books after starting with this. The others were mostly good as well (save Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk), but this was probably my favorite.
0553386794|5.0|I couldn't put this down until I finished it, and somehow I had to work inbetween and sleep and eat and talk to my family.  This book follows so closely to the series first season, and I was very happy about that.  It was easier to visualize the characters, the clothing, the scenes on the Wall, and all the fighting after having watched Season 1 first.  I am now in the second book and will be watching Season 2 soon.  I have enjoyed this series best of all fantasy books.  I highly recommend this book.  It is easy reading and not weird at all with the slight bit of otherworldly animals, people, settings.
1449415881|5.0|I bought this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas and my dad loves it. I had to take it away from him until the new year because he wanted to read through all of the comics already! The colors are great and the comics are... well... typical Dilbert. Very funny.<br /><br />Nice gift for someone who works in an office and wants a good chuckle every morning.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|This book is not well written.  It has a very jumpy timeline, and uninteresting, even for a Harlequin Romance.  I find it unbelieveable that someone will get slightly drunk, get married and forget the basic events.  I read the first 5 chapters and then got bored and deleted the book off my Kindle.  I wasn't entertained, so unless you love spotty plots, it wasn't worth reading past the chapter pages.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|we enjoyed watching it. very good quality. worth the money we paid for. this is one of our favorite movies specially on 3d.
1451695187|5.0|Very enlightening.  It is not &#34;new&#34; to an individual that has a faith.  The difference with this book is that a man of science wrote it - not a child's view or a pastor's.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I already return kindle Fire, this is not what I want for myself and my family. I got google android.
B001EBWITA|3.0|A lot of people I know hate this movie. The comic book nerds I know go on and on about how Reeves will never really be John Constantine, how Constantine is NOT an American, etc. etc. Then the people who hate comics tell me it's too silly, the story is lacking and well, Reeves doesn't quite manage the right of air of badass, instead coming across as a d****** bag. Personally, I enjoy watching the movie. Yes, the story is a bit weak, and yes, Keanu Reeves is NOT John Constantine. What I enjoy are the visuals. I enjoy the costumes, the props and the sets. Well, I also enjoyed the performance of Peter Stormare as Satan. In the end, I enjoyed the world the movie was set in, I just didn't enjoy the story that I was told in that world as much.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|I Like it a lot.  There is a great selection of pieces.  The only problem is that there are a few really difficult pieces and it's very hard to play on such a small keyboard.  The keys are very small for my fingers.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|If you pick up this DVD, you pretty much know what you'll get.<br />The  story goes like this:  After Steven Soderbergh learned that Tatum Channing used to work as a male club dancer, he came up with this idea of making a film about a male club dancer starring Tatum Channing.<br />Steven Soderbergh assembled a good young cast headlining by TC and Matthew McConaughey as a jaded leader.<br />Other than allowing Tatum to display his dancing prowess and engagingly supported by his teammates, the storyline is very bland and predictable that it is not a very meaningful or rewarding movie viewing experience, unless watching good-looking men half-naked doing suggestive dance numbers is good enough.<br />Steven Soderbergh seems to have a penchant to make films with diluted drama and under-developed plot lines which was entirely intentional.<br />This is a film mainly for and appreciated by the female audiance.<br />Soderbergh has been churning out similar types of small films for years, with the exception of \\"Traffic\\" of course.
B0052YAKS6|5.0|If you music, get this disc, so many different artists, dance and rap, get this disc, get this disc, you wont be disappointed, thanks amazon.
B009SQRC9E|4.0|I played this movie for my daughter's slumber party two days before Christmas. It kept a group of 6 and 7 year old girls sufficiently entertained for 90 mins. Some of the dialogue was a little over their heads and the movie lulled in some parts but overall I thought it was worth the purchase. Good, clean, holiday fun for the entire family!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I've never  read on  Ellen's books before but I watch her show quite often. This book had me laughing and giggling so often I probably should have  been on  kindle commercial. I highly recommend this book!
1593081154|5.0|My brother had me order this on my account and he was very pleased with the book and arrival time.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I bought this album after buying his second that just came out either last month or earlier this month. This one is just as great as the second. I never have to skip any songs!
B005LAIH4A|4.0|We saw it at the movies and loved the movie.  We have not seen the actual video yet to be sure the quality is good, but we will and if for some reason we do find an issue, we'll revisit this review.
B004U52VPS|4.0|This toy is sturdy, portable, and provided a lot of fun for two six-year olds on Christmas day. I would buy more of this type.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good book,very interesting  don't really know what else to say glad I got it keeps. Me very busy while I'm at work
B008MG1E4A|4.0|My husband enjoyed reading this book on his kindle so much that he bought our son a copy for Christmas.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I have read better books in this series and i just thought it wasn't as funny as the others and it shouldn't cost $6.65
1612183956|4.0|Wayward Pines, Idaho, seems like the quintessential American small town. The scenery is beautiful, and everyone seems happy, yet something is amiss, as Ethan Burke discovers. A Special Agent with the U.S. Secret Service, Burke has come from his home in Seattle on a mission to track down two fellow agents who have gone missing. However, a car accident upon arriving in Wayward Pines delays his investigation, and as he recovers, he realizes that behind the idyllic façade, a sinister force is at work. Why does the passage of time seem so distorted for the residents? Why won't anyone help him contact the outside world? And, most importantly, why can't he seem to leave? Peppered with flashbacks to his days as a Chief Warrant Officer during the Iraq War, the journey upon which Burke embarks is both horrifying and unique. Readers will be unable to put this thriller down, and the dramatic, revelatory ending will keep them thinking far beyond the final page.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|One of the few classics that are highly engaging. I loved the warmth of love, family, and friendship this book teaches us.
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|Total Recall was action packed and featured some great chase scenes.  I watched it with a couple of friends, and we never quite really understood what the big boss was trying to acomplish or why?  Take over and rebuild the &#34;colony&#34; for rich people after the giant apocalyptic biological germ war?  It would be like America invading China to tear down the factories to build gated communities.  Where would we get our &#34;stuff.&#34;  In any case, this is a movie with a bunch of strung together fight scenes and futuristic chases.  It was Ok.
1451613512|4.0|Good read.  Nice to know the real history of the US.  And how gas<br />prices got here and payola began.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Movie is very entertaining and moving story. If you are looking for a family movie I thinks this is a good one, but not for younger children.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I really liked the book. I liked all the twists. I kinda wanted an epilogue but you can't always get your way.
034580404X|5.0|Raunchy so I am told but it is what was asked for, wife has already burned through the first book
B003WUYRGI|4.0|It's pretty interesting...I really like it, it's pretty helpful, fun. If you're thinking about getting it get it and I'm not kidding around get it
145210655X|5.0|This book is just awesome and very very cool!  It has made me laugh a lot and see a side of the Master that I never thought I would see.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This book gave a lot of facts but in my opinion it's boring to read but fun to learn about who did what and who made what that's why I liked it but I didn't want to read it. But when I did started even tho it was boring I could not stop
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The movie was perfect! The music is even better! and now I can listen and sing at home. hope this wins an oscar!!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|A great app overall, the prices in the shop are a little high so I recommend tapping the cars and planes to earn a little extra kibble. The app does have some fun games but not very many and you can only play them once and then you have to wait a certain amount of time but other than that great app.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I will have fun with my new Kindle Fire HD and use the camera a lot when the weather gets better, cold and snow right now. Can't get out. What I have managed indoors is excellent.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a true Nicholas Sparks book. It had a wonderful love story and suspense. I was glued to the book and read it in two days. I love Nicholas's books and this was another amazing one.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is a good way to stay in touch with the goings-on of all my family and friends., Easy to use.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I still have no idea why you'd put a dictionary on a kindle... especially when people that but expect it to have sum top picked books and if somethings free it's free and I don't have to put in my credit card number. I'm returning this dumb thing. I have to enter a CREDIT CARD NUMBER for something FREE? =.= do I feel smart when I say that .-.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|My whole family loved this movie.  We've all heard different variations of how Santa started out, but this one had that little something extra special.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Must read! It exceeded all my expectations! I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a honest and good book to read.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Enjoyed reading the book.  Wanted to keep up with what the younger set is reading.  Like to be able to discuss books with the grandkids.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|One of the better shows.  Cable lives up to the hype own this one.  Superb acting and writing.  It stayed fresh for the whole season.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I tried the various players and almost gave up on the possibility of viewing videos from my kindle fire hd's hard drive until I found MoboPlayer. I can't explain any of the technical details, but it works and the 720p is beautiful. Don't waste your time with avia or vista or hd player. Get MoboPlayer.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|I read the bad reviews in order to understand why people didn't like this amazing book, and I see that most people was expecting to read either about the movies or about his mistakes in life. People, c'mon, this is an Autobiography! If you are looking for read about gossips, try elsewhere !<br /><br />This book is about how Arnold became a legend in Bodybuilding and in Movies. It's almost a self help book, where Arnold details how he succeed in life.<br /><br />I do believe this is one of the most inspiring books I have ever read. Wasn't expecting to learn stuff that I can use in my life, so, this was a big surprise, and I plan to re-read the book again.<br /><br />If you are a fan, you will love it. If you want to understand how Arnold became this amazing successful person, you will find this here in the book too. If you need a book to inspire you, get it now !
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie was fabulous! So many big name actors along with great production and writing. Probably the greatest large budgeted movie ever. Must see for anyone who has seen the first Dark Knight. And if you haven't, I recommend you do so immediately.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another excellent book from my favorite popular author!<br />Those who have stated in their reviews that this book moves too slowly or is generally not exciting until the end of the book have missed the very thing that students of Bosch and of Michael Connelly's writing find so intriguing.  Connelly continues to provide the reader with a unique look into the psyche and the motivations of &#34;Harry&#34; Bosch, one of the very interesting ongoing characters in this genre.  We see in  Bosch, the detective-father, great concern for his relationship with his daughter, we see in Bosch, the detective-former soldier, the impact of brutal assignments in the tunnels of the Viet Cong, we see in Bosch. the detective-with-a-conscience, a desire to bring justice even for those forgotten by time and convenience.  In this novel, we are brought to the continued realization that this is a man who wants to live by a code of honor and has to balance that code with his past psyche.  Yet, he manages to drive himself with the thought that &#34;they all count or no one counts&#34;.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of the book gives us yet another look into what it must be like to be Harry Bosch as he fights his demons and authority and the easy road, to progress from little in the way of clues to another exciting conclusion. I also find the description of the process of detective work to be a rewarding benefit to this kind of read.<br /><br />I wait eagerly for the next Connelly novel!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|A good action movie.  A bit hard to follow with all the flashbacks.  Helps if you have a rough idea of the story before watching.<br />We experienced problems with the sound consistency.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This story is ecellently crafted and solid with great characters and story line.  At first you may think the story is tedious, but then you find yourself immersed in Mark Whatneys' world and fight with him as he stuggles to live.  The entire concept is realistic and conceivable with great narration to explain things.  A wonderful story that is a 'Must Read' for anyone who wants a great read.  You'll Love this.
1449417051|5.0|This book cracks me up! Great for those crazy cat lovers and the crazy cat lady down the street. ;)
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is great! My only request is that they add MORE characters like if u earn all the characters you get the all mighty character.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Couldn't put it down! It was a book full of life's biggest truths and I could deeply relate. Must read.
1250006341|4.0|This is pretty much what you'd expect: a light bit of reading to round out some of the background on the life & times, in general, of that period.  It does a nice job blending historical events with things happening in the series
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really liked this book. I would recommend it to my friends. That like to read these kind of books.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|I thought this book was excellent - it is not my usual reading genre but this one was very well written and kept me entranced.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A great read, it grabs you  from the first word and doesn't let go. I couldn't put it down. It's everything, everyone said it is. Ready for part two.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|There is constant stopping of the video stream. If you wait for the service to reconnect, it jumps back to the beginning of the movie. Which has you stopping the video to refresh the system. I would not reccomend this service to anyone. Plus watch out for double billing for the same movie.Happened to me already.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This is my first reading of a Crouch book.  I was intrigued by his twist on an old subject and his subject presentation.<br />Some passages describing the characters past military exploits were too long for my liking, but on the whole, this was well worth reading.<br />I would certainly take the time to enjoy another writing by Blake Crouch.
B006O3MU96|2.0|boring. very boring. my kids don't like it. no body wants to play it. it's just taking space. yup it is.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think this book is grate for the whole family ,and it is very funny many you can share it with you friends to.
0316056863|5.0|I'm sorry but I just think Tina Fey is really funny.. What's more to say? Good stories. Same sense of humor she had on SNL
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I like this book because it lets me explore all the words I need to learn about. Thanks Kindlefire you really make me happy.
B0096YJDNQ|4.0|This app brings strong functionality and clean design and is more capable than any other app I have been able to find that will run on Kindle Fire and Fire HD
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This film merely skims the top of the Bourne series, dipping a toe into action scenes, then abruptly ending without ever deveoping the characters into real people. I was very disappointed.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|My husbands favorite Christmas movie for Christmas time. We watch the 25 days of Christmas on family channel. Now we can watch this one without commercials
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I play this for hours and completely lose track of time.  My four year old granddaughter saw me playing and quickly learned the rules.  Now she beats my times!
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Great movie.  I hope they continue makie the series, as all of them are great combination of drama, action and suspense.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love Downton Abbey  and most all British movies.  I will be watching more of this series in the furture
B0098VYCCE|4.0|A lot of the best scenes were placed on the trailer, which is a little disappointing.  Overall the movie was still great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is a tragic and beautiful story all rolled into one! This one will leave an imprint on your soul!
B008VO3PA4|5.0|i don't particularly even like cats , but i LOVED this ! It's a hoot ! Laughed so hard , I about peed myself .
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Not a great movie, but it was a better than average dumb action movie.  The whole memory thing is interesting, but really, this movie is all about the action.  I really liked the look of the world they created as well.  I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys action/sci-fi and isn't really picky about a movie being \\"great cinema\\"
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Both my husband and I enjoyed this movie. Ted is cute, which I liked, and he's funny in your Family Guy way, which made my husband crack up. I would highly recommend this!
B002ZG997C|5.0|Love this movie, as it shows the awsomeness  of God to do the unexpected to what the norn of human conception
034580404X|5.0|Very good reading.  These books were very hard to put down.  I now have my sister reading them.  It is a fantasy every woman would love to experience.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Where's My Perry is an interesting and fun game that appeals especially to kids, since a lot of kids love Phineas and Ferb. In my opinion, Agent P is the best part of the show, so this app is great because it features him. I definitely recommend buying this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME IN THE WIDEST WORLD. It takes a while for you to save enough coins to buy characters.
0743270754|5.0|I've loved Doris Kearns Goodwin as an author. What impressed me most about this book was the fact that there are 121 pages of notes relating to pages, and 33 pages in the index. It is a masterfully written account of President Lincoln's life in politics and very well researched as indicated above. Run don't walk to your account and buy this book!
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Always exciting, intriguing stories by Michael Connelly.Love Harry Bosch & the pickles he gets into.Don't know how he manages to survive each time. If you're a fan this is a must read.
8866130931|5.0|This is one of the best journals available. I like the way it is presented and page layout: nice and compact without being a large heavy book.
1594630844|4.0|I was curious what elderly folks across the board have to pass on to the next generation. This book sounds like a lot of interviews were conducted, but &#34;is that all there is?&#34; the most important thing I gleamed from this reading is to take better care of my body. I already knew that, but now I know more about why. Lots of folks live longer than they anticipate they will and pay dearly for violating personal health care along the way.
B008WCP2KG|2.0|Movie was a dud. Not enough dancing,poor script.just not good over all disappointing. The script was unbearable and slow. Over all the movie a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Just goes to show that love stories with odd twist span the ages.  Is a great story if you like stories with depth.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Check this app every day for weather conditions !! Don't know how I managed w/o it.  Told other Kindle Fire owners about it and they are now using it ll the time too!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My husband has been playing this game since he gave me my Kindle for Christmas. He says it is really addicting and he keeps wanting to play to beat the different levels.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|awful . only gives about 10 news feeds.  can`t use the whole site . I might just delete it. I would not recommended it if you like to browse around FB.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|its a quick read that will get you out of the every day blahs.  some funny parts and some serious all in all its a good quick read
B009WO7NQO|1.0|her the one mobile app from 1mobile. com it rocks and has a ton of apps that aren't on amazon.  I got this app for free with all of the levels and I love it!!
B0079R8IYW|5.0|Perfect for the Kindle Fire.  It definitely protects the Kindle Fire from hard knocks, and it's very versatile and easy to store.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|My jaw literally dropped at the price. A great up-and-coming, Grammy-nominated band with an album on here for six bucks? SOLD.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|repetitive dialogue was the worst part. This book could have, and probably should have been much shorter. As long as the love scenes were still steamy it would have been a hit anyway. But, the female character Anastasia really needs to analyze her own insecurities and figure out why she would feel obligated to follow through with souch an unstable relationship when she clearly knows this is not her personality and has so little in common with this man. I don't care how gorgeous he is. Not a COMPLETELY terrible story but it holds no real weight on it's own without the somewhat intense love scenes and media attention.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|This the most boring book I have EVER read.  The author does not describe the characters, the locations, the cars.  The main character is so poorly presented the reader cannot develop any feeling for or against him.  The same applies to ALL of the characters in this book.  The story reads like a story told by a two year old:  Mal did this, then the FBI did this, then Mal did this, and then and then ...  Don't waste your money.
1400032717|4.0|After discussing the topic of my young autistic relative, a coworker of mine suggested I read this book. He was right I loved it! Such a wonderful thing to know a little more about how the mind of a young person with autism MIGHT feel. I say &#34;might&#34; because obviously everyone is different and not every diagnoses is the same. But the principles are still there. The focus on specific enjoyed things, the social awkwardness. The author obviously did his research and worked very hard to portray the main character is an accurate light.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Good free book to read. Enjoyed it a lot and was an easy read. I would read from this author again.
B002ZG976U|4.0|At first I was anxious about watching \\"Burlesque\\" because I am a HUGE Christina Aguilera fan, and feared that her acting skills would lessen my opinion of her. So many female talented vocalists have tried, and tried again to transition into an acting career with cringing results. However, I am glad to report that I was blown away by her passion, and how she brought Allie to life! I really was impressed, even her dancing was amazing! Still, I felt that \\"Burlesque\\" was lacking in certain areas, and it is because of this that I gave it four stars.<br /><br />I really felt like the script could have been better in some areas. I don't want to give away spoilers, but after you've seen the movie, I think you'll know what I mean. It needed more attention, and I think with a bigger budget the story could have been flushed out better.<br /><br />Some parts of the movie were just plain awkward. Cher singing a song that really had no place in the progression of the storyline. In one scene, Allie [Christina Aguilera] asks a woman what kind of shoes she was wearing, the woman responded, \\"They're Christian Loubatans.\\" I wouldn't have cared that she pronounced it incorrectly, but the camera zoomed in on her face, emphasizing how awakward the moment was.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Who doesn't like the most watched show on Television?  Love it. Can't wait for it to come back on in February.
B0006N2EZ0|2.0|Missing the beautiful ending of her singing the great song, etc. Dissapointing!!<br />That was the biggest reason I wanted this and I am dissapointed in it.
B007SGM084|5.0|This series draws you in and keeps you interested from start to finish. Well written indeed, a definite reader pleaser!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Years of wondering and waiting the ominous quirky events in Pendergast's life &#34;The Guys&#34; (Preston and Child) still leave us hanging at the end.........but..that's why we love them..no matter what the story
B0082RHRHC|2.0|Ok. Just started. Hope navigation gets easier. I like the concept of listen and move about.. do not like the need to review...
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Good story without being stupid. Plot & characters are believeable.  Buy or rent and enjoy yourself to a pleasant experience.
1451695195|2.0|It was far too full of medical details and things that  were not relevant to the title. A lot of it was just plain boring and at the end of the book I felt that I had got nothing out of it at all. No details of  the afterlife were explained at all.
B004JK61K0|1.0|An upgrade trashed all the existing setttings. Get off my phone, you piece of garbage!<br />word word word word word
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|Great rendition of the original Total Recall movie!  I definitely recommend this movie to every sci-fi movie fanatics.  Great non-stop action!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is so addicting! There are a few little issues, like the birds not doing what they are supposed  to do when I tap on the screen, but it happens rarely. Awesome game! Can't wait to get the next one :-)
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Always have loved this game, so glad it was offered free on Christmas.  This made my holidays that much better
B00005JPD0|5.0|Anyone who loves a little sci-fi mixed with reality will love this.  One of Denzel's best performances...he just amazes me. I loved everything about this movie...the action without a lot of violence, and the way it builds the excitement and the suspense. This is one I could watch more than once for sure.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|I did not like this movie at all it had some really gross sex scenes and was a confusing movie
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I can truly say this movie had my adrenalin pumping nonstop. Even though it starts out slow, I loved the humor of the two characters as they become friends while working on the railroad. I loved Denzel playing a blue collar worker with lots of intelligence due to being engineer for many years.  I know some railroad workers and they both played their parts wonderfully bringing unstoppable suspense of what could happen on the railroad.
030758836X|5.0|While I haven't started reading it yet because of the holidays, the condition of the book is excellent and I got an unexpected good price for the hardback.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|There is SpongeBob stuff everywhere, but it can be hard to find a cute Gary.  We were pleased with him when we (finally) found him!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I liked the book because it was funny and realistic. It was a good book. I would recommend it to others. You would like it!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use the The Weather Channel App, because I find it easy to use, and very reliable, from the Weather Channel.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enhoy a good game of solitare just like the next guy and this app seems to be ok I have not had it very long but so far so good.
1594488886|5.0|This book totally captivated me from beginning to end. I was amazed at how much I felt wrapped up and in the book and the characters.  I read it b/c my book club of women suggested it.  I will always be thankful for the awesome experience it gave me.  It will remain my all time favorite book until something else beats it (which will be a difficult task)! :)
B00006WUWN|3.0|If you haven't seen one of these you should.  It will make anyone laugh at all the comical things that are said throughout the movie.  Wouldn't buy anymore because &#34;one&#34; movie like this is enough
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This is one of those movies I had seen previews for all the time on TV and so I decided to go ahead and rent this movie to stream at home. It is a very interesting movie, but not quite what I was expecting it to be, but you definitely needed to keep watching to see how it would all end. I am all about quirky movies and this is definitely one of those movies with unique characters and storylines that you would only see in a movie like this, and for that reason I was a fan.
0061733199|5.0|Got it as a gift but took a good look at it and it is packed full of information that everyone can use especially if something happens or if you get lost.  You can at least learn how to survive if it just you and your boogie bag
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love all this bible offers.  Higlhight, underline and audible capability.  God's word is always wit me!  One of the most popular bible.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this app is so fun but i wish you could make a toca hair Salon 3 with more characters or just update this one. I love the faces and sound the characters make and that they follow each move you take. l also love the way the hair flows and moves with your tools. this game is also so adicting but it is not a bad thing,  it is a good thing. it is a time killer if your waiting for something to happen also.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|My son could not stop reading and I could hear him laugh all the time. Too bad that these books are so short.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The newsfeed or individual pages won't show below the first few posts, it's very annoying not being able to scroll down.  I don't have this problem on my Android phone, only on the Kindle Fire HD.
0545425115|5.0|Just read, and for the record this was the first book I have read on a Kindle. I got this off the Kindle lending library.<br /><br />The story is reminiscent of John Christopher's \\"Tripods\\" series [[ASIN:0689856725 The White Mountains]] I read as a kid... and if you enjoyed the \\"Hunger Games\\" check out these books.<br /><br />I am not the target audience for this book, but when I was younger I loved books like this. Like everyone says this was a real page turner, but reading it on the Kindle, I was not ready for it to end and it did! Do yourself a favor, no matter what your age, if you enjoy well written Sci Fi or underdog stories try reading this book and see how it sucks you in.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|The movie is a great for star trek fans and for those that have never seen an episode of the original show. I'm looking forward to the sequel.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Great way to keep in touch with news, friends, follow friends, and news links Why do I need six  words to post this is my thoughts it is a great app keep this app for all. When I need to know news events just twitt and twit my thoughts when I need someone to hear me
B0081SPK0I|1.0|Like other reviewer, app won't run on Droid 3.  Get the following error:<br /><br />ASSERT EXCEPT: runtime_error:* Could not compile shader<br />graphics_android.sl (type:FRAGMENT)<br />-- Info Log --<br />Compile failed.<br />-- Snip --<br />>>> (line 0)<br />  #define HAS_STEX0<br />---------<br />- /Users/dtebbs/android/dev/okmain/DGameSystem/src/<br />ShaderProgram.cpp 232<br /><br />Contacted developer, hopefully a fix is coming.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Its ok but kinda difficult to use at times ppt needs to be more user friendly.  Good for now until we find a better app
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Very fun for the whole family.  No crude humor -- which I hate!  NIce message and I loved the accents!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked this book for the most part. I couldn't stand how the author made Conner so hard and so afraid to fall in love. I don't want to give away the ending but lets just say I was pleased with the ending. This book might make a good romantic comedy chic flick :)
031606792X|5.0|This was the fourth and final installment of the Twilight series and I had not read it yet.  Had to purchase before the movie came out.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I haven't finished reading it yet but it has been very good information for me. It is easy to read although itsnanlittle over the top for the average reader with all the pathophysiology of the wheat and its effects on the human body. If you think you might be allergic or intolerant to wheat this book will give you more than adequate information to act and follow the wheat free life
B008DM4OTA|3.0|The response is not great for screen actions but the graphics are good and may be fine for a preschooler. My daughter is still to young to make this a good fit for her.
B001FGD19A|5.0|Love this book and wanted a hardcopy of it. Read it several times since 1994. John Grisham is really good
B008NABUU8|3.0|The games looked clean and pretty but the response when placing joints close was frustrating. Sometimes it seemed the calculations were unrealistic based on real life bridge design.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Have you ever wanted to create a park like zoo filled with dragons.  In Dragonvalenyou can breed dragons compete them in races and you can get limited time dragons likenthe appacalepse dragon
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing. From the times it had me on the edge of my seat to the times I just wanted to cry. This book makes you feel whatever sky/hope is feeling.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|My college age daughter pulled this movie up online Christmas afternoon.  We had teenagers, 40 somethings and grandma in watching it together and we all loved it.  I'm sure if we had younger kids, they would have too.  Great script and story and a very touching message.  Highly recommend.
B00571F26Y|4.0|It was a good book but way more history of wheat than I cared to read.  Good info though.  My wife and I have been off wheat for 3 weeks and feel great.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee always does well with his Jack series. Was a little disipointed he didn't explain what happend to Jack after the preceding book. But loved it.<br />So why why why Tom Cruse????? He should be he &#34;star&#34; of wimpy kid NOT Jack
0811879542|5.0|I love this book. It is great for children who know their colors and can follow very, very simple directions. It's so remarkably put together and I enjoy reading it as well!
B006O7XOOW|5.0|Love it. Baby enjoys it. W<br /><br /> 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Thanks
B00632HWOG|2.0|While brand new to kindle fire hd, downloaded yahoo mail app rather wasy and overall Kindle is very intuitive. Problem cam when trying to ender username and password. The username allowed me to get to the 5th alphanumeric in my uid and would not allow anymore entries. Frustrated after many attempts and give up for now.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|My son loves it! Best gift he has received in a long time! My husband and brother now want one!
098357670X|5.0|Great colors, love the glossy paper. Just a nice looking book although I do not feel it should cost that much for a paperback
030759565X|5.0|Having followed the Smitten Kitchen blog for the last year, I eagerly awaited the release of this cookbook. It does not disappoint! Beautiful layout and pictures with step-by-step discussion of the recipes. Can't wait to try them all.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|Rayman Jungle Run is an awesome game especially if you're a fan of the endless running game genre!  The graphics look amazing on the Samsung Galaxy S III.  DON'T HESITATE buying this game!  It would have been worth the full price (I purchased it on sale.)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This app is fun and addicting. Kind of like Mario but who cares. I totally recommend this app. I HAVE A FEELING YOU WILL LOVE IT AS MUCH AS ME!
0470913029|5.0|Clean up your diet for the new year.  It only takes a couple of weeks to feel and see the difference.  Eat clean.  No junk.  No processed foods or ingredients you can't pronounce.  Be good to your body.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is great for passing time. It lets you play a wide variety of games when you earn enough points to buy it. Totally reccomend this app for waiting on the bus or car, waiting for siblings classes to be done, and for just playing!
B007SSEBCU|5.0|Watched twice, once when it was released and now. I think this is a very good story of a woman leader
B005HSL626|3.0|It is awesome!  You get three strikes before you die. If you hit a bomb, you blow up!  Kinda cool
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Awesome game ... very addictive.  The graphics and story will grab you and the music will soothe you and the game hypnotize you.  If you want escape this is it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun to play over and over.  Very Catchy!  It takes awhile to unlock all the characters and to get used to it, but is is stinking awesome!
B0024F08UG|5.0|Being a firefighter for many years it is a must-see for all of us, and for those who wish they could be in our boots.  Visual quality is beyond great, with color that &#34;knocks the nozzle out of your hands.  Paul Newman and Steve McQueen are fantastic and this is an adventure classic from the king of the disaster movies, Irwin Allen.
B0086700CM|4.0|challenging!  The turns take a little to get used to.  You just tilt to get the coins.  Who would not love to run from MONKEYS?
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's a wonderful book that I would suggest to many readers. I personally can't wait for the movie of this book to come out.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I really wish facebook would keep its personal games off this site.  I have no desire to facebook.  I just want to play games.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I loved the books & I have watched all the movies. I love every book & so far, I love every movie.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I felt it was very challenging to build the structures strong enough to achieve my goal.  Prepares you for an engineering degree...LOL
B005HSL626|5.0|Sometimes I play this when I get pissed & need to laugh. It is fun to destroy something that is not real & still get the feeling & it is FREE!!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Getting to fly on creative mode is really cool.  You get to punch animals and take their meat..this makes me laugh.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Great view of the life in Brooklyn with it's seedy side and the warmth of the family relationships and the close family structure.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|It is just not that fun.  It is too hard to figure out.  I was very disappointed since I had heard soooo much about angry birds.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I absolutely love Adele's music so am excited to have the CD.  I would recommend any Adele CD to anyone.
B009HELT3C|5.0|We picked this movie because my husband's brother works for Sony, and he worked on the making of this project.<br />Overall, fantastic and waiting to see it again.<br />Recommended for anyone. Fun, funny and out of this world!<br />Sunny Arizona
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|The Polar Express is one of my favorite Christmas movies so I decided to purchase it in blu-ray to add to my collection for enhanced enjoyment.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I really like this show. I don't get Showtime anymore so I just buy the dvd. This series is great, it really keeps you guessing!
B009VB97EY|2.0|This movie disappointed. It had a semi-decent story line, but I expected more. Not more stripping, there was plenty of that. Not sure how it could have been done differently (except maybe a more exciting ending).
B004HO6I4M|3.0|My grandchild was really excited to see this never been viewed animated cartoon.  I am waiting to see how he liked it but it seems to be very entertaining.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is a lot of fun!! I love the unnatural and eerie and this game doesn't disappoint. It's challenging if you don't focus and mind your surroundings but once you unlock the next step, you won't be able to resist going on. I love it. So fun!!!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|It was just so so.  I like Johnny Depp, but this didn't impress me.  No I would not recommend it.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Bought these for the wife last year and never got around to rating it but it is a 5 start item for sure.
B008V59AFW|4.0|great recording and the live show is great on the other 2 disc, and the 4 pictures in set make it complete
B004UID2LC|1.0|it kept saying that my free trial was over something like that and I dint really like that I had to get off it n go back it
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Really great book.  I loved the ending. Although Eva did get on my nerves about mid way though their book. I keep reading. And I really like what the author did for there relationship. I can't wait for the next book. I need to know what happens next.....
B0095R6OBS|1.0|Horrible unbelievable characters does not date the film, in the 1930's they hired real actors. Just a solid piece of crap, Worthy of a high school project but not worthy of 1.99 rental, and definitively sub par for a renowned director.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|The best Christmas movie ever!!! This movie incapsulates the real American family around the holidays. It seems like the older I get the more I realize every family has a Cousin Eddy!!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I figured I would give Amazon a try it was only $2.<br />I downloaded it to one computer and without watching it<br />tried to move it to the main computer in the living room<br />since everyone decided they wanted to see it.<br />Well you can forget it!<br />I put it on a usb drive took it in the living room nope.<br />So I tried steaming or downloading it on the computer in the living room nope<br />Unbox would nor even show it as being available.<br />So rented blu-ray from Redbox for $1.60 and took it to all the rooms I wanted to.
B005721W9O|4.0|It's a fun concept and they really pull it off - great actors having fun is really fun to watch.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This movie was funny and quirky, sweet and sentimental. I highly recommend it for a family movie night .  The characters were well- developed throughout the movie.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I literally couldn't put this book down until I'd finished it! It was a truly beautiful, yet tragic, love story!
B00A757EFW|5.0|The major difference this Pac Man has compared to any other is the virtual versions is the virtual joy stick. It is by far the most accurate that I have ever played with. It makes this game very close to playing on A solid device.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Super addictive and a lot of fun.  Love the style of the drawings and how it plays more like a puzzle.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Very good book. Very slow setup because of the number of characters and settings, but really moves once the setup is done.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is pretty fun. I would have definitively paid for this game, if I hadn't gotten it free on xmas day from amazon.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|As a No Reservations fan and a former front of the house waitron, I loved this book. Tony is funny and all too honest about 'the life.' Great Read.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|The book that holds the dvds was obviously damaged on the corners, kind of smashed looking. And inside on three of the pages that hold the dvds, in one of the two slots on each page the dvds were in the slots kind of upside down,and off centered. The dvd was very difficult to remove from the slot, almost like it was glued in place. When removal was possible there was paper from the slots stuck to the dvd. I am returning due to these issues but hope to receive a replacement that isn't damaged. At that time I will do new review when playing of the dvds is possible.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is a free game for hours of bird-flying fun!  You can't beat it!  Be sure to &#34;buy&#34; it!
B006YZOXHQ|1.0|Having purchased over two hundred movies on Blu-Ray from Amazon I expected this one to be just a good as all the rest. All that I can say is what a disappointment this one was. The movie will simply not play on my Blu-Ray player at all. Even after a firmware update it still will not play. It only loads the Main Menu Screen. Highlighting and choosing any of the the choices on the Menu Screen only sends you to the MPAA rating screen where you are forever stuck. The only way to exit anything from that point is to remove the disk from the player. So needless to say I have never seen this film since it will not play in my player. I have since purchased many \\"new\\" release Blu-Ray films and they play just fine on my Blu-Ray player so it would appear that this disk or the formatting of this disk is defective. And since all of the hundreds of Blu-Ray titles I have purchased play just fine on my player I don't see the need to go out and purchase another Blu-Ray player hoping that this title will play. So it appears this purchase was money simply thrown away. I would be curious to know if anyone else has had this problem with this title.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The Kindle PDF reader was acting flaky. Couldn't easily advance pages, unless I unzoomed them. Occasionally, the page would split into 4 parts, and I couldn't read a single segment. It also once zoomed through 10's of pages, without me touching any area of the screen. So, I wanted a solution that I could count on. I downloaded and installed Adobe Reader, and after some difficulty figuring out how to make it my default PDF reader, I chose an option to Force Stop the app. After that, I was able to open any PDF easily from within the mother of PDF readers.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son loves this game, he raved & raved about it. I could not get him to put his kindle down for more than 10 minutes at a time.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Have been a Demille Fan for years, but like most Iu find other interest and drifted away. I have missed the other John Corey books, but will be catching up. DeMille has gift for mixing current events into great adventure and suspense. This was a three evening read - it is a great book when you find yourself alone at midnight thinking &#34; just one more chapter&#34;.

B001DTPZNY|5.0|Great video for an insane price. Came quick and was worth<br />the little that I had to pay for it.
B009CPGHDI|5.0|I rented this with way too much time on my hands, but now I would actual consider myself a Katy Perry Fan. It was super entertaining to watch her behind the scenes and fall in love with her personality.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood was his usual character.  Good story line.The ending wasn't too obvious like most movies until the end, worth renting.
B009HELT3C|5.0|I have loved every Men in Black movie ever released, but I think this one was among the best.  We really enjoyed it.  I missed the pug though.
0978607651|5.0|Charley Harper only entered my consciousness last year when I saw a calendar of his designs. Then I bought a puzzle, \\"Diversity in the Burbs,\\" and loved it even more, so I asked for this book for Christmas. I had no idea how big it was - size isn't something I look closely at when choosing books - this one is big enough to BE a coffee table. It  comes in a beautiful black-and-white illustrated box.<br /><br />Inside, the presentation of Harper's work was so perfect it amazed me, from the initial photo of a young Harper drawing in the mountains to the arrangement of hundreds of wonderful illustrations and paintings and silk screens. The interview of Charley Harper by Todd Oldham gave me a feeling that I'd gotten to meet the man, and I love that the interview is published in the back of the book in multiple languages (Italian, Spanish, French, German).  I love that the illustrations are unlabeled - you just come to them and make what you like of them. If you want to know their title or when they were made, there's an index in the back, but the pages of beautiful graphics themselves are wordless.<br /><br />This is the best Christmas gift my husband has ever given me, and I know I will be pulling it into my lap and using it for trips to wonderland for the rest of my life. My only regret is that it's hard to see more of Harper's work anywhere.
B00AAQ7LP6|1.0|I bought the DVD hoping to see what the fuss is about Rihanna. Too bad she is just another pop gimmik that uses her body to sell records. I was so dissapointed. Her singing is terrible and she grunts. The stage production was cheap and no concept.<br /><br />NO TALENT
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I expected so much better especially since the original was so great. This seemed like a cheap knock off :/
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|game is lots of fun. wish the food would give you energy instead of waiting for it. good graphics and music
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Very entertaining; action packed with an interesting story.  Colin, Kate and Jessica all were suited for their parts and provided interesting drama among their individual characters.  I would recommend this movie for die-hard action fans.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Excellent game !! Cant wait formless dash games for the kindle.  It is truly addicting though; don't buy it unless you have time!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Seeing the movie is one thing but reading it is another.  Great read. Translates well to any century and the story of redemption should resonate with everyone.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|It was good and funny it made me laugh it was a very good sense of humor it's funny that Greg is such a bad boy
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play the game all the time. I like using the game on may kindle better than playing it on the laptop. More mobility.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Great TV series! Just can't get enough of this show! Have Season 1 thru 7 now! Can't wait for Season 8!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Is a fun game, and it does gets challenging quick! Not that is a problem for me but is worth mentioning
B009MF56GC|5.0|We saw this at the theater and just loved it. We had to have it on DVD. Great actors in this movie! Will watch this movie over and over again and not get tired of it.
0060899190|4.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, and she loved it. Ordering was easy and it arrived in record time.
6304698690|5.0|I haven't ever read this book, but I used to watch this movie when I was young!!! I had forgotten all about it until recently and was surpirsed to find that I really did enjoy it now as I ever did when I was a child. It is a very good and moving film, starting off with the neglected and angry Mary Lennox who becomes an orphan and this is taken from India to England to live with her estranged and depressed uncle. There she learns to leave her bitterness behind as she becomes friends with her maid, and her maid's brother Dickon and even shows her spoiled, but also neglected, cousin that he can indeed walk. All while bringing back her aunts 'secret garden' that had been forgotten for years. It is a fun getaway to watch and I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun fairytale.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in ages. The characters are real and relatable and you find yourself needing to know more about them. I could not put it down. A love story that conquers all

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a story that I will read many many times. Each time I read it, it gets better. :)
B007PVHMCG|4.0|It was exactly what I was looking for. The only thing is that the price changed a lot, I saw 2 different prices on the same day
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is a great time waster.  I mean that with all due respect too - haha.  Fun, simple, easy, challenging.  Well done!
B000FCK9D6|2.0|This book was predictable and reminded me of the game clue. I may not be an Agatha Christie fan. This was not the book for me.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A modern-day adventure.  I loved this book.  It is full of querky characters (which I personally love).  It is futuristic and historical at the same time.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This product is great! I do not understand why some people say it feels structurally weak, I tested it thoroughly and it I'd great! Only problem is it does not I repeat DOES NOT come with a charger cable, but who doesn't have a spare sitting around?
B007SNFTAI|4.0|Interesting read.  Great characters.  The book is intelligently written.  The story kept me interested throughout the book. I would recommend this book to my friends.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Free should be FREE shouldn't have to buy coins. Should get credit for the stuff that falls off the sides you can't stop it or side rails should come more often or when you have coins to make it worth having up!!!! Other then that it's fun to play for awhile.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My wife loved this Christmas gift.  It was the right price for 8 DVDs.  I haven't watched the videos yet.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Nothing to brag about. I only read be it because a friend mentioned it.  I wouldn't recommend it because it was a repetitive story line throughout the book.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Don't listen to other people's reviews this app is awesome!!! I absolutley love it soooo much that I play it almost every day!!! :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After the first 20 minutes of me reading 50 shades of grey, I slowly became infatuated with the book. It is Divine! Words alone cannot describe the pang in my heart at the close of the book. I highly suggest it for people who aren't afraid of the realities of life. And with this, I continue onto book two    . P.s. did anyone picture Matt Bomer as Christian Grey?
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Book was cute and it kept me interested. Now I don't think it is the next number one best seller but over all it was a good book
0698400852|5.0|Update (December 2016) - I listened to two unabridged audio versions in the past few weeks - one by Jim Dale and the other by Simon Vance - have been a fan of Vance's for his narration of other books, but in this case I think Dale's narration was much better - in any case, anyone approaching A Christmas Carol *must* read or listen to an unabridged version - and, while I've watched every adaptation on film on TV, there's nothing like the very words themselves - indeed, this is a story best listened to than read, I think - will always be a favorite<br /><br />To borrow from Dickens and A Christmas Carol: &#34;An intelligent book...a remarkable book...What a delightful book!&#34;<br /><br />I got this book at the &#34;Dickens on the Strand&#34; festival in Galveston, TX, in December 2012.  The book is all the more special because it was signed by Dickens' g-g-granddaughter and g-g-g-grandaughter, who were special guests that weekend.<br /><br />The illustrations are excellent and really bring the story - and, especially, the characters - to life.<br /><br />And the story!  Oh, what a story!  I think my favorite aspect is the descriptions of the characters and settings.  As a morality tale, it is so interesting that there is very little sermonizing.  The three ghosts do not jibber jabber...they let Scrooge come to his own realization by placing him in situations where he can see and contemplate his own actions.  The most biting part is when his own cruel words are turned on him.  But other characters, too, act without charity, and if we don;t see ourselves in Scrooge and his outlandish meanness, perhaps we can see ourselves in the minor characters and their snide remarks, and improve ourselves on that account.  While Tiny Tim seems to be the iconic character of The book, I actually like several others more, including the nephew, Fred; Fezziwig and his family; and the folks who stole the very curtains and clothes from Scrooge on his deathbed - their behavior was atrocious but their characterization was superb!<br /><br />This book capped off a year when I read two other Dickens works - Bleak House and Great Expectations for the first time.  I plan to read more of him next year and will once again end with the Carol.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!This book capped off a year when I read two other Dickens works - Bleak House and Great Expectations for the first time.

B00A77II0U|5.0|Great visuals, great story. Loved the scenes where you had to find the listed items. Definitely should get it. 5 stars.
030758836X|4.0|I gave it 4 stars just because it kept my interest throughout. It was tricky and surprising and devilishly fun.  I would have given it 5 stars except I hated the ending. I think most readers will be hoping to feel satisfied at the end and will be disappointed instead.[[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]]
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Not usable because it constantly freezes and causes me to reboot or reset my device to factory specs and that's a huge inconvenience...
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|The movie is well done but I would have liked more. Special effects are good. Introduction of Master Chief very well done. I hope there is more to come.
B000005B0U|1.0|The audio file type is worthless because it will not play in a traditional CD player such as the one in my car...
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Active repeater, cheap!  Works great! The word requirement makes me complete this sentence, which I think is over rated. wow
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|I really like the game but it is impossible to get the galaga star fighter.But other then that I love it.

B009E3EY4M|2.0|Fist of all I am a big Zeppelin fan and they are in the top ten for me ever  ..my complaint is about the audio. It sounds bad to me, and I agree with other reviewers about this sacrilege.<br /><br />Some years ago, on his first remasters, Jimmy Page did not let his  work be destroyed by the LOUD WARS/Compression/ criteria, like Genesis did on their most recent remastering, a massacre.<br /><br />Some years later  Jimmy began to make some strange things  like editing and cutting out ultra valuable parts from the The Song remains the Same first edition  CD, and i have the utmost respect for this guitar genius, but as a hard core fan, this actions i dont understand coming from him, always a defender of his music's sound quality standards, just read The Hammer of the Gods  bio.<br />.<br />Maybe it is Jimmy's age?  Read my review on The song remains the same LIVE and find out how Jimmy inexplicably edited badly one of his most heart felt, marvelously crafted live solos ever.<br /><br />Now, CELEBRATION DAY is bass heavy/muddy one some parts and songs, like Kashmir.  Also,  The high frecuencies are a bit harsh.<br /><br />About the playing... well Jimmy is not the same, and some of his solos are quite desarticulated and sound bad.  But that is quite acceptable for all of us fans that wanted to see these music Gods again.<br /><br />I think they lost a great opportunity to make a 21 century-sounding Zeppelin record. I think the group itself  did not participate in this proyect post-production-wise, or they have lost their hearing enough to let go this MEDIOCRE AUDIO WORK. SAD BUT TRUE.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was very funny and good but it was shorter i think the book could of been longer nxt time
B008COPZ60|4.0|Obviously you purchase this if you are a JB fan. Great CD and my daughter loves the DVD. We are confused, however, as to why \\"Love Me Like You Do\\" is not a track on this cd. We are aware of the difference between the Deluxe version and the golden ticket version. This is the golden ticket version and contains all songs except that one. Great CD just be aware you may have to purchase that song separately.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book ever written this book will have you hunkering for more take heed picking this book up you'll love it
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Another app designed to get your money!  First, I thought this was like the actual Oregon Trail for the PC which is why I excitedly downloaded it---it is far from it (it's more like Farmville).  After awhile the routine of collecting money, feeding animals, chopping trees gets VERY boring.  If you don't have any friends (actual people who've set up their own virtual towns) to visit then you'll not be able to fulfill some of the goals which further makes it frustrating.  If you want to get anything done you're gonna have to pay or play for like 90 hours straight to accomplish it.  If you're someone who doesn't mind paying for games (i.e. teenager with a parent's credit card) then by all means you'll probably like the game, but if you're like me (and understand that money doesn't grown on trees) then proceed with caution.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the art and the good word choice it made me laugh so hard and for a  long time
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Makes for an easy way to find your downloads. Just a good organizational app.  I'm sure there are other good features about this, but I currently only use it to find my downloads.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This book has been my favorite since I was a kid now my kids read it to me. Great book.
B006O6F932|1.0|I have never written a review before, but now feel compelled to do so.  This is extremely overpriced and a piece of junk.  The doors won't stay on, it's flimsy, and there's no place to store the large amount of accessories that come with it.  My daughter who is a huge monster high fan, played with it for maybe 10 minutes.  She got so frustrated with the stairs not locking down, that she just gave up.  I would not recommend this toy to anyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is epic I got it for xbox/Pc but now its portible Get it if you love minecraft please make more updates tho 5/5
1439152802|5.0|I absolutely adored `The Secret Keeper'! As children, we don't often wonder who our parents were before they were our parents. Yet, in `The Secret Keeper' finding out this information is the key to discovering the truth about one awful day when teenage Laurel Nicolson sees her mother murder a strange man at their idyllic farmstead. Now Dorothy Nicolson is turning 90 and she is losing the battle with a debilitating illness. Laurel is now a successful actress and she is compelled to find out the truth about her mother and this mysterious man and the day which changed her life forever.<br /><br />Split between 2011 and Laurel's search into the past and the late 1930s/early 1940s telling Dorothy's story, `The Secret Keeper' is a compelling story of tragedy, triumph, love, betrayal, loss, and acceptance. The story flowed seamlessly between past and present as more and more secrets were uncovered. Beautifully complex characters and a rich backdrop paints the tale easily for readers and there is a deliciously wicked twist at the end which will leave you speechless. Ms. Morton has written a spellbinding novel which I will definitely pass along to friends to enjoy, too!
1400034205|5.0|Many thanks to that bon vivant and great conservative Taki Theodoracopulos for reminding me to read \\"The Razor's Edge\\" (See \\"Taki's Top Shelf,\\" The American Conservative, October 2012). I watched the Bill Murray movie about a year ago, planting the seed of wanting to read the book. The seed did not sprout until Taki watered it. Cheers, My Teacher.<br /> Taki writes that our masters of the universe (read: denizens of Big Finance) would do well to ponder the life of the mind that keeps intruding in Somerset Maugham's superb novel and, as usual, he's right. Maugham describes his telling as \\"success\\" stories (see the book's final page) but most people commuting to jobs in lower Manhattan would likely disagree. Grand point by our author - What is success really?<br /> The spiritually attuned with see Larry Darrell as the big winner but Maugham is wise in noting that all characters got what they really wanted. As the Moody Blues (\\"Nights in White Satin\\") put it so well - \\"Just what you want to be, you will be in the end.\\"<br /> Maugham, who is a character in the book, is honest and a pretty good detective as well. He cleverly roots out Isabel's ambush of Sophie. We're appalled at Isabel until we come face to face with the realization that Sophie could have righted herself at any time and married Larry. The Torah commands us not to put a stumbling block before the blind but from where I'm sitting Sophie doesn't appear blind. Nonetheless, her fate is a sad one.<br /> Our author brandishes his honesty again when he relates his admiration for Larry but admits being unable to live on that level because he (Maugham) is too much of the Earth (p. 313, Penguin 20th Century Classics Edition, 1992).<br /> Juxtaposing Larry and Elliott I hear the gentle tune (thank you for that phrase, Rabbi Daniel Lapin) of the story of Jacob and Esau. Larry and Elliott are not blood brothers but it's their spirits that draws our attention. Like Esau, Elliott is generous but his Roman Catholicism ismore of a prop for this world than a map to the next world. Larry understands what Jacob Our Father understood - work for the next world and G-d throws in this world as a bonus. At novel's end, Larry has renounced glory-seeking in this world, becoming a partner with Vishnu the preserver (see Maugham's description of Larry's Hinduism) and squaring his shoulders toward the next world.<br /> Properly educated Jews should be able to spot Torah Lishmah (study for its own sake) and mitzvot (performance of the commandments) in this sentence (p. 274) - \\"He taught that work done with no selfish interest purifies the mind and duties are opportunities afforded to man to sink his separate self and become one with the universal self.\\"<br /> We can see how Larry grows so why don't most of us follow him? Maugham's introductory quote from Katha--Upanishad about the sharp edge of a razor is a pretty good explanation. But a better one can be found in one word: fear. Notice how Larry identifies it (unlike any of the other characters) and thus strikes fear out.<br /> P. 246: \\"I found I was able to relieve people not only of pain but of fear. It's strange how many people suffer from it. I don't mean fear of closed spaces and fear of heights, but fear of death and, what's worse, fear of life. Often they're people who seem in the best of health, prosperous, without any worry, and yet they're tortured by it.\\"
B007MB5OCE|2.0|Had to force myself to finish it! Just too much of the same thing............certainly not a page turner!  Would not recommend it.
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|This one did not disappoint! While I thought the plot would be predictable, it was not. I was surprised right to the last page.
B004AKCME8|5.0|I bought this movie for my granddaughter, she has read all the books, it made a great stocking stuffer. She enjoyed watching it. A good family movie.
B004EPYZUI|2.0|I watched the Extended Cut for my first viewing; I doubt that there will be a second one.<br /><br />I was hoping that the movie would be at least interesting, but it wasn't able to hold my attention.  I found myself browsing for Christmas gifts after about a half-hour.<br /><br />I understand that the action sequences take place in a fantasy, within a fantasy, within a nightmare (I really do).  The action is just so disconnected from anything else in the movie that it looks like someone put some CG together then decided to write a movie around it.  The CG is enjoyable in and of itself, however it doesn't really relate to action in the mid-tier fantasy.  There just seems to be too much time spent setting up for the next action sequence without any character development.  In the end, the only reason that anyone seems to really trust baby-doll is that she can \\"dance\\" good.<br /><br />Its watchable, everything made sense, and it progressed in an understandable manor.<br /><br />But... in the end, I felt no connection to any of the characters at all, and didn't care that that they lived or died.  I just wanted the film to end.
B002VWNID6|5.0|I bought this as a gift for Christmas, I have always like Kevin Costner movies, The person I bought it for liked it and I hope they let me borrow it to watch.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|This nerf gun is super fun and the kids love it.  It shoots really far with a minimum number of jams.  Most of the times it has jammed was due to the dart already being a little messed up.  Careful when putting the thing together out of the box.  The magazine shield is tough to put on and needs a bit of force and finesse.  I thought it might break when I was trying to get the pieces to snap together.  Advancing the magazine could be a little smoother but not bad considering we are talking about molded plastic.  It is a hefty size shooter making a bit tough for my 4.5yo to carry and just a little bulky for my 6.5yo.  Obviously, it would have been nice if they included more magazines and bullets.  Bottom line is that the kids really like it and it works.  Meaning a rain of nerf bullets all up in ones mug!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought it as a Christmas stocking stuffer for my granddaughter, I thought she would enjoy it, she wanted to see it at the theater.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Maybe not the best comedy I've ever watched, but funny for a long layover on my Christmas day trip :)
B009OYTOA0|5.0|Finally a TV show with some quality. So far the scripts are good, and the show has been very well cast. Oliver is a believable person who developed his skills over time, which makes his abilities realistic to me. I'm waiting to see if the female parts will develop into people with more depth and complexity. So far they are stereotypical and shallow, easy to ignore. I look forward to the show every week. It's a breath of fresh air amidst the mostly banal garbage that has flooded the airways over the past several years.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas present and it was exactly as advertised.  So glad I bought the set instead of each one individually, there are so many more features with the bonus DVD.  I highly recommend to any Godfather enthusiaist.
B001CDD84Y|4.0|Enjoyed the movie, but it seemed like just when you were realy getting into it the movie just ended. I would still recommend it the premise of the movie was very good.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Whole family enjoyed this movie. Good addition to a sleep in day. Amazon Prime streaming through Roku box worked like a charm.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This is a fun addition to our collection of Christmas movies.  The adults enjoyed it as much as the kids did.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Streaming long movies works well for us.  We can leave them, resume, watch sections again, etc and the price points are much better than Dish On Demand.
1426308469|5.0|This marvelous book is perfect for a young child interested in paleontology; I bought it for my 5-year-old granddaughter.  The format is large and easy to read.  It gives a pronunciation guide for the species names, and general information about each animal.  The artwork is absolutely beautiful, as I would expect from a National Geographic publication.  If you have a little one who is enthusiastic about dinosaurs, this book is gold!
143350393X|5.0|I purchased this Bible for my wife and I, hoping that it would provide a solid but probing commentary that would encourage discussion as well as leave room for personal interpretation. I was not disappointed!! This Bible provides an historical representation of the goings-on in the region/world that the Bible doesn't cover and gives contextual relevance to that history. The construction of the Bible is very durable and the leather used does not show wear easily unlike some materials. I was so pleased with this Bible that I purchased the smaller version to travel with. I would recommend this Bible to anyone looking for a durable, beautiful and incredibly useful resource to read, study and lead your life with.
B0000C9ZBW|3.0|Seemed a little fragile, and it was smaller than it looked so I am going to return it.  Not really durable.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo781ID0BNJVZI]]Great bag. Loads of space. very durable. Compare with bags for $80 - $100. Well padded customizable partitions. I pack a Nikon D5100, Tamron 70-300, which is a big lens, and 4 smaller lenses, filters, batteries, flash, and other accessories. This is a GREAT bag, and the price makes it even better.<br /><br />UPDATE- 5/18/13  Five months later the backpack is still like new! Taken on hikes and photo outings and has not disappointed me.

B007REV4T8|3.0|Let me start off by saying: Skyfall is a good movie. However, it isn't the best Bond film of all time, and it isn't the pinnacle of action artistry that other sources are claiming. It's still worth a watch, even if I am being harsh here. It's just that Skyfall doesn't live up to its hype, even if it's good. Unfortunately, I can't do half-stars here, otherwise I'd give it 3.5/5.<br /><br />The film starts off on a fantastic note with an eventful multi-tiered chase through Istanbul, including motorcycles on the rooftops and a true-to-Bond thriller format - and it barely even uses CGI as per director Sam Mendes's behest, which was one of his many great decisions. This proves to be by far the best sequence in the film, as its riveting presentation engrosses the viewer. The first issue, however, props up at this sequence's conclusion: A completely unnecessary suspense of belief that completely defies all logic and is never explained in the slightest capacity. When I see a movie, I at least expect the latter.<br /><br />This is not a one-time issue at all. In fact, the recurring nature of these either unexplained or underwhelming facets is at fault of one thing: A poor script. Skyfall is, in essence, a fantastically produced film adapted from a lackluster script. That's a pretty large problem. You would think that Neal Purvis and Robert Wade would know what they're doing, since this is their fifth endeavor into the James Bond universe, but they clearly don't.<br /><br />The first major issue with the script is the complete lack of character development where it is necessary. Raoul Silva, the main antagonist, is given a haphazardly-assembled plotline that is almost nonsensical; however, Javier Bardem's brilliance with what he is given makes Silva a standout in the series - at least superficially. His motive and actions are there, but are never fully explored. The script makes him a bitter psychopath and very little more - Bardem takes this and makes it into something else.There is also Eve (Naomie Harris), a field agent whose camaraderie with Bond is colorless and backstory is virtually nonexistent. Another example is the film's only Bond girl, Sévérine (played by Bérénice Lin Marlohe), who is brilliantly acted by taking inspiration from GoldenEye's Famke Janssen, but her development is never explored. Also, given that Sévérine is the ONLY Bond girl, the script doesn't give something important that the Connery and Moore Bonds had: Charm. Daniel Craig is brilliant in the role of Bond, but he's not given the suaveness and seduction that the fans expect from Bond. He's given everything else he needs here, which is a plus, but it's his own execution that proves it. It's the writers that aren't keeping with the formula.<br /><br />Another issue with the script is the uncreative action sequences that follow the initial Istanbul chase. The film's first act consists of a series of hand-to-hand brawls that get repetitive and predictable. The film's second act has a long footchase that only wishes it lived up to the greatness produced in the opening of 2006's Casino Royale. The film's climax is also drawn-out and straightforward, and halfway through the sequence, you ask yourself if the movie is going to end any time soon. This may be due to fatigue induced from the excessively long footchase paired with the continuing endlessness of a rather boring climax.<br /><br />Yet another thing to note is the near nonexistence of the dry wit that helped make the Bond films of the past even more fun. There are very few laughs and there are very few double entendres. Thankfully, \\"Bond. James Bond.\\" makes a reappearance after its unforgivable exclusion from 2008's Quantum of Solace. The script is an improvement from that disaster in every facet, which means it's a start at the very least.<br /><br />To reiterate: Skyfall is a good movie. It's a fantastically-executed adaptation of a weak script. The acting, directing, and production all go above and beyond the norm, but the mediocre writing makes Skyfall devoid of some elements that made the 007 franchise a success in the first place. It's a huge step forward from the abysmal Quantum, but it isn't to the level of Casino Royale, which had everything Skyfall does PLUS memorable action sequences and the charming suaveness with the ladies that this entry lacks. It is those two missing elements that strip the soul from this Bond. This seems more Mission Impossible than Bond, and when you can't take a fifty-year-old franchise and keep its unique identity, then something more needs to be done. I know nothing can be perfect, and Skyfall isn't. It's just that with all the hype, I was expecting something more. However, I would recommend it to Bond fans, action film aficionados, and those looking for something new to explore. It's a good movie, but it comes nowhere near to beating Casino Royale or GoldenEye for the best post-Cold War Bond.
6304100507|5.0|Arrived on time and in good condition. Still had the Disney seal and actually a couple of coupon stickers that were unfortunately out of date by about 14 years. Good story, fun music, great characters. A definite favorite.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|wish i had more chips to play with they run out fast otherwise one of the best bingo games ive found
1608871452|5.0|Any Supernatural fan would love this!  I gave as a gift, so I haven't looked through it in too much detail.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|It's probably one of the best indie games available. The controls on the mobile work good for a game like this.
1582701709|1.0|Yes, I did read this book. It was borrowed from a friend who insisted it was changing their outlook. I approached it skeptically, as anything that associates spirituality with money or business matters makes me weary.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I read this book all the way through, I had officially disowned its message about a quarter of the way in. The message is vastly oversold, so don't even begin thinking that you're going to walk out with more than you walked in with. Your caliber of disappointment may be high if your anticipations are buttered up. The promises that are packaged within this franchise are paunchy. I suppose if you truly believe Rhonda Byrne at the end, even the slightest conveniences that befall in the days or weeks following your reading could be perceived as the system working.<br /><br />The \\"informal\\" or \\"easy to read\\" writing style is something that will irritate a lot of people in particular. There is nothing challenging about the text whatsoever. There is no terminology or scientific method presented in this book that can be refreshing to an intellectually exertive person. Flimsily articulated pseudoscience, not even worthy of second grade classroom conversation, is presented as self evident and applicable. I am not a college graduate. I didn't even make the honor roll in public high school. But I was flabbergasted at the cut-rate, almost condescending nature of Rhonda Byrne's assumption that readers would consider people such as William Shakespeare and Benjamin Franklin to be peers within Byrne's club. Implying that all of history's most masterful achievers glide on faith and coast on joy is insulting and deceptive. Several areas of the book play down the importance of research, critical thinking and harnessing of resources. If you were ever an individual who placed high value on the Scientific method, you will probably find the overall message of this book to be as glib as I did.<br /><br />The big claim of Rhonda Byrne's epic - the \\"Secret\\" if you will - is that all success and failure is linked to positive or negative thinking. To suggest that tragedies which befall innocent people - cancer, burglaries, rapes, car accidents, child abuse, genocide - are brought on by such victims cynical thinking skills and negative attitudes is grievous. At one point Byrne suggests that The Holocaust was manifested by negative brain waves being radiated throughout the region in which it took place. No, I did not make that up. But Byrne is clearly not an idiot. I suppose she is somewhat of an academic. At some point in her writing she must have stumbled into the awareness that thousands of readers would eventually poke the aforementioned hole that I just did. So think about it for a moment. Why would she keep such a claim within her text? The only logical explanation is that Byrne had to trust that the majority of her target demographic would not be intelligent enough to challenge or raise questions. Besides, they already paid for the book, so who cares cares what they have to say?<br /><br />Ironically, it takes a lot of unhealthy black and white thinking to accept the doctrine of The Secret. No room for grey perception here, as grey thinking would only equal grey results such as moderate success, moderate disappointment, etc. Thinking in terms of constant \\"white\\" and the expectation of picturesque outcomes can be a dangerous process for people possessing emotional or mental abnormalities. People with manic depression and bipolar disorder are particularly vulnerable. I can't imagine the sort of damaging effects that the severely economically disadvantaged could possibly experience from relying on this text.<br /><br />Please don't give this author any more money. Don't buy this book.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This radio app is featured pack, it'll give you your favorite radio stations in crystal clear audio. It's great for the average listener to the people who depend on radio every day. Really a must have app to have.
B009DT98RK|5.0|I recently got a new TV and blu-ray player and this disc was a Christmas present.  Putting this disc in for the first time, I watched the entire FCA song line-up all the way through...there was no stopping this one! The major thing I want to say in this review is that the band Frampton has currently/on this disc is, IMO, as tight and rocking as the band he had on the original 1976 recording...Bob Mayo & John Siomos, R.I.P. - they were some big rock & roll shoes to fill but these guys carry on their tradition wonderfully.  If you're a fan of the original album (who isn't?), you need to get this Blu-Ray disc now, play it on a good system, crank it up and it's almost like you're there - awesome, great job guys!
B006PFC2S2|1.0|The movie's ok (I've seen it many times before), but the streaming froze repeatedly.  The only recourse was giving it a few hours to unfreeze itself, and then it froze again.

B00AHSMDQY|3.0|This series maybe coming to the end of its life.  This movie was slow which is a problem when the movie is over 2 hours long.  Good action scenes but to far and in between for my taste.  Glad I waited to watch it at home.

B005CRQ4OW|4.0|It's not my FAVORITE book, bit I'd recommend it to a third or fourth grader, because it is actually a favorite of my younger sister,Sophia. This book I felt was targeted to attract middle schoolers but wound up attracting all ages , it's a good book overAll so if your looking for maybe a book to do an assignment on, maybe something else but this book is perfect for free time reading
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is just awesome. I play a lot of games (a looooot), so it was nice to have something so unique and special to play. It offers a unique mix of social interaction and jprg like dungeon game-play. For details i would like to refer to reviews like the one on ign. I can just say that i really enjoyed playing through it and that even after playing for over 80 hours i still wasn't bored for one second.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|A fun care ride.  If you like to imbibe then this is a side splitter.  Kept me laughing the whole way through.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I love this movie.  I showed it to my high schoolers (9th grade), and they loved it. One girl even asked where she could buy it because she told her grandma about it, and they wanted to see it together.  So cute.  :)<br /><br />Great movie to show inspiration, love of others, learning about the uniqueness in others, etc.

B0076DCT2G|1.0|The &#34;hero&#34; is so obnoxious, offensive, and arrogant that by the end of the book I was rooting for the terrorist. DeMille has written some of the best books I have ever read (Up Country, for example). This is one of the worst.
B008BM9L72|4.0|Fantsy erotic, but still a cute story about 1st love...Maybe a bit too explicit for some people....Would like to hear more from his side....
B003SPCYP8|3.0|Centered on the 9/11 disaster that struck New York in 2001, this Indian-produced film portrays the prejudice that befell Muslim US residents in the aftermath.  The male lead is a young adult with Asperger Syndrome, certainly enough of a handicap in life, who encounters further problems because of his religion and his inability to defend himself from hostility.  However his innocence shines through in the end, as he categorizes people as being simply bad or good, and makes that point over and over.
0446573027|4.0|An excellent book! Baldacci once again manages to weave a story steeped in intrigue and thrills. Who else but Baldacci can make a backwoods town in coal country West Virginia the place where a terrorist plot unfolds involving nuclear secrets and a bomb ticking down to doomsday? Here is a paranoid thriller wrapped in a murder mystery inside of a political secret. Highly recommended if you want to stay up all night reading.... and if one does not want to... read it for sheer enjoyment!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Hard to navigate, doesn't show seperation of updates or way to follow the link. Makes me want to just go back to the computer.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Red is another one to add to the collection of Taylor CDs.  She just gets better with time.  The instruments and beats keep you engaged and she's also a wonderful poet so the lyrics are on point too. Love to listen to her while working or driving in the car.  Definitely, road trip music. And the songs grow on you. So lovely.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have heard good things about Mrs. Michaels, and I was proven right when I decided to purchase this DVD. I just started it today actually. It for sure had me sweating a storm.I love her no-nonsense and fun upbeat personality. Today I almost gave up, but decided to go on and felt great when I finished. I realized I am beyond level one and can actually step up to level 3. I am going to do this 5 times a week along with Turbo Jam to get maximum results.
8170262259|3.0|The book was a lot smaller than I assumed which would not have been so bad if it was $5 like stated on the back of the book instead of $15.99 amazon price I paid. This is the first time I feel like I did not receive a good deal from amazon. Other than that the book is a good read which is why I gave it a 3 star review.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Provides a much better presentation of my ASUS TF300T battery power dissipation. This product was recommended by a heavy tablet user.

B0067Q42BY|3.0|It is a fun game but it is nothing spectacular.  I play lots of games and I definitely play manning.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I've seen the Broadway and I've seen the movie. One isn't better than the other, just different.  I was thrilled to see and listen to other interpretations of this great work.  As an opera singer, it would be easy for me to linger on vocal imperfections of the movie.  It is as stated above, \\"RAW\\" or very real.  When Jackman sings his first song in the church, I was moved to tears.  It is more than singing.  I can listen to both the stage and movie versions without comparing, but spend my energy just enjoying and soaking it up.  So, if you want a critique, Jackman's voice has a very strong bright edge to it that is very acceptable on the musical stage.  Most of the time that edge works for him, however during Bring Him Home,I don't think it does. He tends to bring way too much chest into his high notes for this song which makes it sound like he's working too hard. To his credit, he never flips into falsetto for the high notes like everyone else does.  His final three high notes are supported and placed very forward again using the bright edge to his advantage. Crowe was an introverted, driven, psychological methodical character, however the emotion is still there.  He was very understated and there was a reason.  Freddie Redmayne is excellent as Marius and his acting/singing especially during Empty Chairs is emotional and beautiful. Ann Hathaway brought her role home and nailed it at the end.  Not a dry eye anywhere.  Important safety tip - do not drive while listening to the last track.  I cried all the way home in rush-hour traffic.  I guess I should have turned it off then, but it was awesome.  They tweaked the end a little, tightened it and every word could be understood. Since the sound track was recorded live while filming, you get the added thrill of all the sound effects, grunts, and gun shots, cannons etc.  It was thrilling to hear.  I agree that you may want to view the movie first then you would have a great visual when you hear the songs.  It was a fantastic movie that I will watch more than any other because there is so much going on.  I will enjoy listening to the memories of this soundtrack as well and the new orchestrations.  Take a chance and allow yourself to go on a different kind of journey.  I found it very emotional, extremely moving and fulfilling.  It's great - just different and different is okay!
B0030B1WBM|5.0|great streaming experience.  i love this movie as well.  Christmas just isn't the same without it!  rent now! rent now!
B005K17RU0|1.0|Downloading took three tries. Installation failed once. The app does give a nice current condition display, but when anything else is requested, it starts behaving erratically, and tries to access weather info site addresses that are no longer active. It takes up a lot of memory for negligible benefit.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It is an amazing game!you can upgrade;fight;free roam;and save people!There are even missions!Last but not least you can buy the BLACK SUIT!!!there are only two downsides; the water is gliched and it takes up a lot of room;other than that; it is AWESOME!!!!!!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I download Facebook on all my electronics. It comes up super fast on my Kindle Fire HD. I can see the screen better.
B005HSL626|4.0|I enjoy this game as a great way to waste time waiting.  I do not, however, like the fact that when trying to connect with this game it crashes my tablet every time.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|This was one of my gifts under the tree this Christmas.<br />So, naturally you can imagine what I spent the rest of my day doing...<br />The graphics were spot on, the characters weren't as well developed as I would<br />of liked...so much so that it created plot holes. The meaningless dialogue was<br />teeth grinding..<br />Black screens that seriously took the time only to write \\"...\\", \\"...\\", \\"...\\"...<br />Really? I understand the point of suspense and setting the atmosphere. However,<br />they might as well just made this a movie judging from the actual play time you're<br />involved in.<br />The story setting was interesting and once started I was determined to see it through.<br />On one hand, the alternate endings are nice because it gives you a chance to replay.<br />Sadly, who wants to replay a game that you spent hours pressing \\"a\\" the whole time just<br />to cycle through walls and walls of text.<br />It's frustrating especially that your first go through with all of that is rewarded with a \\"bad\\" ending<br />(alternative ending that gives you no closure at all)...which is not preventable, you'll have to<br />go through several of the alternate endings before getting the \\"true\\" ending that explains everything.<br />But, still, is filled with plot holes...<br /><br />I'll still rate the game highly because it was a interesting set up, the puzzles were engaging (if only<br />there were more of them), characters had potential, nice art, and really did keep me playing till the end (or<br />at least one of the ends..Axe ending anyone?). I probably will play it again and most likely will buy the sequel.<br />Just be warned, you might want to make sure you have the time and attention span to play this game...as well as<br />a forgiving heart for the holes in the plot.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Its not perfect but its the best reading app I've found up to this point.  The issues I have and the reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it doesn't accept more e-book formats.  another issue is this version, versus my older dedicated kindle reader is that you don't have the same level of control over the files themselves - options for accessing all downloaded e-books and etc. are less intuitive.  Some of this may be related to the device itself, a google nexus 7, but not all of them.
B0011Z76RS|5.0|This album came out when I was a teenager and as one of those kids who had a shitty child hood thanks to abusive parents and being bullied in school. Linkin park brought me up and made me feel amazing no matter how far down someone pushed me. I've bought this cd several times of the past decade and recently lost my last cd and had to buy the album again. I'll continue loosing it and re buying it because they mean that much to me.
B00936A0ZW|5.0|Paul Gilbert's newest album has yet another switch in styles. Is there anything Paul can't play? There is quite a mix here, but it should be very enjoyable to a wide audience. You get funny lyrics, serious songs, hard rockers, tons of blues and jazz types of songs, all played by a man with an unbelievably large amount of talent. His wife is on keyboards, and she is great too!<br /><br />If you like Gilbert, if you like guitar masters, or if you like great rock, buy this.

B008QTV3X0|5.0|Excellent character and plot development.  Each episode reveals a little more on each. Mini cliff hangers at the end of each episode makes you want to watch the next.  (Previous series I have thoroughly enjoyed are; Rome, Spartacus, The Tudors, Breaking Bad and Broadwalk Empire)
B004JMSIRC|5.0|All the Iron Man movies are great. Bought all of them to have on Blu-Ray and they are great! Recommend :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this book was so good; it broke my heart and put it back together. I fell in love with the characters and wish it never had to end. I highly recommend that you should read this now.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I downloaded a bunch of apps onto my kindle for my daughter and she likes this one alot.  Super cute!
1452110581|4.0|Funny, funny, funny.  Purchased for my Crazy Cat sister.  Still laughing over the OCD poem,  Any room in the house for quick hilarious enjoyment.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|Emma Stone is PHENOMENAL in this movie, which is focused in high school but definitely still works for older folks.  I like to think of it as a slightly smarter &#34;Mean Girls&#34;... Emma Stone inadvertently gives herself a bad reputation and then takes advantage of that to actually help other kids become more popular.  Strong acting from all the main actors, and a moment with &#34;Pocketful of Sunshine&#34;, makes this a can't-miss movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there is a lot of games in one app I like the frog eatting the butterfly's. I have not unlocked very many but its still fun
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I'll admit, I only read half of the book.  But, it seemed fairly accurate to the book, although the story seemed somewhat rushed especially at the beginning.  The movie also retained much of the simplistic nature of the book.  The acting was decent, and the scenario was pretty gorgeous.  Personally, I think the ending leaves a little to be desired, but overall its an entertaining use of time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat!<br />Could not put this one down!  I will be thinking of the characters for a long time.
B009CGR416|4.0|I have a wide range in taste, but generally don't tend towards &#34;nerdy&#34; movies, video games, etc.  This is an exception.<br /><br />It is a simple enough story to follow, with a focus on the relationships between the main actors.  The style is kind of a mash-up between video game and movie that works surprisingly well.  The acting is strong, and there are some hilarious moments that I like to recite with friends.<br /><br />Better for older kids, twenty-somethings and adults, and would be a great movie to watch during a movie night with friends.
B000002O1Q|5.0|Highlights the Meatloaf-esque (unsurprising as written and produced by Jim Steinman) Nowhere Fast and Tonight is What it Means to be Young. Also the Stevie Nicks penned Sorcerer amd Dan Hartman's I Can Dream About You. The movie was crap but the soundtrack is great.
B009D5VPTI|3.0|I'm an adult and got talked into watching this movie.  The animations are beautiful  and it is a well done movie, but I found the story to have a somewhat forced moral at the end, definitely a kids focused movie but entertaining enough for anyone to sit through.
B004478GNI|5.0|My young &#34;Star Wars&#34; junkie could barely contain himself long enough to get the wrapping paper off before tearing into the box to begin putting it together!  It is safe to say, that he loves it.<br /><br />Thanks, great service
B001UV4XFG|5.0|JUST LOVE HER BOOKS AND THE MOVIE IS GREAT WE HAVE ALL BOOKS AND MOVIES WAITING FRO BREAKING DAWN II
B00979CS50|3.0|I like almost everything Neil Young (except techno and rockabilly) and always enjoy Crazy Horse - given that, this is a pleasant collection of songs but nothing I heard is destined to be classic NY/CH.  I may revise this review after I listen a few more times.  Still it is probably worth a listen for die hard fans.
0765324857|5.0|I am an avid Bioshock fan. I played both games through back to back before I picked up the book. John Shirley does a terrific job of piecing together the backstory behind the two games. The way he had written the book gave way to creating three \\"ages\\" of Rapture. The building & creation phase, the 'day-to-day life' of Rapturions, and the final phase, Rapture's Demise & Downfall. The book is told third-person, but indirectly steers the readers to connect evidently well with the protagonist, Bill McDonaugh. Bill was a no-name plumber in NY until he met Mr. Andrew Ryan who turned him into one of the elite engineers and maintenance managers of Rapture. The book overall details each individual from the game incredibly well. Characters such as Sander Cohen, Sullivan, and Sophia Lamb are all extrapolated in detail within the parts relative to their prowess. The ending of the story is just before the beginning of BioShock 1. \\"Rapture\\" acts like a prequel to both games.<br /><br />I mainly read non-fiction and history books, and what appeals to me most about the overall story is that it sticks well to historical realism and a bit of realistic fiction, but there is enough realistic fiction that it stays incredibly captivating throughout its entirety. John Shirley's descriptions of plasmids and the technology used within Rapture can easily be picked up and personified by the reader's imagination. John Shirley's style of writing aided in the 'audible' voices and personalities of each character quite well. Each character's style of speech and accents were noticeably picked up and easily identified by their own 'style'. Bill McDonaugh, Sullivan, Karlosky, Fontaine, and Atlas especially.<br /><br />If you loved playing the game and loved the idea of a steam-punkish deco dystopia under the sea, then you'll love the book. It's a definite read and sits along my bookshelf with the rest of my favorite books, novels, and novellas.<br /><br />Overall 5*****,<br /><br />PS If John Shirley is reading this.....

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I was so ready for a good laugh, and this movie had such a good premise.  Yet it just went to far for me, and I consider myself ridiculously open minded for a grown adult.  With a way too crude sense of humor.  Yet this movie still missed the mark of being funny.  I guess these days there are absolutely no boundaries that kids don't mind.  There were some very funny moments, and I didn't stop watching it.  But in the end I didn't think too much of this movie.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I've put off watching this movie for a long time but am glad to have finally gotten to it! Great price and it shipped & arrived fast.  Definitely a &#34;wow&#34; movie.  Not a boring documentary and not filled with overly opinionated &#34;experts&#34; like some tend to be.  Gives enough information to allow the viewer to be educated and form their own opinions.  Opened my eyes to some topics I was not aware of.
B008NEMN0K|1.0|I had the original I robot and bought the new 3d version with some great expectation. The 3d is very poor, cannot tell the diff between it and the 2d version. Poor.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I really like this game except, like everyone else, you run out of energy FAST, it takes a VERY LONG time to re-up your energy or you have to pay out real money.<br />Hoping that in the future maybe this will change.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really liked the Racketeer, it kept my attention through out the book and I wasn't expecting the ending.  Good story and well written.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|unclear instructions<br />Most games online have help features. If they are there on this game then they have them hidden.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|As a gigantic Les Miz Fan and directed and produced a successful regional run. I went to the film after hearing clips knowing I would hate this film BUT I loved it.  It is not the version you want to buy to listen to but in context to the movie most is very good.  As for the new song, they have to write an original song to get  Oscar consideration for best song.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a crazy game! This is the first running game I've seen. The graphics are great! It's deceptively easy. I'll probably end up getting the next one, too.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Best Season Ever! I love the story<br />Can't wait for the 3rd Season to blow my mind away. 5 stars
B00973902K|1.0|For Christmas, our family wanted to do a &#34;Call Me Maybe&#34; video, like the ones that were all over the internet this year.  We spent a great deal of time choreographing the movie.  However, when I attempted to use the song with the video, it would not allow it.  I got the message &#34;Class Not Registered&#34;.<br /><br />Very disappointed!!!
0694003611|5.0|This &#34;tried and true&#34; book is one of my favorites to give to parents of newborns.  The cardboard edition makes perfect sense for little hands.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I got this game for Christmas from Amazon.  Thanks Amazon!  This is truly a wonderful game for all that like puzzles, especially Civil Engineers, in a very artistic, fun, and clever way.  I just finished Chapter 1 last night and was left with great admiration for the creators and their imagination in creating this masterpiece. This is currently my favorite game on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The game involves using droplets of goo to make truss structures that allow the un-used droplets of goo to traverse an obstacle.  Much like Lemmings, the droplets move toward your goal along the structure that you create and have to be guided away from peril. They also weigh down your structure. There may be different kinds of droplets that do different things.  Some are re-usable, some are not.  Some make links and some make trusses. Some are even lighter than air. Getting to the drain is the goal. The strategy is to minimize the number of moves and the number of droplets used to get the maximum number of droplets to the goal.  Gravity, spikes, fire, spinning gears, etc will destroy your structures/droplets and become your enemy. Planning, patience, risk-taking, and skill are required to achieve success.<br /><br />If you have ever taken a Statics (engineering) class in college, or even high school physics, you will probably find this game to be easier than most and very addictive. Enjoy!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter just loves anyhting Little Pet Shop. The game is very awesome. I'd reccomend this game to the whole.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|It arrived promptly, sealed in excellent conditon; brand new! It was purchased for my 13 year old Daughter who loves One Direction!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I chose 4 stars as it exceeded my expectations!!! The game is very entertaining. I'd reccomend this game to anyone.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works wonderful, definitely a great buy if you need a replacement cable for your Kindle Fire. Totally worth the money spent.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I chose 5 stars as it exceeded my expectations!!! The game is very entertaining. I'd reccomend this game to anyone.
0300176147|5.0|Got this for the children for christmas. I enjoy reading it as much as they do. Lots to re learn and to learn.<br />Worth the price
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My daughter loves anyhting with Angry Birds. The game is very entertaining. I'd reccomend this game to the whole family.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Seriously, awesome little BG product here.<br /><br />BPA free and comes with a great carry case, survival guide, and usable billy can.<br /><br />The billy can is made of high grade aluminum and has a great handle system.  The canteen locks in nicely to the can and all tuck away nicely into the case.<br /><br />the wide mouth opening is very nice for water purifiers.<br /><br />A must have for modern day survivalist.<br /><br />-JB
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|I chose 5 stars as it exceeded my expectations!!! The movie is very cute. I'd reccomend this movie to anyone.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Very rare for me on phone apps, but I played up to the end of the game.  The puzzles are challenging enough to remain interesting, but not so obscure that it becomes impossible to play.  The developers hit a perfect balance.  Good job.
B001HN6922|5.0|Got it for my son because we rented it from netflix and he didn't want us to send it back. Now he can watch it whenever he wants (or when we want)
B00913DPW2|3.0|The game itself seems decent, but it became impossible to play on a small screen after the initial puzzles.  Kind of a shame...
B00005JNS0|5.0|Got it for my son because we rented it from netflix and he didn't want us to send it back. Now he can watch it whenever he wants (or when we want)
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is splendid! I love it. Amazingly fun. :) It'll always be a wonderful game. I would definately give it a five star rating.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|its addicting- fun to play and go on and on and on playing. you don't want to stop playing.really fun.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|If your looking for a little bit of mindless entertainment and a few laughs, this movie does the trick.  If you like the show Glee you'll probably like this movie.  Otherwise steer clear.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|One of the most exciting movies I every purchased. I very happy with the service and would purchase more in the future.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This was an easy purchase that shipped quick. I have not viewed dvd yet. I'm hoping that it works nicely.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I LOVE IT! Didn't know I miss my home radio until I downloaded this app. It has mostly local channels and news. I've only use it on wifi but found the app real smooth and the sound loud enough that I can keep it on medium. Some stations are more staticky than others. Unless publically funded, the big name stations won't be available.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|My news feed has all kinds of display issues when I scroll down. I'll use the Facebook app on my iPhone instead.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|I received these for Christmas and noticed as I watched the first movie that some scenes have been deleted.  The letters don't appear in the eggs and Hermione doesn't answer Snape's questions to Harry in their first potions class.  Unfortunately, you can't return an opened DVD....
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Phillip Phillips has such a fun but laid back kinda album.  If you watched him on American Idol, he has an ease that makes it all look so easy to him.  The music captures that ease.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|I loved this show.  Funny to see the innocence turn to an attitude of hardened reality.  Over the top never gonna happen situation with a bear coming to life turned comedy.
B005LAII1C|3.0|It was a okay movie for me. I will probably never watch it again. A nice surprise heartfelt moment towards the end but not enough to save the film. Probably would've been a better film if it was a kids movie. Definitely just rent this movie and not buy it like I did.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|i loved the songs that were chosen and the other artist that were invited to sing on this cd. i would give it a five star rating and recommend this to anyone who is a rod stewart fan. even if not it is very mellow and understandable
B005VPRETE|5.0|my 5 year old daughter loves this, she can (with just the help of me opening packages) put together the homes and objects with little to no help at all, great instructions.  But I didnt expect anything less from Lego
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Packaging is awesome, like a old book. Movies are great! Whats not to love? Definitely would buy again for sure.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|Was able to run the digital audio signal from my newer plasma TV to my analog receiver and can now run the TV sound (much better through the stereo than thru the TV) off the stereo remote.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|This new Ren was no Kevin Bacon, but it is a good version of the classic movie. The dancing, clothes, and lingo are definitely updated from the original, but they do a good job keeping some of the same elements there. Super movie. Everybody cut footloose!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It was alright but i was def expecting it to be alot more funny...not kid friendly tho! It's def a movie for adults.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|the most fun game I've played on my kindle so far besides fruit ninja.. .. .. . . . .
B00571F26Y|3.0|It was well written with information over my head which made it boring at times. I'm not a Dr., I didn't need that much information. I found it to be a little misleading because although I believe this would be good for anyone, its mainly for people with sensitivity for wheat & celiac disease.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I like its ease of use and alternative search categories. It's smart typing feature is also very helpful, overall a good app.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I thought the book was really good and am looking forward to #3.  The first book was a bit better as it explained more of the politics preceding WWI and WWII.  I compare #1 with &#34;Winds of War&#34;
B005J4TLQG|4.0|I can't recommend this movie enough.  I'm surprised it completely flew under the radar like it did.  It's a genuinely great film from beginning to end.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I bought the box as well as each LP individually and I have no issues with the pressings or packaging. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones. It was shipped in the proper insulated box and arrived in perfect condition. A friend of mine (another Beatle collector) was not as lucky. His came busted up as it was only protected by bubble wrap. He returned it and his replacement was in the proper packing box and arrived undamaged. I also bought the LPs separately (locally) for play and I have no issues with their fidelity. They are 99 percent free of surface noise and ticks. The only noise I noticed is in the trail off groove of \\"Abbey Road\\" (side 2) but who cares it doesn't affect the music. Are people that anal that this would be an issue? I am listening to \\"Pepper\\" at this moment and it is brilliant! It keeps diverting my attention as I write this. As far as the packaging I give it a 10 out of 10. The LP covers are nicer than the originals (not as flimsy as their counterparts)and I like the extra inserts included in \\"Pepper\\" \\"Yellow Sub\\" and \\"Past Masters\\". The rice paper lined inner sleeves are perfect. The \\"proper\\" labels per LP are stunning. I also like the unattached book in the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" LP that is housed in the extra pocket in the gatefold cover. I have several copies of this LP (as it is my favorite) with the attached book so the new version is a nice alternative. Do I really even have to mention the incredible 250+ page hardcover book? I give this box a 5 star rating and I personally regard it as the best reissue set to date.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This may be my new favorite game on my phone.  I love that some of the levels are straightforward, but others require some careful planning and timing to complete.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book truly helps you realize the nature of humanity and why we will eventually fail if we do not change our course and open up to peace.
B005XLN97M|4.0|My 4 year old granddaughter lives in Hawaii. She loves her new Barbies and their beach house. She wants to take them with her when she visits friends and family!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. The details kept you hooked for more making you turn page by page for details.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I love the free books for the Kindle and Kindle daily deals.  They greatly expand our homeschool reading beyond what we can find at our library as well as allow us to keep a copy as long as we need.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|In general the book has good intensity. Not necessarily a hard ending to figure out. Over all probably a four star book.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I love the free books for the Kindle.  They greatly expand our homeschool reading beyond what we can find at our library.

B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Love this game. Graphics are fantastic. The sound is perfect. Works very well on my Kindle Fire G1. Recommend this one
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I received this for Christmas and I, my 22 year old daughter and my husband all really are enjoying watching it.  There is so much history, drama and the view of the servants and the upper class is fascinating!
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I play this with my sister in law, we have so much fun with it. This works well on my Kindle Fire (G1) and also on her iPod G4
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was by far one of the most well written books I've ever read. It had not only moments of sadness but moments of pure happiness and bliss, and I don't think I've ever had  a book make me feel everything this book has. If you're debating whether or not to get this...make sure you do, and enjoy every word of it.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This is a fun game but I do like Cool Piano so much more. This one works well with very good touch response on Kindle Fire.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I had high expectations for this show as it seems to be the one everybody is talking about. I thought it started slowly, but by episode 4 I was hooked. I am trying to slowly savor the season, but really want to cancel my other plans and watch the entire season right now.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I liked having ebay to scan and play with right at my finger tips.  easy to use!<br />get your app now
B00884GR0W|2.0|this game sucked I only gave it two stars because it would be fun if there wasn't a giant glitch when I put the crafting bench down it glitches out and I had to delete the world mineceaft pocket edition is wayyyyyy better
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This is one of the best books of the year. Highly recommend the read. It is a very useful &#34;Cook Book&#34; Or guide book for life its many ways of learning skills quickly.
078322737X|5.0|While I like &#34;American Graffiti&#34; for itself, it also suggests George Lucas' imagination and tenacity as he fought for his vision. If you want to know a little about the battles behind the scenes, not just those around Modesto or Tatooine, check out Dale Pollock's &#34;SKYWALKING: The Life and Films of George Lucas.&#34;<br /><br />Rick C
B0085KGHI6|4.0|This jam at Muddy's club in Chicago happened more than 30 years ago. It is a superb historical primary source that shows the Stones at the height of their powers but they were upstaged by a brilliant Muddy Waters & a superb Buddy Guy et al. Mick's rock star posing looked out of place in a real blues club alongside real deal bluesmen. One outstanding feature for me was seeing Ian Stewart rocking it out on piano, he truly was the heart & soul of this band. An absolute travesty, the way he was treated.
B000E33W1C|5.0|I've enjoyed &#34;A Fish Called Wanda&#34; since its original release in 1988. I recently bought a dvd copy so I could retire my vhs version. The movie is still magical, a comic tour de force, and Jamie Lee Curtis is still sexy and funny.<br /><br />Rick C
B00006J3T4|3.0|Vey laid back Knopfler, superb guitar work but thats what we expect from him. I liked some of the country influenced instrumentation but it needed more. I wanted a track to jump out of the speakers and shake me up....it didn't happen.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Like many Americans, I enjoy Christmas film classics. If, like me, &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34; has become too sacchrine, then revisit this version or the original, &#34;Home Alone.&#34; Writer/director John Hughes has kept most of his cast and plotline but has also added some wonderful quirky moments, like the pigeon-lady of Central Park. Or the battle of wits between Tim Curry as a hotel manager and Macaulay Caulkin's Kevin McKallister.<br /><br />Rick C
B0095P29EG|5.0|Very excellent movie. Strong character development. I love the touch of Shakespearean drama.<br />The movie did well to guide you to feel bad for Loki's longing to fit in; while at the same time admire Thor's personal growth.<br />All characters were very much loved.<br /><br />I have to admit.. as a lover of sci-fi & mythology, my review is biased in favor of Thor!<br /><br />Can't wait for the sequel, Thor 2. :)
B00005U8EM|4.0|If you were stuck in time, what would you do? Celebrate? Veg? Despair? Deny? Drink yourself into oblivion? Or try to improve yourself? Weatherman &#34;Phil&#34; (yes, like Puxatawny's weather rodent) / Bill Murray has to confront himself and his choices in this look at human nature that seems more Ray Bradbury than Harold Ramis. A fun but thoughtful frolic.<br /><br />I guess that the Beatles were righty about love.<br /><br />Rick C
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have this app for my Kindle Fire and it is great in keeping me up to date on my battery life and how much time I have left before I am out of juice.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|Great movie and older kid friendly. Although my 5 year old love it too, there's some language I'm not super excited about.
141659521X|5.0|If you like Vince Flynn, you will like this book.  A great read.  Could be taken from today's headlines.  Liberals will not like it.
B001974DG0|5.0|A must read for the dog lover.  My favorite Dean Koontz since Life Expectancy.  Told with great wit and fun.
B000H7J9RQ|1.0|I ordered the DVD as a Christmas present for my mom. When she placed it in the DVD player it said Region Error. Very disappointing. That wasn't disclosed in the original purchase. I would not order from CD IMPORTS ever again.
030758836X|1.0|The only good thing that I can say about this book is that if you have hopes of anything redeeming about it, you will keep turning the pages.  Unfortunately, once you have turned the last page, you see how much you wasted time and money that you can never get back.  It starts out looking like a decent mystery but quickly goes down hill when you realize that there is not one likable character in the book, no one to sympathize with or to hope for.  This is the only book that I have ever read than left me feeling nothing but anger and disgust.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|I really enjoy the cd. It has a good selection of songs. Is great to fall asleep too! Woo hoo.
B0086700CM|2.0|The graphics are cool and it could be a really fun game, but you have to keep $$ Buying things to further the game.
B002L5CNRA|5.0|Viewed this movie on late night television earlier this year and loved it.  Great story line and music.  De Niro and Palminteri are awesome and couldn't help but really like both characters.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|This is a Standard app that is nothing special.  Good for kids quick fix or kids that haven't played with it on phone already.
1926778537|5.0|As I've already played Darksiders II, I know that Madueira's art is awesome, so, my review is about a book.<br /><br />Printing is superb. Book itself is freaking HUGE, it's almost A4 and every page is thick and coated. Number of arts in it is just overwhelming - this is definitely not a quick reference.<br /><br />If you love seeing good art from time to time and/or loved Darksiders II go buy this artbook immediately.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a standard game and I love the colors and game on my kindle fire hd.  Can't complain about it.
0525953728|3.0|not mine ex husbandsdid did did did not not not not read read read it it it did not read it
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I don't have much patience for these games but the idea was cool.  I'm sure the kids will enjoy it much more than me.
006109594X|3.0|not mine belongs to ex but has to leave certain number of coments so I will type until it lets me submit
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really fun puzzle game that challenges your thinking speed. Give it a shot, it's free. 5 more words required to complete this review.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|easy tutorial and game play. nice mindless entertainment.l would recommend this game to my grandma, friends, or any one that wants to relax and have fun. Gets more interesting as you advance.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|The price of this movie was just right...The quality of the DVD was great. Act of Valor was definitely a hit in my home.
B004SIP71M|5.0|Have seen the movie, Doubt, before and wanted to add it to my collection.  Respect the work of Meryl Streep/
1613832788|4.0|I paid extra for the hard cover so it matches my game of thrones. I got the hard cover but it is a different edition than I wanted. I wish they specified which edition it was.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Love the book like I enjoy the movie<br />Excited to start the next one! I would recommend it to my family and friends
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|You should get this game.it has great replay value. It has a story and items that you have to get to the bottom of the board. At first I thought I was not going to like it, but when I got to playing it, I could not put it down. The game is worth what it is priced..but I got it as faod..I almost turned it down, sure glad I didn't. Very fun app.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|One of sparks best books. Gripping and suspenseful. Did not want to put book down...true love story with compelling courage.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|These are getting worse each time.  The action is good, but the plot appears to be completely forgotten.  I can usually forgive am action film for having no plot, but this was just a waste of my time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think that it was a great book. I can't wait to read the next book. I really want to see the movie now.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I think this app is extremely easy and helpful! I think it's very convenient that your can change your alarm to your music ( if your sick of the other alarm sounds ) so now I wake up to my favorite song(s)!!!!! &gt;.&lt;
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I liked the message, theme, etc of the story, but throughout, I had to keep reminding  myself that Charlie is freshman in high school and not a little kid.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Good if you like short reads or just want to read a book about a wimp! 4 stars out of 5.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book sucks i gave it 1 star because it was horrible i would not recamend this book im very. glad to get rid of thiss
0525478817|5.0|It was a great book and easy to read.  I couldn't put it down.  I would highly recommend to young adults and adults alike.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|I watched Prometheus on DVD in regular old 2D (don't care for 3D, never really works for me).<br />The visuals were nice but much of the film is in the dark and it was hard to impossible to see what<br />was going on.  However, bigger distractions were the fragmented, hokey story and the stupid, stupid<br />characters.  The story was not very coherent and made little sense.  THe characters behaved stupidly (withint<br />the context of the story) and did not behave like real people would in the situations in the story.  I can<br />barely recommend this DVD for viewing.  I certainly wouldn't buy it.
B0014E917Y|1.0|Was not aware region 2 meant you couldnt play the movies unless u havea specific dvd player for that region...would not recommend...would love to return it!!!!
B008XBASVY|5.0|It was a lot better than what I was expecting, very touching and emotional. I highly recommend it to everyone.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My son loves this movie!! It is so fun and full of colors and has some cute songs that will keep little ones entertained
B002BWP49C|3.0|Was not a fan of twilight series until my boyfriend little brother took us to the movies. I had so many questions I brought all the movies and now I am very into the series. Considering even reading the book.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Cute little movie that is sure to keep the little ones entertained and has a good story line that an adult can enjoy it too
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Maroon 5, once again, didn't disappoint!  Great tracks, good variety of songs, and it has been in my CD player since I purchased it.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I have to start by saying,  I really love the developer Gameloft.  I like their games so much that when i received a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas I went to the app store and bought my favorite games.  I was really excited to play Order and Chaos on my Kindle Fire HD so I downloaded it and was disappointed how far behind the version is on the HD compared to iOS.  I figured I would just try it out until Gameloft catches up with their other versions but when i created my character it said my subscription was up? I just downloaded it 12/25/12 WTF.  I wrote to Gameloft that day and have heard nothing.  So there you have it.  Not only is it outdated on kindle it still requires a subscription and you have to pay again to just play the game.  Really lame and I hope they fix it because it really is great on iOS. Like World of Warcraft in your pocket.  Gameloft please fix you are better than this.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Easy read. Suspenseful and engaging.  Very timely topic about bullying and impulse control.  Could not wait to read it every day.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's a great read for the entire family, am so try the other books by Jeff Kinney. It's the best one yet
B0091REZMW|3.0|Graphics are great, but I have to download them each time I want to play.  Also, unlike the Facebook version, it is very difficult to earn items required to visit some rooms. The positive is that my finger no longer gets burned when using the flashlight in night mode.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Awesome movie! Great visual effects! My type of movie =) you can't go wrong with this tyoe of action movie.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Product was exactly how it was described, arrived very quickly and in good condition. Would definitely recommend this product to someone. Ordered as a Christmas gift
B0027MJU00|3.0|I did enjoy this book but it was my least favorite of the Fylnn novels. I felt like even if you wanted to predict the ending  you couldn't because there was just to much information intentionally left out.Which is fine, although I felt it was almost abrupt and not tastefully done; just kind of thrown in at the end in order to tie loose ends together.
B005FISC52|5.0|Product was exactly how it was described, arrived very quickly and in good condition. Would definitely recommend this product to someone. Favorite show ever! So good!
B009369Z8A|5.0|great movie.... I had no idea this was based on a true story. as the movie unfolds it becomes a story of actual American lore. Probably not for anybody under 17....
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I love this show, DVD is awesome, can't wait for the next season! I recommend this product to everyone and anyone.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|while this movie did not do well in the box office IT is truly a GREAT movie! Rarely do I talk about movies, so here goes: this movie is actually based (loosely) on the game &#34;Battleship&#34;. You will notice &#34;Hasbro&#34; in the beginning. The story line is obviously science fiction but the movie has a bunch of fantastic special effects 7 incredible HD sound. The end of the movie is very American and very moving especially for veterans like me. My son told me to get this movie, I am glad I did ! You will enjoy this movie ! Pay attention & you will see original game &#34;hints&#34; & visuals too.... I will enjoy this movie over & over....
B009JBZH54|4.0|Product was exactly how it was described, arrived very quickly and in good condition. Would definitely recommend this product to someone. Ordered it as a present for someone and was well received. Great Price.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Fun movie with many adult situations & language. Action packed as usual. Josh Brolin actually steals the show with class and certainty.
0802473156|5.0|I recommend this product to anyone that will ever have a relationship.  This book is directed towards married couples, but the context can be used towards any relationship.  It's a very easy read and has helped me in my own relationship.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|this works well for me and I still have it installed in my camera.  It has the right capacity for the number of pictures I take.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Easy to use and a very reliable app with great features.  I use it regularly and I am never disappointed.
B003297I1U|5.0|As soon as he he opened the box at Christmas, my great-nephew let out with &#34;It's another Bruder&#34; (his Dad also got him a different one for a Chistmas present). It was opened immediately, and later father and son had a fine time playing with it.<br /><br />I was impressed with the detail and functionality, and I would recommend it to others.
B00772M1F6|5.0|Do yourself a favor and pickup this album.  Great old school blues rock sound.  I saw JD a few weeks ago, and he put on a great show.
B00821BLX4|5.0|As mentioned in other reviews, the little ring that sits around the lens falls out easily. I lost mine somewhere on a week-long bike trip (the camera is perfect for this as I never had to be concerned with moisture). I tried to re-order that piece from Olympus and they were entirely unhelpful. I put a notice in with J&R to email me when this item was in stock. I got the email just before the holidays and pulled the trigger. It fits perfectly and includes a lens cap.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love this show. So it it is hopeful to look forwad to receiving the other years for more presents.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fun game for kids of all ages! Very addicting, I played it for an hour straight without realizing! Fun app!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'd heard so much about the series and I wasn't sure I'd like it, but once I got through the first few chapters I wanted to see what happened next! Will definitely be reading the next in the series.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids can't put this game down! Works great and is super fun. Get this game for hours of fun!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|This CD was a good buy of course its Lady GaGa. I just had to have it as soon as it came out. I liked the idea of having a digital CD and not buying the physical CD itself. While I do like to have CDs to collect and own, this was a good and instant way to get my music!
B004R2DS9C|4.0|My grandson, age 4, loves it. It is great for the smaller Lego pieces but will not hold a lot of the larger ones. A very durable box.
B009MO5960|5.0|Luv it , no doubt about it, it's the best ........enjoy ur copy buy now or regret later lol yeahaww[...]
B005KR6OBM|3.0|Great video series.  One of the discs in my set does lockup however and has to be fast forwarded through to keep playing the disc.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I do not like that I can only see the first few statuses, pictures, etc. in the news feed on my Kindle Fire HD. After that, I get a few grayed out statuses, but cannot see pictures without going to the person's wall. The grayed-out statuses go to the end of the screen, and I cannot see any status from earlier. It's almost as if this Facebook app thinks I'll be on Facebook continuously. It won't even let you sort by \\"top stories\\" or \\"most recent, as I can on my ipod touch. Maybe I'm missing something, but it's pretty disappointing as it is now.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Because the company was from Australia I was prepared to be critical. But they got the turn of the century Coney Island. The singing,the production was passionate,creative. The story was surprising but true to a deep reading of human nature.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I am unable to continue to scroll down to older posts. It only show me a limited amount of posts before it comes to a hault. I think the app needs to be updated. Facebook is much better on my android phone
B003XD7ECI|5.0|Awesome compilation between 2 great singers. Very enjoyable. Couldnt ask for a better cd. Listen to it daily while in the car.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I bought and downloaded this game twice for my granddaughter.  It would not open and she wad unable to play.  Removed from Kindle. And will not reinstall!!!!!!!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I watched her the year she lost out to a street dance troop on Britain's Got Talent and like everyone else, her story captivated me.  I grew up with music and playing and singing myself and I knew talent when I heard her sing and make history late in life at 47 and never been kissed.  I have bought every album she has put out and knew i would love this one with great songs from the movies.  Once again, she came through the way I knew she would.....beautiful and I love this simple woman who still lives in the same house while her new one is used only for interviews....wonder if her cat is still alive.....
B004UXY5D6|5.0|It's ashame that country music radio is not playing this CD. I guess it's not poppy enough for todays country.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Now, I am not so sure about which one was first.  I think it was this one.  But I have bought all of her albums simply because I like not only her and her simple life but she's down to earth and made it late in life after someone submitted a song to the show &#34;Britain's Got Talent'. She has become the new Loraine Paige, her idol for so many years.  Nervous at first, it cost her the win but she recovered and has gone on with her career and people still want to hear more from her.  I for one, am very glad that she got her chance at last.
B008ULM7HU|4.0|I love this one but as always a record like this should have come out a long time before now. I see most reviews are favorable except one on it's sound (have no idea what he was listening to!) anyway, I collect this band and like most collectors have the other compilations by them and for the content of material contained on this one it really makes it one of the best compilations by Duran Duran in this time period. A few really good numbers were also included on this set that were not on the other compilations. So my thoughts are, if you a casual fan and just want a record with 98% of their best materiel, then get this one. If a hardcore fan, you won't find anything new but get it for the collection and give it a play, a very good compilation. Highly Recommended collection.<br />Drop by my site sometime @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\". Check out the BLOG section as well.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great read, didn't want to set it down!!! Good story...and the happily ever after is always a nice touch. Thoroughly enjoyed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best audio bible app Ive found. Recommended by my pastor and he originally paid around $80 for the cd's.<br /><br /> So to get it as a free app is a blessing.
B0012HQKZE|5.0|This was a Christmas morning surprise for my wife. This is one of her all time favorite movies. We both enjoy how Anthony Hopkins plays this role and he uses his intellect to overcome so many physicals obstacles.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this game is definitely worth a dollar. it is fun and very addicting. A decent amount of strategy involved. love it. You can unlock everything else through playing.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I found this Grisham book hard to get into. He lost me in all his characters and their roles in his story.  I never finished reading it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The controls are clunky, some of the games are unnecessarily aggravating, and the &quot;unlock the other 120&quot; gimmick is pretty obviously a way of padding play time.<br /><br />But, I've put a lot of time in and I'm not going to quit just because there's a persistent banner and an occasional click-through ad. This is a great game if you want something to do on the bus or when you've got a few spare minutes (and you don't want to keep reading on you're Kindle).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read this in two days! I couldn't put it down! ... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . ..
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love it! Super easy to learn and the different levels make it always feel new and it becomes addicting! Overall, very fun
B003E88TKS|3.0|I would have been disappointed if I went to the theatre to view. It was fine but not great. I lost interest a few times.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|It was not what I expected. I though there would be more action. The acting was ok. I just didn't enjoy it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|whenever i look through the news feed after like ten posts it doesnt load and takes a looonnnggg time and u cant see the full picture on the newsfeed so u have to click on it and after u see it and exit out of the picture the screen goes right to the top of the newsfeed and u have to go down all the way again.
B0088TG252|3.0|It was a decent movie. Not the best I've seen from Denzel. I still enjoyed the movie though. Maybe wait until it comes on tv to watch it.
B0086700CM|5.0|three words i must say... just. get. it. oh and its free so theres nothing to lose. works smoothly on my kindle.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was exciting and suspenseful. I wish I could watch it again for the first time.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|After reading the entire series, as well as the second series (at least what has been published so far), my family was really looking forward to watching this movie.  We were all greatly disappointed.  Rick Riordan did such an excellent job creating a story that was creative, engaging, and appealing to multiple age groups.  The movie includes none of these.  With all the vivid descriptions in the books, the movie producers blatantly ignored them, and created a storyline that was so far removed from the direction of the book, it should not even have the same name.  I was completely disgusted.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|It was entertaining. The movie was filled with action and adventure. I wished I had seen it on the big screen.
1426308469|5.0|When my four year old Great Grandson opened this gift he was immediately fascinated.  He happens to love anything with dinosaurs  so this was the perfect gift.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|It's no where to be found on my kindle I'm searching everywhere for $1.99 it should be where the apps are<br /><br />UPDATE It appeared after I posted a review which is a day after I purchased it and the camera only appeared under the photo tab above the carousel after I purchased the app not before as some reviews suggest
B008WCP2PG|4.0|received on time!<br />Channing Tatum is a fabulous dancer and was fun to see some of my favorites in this movie!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I want to be able to see all my news feeds not just a few!! Please change this or I will be uninstalling.
B005Z28M58|5.0|Shipment came nice and prompt to give the last season to my mom for Christmas. She in turn was very pleased with it, and so was I. It was a good buy, cheaper then most places!
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I teach at a Community College and many of our students struggle as the first in their family to navigate college. From a educational psychology, sociology, education, student success, equity in education, perspective, worth every penny and every minute spent reading.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|I think jim carrey is really good. one of the best renditions of the story. great animation etc. we all loved it!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Another great Angry Birds game!  It is so addicting, I love playing!  The graphics are so fun the way they match the screen changes from the original Star Wars movies and I love that the music is real Star Wars, too!
B008OOYALE|2.0|We just got a Nabi for my son's Christmas. I didn't know that the game cost money. It was already on the Nabi and listed as a Free game. My son was in the living room playing with it, and I got an email saying thanks for my recent purchases. I'm not getting that money back :(
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Kids love this game. Good puzzle fun.. Sometime hard to play on the screen of my phone but still very enjoyable.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Enjoyable read that also validates the introverted personality type (though Cain doesn't always refer to &#34;personality&#34;). Cain describes ample research that demonstrates the value that introverts bring to any setting, and just to themselves for that matter. I'd absolutely recommend this book to anybody who's thinks they are an introvert, or who has tested as an introvert, for example, on the Myers-Briggs instrument. I'd probably say the same thing I do about a lot of books: Cain probably could have incorporated anything she needed to convey in 2/3 of the length. After a while, I don't need to hear about another research experiment. My experience is often provides sufficient data for me to assess the value of her points. After all, I'm really reading the book for myself anyway. A few examples are nice to substantiate her claims, but that's enough. Her interviews with successful introverts, and how they have incorporated their introversion into their work (including research) are quite interesting.
B0076NAW48|5.0|This album is awesome! I really love this album. I have purchased several this year, but this is one of my favorites!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good time burner<br />Mindless but fun at the same time<br />Not sure why but I like it.<br />So do my kids
B002QCD2QO|2.0|I rented this because I love Edward Woodward but the movie was weird!  I read that it was such a wonderful movie but I found it to be ridiculous!
B0053KWDES|2.0|So I needed this for a work project that involved amplifying a mic, but after I fully charged it-- it wouldn't turn on. I opened it up and took out the lithium battery for a second and then just put it back in and it turned on.<br /><br />The crappy part: it continues to randomly not turn on occasionally, so I have to constantly take the battery out and in.<br /><br />Pain in the arse. Also, it doesn't amplify that great.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Not just another sappy Christian film. Wonderfully written with real life issues. I let my 8 year old son watch it with me. It offered learnin opportunites & had enough action to keep his attention.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|I chose to rent before buying; and am I ever glad that I did. I loved MIB; not MIBII, and for me the only saving grace for the third installment was Josh Brolin. No one else could have portrayed a young Tommy Lee Jones with what appeared to be such ease.<br /><br />The story line could have been stronger; and I have to ask why did they cast Emma Thompson?<br /><br />As others have stated, Will Smith certainly could have used more sass; and it seemed to me that even the aliens were old and tired, I can't imagine that these men needed the salaries they were paid; so why did they not insist upon a better production.<br /><br />I may watch it again, as they offer 48 hour rental, but as it stands now I'd have to say, watch the trailer; it containes the best scenes and most laughs.
B004SRNH10|5.0|I downloaded a bunch of apps for my son that required this. It doesn't have any problems and doesn't take much space.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|The adds are just short enough to keep the game flow going and the game is fun. Might be addictive, I don't know, I can't leave the game long enough to find out.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A very good book. Would recommend to others.<br />Now I am looking forward to the other books and the movie.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Love love love this game! Once you get started you don't want to stop, so be careful because before you know it  you' 'll run out of energy.
B008MEM24S|5.0|my daughter and I love this game.  we never have any problems with the performance.  it is a fun game and helps my daughter to think of the best way to achieve something.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was awesome. Sparks has done it again. I couldnt put this book down. Loved the ending a bit of a tear jerker especially being a mom imagining myself like that
B009N1HUIC|2.0|Another Hollywood movie full of immorality. Motherhood is a beautiful vocation and this film does little to express it's importance and beauty.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|This is a well thought out game, great graphics, creative integration between scenes. And free!!!! It has been a pleasure to test out my new tablet on this game.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This is the best Batman series ever. Hope this isn't the last one of them. Puts you on the edge of your seat.
B005HSL626|5.0|my son hates going to any appt becasue he always bored so when I downloaded this game an allowed him to play it while we wait time has just flew by and I don't have to hear him say he's bored.... LOL great purchase
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I can not wait to see the next movie, great cast, good plot. plenty of action through out the show.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I am a senior, and I have loved reading 'romance novels' since I was a teen-ager.  This one was right on point. Enjoyed it very much.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Great movie but was really short, that is the only reason I didn't give it a five star rating otherwise I loved it!
B0034G4P4Y|4.0|This is a very fun, action packed, family film.  My daughter loved this movie and raved about the crazy messes that Tin Tin finds himself in throughout the movie.  Several times she had a big belly laugh at his antics, which always makes me smile:-)
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Best movie I have seen in years, full of action and plenty of humor. I will have to watch it again ti get ball the puns.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I love this movie! It made my kids and I laugh right out loud, and has several fun, catchy songs that I find myself humming days after I've watched it. It has a great message as well:-)
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|what's with the wierd music?  Definitely a pain in the &#34;neck&#34;....don't need a sound track with my games...though this one is interesting
B007712XAU|5.0|It came in great condition and this is absolutely the best t.v. show for everyone! If you do not believe me, check out their awards! Can't wait for the third season!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Well worth the price, etc, etc, etc, and so on and even with ten more words i couldn't do it justicd
B00APUYWYA|5.0|If you want to laugh this is the movie that will make you do it! Simply hilarious with a comedic look into musical competition.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|What a interesting book to get to read!(: just wonderful book to read. Words can't say how pleased I am!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I choose this rating because...  I really Luke the details and the pictures.<br /> I dislike the most was that they had the  kissing part because m only 10.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|As much as I loved the first 2 I was not expecting as good a movie in the third.  I was wrong - this one is great.  They did a terrific job in the story line and great job on the action scenes. LOVED IT
1595825045|5.0|If you are a fan of the &#34; Avatar Last Airbender&#34; T.V Series you will enjoy this &#34;Art of The Animated Series&#34; Overall its very nice and each page is filled with designs,costumes, and info about the character. Its very nice to look at very well put together I give it 5 stars. You will not be disappointed in this product.
B009MO57H6|4.0|Just not as good as the first few.  Lots of actoin scenes but little in the way of story.  Yes we had to buy it to complet the set.  I am sure the hibby will watch it a number of times over.
155890641X|5.0|Had the VHS as a kid and decided to finish my Disney Masterpiece Collection. I don't think I need to explain further about the movie itself. If you have not seen this at all I suggest you go buy it asap. Plain and simple.
B00004STDN|5.0|its great good condition got here for christmas good price too i see what else you have i be sure to bye thanks
B00005J6T1|5.0|The whole album from start to finish is amazing every track is upbeat and just a work of art in it's own way. Even if you are not a fan of the Queen you must have the first album in your collection.
B008476HBM|4.0|Classic Jane Austen at work. Already have the paperbook addition but is definitely a &#34;must have&#34; for my electronic reading collection.....never know when you're going to get stuck somewhere or the urge for a classic read ivercomes you!!!
B007P4OTHO|5.0|Service is impeccable. Christmas present was so appreciated.<br />My friend was extatic.<br />Packaging & delay were absolutely beyond expectations.<br />Bravo
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Wow through struggles and the unimaginable in the end all works out. Thankfully there's always that one person who is willing to walk through hell for you. Sometimes to discover yourself you need to remember the past to move forward and this book is a perfect example.
0385341008|5.0|Found out about the life in Guernsey during the war was quite interesting<br />What i love about this book though is that despite the situation, this delightful english sense of humour and writing makes you smile all along.<br />Chin up whatever the circumstances may be
B002NEFL8W|2.0|all of sudden the main dial just stopped working. After taking it off the camera I noticed one of the metal pins was missing. The weird thing is that I never took the grip out the camera. Also Ive heard that the grip isnt weather proof as the camera itself. Im very happy with my 7D but Im buying an after market grip for about 20% of the price. camera and speedlite canon...lens: if you can afford canon, but there are some great values out there (ie tamron 28-75 2.8) everything else (grip, remotes etc) buy after market for 80% less than canon ones.
B00899DR40|5.0|My eldest granddaughter is a big Justin Bieber fan. This download made a great Christmas gift. Easy to buy, easy to give.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is a game I played as a teen ager.  My 9 year old loves this game.  He thinks this app is better than any other version we have purchased over the years.  Thank you!!!!
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I think their first season is still the best they've had. They had a concise, clear running storyline throughout the season and deftly managed to balance it with the Case of The Week, something they stumbled a bit with in Season Two and seems to be completely lacking in Season Three.<br /><br />Action, humor, scenery, and the Bromance of the Century. I love it.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I am begging the author to continue writing so I can continue reading well written books that consume me from beginning to end!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Pretty good. Plot and acting were decent. Characters were interesting and held my attention. Liked the homage to \\"The Breakfast club\\"!
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Pretty strategic game for me. It's worth the money, go ahead and buy it. Its also acceptable to the parents
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this trilogy and recommend it for everyone! Wonderfully written story for any age! I will re-read these again and again.
0545265355|5.0|I gave this set as gifts, I really enjoyed every one of them, Great Story line I can not wait for the second movie to come out
B004K4IZ54|4.0|If you grew up seeing the first Tron movie, you might be wondering if this version would be a fitting sequel. In my mind, Tron Legacy has done this very well. The special effects are seamless while paying homage to the color palette of the original. The light cycles are terrific, the depth of the sets is great, and the sound track is perfect.<br /><br />I have watched it about 4 times now, and it has grown on me with each successive viewing. I definitely recommend this movie if you were a fan of the original.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I cannot begin to describe how bad this book is. Not even good pornography. I would avoid this and any sequels if I were you.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|you can only view like 10 statuses then the rest are all blue . stupid . they need to fix it asap .
B008K5T5AI|4.0|A touch of cheeky philosophy. An exploration of transcendence that never quite leaves the real. Banks writes with elegance and humour about imagined futures that somehow allow humans and human values to flourish in a big, big universe.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This set surprised me with its sharp quality and great selection of dvd's. I already watched all of the epidodes on Netflix and was doubtful that this dvd set would offer me any episodes that I have not already watched. When I opened it up and watched the first episode I was thrilled. I had never saw it on Netflix. In fact most of these have never been on Netflix.
0767812387|5.0|Excellent DVD
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Every translation<br />Every version<br />And you can read along with the audio feature.<br />You can't go wrong with this app.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Excellent DVD
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Loved the selections on this CD.  I didn't realize she had so many great hits.  I'm very pleased with my selection and with the great price.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Excellent DVD
B000YHG72E|3.0|Not sure what I was expecting but it seemed to go over well with the kids (13,8,3) and I did not get bored with it.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Excellent DVD
0446343129|5.0|Needed more information on sugar, this is an excellent read, well package and arrived faster than expected. Very happy with my choice and will purchase more books soon.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THE &#34;TWO GRAVES&#34; BOOK.  iT WAS HARD TO PUT IT DOWN.  IT WAS EXCITING TO READ RIGHT UP TO THE ENDING.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Gave to my nephew for Christmas present and he loved the movie.  The package was well package and the items arrived on time. Thanks for a job well done.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great game graphics are good very interesting story line<br />also if you get the stragedy guide is very helpful deft worth the 2.99 I paid for it
B0002VFXFE|5.0|The Thermal compound worked as advertised. I don't know what else to say since I didn't test my system CPU temperatures prior to changing out the thermal compound, this was simply to aid in upgrading my heatsink.
B00ADS98FC|2.0|Not sure why this movie was rated so high by other viewers. Not what i expected. Bad acting. Bad plot. Music ok
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Very quite, tall but not so tall as to not fit into my standard ATX case. It requires you to take out your motherboard in order to mount so just be aware of that before you think it will snap into place like your Intel heatsink probably did.<br /><br />Overall I love it. I had it recommended to me by a friend and I'm glad I made the purchase.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I felt as if this book was hyped up because of who the author was and not based on the content.  I didn't actually enjoy reading it or get &#34;into it&#34; until I was about 50% of the way in.  If you have to struggle through half of the book before you even care what's going on, then there is a problem.  I don't think it lived up to the Rowling name!  The story lines were boring and the people we just not that interesting.  I didn't care about them at all.  Better luck next time...
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|I can't get the talking feature to work. He just the does the same few things over and over. Not for me.
B008TRUDAS|1.0|Very juvenile, though I don't recommend for teens.  I really wish I didn't pay for this.  Unlikable characters, and predictable story lines.  Snore.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's great with one exception. Every time I open it, it's on one of my friend's pages when I know I left on the News Feed page.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a typical Stephen King page-turner.  Highly recommend!  I was a small kid during the kennedy reign in the wWhite House.  This book puts you right on the street in Dallas.
B000PGTPE6|5.0|Love it!  A very different  Bruce a great concert and a really great band . A must see a few of my friends went out and bought it after watching it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this app works great. it is so easy to set the alarm. the display is easy to see and very clear.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I read a lot of SF and found this book outstanding! Great story with some very funny lines. You might even laugh out loud. I especially liked the applied physics, not wormhole string theory but good old fashion stuff I could understand. An excellent read you won't want to put down.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|These Kindle covers would be SO much more user friendly if they had a POCKET or two.  I need a pocket to hold a stylus, maybe a business card.  Nothing huge and bulky here but just a little pocket so that sometimes my Kindle is all the purse I need.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Both boys love this game. Could not wait to get it on the kindle to start all over the game.
B003L77GG0|5.0|For a real Smallville fan is good to have the complete collection.<br />I like they don't took the Superman's story as we know it.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars but in many puzzles it is VERY sensative to the EXACT spot the object needs to be placed and can trow you off when you have it right!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|John Corey is a great character but the continuous wisecracks get tiresome.  I also noticed in this book the repetitious author's asides such as 'then he said', He added to', etc. within dialogue.  It seemed unnecessary and annoying.  Mr. DeMille needs a better editor.  The story starts slow but builds tension (finally) near the end.  It's still okay, a quick entertaining read but I hope DeMille's books don't continue this downward trend.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Was a great deal for all three movies if you had not already purchased the first two. Could do without the special features.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This is an automatic watch - living in the mountains of WV, I cannot get to the nearest town with watch batteries very often, an automatic fills the &#34;no battery&#34; requirement.<br />The watch is an average size and thin enough. Large watches oar to big for me and hang-up on most things I have to get my hands on.<br />This is a great watch - buy one.
B004LWZW24|4.0|If you want a movie that is actually creepy then watch this movie. I am hard to scare or creep out but this movie did it for me.
0399157565|3.0|I have been a fan of Cornwall for years and eagerly looked forward to her next book. However, I find this lukewarm at best, I kept losing my place because the book did not keep my attention. This is not the same Scarpetta novels I am used to. Disapointed and waiting for the \\"good stuff\\" and I am almost done with the book.<br />Wait for the book to be released in paperback..the price of the hardcover was not worth it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was hard to put down. I am especially impressed with the twist in the story. I recommend this to anyone.
0345528581|5.0|A friend of mine refered me to read &#34;You Are Your Own Gym&#34; by Mark Lauren as we were talking one day.  I took a chance and ordered the book from Amazon.  I was impressed right away.  The book is simple to read and flows quickly giving background and general heath information.  But, a majority of the book is (of course) centered on different types of bodyweight exercises.  The amazing thing is that there are so many exercises!  Now, there will be some that you already know, but I was very impressed at how many exercises that I never knew about and that you can do without the use of weights or by using improvised weights!  This book covers it all and will be extremely handy to someone that travels a lot, or someone that does not have a lot of time to hit the gym, or someone with a very random schedule which makes planning to workout difficult.  The best thing about this book is that you can perform the exercises anywhere and at anytime.  I find it very useful to use if I happened to not be able to make it to the gym; I can still get a good workout in at home using the exercises listed in the book.  Check it out; I am sure you will like it!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|AMAZING!!!!!! I am very pleased with the book. My next stop: Book 2: The Reptile Room! Sounds exciting and fun!!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I liked the first one better.  But it was entertaining to watch and the story is good. Besides, Kate and Jessica.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed out loud and cried at parts, but God this book has changed my life. Thank you Mr. Green
B000OZXL8Y|5.0|its so realistic and well detailed, its so real that my 2 years old son fights for it, he even sleeps with them<br />good buy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It really got me thinking about life and how sad and happy it can be at the same time. It also helped me remember how valuable family and friends are to me. I would recommend this book to any high schooler. I think it helps people realize that even though life is hard, it always gets better.
B005JVNTGM|5.0|Love this movie.  After years of that Friends TV series, seeing the hot Jennifer Aniston in garter belt and stockings makes this movie well worth the price!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The Next Update should be signs I hope minecraft hears this :] and the next update should also have Redstone stuff
B009JBZH54|5.0|The Batman Trilogy has to be my favorite trilogy of all time and contains one of my top 5 movies of all time (The Dark Knight). I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good plot, storyline/sequence, good movies or just overall entertainment. This is not just a set of superhero movies, but a set of amazing movies.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's funny and I love every page of it. It is a serious page turner, I can see why it's a number 1 seller
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is a great show for anyone. The only problem, the show was too short lived. With an great ensemble on screen, they make this one of my favorite TV shows of all time. I highly recommend this to anyone whenever I get the chance to do so.
0316069434|3.0|I really, really wanted to see Michael Connelly return to form. I had high hopes for The Black Box, but although it was a disappointment it was still markedly better than his other recent efforts. Connelly basically turned me onto this genre many years ago with his first novels and it's been sad (and costly, and time-consuming) for his readers to watch him settle into mediocrity. On the surface, this Bosch book sounded like it had the potential for redemption, but it wasn't to be. It's not a bad book, it's just not that good.<br /><br />It's a fairly interesting cold-case of the murder of a foreign journalist during the LA riots of the 90's. Bosch has his usual run-ins with authority figures as he uses tried-and-true techniques and intuition to make progress on the investigation, and for awhile there it sounded like he would be bounced from the case and the department in short order. However, he's able to work through his issues, make some logical leaps to identify and eventually take down the suspects, and in the meantime handle the sub-plots of romance and parenting. Everything turns out well.<br /><br />When I read and eventually review novels, I usually 'rate' them in plot, writing, dialogue, and conclusion. The Black Box had a decent plot, but I did have problems with several parts that I thought no cop would ever do. The conclusion as well was a bit hard to take- although the good guys 'won' in the end, I don't necessarily think the way the story built to that point was very believable.<br /><br />I had my biggest problem with the writing and dialogue. In a word, it was boring. When Hemingway wrote in simple, declarative sentences, it was magic. When Connelly does it, which seemed to be what he attempted to do throughout this book, it was tedious, sort of like listening to Detective Joe Friday for 400 pages. The dialogue was likewise rather stilted and odd-sounding in many cases.<br /><br />At least the plot, albeit with a few holes, was a bit better this time. Who knows- with marginal improvement each time Connelly might be back to his previous level of competence in 10 or 15 years.
B0025KW29U|5.0|NPH, Nathan Fillion and Joss Whedon...can it get any better??? This is a hilarious and catchy show that is worth every cent and has great rewatching value.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I remember way back in 2002 when the first Resident Evil movie came out how skeptical I was about a video game transfer to the big screen. But you gotta hand it to Writer/Director Paul Anderson on that one; he made a great, Action/Horror film.<br /><br />Then along came Resident Evil: Apocalypse (RE2) in 2004. Anderson wrote the script, but turned the directing reins over to Alexander Witt...and you saw Witt's inexperience all over the movie. RE2 added an amateurish hokeyness that wasn't present in the original.<br /><br />In 2007 the series returned to straight-up Action/Horror with Resident Evil: Extinction (RE3). RE3 never got as dark and creepy as RE1, but it was a lot better than RE2. Anderson again wrote the script, but relied on vet Russ Mulcahy (remember the cult 80s hit Highlander?) to direct. For RE3, Mulcahy went back to a lot of the basics that made the original so good.<br /><br />Paul Anderson returned in 2010 to the Writer/Director's chair for Resident Evil: Afterlife, and he continued with the straight-up Action/Horror format. There were good old fashioned scares, a ton of action and the story never got boring. The acting and action were often clich&eacute; and over the top, but it was all good.<br /><br />And in 2012 Anderson held onto the reins for Resident Evil: Retribution, but this time a word of warning: If you're a gamer (especially if you've played [[ASIN:B002Z7BE24 RE5]] or [[ASIN:B0050SXLQC RE6]]), you'll probably like Retribution...maybe even a lot. On the other hand, casual movie goers will likely want their own retribution after watching this latest in the franchise series.<br /><br />The 2012 film is VERY videogame-esque. The characters need to escape an underwater/underground facility where they encounter various levels that they must get through often with video game bosses to beat in order to get to the next chapter. It was like watching long video game cutscenes, but when the action started you don't get to play...you still just sit and watch. Like its predecessors, Retribution has tons of action, but it's much lighter on the scares, and like I said earlier, the whole 'escape from the facility' concept may have made a great video game in the series but it only left me yearning for my PS3 controller. Perhaps too much time was devoted to the 3D stuff that for DVD viewers like myself wasn't part of the equation. Retribution was fair, but I suppose it was better with the 3D action eye-candy.<br /><br />It's certainly not necessary to watch all the movies in chronological order to understand what's going on in the individual releases. But if you're into the Action/Horror genre, and you haven't seen [[ASIN:B000MPEIF6 the first]] or [[ASIN:B004DTXJ4S Afterlife]], I'd recommend starting from there. If you like those two, then you have Retribution if you've got to have more. None in the series have topped the 2002 original.atch.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|The most notable aspect of this novel is that it is one of a relatively small number of books that is based on a truly unique premise for the future. Living in an underground Silo due to the outside atmosphere no longer supporting life provides an opportunity to explore a very different existence. But what makes this book interesting are the rules this culture utilizes to keep control of the thousands of people in the Silo. Excellent characterizations and a solid story line kept me turning pages till the ending... a very satisfying ending.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was very good. Has some violence in it.<br />Not recommended for children under 10<br />Very, very well written
B0029Z7Y2G|5.0|Underword: Rise of the Lycans<br /><br />This book keeps me on the edge of  my set. I just could not put it down. I would recommend this to all my friends and family.

Temporarily stuck on a stage that uses the balloons also :/  ... I used to have this on the ps3 a long time ago. It's fun. Not quite sure if it worth $5 but i got it while it was the free app of the day so its all good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a really good book. Very different from any other book I have read. It had a lot of twist and ups and downs. I did tell all of my family and friends.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game and played it on my phone without any problems; however while playing on my kindle fire it constantly freezes up and a note pops up telling me my connection is too slow (which it isn't)  and refers me to try another room and that my credits will be refunded....I made 7 complaints to their support in a 30 minute span and have yet to be refunded any credits or even a response from the support team...GRRRRRR!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've enjoyed the game very much. I don't think it could be inproved. Try it, you will love it. I just know it!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|My son likes this cover but keeps misplacing it because of the black color that merges with our black furniture. I gave it three stars because the folding mechanism to keep the kindle upright works but is not very stable.
B0063IH60K|4.0|What more do you want?  It works well, it has all the necessary options.  If you'd like a time waster, it doesn't get much better than this.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I never watch a movie before reading the book if a book is available, but the previews on this one intrigued me. Thus, I bought the e-book. Couldn't put it down. A story that could live inside each of us. 're-inventing the past to create a new beginning. A must read!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great play, keeps you plenty entertained!  Many levels of play to choose from, my grandchildren love to play with me too.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|The most clever, engaging, endearing, and laugh-out-loud funny television comedy EVER. I actually purchased all five seasons for my daughter (well, yes, and myself too) as a Christmas gift and, trust me, we are delighted!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Even though I had at least fourteen days to read this novel I found myself unable to put it down. Hopeless is definitely a great book. It does not stick to pure happiness, it also shows pain, hopelessness, and sadness. This book is deep, and displays events that are realistic. Though at some parts I dreaded reading, it just made the experience far greater. Definitely a good read.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love it more than A Christmas Story! Elf is the best Christmas movie of all time. Will Ferrell is brilliant in this movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Movie does no justice to the book love this book can not wait to read the rest of the trilogy
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Still good after all those seasons. Dexter still has A few surprises left in the series can't wait for season 7.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|Do not like how it only shows the last 10 posts.<br />Not user friendly and doesn't come close to other facebook apps.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like the  ability to play more than just one suit and to be able to back up a move or to replay the deal.  It is a way of looking at different outcomes,depending on when you make a decision.
B005QUQ99K|4.0|the ninjago cartoon is a big commercial for the lego products...and it works.  my boy(4) and his friends love ninjago.  the toy is well made and my son enjoys playing with them after putting it together.  full msrp is a bit on the high side, but amazon always has them on discount at around $15.  at that price i think they are worth it.
B000ZLFALI|3.0|The idea of creating a musical using songs by the Fab Four is interesting.  There are a few Beatles songs in which person's names appear and so some story can be written using those names given to the characters.  The director picked such obvious choices as Jojo, Lucy, Max, Sadie, and Prudence, as well as such obscure ones as Dr. Robert and Mr. Kite.  To a Beatles fan who has been listening to their songs for years and memorized most of their songs, the character names are associated with some strong images that are depicted in the songs and so the use of such character names is an overkill, because there is nothing common.  And because such names are used the story is tweaked to be able to use the songs addressed to them.  For example, the character Prudence exists just for the sake of being able to use of the phrase &#34;Dear Prudence, won't you come out and play&#34;.  Her presence and the story around her are so artificial.  The main story is somewhat cheap, using the Vietnam War and the College students protest as the background.  A plenty of songs by The Beatles are rendered in the movie, and that is fun to listen to.  While the story lines are idiotic, there are many beautifully filmed, memorable scenes; e.g., the partying scene with &#34;With A Little Help From My Friends&#34;, an amazing army recruitment scene with &#34;I Want You&#34;, and a stage performance scene with &#34;Don't Let Me Down&#34;.  Jude, Lucy, and Max are well acted, and they are cute.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Downloaded this appand am amazed. Can continue playing the WoW ah, and crafting while in the bathroom or living room now. Also, installed the streamer on my xbmc machine, so I dont have to get up to start or restart xbmc. This will definately cut down on my exercise. Wait, maybe that's not a good thing. Oh well, awesome app!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The past few books were very light weight but I could not put this one down. Great read and I'm looking forward to the next one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i became addicted and my competitive side against my self kicked in and i finished the game. so yeah i loved it
B005LLSLPE|5.0|Just absolutely excellent.  You don't need to love motorcycles or feel guilty about having anti-heroes on your set.  It is just damn good entertainment with superb acting and direction.  It is not for small children and wimps, but the characters will grab you.
B0086700CM|4.0|i finished the game and now im just trying to move up the leader board. it was fun while it lasted
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't think this version of the FB app is as fine-tuned as the app for other devices. It doesn't update as well as my phone.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|it started out really slow but than it became ok. its an easy game and everything become the same after a while not much variation. i didn't like that the multiplier only went up to thirty which i reached in like two weeks and lost my drive to complete tasks<br />over all it a good game to pass the time
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS A AWSOME GAME!!!!  I like this like this game cause Well... ITS MINECRAFT  but it's like not to be offending to anybody that likes Alfa but Alfa is umm..  it sucks they just really need to update but besides that ITS BOSS, EPIC AND MINECRAFT!!!!<br /><br />Z
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a simple yet challenging game. It is quite addictive and easy to play, but it also offers enough of a challenge to keep you playing.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Well it is not that old, but nonetheless it needed some help.  It was overheating and the best I could tell from the symptoms it needed new thermal paste.  From other internet resources Arctic Silver was a good brand/product.  Purchased it, used it and now my old MacBook Pro is like new again.<br /><br />Now when I say used it, I went way deep into the dark depths of the logic board (aka as a motherboard) of the laptop.  Wiped off the old crusted compound paste and reapplied this new stuff.<br /><br />Overall I would buy again and recommend this product.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|20 more words 17 more words 14 more words 11 more words 8 more words 5 more words 2 more word limits are stupid for this point.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Good book quick read..stayed up until 3 in the morning without even realizing that I was up that late.. the end
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Interesting plot but the close quarters, fast-cuts just wore me out.  I would have enjoyed more had they kept the camera still and made the cuts twice as long.  Hard to tell who/what/where when the cuts were so fast.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Amazing product! This is one of the most useful products that has come out! Is great we can have multipul devices on to share music through
B000A6T1JU|5.0|Classic movie of all times, this is how you fight. Nothing but good to say about the movie. Straight classic.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|I was pretty disappointed, considering it was advertised as one of the funniest movies ever. Most of the &#34;funny&#34; was in the trailer. It was too serious for me.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I love everything about this case. My only regret is that I didn't buy a more colorful case so my kindle would be easier to locate.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|A very cute Christmas story! I would really recommend this to adults and children very very funny movie! Loved it

B009MCRHH6|5.0|Excellent game, it is lots of fun to play and is both challenging but not annoyingly too difficult. I first played it on PC and am glad to have it again on the Kindle fire.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|thos is the best book i have ever read. its a stunning fantasy made and woven(as acerne would say) from myth. i learned all of the names of the 12most powerful gods and ther powrs of greek myth. this would be a great book and a great series to follow if anyone wanted to do the same.
0061992860|5.0|This is a great little survival guide, which will fit just about anywhere. The author claims this book has been the standard for many years, and I can see why. Clear, concise information, presented in a no nonsense way, definitely recommended.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Takes getting used to.  Have to learn different tactics and different ways of solving the space problem. I am sure that I will be able to conquer it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've never had a book that impacted me this much. I can only say, it is a must read. Just prepare yourself for some tears.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This package is a great deal for those who love the Harry Potter Films.  There aren't a lot of extra features or memoribilia.  What you get is 8 blu ray discs which give great quality viewing of the movies, which is, after all the main thing.
B00701L5XS|5.0|Great for reference.  Like the little side-info they give about each knot. Very helpful that it shows how each knot is tied AND you can slow the speed down to get a better view of what's going on.
B008LC8TJI|2.0|My kids really wanted a maroon 5 cd because they have been watching the Voice and love Adam, so I bought them this cd for Christmas, knowing that it had a parental advisory. I know, dumb of me.  We don't usually get too fussed about a little bad language, my kids listen to Gogol bordello and like it a lot.  I thought, how bad could it be? I realize now that the radio plays a very sanitized version. My son who is 8 puts his hands over his ears because the bad language is so...loud and well, really bad.  Can anyone tell me how to get a version that has the bad words dubbed out, like on the radio?
B004SMDJ9U|3.0|The audio and video are out of sync by a full second on at least one episode on disc #2 (that's as far as my viewing has progressed to date).  It's kind of like watching a foreign film with the dialogue dubbed in BADLY.  While it is not a consistent error, it is distracting and indicates to me that quality control could use some quality control.<br /><br />It's unfortunate because I really love the series Haven and this flaw has caused me no small degree of disappointment.
B00AJV4G28|2.0|I am no prude and I tend to use cuss words, but I know when not to.  Buddy guy neds to learn that when he is taping a show for a CD.  There are so many cuss words that this CD could never see the light of day on any radio station.  Buddy Guy deserves better, but he just doesn't get it.
B000SGRONM|1.0|Rather morbid for Christmas with a bit of a sick sense of humor.  The best part about the book was how short it was.
B0091LS0BU|5.0|It's Sir Paul, what else can you say.  The original Kisses on the Bottom is one of his best efforts in many years.  It just shows you how good every Beatle was.  No matter the genre of music, Paul McCartney can make all of these songs his own and then classics to boot!  Best song? The Christmas Song!
B005VTS4EY|4.0|I enjoyed it. The game is easy enough to not get annoyed and just hard enough to keep you interested.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|I could not resist the price $.99 for such a complete collection of his work. Even at the regular price, it is a bargain.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|To me it was one if not the best of his books  Held my attention from first to last page
B006R4H5FG|5.0|I did not want to buy this book due to Zen, which I did not know in details (neither today) but as one day suddenly made a for a kindle version there was no way back. That was one of my best click in the last year.<br />Now I understand what is the difference between a document and a slide-show. Why PP or Keynote is not getting a good and useful tool, but rather forcing us to make mistakes, turning our ideas into a boring presentation. Anyway instead of an explanation you should read this book. Everyone should read who speaks to smaller or bigger audience... Have a good time with that!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The movies arrived in great shape, on time, and in good packaging.  We just haven't watched them yet.  Hopefully, there is nothing wrong with them!

B000O8OTNC|5.0|nice little device. It should work well when you need it.  nice carry and go piece.  Would buy it again if necessary,
B00000J048|5.0|My two euro grandson received this Christmas!  He has not stopped playing with it!  We will definitely be adding more sets  to the collection.
0061733199|5.0|Ive only been through a couple chapters but it seems to have everything I wanted in a survivalist book.  Great
B005GSVFAK|5.0|This is one of the most complete movie which tell the story in a very colourful way. It has the appealing power for all age group. As for kids, they will enjoy the story line , actions and jokes. As for me , I like the message about staying together and helping each other out. It seems that this has been long forgotten by most of us in this \\"Dog eat Dog\\" world.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this dirt cheap at like 26 bucks. Would definetly recommend if you can get near that price again.
B007TK77QE|1.0|After reading all the Harry potter books I expected great things from this, the first of Rowlings adult books. This is dragged out and the characters are not the slightest bit endearing to the point that you just want to put the book down -which I did in the end.<br />May yet go back to it but not in the foreseeable future anyway!!!!!
B0056BMK6K|4.0|As an author [...] I was interested in how John Locke has accomplished his remarkable ebook sales. The stand out piece of advice for me is - Don't do social, BE social.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|I watched these movies wit my children over nd over again and nothing comes as close to entertainment and imagination as these early Disney classics. I don't get tired of being asked to see these movies.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This was a book I let peer pressure force me to read, but it was disheartening to think this is a way of life for some people.  Call me old fashioned, but I think it's time to go backwards and clean up our act.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is entertaining for early teens and younger.  And on top of it it's free!  Your can't beat it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved this book, it was the type you can't wait to find out the mystery but don't want it to end.  Too real as it seems we can't be happy in this world unless we have 'everything our way'<br />.
B001DJLCRC|3.0|I ordered all 4 seasons here for my husband for Christmas.  To our dismay, there are no English subtitles!  I wish there was more information provided before ordering things like this.  Other than that, the CD's are new, all in wrappers, and the series is really good.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a fun app.  Play it frequently and it helps reduce stress...takes you away. :)  You might want to try it!
B000YH6YG8|5.0|While I don't agree that this movie sums up all of our American history it is an intense drama about a man's journey and how his life has affected others as well.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|he was a bit crude.  I may be showing my age a bit.  I guess I expected a movie more like BIG.  I should have known ... I did laugh out loud though; hence the 4 stars..
B005LAII1C|5.0|very funny movie, kinda pricey.<br /><br />bought it as an Xmas gift for my Dad. very funny movie especially if you love Family Guy!!
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Great action packed movie.  It was good seeing some of the old bad guys from previous Bourne movies.  They  are really evil.  The Amazon price seemed a little high but more convienient that driving to Red Box and only paying $1.00.  The other problem was that it took over 2 hours to download the movie onto my TIVO-HD before I could watch it.  Yes I have high speed AT&T fiber optic internet connection but not the highest speed.  Next time Red Box.
1426209584|5.0|This book is about astonishing fotography of the most fascinating birds on earth. A masterpiece! Every picture makes you wonder: is this real?
B0007ZIYM4|5.0|I am very very familiar with Vivaldi's four seasons and have listened to it countless times. However, great was my surprise when I first heard Janine Jansen's recording. How refreshing! Absolutely fantastic - can't get enough of it.
B005V4FJC4|3.0|This... album... is... ok. I felt like my Christmas music collection wasn't complete without it - and I've hardly listened to it at all since downloading. Good thing I got it on sale.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This game is an ok version.  I have no complaints.  It is a simple version w/o any storyline.  Good for a free game.
B002VWNID6|4.0|the acting was over the top at times but the story was great. Needed a better play on words to get it another star enjoyable but just missing tha t extra star zing.
B005VPRETE|5.0|all i can say is they liked it when it was given, havent tested it myself but seems like its good
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book was great up until the last 1/4 of the book. I couldn't believe the way the author thought up some of the scenarios in the book. I was glued to my seat and I couldn't wait to finish it and see what happens and then I got to the last 1/4 of the book. The ending didn't stand a chance with the rest of the book. It was almost like the last 1/4 was written by a different author. I loved it but didn't care for the ending.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|The movie ended just when it should have started going, just left it open for a new Bourne series, The ending reminded me of the lord of the rings trilogy where the first movie didn't really end. I said then that if I invest 3 hrs to watch a movie, it better end, never watched the others, Will treat the new bourne series the same.
B009GESJH2|2.0|I hated to rate Kid Rock's last album \\"Born Free\\" so low, but nothing on that album stood out to me as something that would be a classic, it may have gone to #1 in the US and done fairly well around the world, but that was fans anticipation that Kid's latest album would be great, but the proof is seen in how many songs you remember now, how many have radio play, how many clips where made and remembered and the singles chart positions.<br /><br />I am glad Kid Rock abandoned using Rick Ruban's help to produce this album, as it does sound a bit more like Kid Rock now. However, I was excited to not only hear that, but that Kid wanted this album to be something more like \\"Cocky\\" which to me is one of his best albums yet where I enjoy listening to that album almost from start to finish. But what has been the outcome here on \\"Rebel Soul\\" has been rather disappointing for me.<br /><br />The opening song \\"Chickens In The Pen\\" is not a strong opener, nor is it a great song. Usually upon hearing the first track of an album, it sets the mood for what is about to come, but like on \\"Born Free\\" the first track here made my heart sink that this album was not going to put Kid back on top of his game. The lyrics are too weird for me to even understand what Kid was going for on this track. I thought maybe it would be tongue in cheek lyrics, but \\"the mule keeps kickin' the chickens in the pen, Let's rock all night and then do it again\\" I dunno... I just expect better from Kid Rock. The song is just too stupid to be good if you ask me.<br /><br />Lets Ride - it sounds like Kid has taken a real liking to the 60's and 70's sound of Rock N roll bands like 'The Who' and 'Alice Cooper'. It's certainly not a bad thing at all, however the song comes off sounding pretty average for it's genre.<br /><br />Catt Boogie - About the same as \\"Lets Ride\\", its decent, but not all that memorable.<br /><br />Detroit Michigan - OK, KID. WE GET IT ALREADY, YOU ARE FROM DETROIT, BUT PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASEstop singing about it. The lyrics sound good, the melody is pretty good, up until the chorus, it just doesn't sit right in the song. A song that could have been good, but he does a better job with this type of thing later on the album.<br /><br />Rebel Soul - I expected a title like this to be southern rock, but it sounds country to me. Kid's done some great country songs, but this song here to me is not worthy of naming the whole album after. Definitely a filler sounding track.<br /><br />God Save Rock N Roll - What is Kid thinking these days? First Rebel Soul is not southern rock, yet this one here has ROCK N ROLL in the title and is a country tune? Next.<br /><br />Happy New Year - This is a cover song? Why did Kid chose to cover this song? It's pretty simple lyrics, and i'm convinced Kid can do much better then this. I was surprised to see this song was leading the votes of favorite song from this album on Kid's website... why, I just don't know?<br /><br />Celebrate - Not a bad song, but like track 2 and 3, it is easy to forget, but amongst the rest of this album, it's one of the better ones on here.<br /><br />The Mirror - I absolutely hate auto-tuners. Kid doesn't need to use them, and ruined what could have been a decent slow song had he not used those annoying stupid auto-tuners that should be banned from anyone being able to record with. I did say something the same on Alice Cooper's last album, and was informed that it was an effect and not an auto-tuner, so if that's the case with this song too, then Bathroom Bobby, never EVER use that effect ever again, it sounds horrible.<br /><br />Mr Rock N Roll - I was losing faith that there wasn't going to be a stand out song on this album, and i'd be reviewing it the same way I did Kid's last album, but Mr Rock N Roll showed up and brightened my day. I wouldn't say this song is 5 of 5 stars, but it's around the 4 mark. It's my favorite track on this album, and easy to get into and rock with. The lyrics are great,has a lot of familiar names of classic songs in it, and is worthy of Kid adding this track to his live shows.<br /><br />Cucci Galore - At first I thought, WTF is this $#!%? lyrics spewing out of \\"My names Cucci, Cucci, Cucci galore\\" and repeating. Then a screaming rock chorus of \\"Do you wanna go down\\"... the song makes little sense to me other than it's a typical Kid Rock bragging about having money, fame, women and hot tubs etc... but as weird as the lyrics are, and a WTF imprint it left after the first listen... for some reason, it's not a bad track, as much as it makes little sense, it's catchy.. and about the only song on here that has any boom bass in it, where as most of the other songs on here are classic rock or country sounding, this one combines a bit of rock with a sort of hip hop beat to it. Weirdly, this track grew on me!<br /><br />Redneck Paradise - Euhhh, seems like Kid has done this song before. I'd rather better red neck songs about drinking or \\"Born To Be a Hick\\" over this feel good attempt at a trailer park sing-along filler.<br /><br />Cocaine and Gin - Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, I take back that thing I said about rather listening to drinking songs... only when they rock, this one is just a filler for boredom.<br /><br />Midnight Ferry - I was so sick of hearing halleluiah preachy songs by this point that I just can't even get to the end of this track. Not a good way to close the album. Kid has said he wants this song played at his funeral, I would take \\"Only God Knows Why\\" over this any day and any night.<br /><br />I added up my ratings, and can only give this album a 1.9... a bit higher then the last album, but far from the 4 to 5 star ratings for albums Kid has done in the past. Just to be clear, no, I am not a rap or hip hop fan, so with those sounds being absent here have not left me bitter, but I do miss the heavier sound of songs like \\"So Hott\\", \\"American Baddass\\" and Kid's earlier album sounds... I do miss The Twisted Brown Trucker Band... plus, what I would have loved to hear was songs like on \\"Cocky\\" that started off slow, then rocked your @$$ off by the end. Hopefully Kid Rock will return to that sound on the next album. But even so, the songs on here, there are a few decent tracks, but only one or two worthy of being included during live shows, but only barely worthy of being called a hit song... not something I would be disappointed by if they didn't appear on a greatest hits album in future... but compared to Kid's best stuff, really only Mr Rock N Roll would be worthy of standing next to them... but again, not hard to understand if it was passed by as a greatest hits selection.
B009GESJH2|5.0|What's not to love about Kid Rock?  This was a gift so I did not listen to it myself but have not heard any complaints from the recipient.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|The drug stuff was a turn off.  It had a chance to be a really good movie, but fell short.
1401310672|5.0|I was crying I was laughing so hard! I've passed it on to friends and they have all been in hysterics as well!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you loved the first book, you will love this one too!  I couldn't pu it down!  Very much worth the money!
B007THA4FI|1.0|We chose this book for a book club. Unfortunately, no one could get through the book. It was not written well and there were too many characters to keep up with. There was very little action and I found myself wondering when something good was going to happen.
B002ZP1STK|5.0|This was very heartwarming story. I am not one to watch a movie more than one time, but I have just finished watching it for the second time and enjoyed it as much as I did the first time.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved the first one.  This one is a little tricky to follow the characters, but it is also a great book.  You really need to read Fall of Giants before getting into this one.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|What a superb product! The first movie is an old one, but the image quality is incredible. The rest of the movie's HD standard are excellent as well. Don't miss the MUTH-UR interface inside every movie to see some cool features!
B004JK61K0|5.0|I first discovered K-9 in my desperation to find a better-functioning email client on a Nook Tablet that didn't drain the battery as rapidly as the stock app did. Ever since, I've fallen in love with how customizable and easy to use K-9 is once you get the settings how you want. It pushes emails in real time to the notifications bar, as per your settings, and polls the server at your chosen intervals (or not at all, if you so desire) so that you can still catch mail when reconnecting after being without internet service.<br /><br />Just as with the first device I used it on, I find that K-9 has very little impact on the battery life of my Kindle Fire HD and works the same way. It's a simple yet powerful mail app that's pleasing to use and runs very quickly, unlike the stock email app. The 'quiet hours' setting for notification is also a very useful feature, as K-9 will usually still poll in the background when the device is asleep so you might get alerts at any hour.
B002M9WW30|5.0|If you are a Rocky Balboa fan, you can't miss this collection. Great image quality and great sound also. It comes with a BR Disc with trailers and other goodies too.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The book has you crying one second and laughing the next. It was awful and amazing. It was awfully amazing.
B003VS0CYC|4.0|So, i decided to buy this Trilogy. Is a very good product but it has some flaws:<br /><br />- ROBOCOP: The image quality is very dissapointing for a BluRay movie. I bought the Alien Anthology and the Rocky Collection with this and, for example, Alien (wich is an older movie than Robocop) has a much better image quality and crisp colors in comparison.<br /><br />- ROBOCOP 2: An improvement over the first movie. The sound quality is better also.<br /><br />- ROBOCOP 3: Ditto.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie is great for kids. The music is fun and the lesson is perfect. My 4 yo came home talking about how we need to take care of the earth!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have seen Season 1 and 2 and I am sure I will enjoy 3 just as much as we did the first the other seasons.
0345529057|5.0|Looked for this series a couple of different places, and I could not beat the deal I found here. Just what I was looking for.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I saw both versions of this film and igot to say this is the best one.its in black and white but the acting and the story is just as good forour times as it was back in1949  its about faith.beleiving in something,that things will get better how can i make it better,good will to your fellow man,joy at their happyness.it may sound corny to somebut if there were more of this there would be less of the violence we have had lately.this movie is a feel good movie no one gets killed but all get lifted up in spirit it also has a colerized version that comes with free of charge.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|Grand son loves it and also granddaughter fights for her turn.  She is 4 years old and can work the kindle fire HD better than her 7 year old brother.
B009O2XY12|3.0|It is ok good for awhile, easy enough for the grandkids. They liked it I think I would like it a little harder
B007THA4FI|4.0|Extremely well written.  Not much of a plot or story, but excellent character development and writing that compels the reader to continue and to look closely at human nature.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|This movie helped me grasp the concept of being truly alone, humans need human reactions to survive properly, anyways this is awesome movie!
0684824906|5.0|I love the book. It is wonderful in the way in which you become engaged in the situations and details of the characters.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Very fun game! Didn't know what to expect when I got it but it is very fun. Puzzles don't get boring and keep things interesting!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Our family loves this show. It has a feel-good story that's told with comedy and catchy songs.  It love that it entertains my husband and me along with our young kids all at the same time. My 3 year old  even quotes it now and was very excited to receive it for Christmas. Betty White's character is hilarious.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|do yourself a favor and just go to the facebook website.  the app fails to show a lot of content, makes accessing things difficult, and just doesn't work with a lot of normal facebook stuff.  i uninstalled it very quickly.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|The slots games lag so much that I stopped playing them. I have the same app for my iPhone and it works great.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Love this movie and rented it for the kids over the halloween season. Its nice that you get it for 2-3 days.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Awesome movie and cast... powerful on every level... recommended for everybody to watch, process, and learn about life in The South pre-civil rights and during... inspirational!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I'll keep this short and to the point. This book is a must-read if you apprecaite fantasy. From the pacing to the setting to the characters this book is one of the finest I've read in some time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Think about where u place your coin and u can rack up! Lots of fun to play. My 88yo mom loves it! Plus u don't. need Internet to play.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Read the book in 2 days! It's so addictive that putting it down isn't an option. It draws you in as if the story is real. Like you know the characters personally. Can't wait for the next book!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|So far it has been great! The weather here in Idaho is unpredictable in December and it is nice to have this on hand via my Kindle Fire so I know what storm systems are coming, etc....  Love the maps!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I can!!! This game was recommended by a friend of mine when I asked him if he knew of a good dungeon crawler. For a free app it's pretty impressive! Controls are tight, graphics and sound are decent and I'm having a good time playing this! Plays and controls great on my Kindle Fire, but Dead Space still holds the crown for best overall game on Kindle Fire!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I just received my Kindle Fire for Christmas and this was one of the first apps I put on it.  I like the layout of Facebook with this app versus the one I have on my cell phone.  It is clear, crisp and easy to understand.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Awesome movie, loved it. I feel like this is the best batman series ever. Christian bale is a great batman.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best book ever... I would recommended it to all my friends and I'm reading it again, and again. Can't wait till the movie comes out.
B000MV8XPG|5.0|My tall 3 year old loves this.  We play with this in sand, dirt, mud and snow.  It works great in all seasons and well worth the price.  When any lil guy comes over they want to play with his digger.
1451696205|4.0|I found this book to be a fast and easy read.  It's enjoyable, witty, and thought-provoking at times.  The little quips throughout the book are funny and quotable.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|as always, a fun read. The guy never fails to entertain as long as he sticks to crime and the law. The others  unfortunately lack the pace.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Awesome book to show young adults how their actions (or non-actions) make a grand ripple effect in the lives of others. Beautiful and quick read that's well worth it!
B0083P1QUM|2.0|very ho hum. The annoying Pete whatever his name is, unfortunately comes in to complicate the plot in a thoroughly unbelievable and maddening way. She should ditch him. He is a stupid character to drag along.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|It wasn't very interesting and they should really add more details because you couldn't even picture it in your head
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Alice Munro once again has written a wonderful collection of brilliant, thoughtful and deeply honest thought provoking stories, as always.
B006LSZECO|5.0|As an avid reader, I have never encountered a book quite like this one.  The character development and plot twists are phenomenal and unexpected. All I can stay is stick with it, just when you think you know what may come next, it will surprise you. It will also stick with you and you will find yourself thinking about it as you go through your normal routine well after you are done reading it.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I liked a lot . Maybe not on level of atonement, but totally entertaining thought provoking book. A good read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I found the app was easier to use on my Kindle than using the regular one on my lap top!  Love it!!!
B00APUQPX6|3.0|It was entertaining but that was all.  Not something I would watch again but it was fine to watch on a rainy day.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I love this movie - the music, the acting, the story are all wonderful!!  The movie was received in excellent condition and in good time.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|If you haven't seen Game of Thrones you are missing out! I read the books before I started the show and the show definitely does the books justice.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I found the markings on the tiles a bit too small it was hard to differentiate the symbols.  The layouts quite different than I am used to.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I laughed really hard throughout this movie.  It was clever and incredibly entertaining.  If it was on TV I'd switch to the channel.
B007V65R54|4.0|Once the concept of the &#34;signal&#34; obscured by the &#34;noise&#34; has been made, its application to many facets of our culture serve to pound the point home.  All of the examples are quite interesting and very well presented. Each leads you to new ways of seeing familiar topics.  But so many topics finally makes you unsure what the main theme of the book might be: politics, sports, finance, etc.  By equally presenting so many topics so thoroughly he creates a sort of noise of his own that covers his signal.  He is an interesting insightful writer with a somewhat overwritten book.
B009H442DG|4.0|Always liked John & Olivia. The CD has a nice flow to it. Really enjoy listening to it again and again!
B004PGO25O|5.0|Life changing! A book to be read and re-read UNtil it's committed to pure memory! So easy to apply in anyone's life- GUARANTEED!
B006OAB3ME|4.0|It's McCartney - he continues to make good music. I am patiently waiting for the next CD from Sir Paul!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|A not so serious and funny movie is good for the soul time to time. A good stoner movie :)
B00824VI3O|5.0|My son was required to have this book for a class he is taking in high school and it came just in time.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|After I started reading The Highlander I looked up the historical facts of the Valley of Mexico and found the dry paragraphs attempting to dissolve my eyeballs. I dropped that activity and picked up The Highlander again. It, of course, is a story and the characters are, well, characters, but you could believe they actually existed. It made me take a second look at the map of Mexico and the Valley of Mexico and imagining what it used to be like was a real treat.<br />A recommended read for those interested in historical fiction.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Am not familiar with Seth McFarlanes work but needed a comedy break after the shootings in CT. I rented the movie not really knowing what it was about and LOVED it! Very brilliant, naughty, sweet and funny!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I got this hoping it would be as addicting as my friends find the angry birds app on their smart phones.<br />I am not addicted, nor do I expect to become so.<br />I disliked not being able to see the entire game screen when aiming my sling shot. There  was no real challenge,. it was a hit or miss. not requiring a whole lot of skill.<br />I would rather play the christmas snow ball elf game on my computer than this. Glad it was free.<br />.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|A very great closing act for the Rocky series. Definetely better than Rocky V but still not as good the first 3.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had to give this 5 stars. I wanted to read the book before watching the movie and I just could not put it down. I'm thrilled to begin the next book!
B00005JM0B|4.0|Not nearly as good as Terminator 2 in terms of overall goodness. Yet is much more action packed than the first two installments and is a very good movie to watch when you're in the mood to see lots of crap blow up. Seeing Arnold and Loken square off is very entertaining to watch and when you watch the last fight between the two, you'll be left begging for more.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great game cool graphics easy to play bought for my son plays on his kindle hd would recommend to anyone
B005HSL626|5.0|I can't put this game down and when I do one of kids will steal the Kindle so they can play! Its easy enough for everyone to understand but still a challenge
B0002F6BRE|5.0|We really love this movie and it's now a must watch for our family every December. I know for us Will Ferrell is sometimes not really our style of funny but in Elf he's hilarious! And the story is so cute and different than any others that are the usual holiday favorites. If you've not seen it watch it and think about adding it to your holiday must watch list =)
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Wow, love this movie, also bought the Bourne Trilogy Blue-ray and love to watch all four, one after the other!  Bought for my 19 year old, but, enjoying myself too!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The transfers are crystal clear, the sound is fantastic, the supplemental material is spot on, with interviews and a new doc. Am extremely happy with this new set. But dammit, Steven, do some commentaries on your films.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I love Mark Wahlberg, love all his movies, and loved this one too!  I won't give away any punchlines, but, I want one of those teddy bears!  This was less expensive at Amazon, shipped fast and shipped free with my hugh order.  Thanks, Amazon
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|watch out...you will get lost in the adventure! time ticks by without you realizing how long you've been playing.<br /><br />great graphics, too
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Love this series, already saw all of these on cable, BUT, not in Blu-ray and loved to sit down and watch one after the other of all three.  Price was fantastic, shipped fast.  Thanks, Amazon
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is really a great game. It's fun and frustrating and challenging. The graphics are smooth and beautiful.<br />Glad I bought this.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It doesn't allow me to look at more than 15 status updates at one time. Even after I refresh the screen
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is fun for everyone to play from my 7 year old nephew to my 25 year old boyfriend . It  an easy but yet challenging game very addicting!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|A great story with nice effects and a true underdog tale. One of my favourite super hero movies that plays into and then plays off the whole WWII propaganda with a ton of action.
B0071MDA2U|5.0|great book i really enjoyed it. I also got the delerium stories and they are also great products ! !
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Thought this game was entertaining when played on my sons smart phone and have no regrets I downloaded it to my Kindle.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|If anyone likes romance mixed with a little of trouble, this book is for you! You will really enjoy it! The Third Wheel is about a boy whose name is Greg Heffley. His best friends name is Rowley, and when Greg asks Rowley to be his wingman for the Valentine Dance, Rowley actually got a girl whose name is Alyssa to go to the dance, Rowley ends up stealing his date and becomes his boyfriend. This book is kid friendly, and hilarious!
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Not as good as the book.  I expected a lot more from this movie, but I probably shouldn't have because the book itself wasn't all that great. I still find it a lot easier to stomach than Twilight, which is probably what everyone says...
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed this book better than 50 Shades.  Cannot wait to read number 2 and already preordered number 3!!!  The only complaint/issue I have is I can't \\"Lend\\" the book to a good friend!!
B0088WFZQG|4.0|I am going to be totally honest here when I say I only saw this movie because I half expected it to be like Discovery channel's Surviving the Cut, which I loved. This movie was not that, but it was still pretty cool. It featured real Navy SEALs  giving a commendable (pun intended) acting performance and had some really great action sequences. The story is your run-of-the-mill terrorist action plot, with America's elite tasked to take them down before they reach the homeland. It ends exactly how you think it will, but that's okay because it's still a really fun film.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|Interesting, kinda funny at times but not what I'd say a kid friendly flick. I gave it 3 stars cause I am a zombie fan and it did have a few saving graces, some solid advice. Braiiiinss!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I thought this was a well written book....held my interest to the shocking ending....loved it and would recommend it for book clubs.....could make for very interesting discussions
B005GSVFAK|5.0|Product is exactly as described.  Arrived very quickly in perfect condition.  We have watched the discs and the picture is very clear.  Would highly recommend.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I haven't read it yet because it won't let me read till I rate, butit really good I'm excited too read it
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I gave this book a solid 5 stars for many reasons, and I'll name a few...<br /><br />From the beginning, the reader is snagged by a mystical power urging you to keep reading. Each page possesses a nugget of magic. The story is wonderful and the characters easily lovable. Highly recommended for anyone looking to get lost in a book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think by far one of his best books.<br />How do you think he makes all his books, what are they based on.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is nice to know what the weather is like in the various areas in which family members are living
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|All that I can say is, this book is simply amazing. John green continues to amaze me with his words.
B002BWP49M|5.0|I have watched all the previous Twilight movies and Breaking Dawn part 1 is by far the best one! I am so excited for Breaking Dawn part 2 to come out on Blue Ray.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Haven't read the series in a long time so now I'm restarting it. Overall the Bad Beginning is a fantastic novel for all ages.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i am new to the kindle fire but i am enjoying this game, beats the way i grew up playing solitaire
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love how many games there is, the fun and thinking capacity of each game, and the point saving you got to do to get more games. The wonder encouragement I get to keep getting is just so exhilarating to me and push me to the point of pure excitement. I think you will love these games and fun they got!!!!!!
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I found this book helpful and guiding. I actually learned more than I expected to. I was also expecting to learn a little more than what is in it though.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love it most of the time oh and it should have mods like to many items or the butter mod
B000005KQT|5.0|This CD has some of Little Walter's best songs.  If you're a fan, I'm sure you'll like it.  I did.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I don't quite know how he does it, but I always have the same feeling when I read one of Albom's books - like it's taking place in a soft-focus, dream-like state.<br /><br />Albom tells stories using people and situations we all know. They move at a pace that allows the reader to not only understand and enjoy the story but also to process its meaning. Aren't the best stories ones that inspire reflection and a personal, emotional inventory?<br /><br />The Time Keeper continues that style and addresses man's obsession with time and our many perspectives on it - all, of course, depending on our circumstances.<br /><br />Read, enjoy, reflect, then apply.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|McEwan is back on form after a less than stellar &#34;Solar.&#34; &#34;Sweet Tooth&#34; has a compelling story and is very well written with a nice twist at the end. The setting is the 1960's, which McEwan gets just right. This is a page-turner of a book and one that I would recommend.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|Very easy to get sucked in and play for over an hour but there are some glitches. Mainly directly related to the gameloft account I've been unable to visit random friends. Also sometimes difficult to click on actual monster or object. Other then that very fun game.
1608871045|5.0|Fast service and this book is beyond amazing.  Cannot believe all the cool things in it and the quality was off the charts.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a must have application.<br /><br />I thought the game was stupid at first, but after playing it for a few !HOURS! I realized its flipping amazing.
B001O2QW9G|5.0|This turtle is so lifelike! There are a few &#34;Call of the Wildman - Turtleman&#34; fans in the house, and this turtle is now a &#34;Giant Snapping Turtle!&#34;
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I actually have the paperback of this book; however, it has been read so many times that it is falling apart, so I purchased it for my Kindle.  I love the series up until about the 5th book; after that, it's hard to read as the author puts his characters through so much hell.  I stuck with it to the end and reread the series about every other year.  I would recommend it to other fantasy readers.
B004G606K8|5.0|Has always been one of my favorites, a classic for anyone who is a lover of fantasy. You will come to know, love and hate the characters, and you will feel like you took every step of the adventure with them
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a great match 3 game, challenging and fun. I highly recommend it for match 3 enthusiasts. Great graphics and play.
B00A5052YE|5.0|Bought for my daughter and she loves it! Glad it was avalible for her when she requested it. Will buy for myself.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|It's a typical Blu-ray movie as far as picture and sound quality. It includes a second disc that has a ton of extras on it. I don't want this to be a movie review but I'm really into acapella so I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|I didn't expect it to be as good as it was and it kept my attention.  I would recommend it to everyone!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I beat it on my first try and I love this app because its the best slenderman game out there Compared to the others.  I was scared because I would keep rotating my screen because he was always there
B009UX2YAC|5.0|5 Year old grandson loves it!  Endless hours of fun playing  Keeps grandson busy! Brought it for  Xmas present! I played the game  I liked it also
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Arrived quickly, good quality.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Didn't think a book about killing would be that interesting but it kept my attention the entire time didn't stop reading until the very last word
B005XLN97M|5.0|I bought this Barbie Beach House for my  8 year old niece and she loved it! Just what she was looking for.  The price was great too!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This one of the best movies of the year.  Great story, great acting, just wonderful!!  I purchased it after seeing on the Kendle.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Hated it!!  Way too much profanity our of a teddy bear turned live teddy bear.  Story line was really lame as well.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|This movie is an absolute classic.<br />It is a must-have for any movie collection.<br /><br />I am telling you buy this movie!!!
B007N31ZLA|4.0|This is a great film, great acting, great script, and great photography. I watch this film at least once a year.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|i love this series. it doesnt have the best writing at times and can be repetitive but i still love it none the less. i really wish shed do another w=one from mr grey pov like she started at the end though
B007IXWKUK|5.0|i love this series. it doesnt have the best writing at times and can be repetitive but i still love it none the less
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. It really makes you realize how much you should appreciate life and to never stop fighting.
B008XBASVY|5.0|Chris Colfer never ceases to amaze me... be it on Glee or in novel, his work is always incredibly impressive. Great job.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my kids as they love Toy Story.  It arrived in perfect condition!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book actually reads like a soap opera.  You know what is going to happen from almost the very beginning.  However, there is one point in the book, about 3/4 through, where the excitement builds up and you can't put the book down.  Aside from those few chapters, it was quite ordinary.  Will admit it was an easy read.  Never once had to look up a word.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I don't even know why there were so many A words. Seriously I will not read a book about the letter A.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game, it makes you think as you get to the higher levels in the game.
B001O2QW9G|5.0|My grand-niece never tires of playing with her Schleich animals.  They are beautifully made, completely life-like and virtually indestructable.  And so many different varieties!
B005H29GSI|5.0|This was a game my grandson had on his Christmas list, and he was very happy to receive it for Christmas.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Once I start playing I can't seem to stop! So frustrating, fun and addicting all at the same time! GREAT!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Starts slow....once it picks up u can't put it down. A bit predictable but most Nicolas Sparks books are. Either way I enjoyed it.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|So many things are wrong with this movie, for one I waited for release onto on-demand and thank goodness for that.
B0097S0TM0|4.0|She's very talented and the album has a nice mix of styles. There are a few songs that I think will be reserved for working out, but overall, I'm a fan!
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|To play: you select a song then a difficulty setting (which determines how many keys you'll hit simultaneously) and then press play. Your keys drop from the top of the screen and you hit the corresponding key as they fall into the play zone. You won't hit all the keys on most difficulties, but the song will play. It's a very similar game mechanic to Rock Band or Guitar Hero except you touch the screen instead of an instrament. Since you just move your fingers around I found it less fun than other similar games with controllers. It is well made, sounds good, and feels rewarding to hit the notes correctly, but it just isn't that much fun.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I've been using this for about a year now and I can safely say that it is the best app for Android. I love that I can set the length of snooze, the way to wake up (math problems) and the ring gradually getting louder, but starting very softly.<br /><br />The only thing I wish I had was the default ring from my Samsung Galaxy Tab (which I sold). Since you are stuck with the ringers you have on your device some devices are better than others. So save your ring if you find one you love and install it on other devices.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Rented this movie on Amazon through our Roku. Quality was great but 5 bucks was a lot for a rental.<br />The movie was somewhat of a continuation of the Bourne Ultimatum but not really. It just seemed like they were trying to finalize the Jason Bourne story but then get the audience to like the &#34;new guy.&#34; And the &#34;new guy&#34; being an upgrade of Jason Bourne. It's a good entertaining rental; wouldn't purchase the movie for myself or friends.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I am reviewing this as a 40 year old adult, father and musician so keep that in mind. I have been listening to her music since her first album started being heard on the radio in 2006. I really liked the maturity in song writing and her choice to not follow the wrong path that 90% of other teen pop stars and musicians seem to have and are taking. She has managed to avoid scandals and is really a music star I am comfortable with my daughter following. But then her next couple of albums athough having some good songs on them seemed to me to show some confusion as to what kind of music she really wanted to be, i.e country of pop. Then, in about 2010, my 9 year old daughter, who is also somewhat of a musician having played piano for about 4 years now and also taking voice lessons, discovered her and really liked so we ended up buying all her albums and listening and singing along to them in the car. Still I didn't care for Fearless and Speak Now as much as the self titled Taylor Swift album. They just seemed to be stuck somewhere between genres and never grew on me. We'll, my daughter and I had since moved on to other listening preferences as of late until we heard a track from her new album \\"Red\\". I think it was either \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\" or \\"We're Never Getting Back Together\\" to which my daughter loved and it kind of raised an eyebrow on me, but still hadn't taken the time to listen to the whole thing until my nephew, who is also a young, very talented, aspiring musician,  texted me a few days ago and told me it was on Amazon for $2 and that he had gotten it and it was really good. Well, being one to never let a good deal pass me by I swiftly sat down at computer and listened to all tracks online and promptly purchased it. Ok, now for the review. I am not exaggerating when I say I have had it on repeat on my iPhone since then listening to it everywhere I go and have even learned a couple songs on my acoustic guitar. She has really emerged with definite resolution as a modern pop country music star along the same lines and talent level as Lady Antebellum. She is to be taken serious at this point as a force to be reckoned with genious and talent wise. Her music has matured past teen infatuation and first love breakup type heartbreaks to facing and tackling adult type issues that teens don't have a clue about. Yet, her playfulness and funny side shines through too. There is very mature content in some songs and others that make you want to dance and laugh and others that have such catchy hooks that I can't help but grab my guitar and work through the chord progressions. I have been around and listened to a lot of music in my 40 years from classic rock to heavy metal to country and pop and I like music in all genres and this album has found it's way into my regular playlist (which right now is mostly singer/songwriter/pop music like John Mayer. Jason Mraz, Colbie Callait, Maroon 5, and Lady Antebellum). I realize she is going to get a lot of grief for her departure from country music but for those country fans she loses she will undoubtedly gain a sizeable portion from the pop music crowds. And for us guitar players her music is not so complicated that an intermediate player can't figure it out, like Mayer's early acoustic pieces. I highly recommend this album it is a full rich, deep album that will have you singing and dancing along to one song and then rip your heart out the next one with lyrical content that usually comes from years of experience and her chord progressions and phrasing is both catchy and logical. Buy it and enjoy it; it's really good, in my opinion.n as a modern pop country music star along the same lines and talent level as Lady Antebellum.

B00AHSINKO|3.0|Meryl Streep is brilliant as always. I didn't care for the script very much. Much more serious than the previews led me to believe
B0091TGWYE|4.0|It's nice , useful , and good looking  but the way of use not comfortable and hard to use !!
B004H1V5RU|2.0|I bought this for my grandson it was really hard for him and even for myself he quit playing after a half hour.
1423113462|5.0|My son cannot put Rick riordian down.  After reading lost hero, he said this was even better than the series before.  He read it in about one week.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This was a movie suitable for all audiences, reasonably priced and well worth the value.  These made great Christmas gifts!
B009FB3WQ4|5.0|If you're a Streisand fan, you will love everything about it!  Definitely worth the purchase.  Also a surprise in it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Everything works as described. Cursor movement can be a little clumsy but it works. I would definitely recommend it for anyone.  It is extremely easy to set up.<br /><br />After 6 months of using these rotors, I am completely satisfied.  I had nothing but problems with my 2 previous brands.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a must have.  There is nothing I dislike about this CD. I've been listening to cuts of this for a long time on the radio and finally got it for Christmas.
B008K3HRF0|4.0|The streaming timing and quality were terrific.  Will definitely rent more movies from Amazon in future.  Very easy to do and watch
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like puzzles but never have the time to do them because I'm always on the run. Now I can take the puzzles with me.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I have been an avid fantasy reader for about 10 years first starting with The Wheel of Time. Naturally I found Sanderson and have read all of his full length novels. This is the first of his novellas I have read and I was not disappointed. He creates a great and innovative magic system as well as engaging characters in a very short time. Well worth a read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Okay so I downloaded it for my 12 year old, but really I wanted to play it. I love this game. Small victories for this &#34;old school&#34; game player. I grew up with Atari and Super Mario....the original. This game is great!
B0086700CM|5.0|My son wanted this game and loves it! He handed it to me and besides getting a little dizzy from getting caught up in the motion, it is so much fun! By the way...trees hurt.....you will learn that in the game!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love the game, it makes me laugh out loud.  The graphics are cute and the sounds crack me up.  I can totally understand why it is called Angry Birds but it is entertaining!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Kindle was Christmas gift so a bit slow to start playing the game but once started game was easy to use and play.

B000025Y9I|5.0|How can anyone not like Chris Rea? He delivers, plain and simple. Rea is an extremely talented artist, versatile and engaging. From Blues to Rock, to Easy Listening. His band is a dream team of well known and respected artists. Given the time of this recording and it's accompanying engineering, it was done very well overall. The visual is clear and the sound is great. No complaints. I suppose the perfectionist may hunt for slights with this product but I'm not the harsh type. I'm more reasonable.  Like Rea, I don't fuss about things. I try to enjoy what's placed before me. And I did, immensely. The packaging left me concerned when it arrived, though it survived travel well. No damage. I underestimated this aspect of purchase, so I own any concerns in this regard. It has been one hell of an experience..in a good way. So good, that friends who enjoyed this with me, now want their own to add in their collection. We're all different when it comes to music tastes and how music is engineered and packaged. Again, no complaints here. Go for it and sit back. As a guitarist myself, I basked in Rea's slide work and Blues tones. each song is offered as the first. With heart and soul. No slacking with Chris Rea. Loved every minute of it. Listen to the guy who never sold out to the pressures of marketing agencies and recording companies. An artist of integrity and guts. I'm too big a fan of Rea and his band to find flaws. Here, there are not any to find. A wise buy for sure. Critics can try to \\"choke the smile on every face,\\" but not mine. Love you Chris Rea. You are the man.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Not a true app ... uses the browser.  Slow, sharing is difficult.  Turn this into a true app and then all would be well.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I thought the game was well done. The puzzles were not too simple and I liked the way they did the hints option if you needed it. I hope there will be another one soon!
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Love this movie, my kids love it as much as I did when I was younger! Might be a little frightening for really little ones, but mine don't get scared watching it.
145210655X|5.0|This book was selected as a Christmas gift for a relative who is a Star Trek fan and she absolutely loved it.  Even noted on her facebook posting (with a picture of the front cover) how awesome I was for giving it to her.  Great for any Star Trek fan for sure!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|They are 11 and 8 years old and will watch it over and over.  They really enjoy the movie and it has funny lines for adults too.
B004NEY9EW|4.0|We watched Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace back to back not knowing that they were basically two parts to a story. They were action packed from start to finish. Daniel Craig is my new favorite 007.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies of all times. This is the second time purchasing it since it was left at a friend's house and we needed another copy.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I watch hours of the series at a time. The telling of history in this manor is just what I like, fairly accurate and very entertaining. The wardrobes are stunning.
B000YHG72E|5.0|My wife loves this move.  Now she can love it in Bluray.  Movie came when it was promised. I'm very happy.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I don't like the explicit lyrics in the album - other than that, he's got talent and I enjoy the CD.  It's just that when you have kids, you can't listen to this with them around - Hey Bruno, you've got some older fans too (49) so ix nay on the explicit language, and keep producing good music!
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|Great story! I respect him more than ever! Very inspirational and entertaining book that will leave you wanting more and more.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Really liked this book. Gives you a good feel of the life and mood of Europe leading up to WWI.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|It's been fun to watch a couple of shows a day.  It keeps you coming back for more. Will finish it pretty quicky.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun tile / adventure game. My daughter loves to help me match and unlockthe items needed to complete the mission.
B006LSZECO|2.0|We read Gone Girl for our book club.  Most of the books we choose are well written and encourage a lively discussion of the plot, the characters, ideas  that come up, and the writing itself.  While we may not agree, we often leave our meetings with new insights and a better understanding of the topics presented.  This time we all were in agreement...we felt cheated.  While the story starts off well, the author takes the reader on a trip with no apparent purpose other than to play with your thinking, and the ending was a total disappointment. Reading this book was a waste of time.
B00A77II0U|5.0|it was well draw great scenes good art work<br />pretty good game and great story<br />wish it was longer tho
B006M4F67A|5.0|247 Mahjong is the best game i have played all the different puzzle shapes to keep me entertained.  I like challenging. My mind and keeping it alert thank you
B004Q0R7FG|5.0|These trains were great, bought them for a 4 year old for Christmas and he loved them. Played with them as soon as he opened package.They connect together so well with the magnetic piece that he had 4 of them together chugging along ( on carpet)
B004HHKFIY|5.0|I bought these for a 4 year old for Christmas. He loved them. They worked really well on carpet being connected together by the magnet.  I was suprised at how well they stayed connected. He had 4 together at one time.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I wish all of the music was included on this CD! Otherwise, the music is really beautiful and I've enjoyed listening to it on repeat. I love all of the voices, including Russell Crowe's. At first I was skeptical of him because of the short clips I watched prior to seeing the film, but his voice grew on me and I feel that after watching the movie he sang pretty good in a lot of other scenes.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway's version of 'I Dreamed a Dream' is the best I've ever heard. Before, it was a pretty song but rather bland. I never truly listened to the words until Anne came along. Her voice is raw, fragile, and full of despair. Pure emotion radiates from every word she sings.<br /><br />Since this version of Les Miserables was going for a raw, realistic approach with singing live on camera, I would advise seeing the movie first before judging the quality of the soundtrack.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I just got back from seeing this with my mom. I've literally waited a year for this movie to come out. Don't listen to any bad reviews you may hear because this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />I don't want to spend too much time rehashing the plot, but I will say that its a meaningful story of love, sacrifice, redemption, hope, suffering, fighting and dying for what you believe, and having faith in god and the innermost goodness of the human soul. There were many times throughout the movie I cried or teared up. There was only one part I had a hard time watching and it had to do with the harming of a child. Otherwise, the violence and sex was minimal. Also something not everyone will enjoy is the recurring theme of religioun and a person's relationship with god. As other reviewers have said, this is an unashamedly Christian movie. It was something I enjoyed, but may not be up someone elsex 's alley.<br /><br />I thought everyone was very well casted, especially Hugh jackman and Anne Hathaway. They put their heart, soul, and body into this film. The cinematography was wonderful and so was the music. Don't go to this movie expecting it to sound like the Broadway or west end productions. This is completely different from how other musicals have been one and its best to appreciate the hard work the cast and crew broughtntonthe table in this highly successful musical adaptation.<br /><br />The difference between this musical and others is that its purpose is to bring a world of meaning to the viewer. I'm sure that many can relate to the characters, whether its Fantine' a single mother who tries desperately to protect her daughter. Or maybe Eponine whose love for Marius is in vain. Not everyone will like this movie and there are plenty of those who will find something to complain about. If you decide to try it out, go into it with an open mind.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book!!!!!! All of the detail and confusion over what was going on, it was crazy!!!!!!<br />Can't wait to read the next book!!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|It was entertaining and well acted. Thats all I ask of a movie, however now days there are fewer and fewer.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Well written, typical Grisham legal/ criminal story with many twists and turns. My only question - for a guy as smart as our hero, how did he get into jail in the first place? And the access the other players had to him seemed a little far fetched - but without it, there wouldn't be much of a story. Overall, well done and very entertaining, although not \\"memorable\\".
B004SIP9U6|5.0|Outstanding, exceptional, tempting, sneaky, profound, romantic, macho, funny...a must see! It is flawless. Deserving of every Oscar and including the convenant Best Picture!
B0012DP8A6|4.0|Didn't think they could update and yet improve the remake but I was wrong. The music arrangement was exceptional and cast selection keen.  Not all have chart making vocals but you  forget about it my the first chorus.  LOVE THE PLANT!  If you think &#34;Four Tops&#34; when you hear it then --- you're a plant lover.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Came in new shape, wonderful movie for the kids! I couldn't find a better price any where else I looked.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|There is a reason &#34;google&#34; became the verb for &#34;search it on the internet&#34;.  The first thing I did was get the google search app.  Its free and it is still the best search engine ever designed.
0547884591|5.0|People of Amazon, it would seem that Anthony Bourdain (cool chef you would want to have an espresso with at a cafe in Amsterdam) and Mr. Wizard (wizards are also cool) co-authored this book. Instead, what we have here is one ADHD-like dude, a curious researcher, his mind flooded with questions and hungry for answers, Tim Ferriss.<br /><br />This book makes learning interesting. It's even more fun to learn something you didn't expect to learn when you bought it. So don't be upset when you learn something other than how to prepare food, consider this a bonus, this is no reason to pout.<br /><br />This is not your grandma's cookbook, which has been done and redone, listing ingredients and recipes...yawn... and assumes you know how to use a knife. Four Hour Chef is about food, perfecting some skills, gutting a deer, how to never lose your luggage and learn new things in the least amount of time!<br /><br />I concur on his findings in regards to the Aero Press, this is the best coffee maker I have ever owned. Also, the need for a starter's pistol... I always wanted one, I would look at them and think, I need one of those... but couldn't justify why, until now.<br /><br />Thanks for keeping it abstract, informative and entertaining!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Chock full of great quotes and funny moments. I couldn't put this book down!<br /><br />\\"We accept the love we think we deserve.\\"

B00632HWOG|1.0|I like the original yahoo mail much better, please let me go back. I do NOT like.  I DO NOT LIKE.
0525952616|4.0|I got this as a gift for my fiance, he loves Danuel Suarez's other books (Daemon and Freedom-which I read and found pretty interesting A TON of &#34;computer&#34; talk though so I got lost easy). Not sure what this one is about, but I figure since he likes his others he'll like this. We haven't read it yet so I can't tell you if it's anything like the others-which is why I only gave it 4 stars.
B007KAJG3K|4.0|I bought this movie as a gift to my step dad. I personally love the movie. I couldn't give it 5 stars because I have no idea if the movie itself was scratched or anything, but I definitely would recommend buying it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Just like playing it on my computer except now I can play it anywhere in my house. It took me only a short time to get the number of suits and sounds added.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Great book for anyone seeking something but doesn't know what.  It is an easy read. Much easier than the power of now but also recommended.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful story of love, lies, and loss, and how they all intertwine. I couldn't put it down until I was finished.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me hooked from the moment I read the description. It made me laugh,cry and smile throughout the book. I couldn't be happier that I got the chance to read this novel.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I really like the diary of a wimpy kid series and I can't wait to read the next one. I would recommend reading the books.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Its was good a great addition was the audio feature.it was definatly long enough.I skipped through most of it but it was great
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series gets better & better!  I couldn't put this book down.  I can't wait to find out what's next for Eva& Gideon.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Not sure why this game is so popular. Tried it, didn't like it. Prefer words games to this silly game
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This plot was completely changed from the original, leaving Mars out and putting the planet into a polluted state.  Not quite sure why that was done.  The plot was also as predictable as possible, all characters were cardboard cutout caricatures and there was no one you could really cheer.  A lot of money wasted on a silly story - no wonder it left the theater so fast.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I love this game because it's very fast to play and doesn't take up alot of my time.  It's always good to play against family, friends or strangers.
0446554995|5.0|This is a continuation of the previous two books and a must read. You'll finally find out what happens to Helen!<br /><br />Good book, Pendergest gets his butt kicked on a couple of occasions, which is a refreshing thing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice diversion. Easy to use. It's like having a friend in your phone, ready when you are. Glad it is now available for Android.
B003ZVJFFM|3.0|Their interpretation is kinda strange to us.  The Ghost of Christmas past looks weird.  Overall Jim Carrey does a good job.
1449415881|5.0|I buy one of these every year for the office.  They really brighten my day first thing every morning when I pull off the new page.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I guess I fathom myself a writer -- it's something that makes my own personal world go round. In all honesty, too many people consider themselves writers, thinking they are spectacular or new. Again, in reality they are not. They are fantastically unspectacular and heinously unoriginal. So when a book comes along that defies these things, it leaves an impression. You do not merely read, but feel the characters, growing beside them and living their lives. And when it ends a small part inside you ends with it. Yet y o u are better off for it. This book is one of those novels. It is flawless.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book....can't wait to see the movie when it FINALLY comes out in my area.  Quick and easy read...very different than some of the trailers I have seen.  Definitely recommend...
B005GRTNXC|5.0|Another amazing album.  Her voice gets better and better with every album.  Every song is filled with emotion. it was well worth the price!
B000VI70WM|1.0|Love this band from Planet Earth on.  A couple of iffy albums before the reunion but this one is definitely the low point - it is really bad - not good - lacking - the masters should be burned - and the release should be disavowed by the band.  Falling Down is the only song I can listen to.  Let me say that I hate this type of over produced music that the radio has been spewing out the last 5+ years.  Music that sounds like it came straight off a computer.  No humans required.  If you are into it hell you might like it.  I guess by this point the band had lost their way musically and had also lost their commercial appeal so they figured why not give it a go?  This is one of favorite new wave bands and like another reviewer said it was simply a failed experiment quickly righted with the reunion releases.  Thank God!
B00991TCOG|5.0|Awesome music! I love Lindsey Stirling! I'm very happy with this purchase ...I'll be waiting for more of these :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|After hearing so much about Angry Birds, I had to check it out. This is a great free app for someone to see what the fuss was all about. Thank goodness my son-in-law explained how to tap on screen to get extra stuff from some of the birds. I've been playing on our new Kindle Fire. My 3 year old grandson has fun with it too. I've been enjoying the challenge of how to destroy the structures and the pigs. A little luck helps too.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great tiles, challenging, with fun backgrounds.  I have played many games like this and its great to play this on my kindle!
1619695006|1.0|I gave this as a Christmas gift and am distressed to learn that it has<br />so much profane language in it.  Anyone purchasing it needs to be aware<br />that within the first couple chapters, the author repeatedly uses the \\"f\\" word,<br />as well as other profanities.  I am very disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This came in just in time, I loved the series and my friend loved her present. Buy it if you love the series. :)
B007TXN4TK|4.0|This game is good. It does give you the opportunity to learn the song at your pace. We like it.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|I really had high expectations for this movie...it sounded like a great idea and had some big names involved. Unfortunately it moves very slowly and is not nearly as funny as the previews lead you to believe. Sure it has some great, albeit brief, moments, but this is not going down in the archives as a classic. I'm glad I rented this one and did not buy it.
B00A1AD6ZU|5.0|A great storyline in Rollins' Sigma Force series....you won't be able to put the book down.  For us James Rollins fans, he does not disappoint.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  The continuation of the families & characters makes it fascinating. I also enjoy the history of World War Two.  would recommend it to anyone who likes to read historical novels.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My 13-year-old daughter LOVES Taylor Swift, so half of the CD slots in my car are dedicated to her music. Thank goodness I like her music too, because any time my daughter is in the car, she chooses to listen to Taylor Swift tunes. For Christmas, I bought my daughter RED, and already we're loving it. I wasn't sure I would appreciate it as much as her previous CDs, since I really like her song-writing and I'd heard she didn't write as many of these songs as she usually does. But Taylor has a gift for music, so I shouldn't have worried. We love this one, too.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game was for my daughter she is addicted to this game the whole family plays it everyone wants to beat the high score
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|For once, I actually chose the winner on American Idol - that never happens! I do love PP's sound, so I had to get his CD as soon as possible. It's _fantastic_. He really got to express his style on this CD, in all his syncopated, guitar-pluckin', lyrical glory.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Very fun game to play with the whole family love it reminds me of the old days when it was on sega
B005LAII12|5.0|I've realized that there's two kinds of a sense of humor: those that have one and those that don't. It's amazing to me how many people have negatively rated this movie. It's HILARIOUS! When my son got this for Christmas I thought omg here we go another dumb comedy featuring Mark W and a freakin teddy bear, has he gone THIS FAR??? The storyline seemed very strange to me. But almost right out of the gate the movie was funny, we were all dying laughing, busting our guts laughing at certain scenes. It's different from the other \\"dumb\\" comedies that seemed to signify 2011 and 2012. For a movie that seemed to target the male audience it actually has content that even women can relate to and enjoy. Everyone I've asked if they've seen it has and have said such positive things about it. Will purchase this as soon and add to to my movie roster night!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very cool and entertaining. The whole family plays this game. Now I know why it's so popular, you got to add this to your collection.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Grease is a culture classic that people of all ages can enjoy.  It reveals standards that are no longer appropriate-but should be- in current society.  The music is good and there is no foul language or sex or nudity.  Who could ask for anything more!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel app keeps me updated, informed, and notified.  I love it and I check it all the time on my laptop, tablet, phone, or desktop!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Best movie of the year. Period. Love it. Do yourself a sci fi favor and get this movie. You won't be disappointed.
B0047SF41G|3.0|Intereseting new ideas and backdrop with this new episode in the series. It is not really a reboot or sequel so much as an exploration of a new story, even though it does have roots referrenced back to the original movie. The cast is capable but not matched up to their roles well and the director does not use them wisely. He is the reall problem, in that he does not have a clear vision of what this movie should be and the direction it should go in. It is slow in the wrong places and too skimpy in others where it needs more depth. Overall this is not as good as the first movie. As a home rental it was okay and had its moments. But at the theater, it was a disappointment. This new trip to the hunting grounds of this sci-fy series was under developed and left a watered down taste in your mouth. I was always looking back to the origin thinking this was better, that was more fun, etc. when I should have been caught up in this new movie's flow and excitement.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Just as good or maybe better than the original. Great action. Great cast<br />Overall good movie.<br />Go for number 3

B007OY64C8|5.0|It's TOMBSTONE!<br />If you haven't seen this yet. Start watching it, and quit reading this review.<br />If you have seen it. You know.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Good show. Great theme. I really liked the story line. Abe gave them heck.<br />Who knows he might have been there
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Not much to review, other than it converts MagSafe to MagSafe 2... and does so successfully. The improvement I would make to this, would be to include someway to attach it to the cord. At home, my wife's MacBook and my MacBook Pro share a charger, so we have to take the converter on-and-off occasionally. It'd be nice to be able to leave it attached to the cord when it wasn't being used.
B00A0A59IS|5.0|This is the best album ever! I listen to it everyday and it never gets old. If you love one direction you should definitely get this album
0762434279|5.0|Always wanted to read this book. I had a really long flight from the U.S. to Asia, and I did not have  much space for entertainment. This was a great read, packed with knowledge, and  a space saver!
B005NS5CX4|5.0|I was very late picking up Lady A's last album,[[ASIN:B005IF5H2S Own The Night [+Digital Booklet]]], but enjoyed hearing the singles on the radio. When picking up their Christmas album, [[ASIN:B0097RFAJI On This Winter's Night]], I decided to get Own the Night finally. OTN is another album of great listening hours. Agreeing with another reviewer, this release is longer on ballads, but the vocals are so brilliant and complementary that you just can't help liking every track. Hours later I'm still listening and enjoying. You just can't help being awed by these songwriters/vocalists - the harmonies are sublime and the lyrics heart-rending. So glad Lady A came along!
1401233791|4.0|i gave this book as a gift so i don't know how it is story wise but the person was excited to get it. it came pretty quickly which was nice
B007FH9GA6|5.0|I enjoyed the American Version so much more than the original, although neither version was exactly true to the book. However, you get so much more of the photography of the surrounding area which you miss the first time through.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|todo esta perfecto, el envio super rapido, no me puedo quejar de nada muchas gracias, j a s d f
B00A77II0U|5.0|I love this game I actually bought it for my computer when it first came out n when I seen it available on here I was like oh I gta buy it....
