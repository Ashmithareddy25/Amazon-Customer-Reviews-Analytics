B0007TKNII|5.0|I am in love with this movie! I was so relieved when I put the DVD in and it worked! I have never ordered a movie from amazon before so I was relieved! Plus a little Gerard Butler never hurt anybody!!!
B00CLZ4B4I|1.0|I thought because I really like all the actors involved in this film that it must have some redeeming parts even though there were many bad reviews.  I don't know what movie the good reviewers were watching, but I find it hard to believe it was the same one.  The writing...horrible....acting.....horrible....costumes???...I don't know what they were thinking.  So boring in the midst of so much \\"excitement\\".  I wish I would have only rented it, not bought it.  If you're laying around in the heat and humidity and don't want to move or have any of your own body parts touch and the only other movie choices are Homeward Bound or Veggie Tales...watch this one.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The acting was amazing. You never saw actors, only saw the character. It was a delight to see the humanity have a great president.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|LOVE IT this game is AWESOME I like how it doesn't need Internet connection I would recommend this game to kids

B007FLHW3K|5.0|The only problem with the monkey lights is the price. BUT !<br />1] You get what you pay for.<br />2] Designed and made in the USA<br />3] If they keep you out of the hospital ONE time they have more than paid for themselves.<br />So get one, but bet you end up buying more. Best thing was when I got a pair for my wife, so I can now watch em too. We are a multi monkey family.<br />A possible problem is riding at night you will attract so much attention that anyone riding with you without Monkeys may disappear. Also be extremely careful if you ever again have to ride a no monkey light bike at night because you get used to knowing you are seen. It's hard to go back to ninja riding in the dark.<br />The ME M210 installs easily with 5 zip ties [ Metal zip ties are included for theft deterrence, but I don't intend to leave my bike in harms way so I go with the nylon.]<br />The battery pod on the wheel hub will power 2 Monkey lights. I guess that means half the battery life but they still seem to keep blinging a long time.<br />The batteries on the hub keeps most of the weight non rotational and makes changing the batteries easy. Seems like every 2 months with nightly use ? They go red when the power is low but your still pretty visible, just not quite as beautiful.<br />SO I recommend Monkey Electric most heartily. Children will jump for joy, women will dance and sing, Men will do something manly, drunks will scream random stuff and stoners will say WOW MAN when you pass by. You WILL be noticed.<br /><br />O and customer service is the best too. I had a dead Monkey and they shipped me a replacement RIGHT out.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This is a great movie for children and adults. Include some important lessons on what we pursue in what is most meaningful.
B00821OX98|4.0|Watched seaons one and two over the course of a couple of weeks. After season one, I was hooked. Entertaining and suspenseful, kept me coming back for more.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|First off, this author claims he is a historian, but he is not. He has to his credit several \\"religious degrees\\", but none in history. So I guess he figures \\"close enough\\", huh? But if he is willing to go for \\"close enough\\" on this vitally important fact, and state it outright as fact in front of millions of viewers, knowing it is not true ..... Does that give the reader any faith in any other claims made by him? What else is \\"close enough\\"?  When it comes to truth, close enough is not enough.<br /><br />On to the book. Reza Aslan is either purposely mis-stating the facts of the New Testament (nice way of saying he is knowingly lying), or he is so woefully lacking in Biblical understanding that I wonder what exactly these \\"religious studies\\" were that he took. For goodness sake, any reader can pick up any old Bible and read the New Testament, read the gospels, and compare side by side what the Bible says versus what Aslan says. Aslan misquotes, twists, and conveniently leaves out whole portions of scripture to make it seem like his theories are correct. All anyone needs to do is open a Bible to see it. He picks and chooses verses, patching them together, leaving out verses in between, altering the clear meaning, and then hopes and prays that either no one will fact check him on any of it, or that we will all be so enamored by his many degrees (including his much ballyhooed, yet mythical, history degree)<br />, that we will beleive anything he says. He is wrong. His readers aren't stupid. We aren't swayed by his real or imagined credentials, and we will fact check.<br /><br />This book is FUNDAMENTALLY AN ATTACK ON JESUS CHRIST, designed to DISCREDIT CHRIST AS BEING THE ONLY SON OF GOD AND REDEEMER OF MANKIND. It is an attack on the person of Christ, on who Christ claimed to be, on all fulfilled prophecy of Him, and on the very basic, core beliefs of CHRISTIANITY ITSELF.<br /><br />Have we become so politically correct that we will not call out this attack, or so jaded that we cannot see it? This book is nothing but a thinly veiled attack on Christianity hiding behind the skirt of \\"intellectualism\\". We are told to forget the fact that the author is a muslim, or that we are somehow wrong if we are not blind to it, yet the author can attack Christianity with impunity and it is a-okay. It seems every religion and regious adherent is protected except the Christian. Every god or spiritual leaning is given respect except for Christ. In the eyes of the world, it is Jesus Christ alone who is allowed to be attacked and drug though the mud and lied about, His followers ridiculed, His Holy Book twisted and contorted, and it's all \\"intellectualized\\". Why is that??? Maybe because JESUS CHRIST IS A THREAT because HE ALONE is the way, the truth and the life, AND NO ONE COMES TO HE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH HIM. If the world can discredit Jesus, and keep the people in the dark, then no one will believe and so be saved.<br /><br />Here is what the Bible actually says about Jesus of Nazareth ..... He is the ONLY WAY to the Father and THERE IS NO OTHER. This is who JESUS CHRIST SAYS HE IS. This is what He says about Himself.- that HE IS THE ONLY SON OF GOD AND ONLY REDEEMER OF THE WHOLE WORLD. Should we believe Jesus or Reza Aslan? I'm going with Jesus.

B008602KQI|3.0|Okay film, but too glossy compared to the grittiness of the book.  Of course, with shows like &#34;Big Brother&#34;, &#34;Survivor&#34; and &#34;American Ninja&#34;(?) it seems to be a good fit.

B008EEZ64Y|2.0|I had heard a lot of good things about this book over the years and I had seen that it was recommended reading for a lot of public school students.  The problem with this story is that it tells a story that's very on the surface when the subject matter required something more visceral.  I mean, the basic theme of this story is how important choice is in the lives of the characters, but we never really get to know any of the characters, including the main character, that deeply.<br /><br />This story creates a somewhat interesting, yet completely unbelievable setting for the characters to operate.  If everyone is doing as the \\"collective\\" is telling them to do, it is only logical that there is an individual or oligarchy that would be exercising control over the people in that society.  To set up the premise that this society is trying to avoid pain by taking away certain choices, but never establishing who is running things, is a major disservice to the reader.  I challenge anyone who disagrees with what I just wrote to show me a society that has ever existed in Earth's history that ran things the way this one does.  I mean, the main character is afraid of death at some points, but all of the supporting characters seem like two-dimensional beta males that it seems inconceivable one of them would have the cojones to order the death of their \\"chosen one.\\"<br /><br />The choices the main characters make seem illogical and almost inconsistent with the way they come across.  I get the feeling the author didn't want to really think too deeply about these characters and instead made it seem like we were watching a puppet show.  It's weak...<br /><br />I know the book should probably be taken as a parable (or something) and that its told mostly from the point of view of a 12 year old and that the nebulous ending is supposed to signify some sort of development for the main character.  The problem is that this society that the author sets up is so concrete, why give me such ahalf-assed ending?<br /><br />Save your time.  \\"1984\\" is a much better read for future dystopian societies that limit people's choice.  If this is an indicator of the author's other works of fiction, it may be a while before I come back to read another.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|This app is kind of like Post-It notes - what the heck did we do before this?!  Lived in the stone age?  I'm able to access my media collection while traveling, at work, vacation - anyplace. Great quality (configurable, too).  Strongly recommend Plex for Android and the requisite Plex Media Server.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie, as the Die Hard series is one of my favorites. I even liked the previous one, which many people seemed to dislike.<br /><br />But this one let me down. Tough to enjoy a movie in which the veteran favorite character takes a backseat to an unlikable character.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I would recommend this book I loved it so much which I wouldn't put it down my kindle fire. I loved it
B0060AY6FO|2.0|As a fan of P&P, I was hoping to see relationship development between characters and character growth, and it just didn't happen in this book.  It's a murder plot plopped down into a familiar setting (regency era at Pemberley) amongst beloved characters who behave in ways that are not even a faint shadow of the wry, impudent, observant originals. I made myself finish it because I was anticipating the movie, but otherwise, this yawn inducing whodunnit is best left on the shelf.
B0064J6OMO|4.0|Both of my favorite actors in one movie. Couldnt get better. Although I thought a different plot would be better because the whole switching bodies is really overused. Still a really cute and funny movie though.

B009EEMMWW|5.0|A sweet and refreshing twist on a relationship that appears to be perfect until infidelity breaks the bond. But, true love never gives up and the heart knows what it wants!
159102594X|3.0|Since I just finished this book, my head is still ringing with the question I asked on the last page ... that's the end? I understand that this is the first book of a series, but a book has to have SOME resolution to stand on its own. This book does not end with a cliffhanger (kinda glad about that) or a major plot twist that leaves you wondering how things will turn out. It simply ends. I guess I could have lived with the abrupt ending if the plot had been interesting to that point. It wasn't. As one reviewer put it, why do I care that these things are happening?<br /><br />The three stars are earned for two reasons: 1) The author knows how to describe combat. The writing here is clear, realistic, and agonizing. This is a talent that few writers have. 2) The author has created an interesting fantasy world. The House of the Maker, the order of Magi, the Eaters ... there is enough here to keep us coming back. He holds these cards close to the chest ... maybe a little too close. We could have done with a few chapters less of Glokta's fruitless investigations and more about the fantastical elements of this fantasy novel.<br /><br />I'm hoping the series will balance things out and earn five stars overall. For now, there are better stories out there to dive into.

B001DF68MA|5.0|This is a great seat!  I love how I can see my son and talk to him while we go for a bike ride.  He also has an unobstructed view instead of sitting behind me.  It looks really small, almost doll-sized but he fits in it well and probably will for another year or so.  I could see if your child was a little heavier that it might now work so well.<br /><br />The seat attached to my bike easily (a cruise, mountain bike hybrid) and I can ride normally with him in it.  My knees just have to be positioned out a little bit.  It doesn't seem to affect my balance at all.<br /><br />I wish I had gotten this sooner for my other 2 kids that are now older!!

B00CKYHH6O|5.0|While I have purchased Seasons One, Two, and Three of 'The Next Generation,' Season One of 'Enterprise,' and 'Best of Both Worlds' on Blu-Ray from Amazon, I did not purchase Season Four of 'TNG' or 'Redemption' from Amazon.  I typically pre-order, which I forgot to do this time.  I randomly found them at Target for the same prices Amazon was offering($59.99 and $12.99), however Target gave me Season Four for $49.99 for buying them together.  This is not something I would chance again because I've always preferred Amazon and its reliability.<br /><br />Now, on to my review of Season Four.  This Blu-Ray set is stellar, on par with Seasons One and Three, although CBS did farm out the CGI to Modern Video Film (thankfully they avoided sending it to HTV-Illuminate, which remastered Season 2).  The quality of the remastering of Season Four is much more in-line with the work CBS-D did for Seasons One and Three.<br /><br />The VAM (Value-Added Material) for this set is not AS exciting as the sets for the first three seasons.  \\"In Conversation: The Star Trek Art Department\\" is not as engaging as Season Three's Writer's reunion.  This special was a little over an hour; I would have much rather had this cut to 30-45 minutes so extra time could be given to bring more commentary and interviews into the two-documentary, \\"Relativity: The Family Saga of Star Trek: The Next Generation.\\"  The doc is split into two parts, \\"Homecoming\\" and \\"Prosperity.\\"  \\"Homecoming\\" features a lot of the writing staff and \\"Prosperity\\" is geared more toward the cast.  Wil Wheaton discusses his departure from the show nine episodes into the season, Gates McFadden discusses choreographing the dance sequences in \\"Data's Day\\" and how the show touched on a potential homosexual relationship in \\"The Host.\\"  It would have been more interesting to see them delve in greater detail about the impact of \\"The Host.\\"<br /><br />Storylines in Season Four really began to focus on family and character development.  I think the writing staff finally felt comfortable enough branching out into character arcs and more extensive character development.  \\"Family,\\" \\"Legacy,\\" \\"Reunion,\\" \\"Brothers,\\" \\"The Drumhead,\\" \\"The Host,\\" and \\"The Wounded\\" are my personal favorites of the season because the writing and acting are so sharp.  In fact, Season Four has so many standout episodes that even the more mediocre ones are worth watching.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a very dependable APP. I can't think of how you could improve it other than to make it a little more straight forward, remove some of the &quot;fluff &amp; ruffle&quot;. It is pretty but is pretty always necessary?

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show can't wait for the new season.  Has it all love, romance, struggles, comedy, sadness. Just can't get enough.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I so loved this entire book.  Loved the information on the meanings of flowers.  The story is beautiful.  Learning to truly love, forgive, and heal the heart.  The author gives wonderful descriptions of deep feelings, hurts, and joys of being an unloved young girl who learns she is worthy of love and that she indeed can love on so many levels.  I needed tissues several times!

0446573027|5.0|.<br />Like!<br /><br />My sister is a big fan of Baldacci and gave me \\"Zero Day\\" to read while I was visiting her. I couldn't put it down.  I had my nose in this book all day and all night, which probably wasn't very polite, but hey--her ploy worked. It gave her quiet time to read one of his other books!<br /><br />This is a very thought-provoking and somewhat frightening story. Who knows what kind of chemical and nuclear stuff is laying around. Makes me wonder even more if fracking might stir up something bad.<br /><br />Officer Sam Cole was well drawn.  Too bad Baldacci knocked her off. I was looking forward to reading the next book in THAT series!<br /><br />I will definitely be reading the rest of Baldacci's books. Reminds me of Grisham's work.<br /><br />Kim Burdick<br />Stanton, Delaware

B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Backstreet continued as a quartet after Richardson's departure and this certainly changed the dynamic of the group both vocally and directionally. This their 8th studio album is their first after leaving their long time label Jive in 2010 (now defunct), and with the Boys having written and co-written on most of the material it shows where the group is now and points to where their future lies.<br /><br />The whole album is solid, the Backstreet Boys stated that they wanted to make a record where every song could be a single and I think they have pretty much achieved that. The standout tracks for me are;<br /><br />In A World Like This, Breathe, Show 'em (What You're Made Of), Make Believe, Trust Me, One Phone Call and Soldier (the latter being my personal favorite). The bonus tracks also contain a couple of gems in particular Light On and Take Care.<br /><br />This is a personal record for the boys with songs written as an ode to their children (Show 'em) and to combat bullying (Madeleine), amongst others.<br /><br />Having been a Backstreet fan from the late 90's their sound has certainly evolved and with In A World Like This they have experimented and pushed the envelope whilst for me retaining what they already have. It is such a joy to hear them all harmonising together again and showing they can more than keep pace in the modern music world. KTBSPA!!

B007THA4FI|4.0|True to her style with the Harry Potter series, Rowling pulls the reader in right away, within the first few pages. However, I found it rather challenging in the first quarter of the book to keep all the characters straight. Once it was clearly established 'who was with who', the story picked up speed and got better with each page.

0385528752|2.0|This is supposed to be a book to help catalyze change right? One can't help but think of the South Park episode when Obama gets elected and everyone destroys the town because \\"change\\" is coming. This book approaches change with the entire notion of shooting first and asking questions later, if at all. Everything you need to know is on page 259 - an outline for catalyzing change, that's what the book comes down to, a basic outline. Yes it's a good outline but I feel like I wasted my life with this book, a flyer would have been sufficient.<br /><br />What's sad is that this outline does provide a great starting point and could have been beefed up with proper research and informed insight, for which this book is devoid. The whole premise of two-thirds of this book is that the \\"rider\\" (i.e. your rational side), is totally helpless against your \\"elephant\\" your emotional side. Now for trying to change things, it might not be practical to try to change psyche, but rather play to in your favor; understandable. However in the final third of the book, they do just this when they teach people how to develop a \\"growth mindset,\\" a pretty major shift in cognitive process if you ask me. Studies of willpower and meditation show that you can in fact build up your prefrontal cortex to have more control over your limbic system (the \\"rider\\" and \\"elephant\\" as they so quaintly label neurological processes in this book).<br /><br />This is the key takeaway from this book, don't think, just do. You want those fries? Eat them! She said he said what about your sister? Shoot Him! You want those brown people's oil? Invade them! Okay, over-analysis is not good for acting but this book errs way too much on the side of \\"no analysis.\\" This is heavily demonstrated throughout \\"Switch\\" with many unsubstantiated assumptions and conclusions which are drawn. A few of which, my humble self could identify as absolute fallacy from other readings. This is what the final blow was for me, many of their claimsare actually false and can be disproved with minimal research. The fact that they did not do this research leads one to conclude that they simply have no credibility at all. How's that for an assumption?<br /><br />I think their outline is published for free on their website, don't bother to waste your money on this book.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is one of those SF books I put off reading for years, and after I finished it I remembered why.  The story line is so devious it's hard to stay on track from one reading session to another.  Still, it's a classic and I can proudly say I finished it.
1423113497|5.0|My 11 year old son is addicted and cannot put them down.<br />Love to see him reading... great stories :)
0765325950|4.0|I have enjoyed this series greatly, and I found this last book to be a fitting end.I will recommend this series to any fan of fantasy novels.
0399159347|5.0|I'll be the first to admit it; I did not want to read this book.  The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty screams women's fiction and, frankly, I've not been in the mood lately.  But then, I started reading buzz on Twitter and it sounded interesting enough for me to check out the synopsis and next thing you know, I'm hitting the request button and putting it on the top of my TBR pile.  So was all of that justified?<br /><br />Yes. Yes, it was.  Because y'all, I could not put this one down.  You see, the secret in the synopsis is just one of many and frankly, this book had me freaking out more and more as it progressed.  There are hints dropped here and there about what the book has in store for you, but as I was reading I just filed those away as ambiance, as something to just enrich the reading experience.  But then, Moriarty (brilliant name for what I'm about to say here) began pulling the strings together and knitting pieces of the story into a tightly-woven, fantastically layered bit of maniacal genius that had me blinking and saying.. uh, what?<br /><br />And then, there's the epilogue.  Just one hit after another after another of things that had happened, that could have happened, that didn't happen - you name it.  Basically, everything you think through when you finish a book but you never receive answers to?  Moriarty gives you those answers and she is brutal with the honesty of them.  I was reeling when I finished the last page and I understood then what all the buzz was about.<br /><br />So if you, like me, just are not inclined to read anything labeled \\"women's fiction,\\" I suggest you let Moriarty change your mind.  There's mystery, heart and soul, and gritty, real life in the pages of The Husband's Secret.  It would make a fantastic book club read, but don't let that define the book for you.  Read it and then make your judgement from there.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|We use it in our motorhome and it works great.  Use it for the quick times instead of the vacuum.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I read a while back, but remembering the book, it was a real good read.<br />Would recommend highly to people who enjoy Kate Morton 's books!
B0026OR1UK|5.0|While The Talent Code could have done a better job discussing the practical applications of its contents, I found the concepts postulated around talent development fascinating. Readers who are able to connect the dots will come away with an excitement about how talent can be cultivated that they may have not had before reading the book. The stories about the talent hotbeds are inspirational and highly interesting.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The old app was good. The latest app is terrible! It's way too busy with a bad design. It will be deleted.<br /><br />Amazon should let users get back an old, better version of an app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderfully written, the characters become family and you are kept on the edge of your seat with all story lines.  I laugh, cry and wonder at what will happen next each episode.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I have to type 20 words for the review, but the headline says it all. Funny, witty, and appealing to normal intellectual to the, well, abnormally intellectual. Old school table top gamers, video gamers, comic nerds, super heroes fans, and geeks alike unite!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The details are fantastic. The storyline is quite well written too. I Love the game a bunch-- The downside is thw price. It gives you a little taste for free, and then ends up being five dollars? I bought a game similar to this and the full price was only $3. Other then that, it's a great buy.
B004G600A4|5.0|Great cartoon for the whole family. Girls will love it, and boys will sit and watch as the action is enough to keep them engaged.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|In the next update gameloft should put a button where your character can crouch and you earn a diamond evrytime you win in a match. over than that I really love this game and I would reccomend it to lots of people.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I have to type 20 words for the review, but the headline says it all. Funny, witty, and appealing to normal intellectual to the, well, abnormally intellectual. Old school table top gamers, video gamers, comic nerds, super heroes fans, and geeks alike unite!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game, good graphics, like how the game runs smoothly without the game crashing on me all the time. I give it all five stars :)
0143038583|5.0|Everybody that buy at Mcdonald should read this book. Worth the time and money spent, definitely changed my mind. We modern humans don't understand how hard was to cook and hunt animals and plants. Our nature is to spent energy to get energy in broad sense. The high calorie package in a cheap hamburg is against our nature and we should learn that as soon as possible
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Fine app, except Amazon refuses to keep their users of this app content with the latest version. If you're going to disappoint us by not having instagram, at LEAST keep up to date with updates.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I love this app. I bought it. I would have given 5 stars except for the annoying popup trying to sell their clock app.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have purchased all the seasons and love them all.  I am waiting anxiously for  season 4 to arrive.  Watch it and love it!!
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|It is vile and disgusting, an assualt on family/marriage values. The trailer which we watched before purchasing the movie gave no indication of just how awful the movie would be.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Amazing practical guide to living a stress free harmonious life.....couldn't put it down ..read it in 2 days.......highly recommended..enjoy.....good read....
B0027MJU00|4.0|ATo be honest I wasn't expecting or looking for much - just a decent book for pool side and to fall asleep to. I devoured it - a great surprise...
B007V2UGPE|5.0|A very good game it's way better then  number 2 because you don't have to spend money on other characters best game ever and I like how you can play as zombies
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked this game - not too challenging but not a pushover either - needs more levels, but a fun concept
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves the realism if the horses. she likes how when you clean out the stalls it gives you money.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|this movie is long and pretty strange. if you like long strange movies then you will love this. some parts are pretty slow.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really enjoyed the book despite reading after seeing the movie. In fact, I found the book to be more thought provoking and insightful. I highly recommend it!
B008602KQI|5.0|I like this movie because it is exciting, interesting and shows a good female lead.  It is worth watching, am eagerly awaiting the next two movies.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We were unsure whether Season 3 could maintain the intensity and quality of the previous two seasons.<br /><br />They certainly have accomplished the task!
B007MYP35E|5.0|Perfect form factor for portability and has all required controls needed for a nifty mixer with USB data & power options
B006MW3UZW|5.0|When we began watching DA in Season 1, I wasn't sure that I would like the portrayal of the English Social System - I am not a big fan of social snobbery. I became fascinated with the storyline, the characters, and even the casting.<br /><br />Maggie Smith is quite brilliant in her portrayal of the dowager.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Great show. Seasons 1-5 are 5 stars and 6-8 are close! Hooked once you start watching! Gotta buy them a
1781162646|5.0|I got this for the lurid vintage hard-case crime cover and potential Stephen King-ness of it all, but was surprised by the sweet, wistful tone. Sure, there's what you might expect from hard crime fiction, but the murder plays way in the background of a 70s summer that might as well be 10 or 20 years earlier.  A great summer read, to be sure, especially if you did grow up in the era of smaller regional amusement parks and summers out of time.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|And I found it addicting, a lot of fun. Will try more games of this style, not to hard but challenging.
B003B02PF4|5.0|I totally enjoyed and raced thru the chapters until the end (which you will love).  I can't help it, I am a diehard John Grisham fan and been on a kick this summer to read his books...nice and light summer, fun reading!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun haha channels child unskilled husk Hawkins making mushrooms Hindus shined behind shunned husband was in the beginning and end up running remember last summer and I was going on you are you white papers on you can be missed by my mom and I was in a lot of people who are racist and I have a lot of people who are racist it's a lot of people who are racist it's a lot of people who are racist it's a lot of people who are racist it's a lot of people who are racist it's a lot of people who are racist it's a lot of people who are racist it's a lot of people who are racist it's a lot of people who are racist it's a lot of people who are racist.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I enjoyed watching the movie with the whole family.  Funny and good movie for the kids and the adults.  Great movie for family movie night.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this game sucks its not worth the money if u want something cool get survivalcraft i cant even get on realms to do multiplayer
140006922X|1.0|This guy has no credentials as far as having a degree in Religious history-he has degrees in Sociology, Fiction and Theology. I think this book was an attempt to bash Christians beliefs and he used his Fiction degree to write it.
B005QPMB2Y|4.0|Simple and it works without any fuss.  I use to view public cams and my own home cam.  It works!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I was playing this game on my uncle's IPad then I was playing on my friends iPod.Now I'm playing this game on my kindle fire HD. It's amazing!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I love this movie! The only problem is that the digital copy cade was out of date so I wasnt able to get it. But whatever.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Yep, great game. They keep expanding it and making it better. I've never been I dinosaur guy until I played this game. Being in the military, I've always played military builders. I tried this on a whim and haven't regretted it. You can IAP cash but I haven't needed to. Definitely worth a try.
B00CZF87TY|1.0|This is not a soundtrack to sing along and enjoy with the kids like the first one. We love the first film and the soundtrack was this wonderful mix of oldies and new tracks by contemporary artists. Not this one.<br /><br />There are maybe 4 new tracks on this soundtrack and two of these are the minions singing. Two songs from the first film is included (not bad- we liked them the first time) but this is primarily orchestral background clips from action scenes in the movie. Keep your funds and don't end up disappointed like my four year old or bitter like her mom.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is amazing omg if u want fun on a game here u go u can collect bananas and weapons
B004J4WKDI|5.0|This book is probably the most unique book that I've ever read.  It is a wonderful and magical tale of love, friendship, death and life.  The prose is so exquisitely written that it feels like a dream right from the first page.  Ms. Morgenstern's prose and her descriptions are fantastic.  There are a lot of descriptions, but never once did I find any of them to be overdone or unbelievable.  I think the most amazing thing about this book is the way that she weaves these very disparate characters into one story.  I'm sure I've never read a book with as many varied characters as this one has, and each one is so extraordinary and so realistic that I felt that I had an intimate knowledge of each and every one of them. I swear that each time I put the book down, I had to blink to come back to reality.  I was so taken in by this wonderful night circus and its many wondrous sights that it felt like I was there experiencing this amazing and magical circus.  This is a book like no other.  It is a marvelous creation and it lives up to all the hype surrounding it. I'm not sure that I can come back to reality with my choice of reading material after this one.  (Not for awhile anyway)  It left me shaken and wanting more and I am sure that there is no other book anywhere like this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|MINECRAFT IS THE BEST GAME EVER!If you want more buy the Xbox or pc version.<br />But if not this one is a lower price and is a great game.<br /><br />...
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I'm guessing most people who make it this far (book 14) into the WoT series are going to have a lot of expectations for the ending.  My only expectations were an entertaining story with the characters I've known and enjoyed reading about for the last 13 books.  From that perspective, A Memory of Light certainly does not disappoint, bringing with it non-stop action from beginning to end.<br /><br />Most of the dangling plot threads from the series get resolved satisfyingly, although I'm sure someone paying more attention than I was could spot holes.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great app, and very  easy and informative. It's colorful and I love the way it comes on when I am charging my tablet. It just works for me!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love the complicated nature of the relationships on this show. Louis is SO neurotic, so needy, the lead character wants so badly to be cool but he's a little boy just trying to be accepted, the young &#34;non-lawyer&#34; is such a jumble of ethical conundrums and Rachael -- what isn't she conflicted about! When I learned she was mixed race rather than hispanic I just threw my hands up in the air! Of course she'd have to have every ambiguity the good Lord could heave onto one woman's shoulders! How else could one person be so disapproving of oneself! Addictive.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Charlie Sam and Patrick seem to go together very well. I cannot believe the twist in this book. I will definitely be reading more books by Chbosky.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm not a kid and I love this game! It is challenging enough to be fun but not so hard that you cant mindlessly. enjoy yourself!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I've always loved the music and then read about it. Yes, I highly recommend it. Great entertainment. My spouse loved it, too.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a book with great character building and an excellent plot.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game. I enjoyed playing it. Great fun to play during my lunch break and afternoon break to get my brain stimulation.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it goes slowly and it takes far too many gems to finish an hour long thing. give more gems for activities
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack fits everything...4 lenses, camera body with grip, chargers, batteries, cleaning supplies, etc.  Great product and I would definitely recommend!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a beautiful story. It tells us about two teenagers ages of 16 and 17 who meet eachother at the heart of Jesus (literally, but its like a cancer group therapy). Augustus has cancer that ended up taking a part of his leg. Hazel on the other hand has a cancer that affects her breathing which causes her to carry around a little machine to help her breathe better. Well these two hit it off instantly becoming friends and bonding over video games, books, and movies. Soon they start to fall in love but it seems like the universe (or maybe just cancer) is against them.<br /><br />I loved this book. It was a little hard to get into the book but I stuck through it and I couldnt put it down. Both of these main characters do not speak like regular teenagers, I would know because Im the same age as Augustus, but that didnt bother me at all.<br />I found myself falling in love with Augustus along with Hazel throughout the book.<br />Towards the end I was in tears; swollen racoon eyes, snot all over the place, and that growing ache in my chest.<br />This was a beautiful love story between two people that will forever stay in my heart.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECCOMENDED
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was fabulous! The romance of it all was great; not too over done. Even though the book was about teens with cancer, it was not your typical \\"cancer\\" book.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I think this was the best book in the series. Very interesting and kept me reading. I could not put this book down.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|Maybe I just didn't get it.  What communist came up with this version of 'The Zombie Apocalypse'?  Too much self-esteem blah-blah.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Great game, and it's nice to support the independent developer. My only complaint is that it might end a little bit too soon.
B00CY0JY88|5.0|A great read, didn't want it to end. All 3 books held me captive until the end! Really want more!  Can't wait to see what else Sylvia supplies!
B003O86FMW|5.0|By far my favorite in the series. I wanted to read it before the movie and now I cannot wait. I didnt think I would like this series but it is now one of my favorites!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Watch it, you will not regret it.  One of the best shows on TV. Cant wait for season Three to start.
B000SFD21Q|4.0|Very interesting book.  I would give it 5 stars but it spent a lot more time on the impact of exercise on depression and mental illness than I was personally interested in.  On the other hand, if you suffer from one of these conditions or treat people who do, it would be ideal.<br />If you are interested in exercise or improving your personal well-being, I highly recommend this book.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|I travel a lot and needed additional music to listen to.  This CD was perfect music to drive to.  I plan to buy more Yo-Yo Ma.
B00CATSONE|5.0|The true difference between Tesla and Edison was the state of their hearts.  One served humanity and one served himself.  Read this story and then ask yourself what the world and society would look like if we all  lived and created from the former.  Pretty amazing!  Right?
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have been a Groban fan for a long time.  I found this CD to be as good as his earlier ones.
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|It was a pretty good movie but not one I would watch again.<br />It had a good plot and interesting story.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Positives<br />A. Super quick setup until you are someone who messes around with router settings (if you do, you will know what to fix)<br />B. All my iOS devices could cast YouTube/Netflix<br />C. Cast a Chrome tab that is playing a movie and add another tab and browse as much as you want without disturbing the content being cast (just don't close the tab being cast or Chrome itself). I experienced no problem in casting as I have no need to watch both screens - my TV and my computer monitor! Casting quality is as good as it can be (using hdmi cable). Bye bye HDMI cables on the floor.<br />D. Netflix played far far better than what I was experiencing when using over Wii or Sony BDP. A very pleasant surprise indeed. (I use Verizon dry loop DSL)<br />E. Queuing works with mobile devices only and works nice and is a very handy tool if you have a get together at home.<br /><br />Not so nice<br />A. Perfect experience if sharing from one device/one tab only. Gets terribly confused very often and you have no option but to close the apps/browser and start again fresh - no trouble whatsoever if you do not jump around devices/content too much - fix - Go to Chrome app and hit button for \\"Stop Casting\\" and try again.<br />B. Dongle is hot when playing content.<br /><br />I consider Apple TV a far superior product, but only technically for its integrated experience.<br /><br />This little thing is a MUST for a household which does not have a wifi streaming device for their television. There is nothing better in the market.<br /><br />Update 16-Dec-2013<br />After new update for Chromecast, facing lots of issues in streaming Netflix. YouTube streaming works well though.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to see this movie when it came out in the theaters, but now I wish I did! next best thing was the DVD which came in a timely manner and wall the I expected it to be. I would purchase again and can't wait for the sequel to come out.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I know I never want to go to jail. It was a great informative book. The people were very real.
B000AP04FG|3.0|I love Angelina Jolie but the movie itself was boring!  I would not recommend this to anyone.  There are so many good action movies and comedies out there that this movie fell short!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I love the movie, it was worth it to pay a little extra for the extra content disc. It was very entertaining to watch. I also LOVED the movie itself.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great read! Very well done. Sorry we have lost Vince. I definitely follow up and read all of  his books.
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|I liked it a lot, still a darn good movie from over 35 years ago.<br />Mia and Robert were well cast.<br />disturbing story at times, but that is what made it so good
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|Its good but 75% of the time you cant connect to a game online. Other than that its really fun
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing. I laughed, cried, cried some more. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a quick inspiring read.
B001GCUER0|5.0|This was a gift for a parent, and it arrived in a timely manner, brand new sealed just as advertised. I would do business with them again.
0142407542|4.0|This book follows the Gruffalo's child, again encountering the very clever mouse in the forest. My grandchildren thoroughly enjoy the story
B004HW7JH4|5.0|This was a gift for a parent, and it arrived in a timely manner, brand new sealed just as advertised. I would do business with them again.
0142403873|5.0|My grandchildren 3 - 5 years old love the story of a very clever mouse who bluffs the entire forest including the Gruffalo!
B000EHSVSC|5.0|This was a gift for a parent and it arrived in a timely manner, sealed brand new, no problems at all. I would do business with them again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|i had never seen the show when it was originally on but just love nathan fillion on castle. i havent had a chance to watch these dvds yet but anything with him in it will be enjoyable.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Goog goog goog goog<br />Love it nice game to play do it so much love it good game love it pop pops me j u n pop
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book flows like I'd imagine Tina's stream of consciousness to, which makes me wish that I lived inside her head. I have never read a biography so quickly.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|These products are really nice quality, and for the price i think they are an awesome option.<br />Since it is mono, i just bought an adapter and everything went awesome!<br /><br />The shipping time was beyond expected and i definitely recommend it.  I will be getting a few more in a near future.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|So I have farm story and I am typing in random names so I can get more neighbors and I accidently hit the app icon and thats how I got restaurant story. Its a great game without almost any glitches and it has amazing graphic quality. It may be a little hard if you don`t play farm story first but this creator is on a role.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|One of the most inspiring, beautiful, and just plain fun albums I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. Definitely a new favorite. All of the songs from Car Radio to Guns for Hands are my absolute favorite part of the album.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|The Blu-Ray played just fine. I am not a big Star Wars nerd so I do not care if it is the original remastered movies or not. I happened to buy the movies with the added scenes and Im just fine with that. It was actually good as I was able to point out the differences to my kids who where watching for the first time and now that they are hooked we can go back and watch the original movies.<br /><br />Only reason I did not give 5 stars is that when we played each movie it started with the end credits so it was as if they were used. Since I could not tell if the movies were used and they were sealed I will give Amazon the benefit of the doubt.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really love this game on my Kindle Fire. I try to play several times a day. There is always something to do. Would recommend this to family and friends. Thanks!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Dog lovers will love this book. Brought me through so many emotions. There is just something about the perspective of a dog, love reading this book!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very good graphics, not too hard, but hard enough to be challenging. I recommend for all ages, but little ones need help, which is great to do with them! I play with my 5yr old grandson, and we have a great time.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Great show - definitely worth paying for if you haven't been following since the pilot episode. Katherine McPhee is fantastic!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|New upgrade did take some time to get used to but  it works just fine.  Weather Channel is still one of the most accurate and easy to use weather apps.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! Well-directed and well-acted. One of Richard Dreyfuss's best performances in my opinion, and yet not many people I know ever saw this. Very few movies make me cry, but this one has its moments. Good flying scenes too. I got my pilot's license years ago, and this movie brings it back for me.
B0017XD3OY|3.0|Good and entertaining movie, but it didn't follow the story line of the book too well. I personally enjoyed the book better, but would recommend the movie to friends.
B00005JA8B|5.0|Schwarzenegger shines in this action flick. Pretty scary and not too cerebral, but definitely has a plot. Good performances by the rest of the cast, too.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Tried the new email and it did not work.  Too many ads slowing it down on the side panel.  Went back to basic yahool mail which is<br />limited.  Would not recommend the new Yahoo email.<br />H Hill
B002LYTNR4|5.0|pleased with this purchase and have listened to this many times. Right now a friend of mine is borrowing this to listen as well. Thanks.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|it was so beautiful hearing and seeing Darlene like 'those days'. The songs therein will definitely take you to that realm of worship and as you worship our Victorious King, He will put things in perspective for you. 'twas nice seeing Miriam Webster in this project as well. Thumbs up guysssssss.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Too far fetched...he is beyond rich...flies planes, helicopters. She is a virgin, clumsy but humbly beautiful.  There is not an ounce of real world
B001J20ZIA|5.0|My Son really likes this.  He is 6 years old and just starting to enjoy movies.  He has watched it over and over again already :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app makes you love horses! Soon after getting this game I took lessons. But it is so addicting that you can't stop or you just don't want to.
0743277708|5.0|Worth reading again & again. Not only for children, but all ages. Richard Adams has an awesome imagination, so creative & talented.<br />I cried at the end & was so disappointed that the book was finished. I just wished it went on & on.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Somehow I didn't realize that this was rated PG and was caught off guard by the scenes of war. Still, it is a fascinating and sensitive story with really imaginative giant insects. Delves into the deeper themes of man vs. nature. A great springboard for family discussion about how people and the planet have a symbiotic relationship that is not bombproof.<br /><br />As always, we are big fans at our house of strong female protagonists who offer a different path than the Disney princess formula. Go, Studio Ghibli! Check out other animated titles from the people who brought you Totoro!
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|This is by far the most weird and ridiculous game.  I think it was made to keep someone's mind occupied and not make any achievement in conquering any scoring points.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|The visuals were nice, but wasted on this.  I wonder if a better actor playing Oz would have made a difference.  The story seemed so slow and boring, but I'm not sure if it was the one-note acting, or that if the story was just that boring.  I was just glad it was finally over.
B005K200NK|5.0|These books are some of the first I can remember my mother reading to me - certainly they were my first chapter books. One or two chapters a night are just perfect, even for the preschool set, as the chapters are basically episodic and don't require your little one to keep track of an elaborate plot. For me, as for so many, they set me on a path of loving both reading and history, but they also served to spark interests in fashion, cooking, crafting, and later, even educational theory - not just in the history of these things, but in their contemporary incarnations.<br />These memoirs of a little girl growing up in a pioneer family are presented in plain but strikingly lovely language, revealing a remarkable talent. Laura Ingalls Wilder is, to my mind, not given nearly enough credit as a great American writer. However, she is well-loved by generations of children, and I can't wait to share her work with my own.

1451624468|1.0|Basically, they start with \\"something\\" then talk about how that something became everything.<br /><br />Dawkins states \\"...you have to have a [accurately] self-replicating molecule...\\" created by \\"chemistry\\".  I didn't know chemistry was a force.  Of course you need something for the chemistry to work with.  Oh, and you need some laws to govern it.  A perfect environment wouldn't hurt either.<br /><br />Therefore, if you want to read a book on why there is something rather than nothing, this is not that book.  It doesn't really try to answer that question.  Right off the bat they quantify nothing as a pretty big something.<br /><br />If these guys didn't already have a reputation, this book would never have made it to the bookshelf.

WILL PURCHASE A SANDLE  WHICH ALLOWS &#34;MORE FREEDOM&#34;, MORE FRESH AIR.

1609611543|5.0|The author believes the problem America is facing with obesity is because of modern wheat. He goes through how wheat was developed from previous grain varieties. He explains the condition of wheat intolerance and how none of us have the ability to digest it fully. Then the author goes into of all the different effects wheat does to our bodies from the digesting to our brain and more. The author does come up with conclusions from personal and client experience. No doubt the author does have point and it needs to be more research, and needs to be on the minds of America. I highly recommend this book to others. Hope this review helps :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Worth every cent ! Great game! Beautifully designed. Music is nice and it really makes you use your brains. Absolutely a must have for every kindle owner.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am just getting back into reading after being consumed by too much reality television and this book really pulled me in.  I was able to keep everything straight until about 70% of the way through the book and then I got a bit confused by the year jumping and the generational family ties, but it all came together in the end.  I never read The Kite Runner, so that is next on my list.
B005J2UM9S|1.0|This movie does not stand out among similar movies...mental hospital, they end up as patients, blah, blah, boring!  Poor acting (very overdone), no dialogue (99% expletives), and story line predictable.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|This book was OK...really good concept and development of the plot but just never grabbed me. I kept reading because I wanted to see how it ended, not because I was invested in the story.
B00DU74U74|5.0|If you've read the book and have a need to have the movie follow it, then forget watching it as it doesn't.  However, the movie stands on in own, is well directed, shot, and the acting is great.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|The app is okay because I mainly use it to play music to relax my dog.  It frequently won't load, and I usually have to turn the kindle off and then back on again to load a video.
B001O96JC4|4.0|Probably the closest to the book by Bram Stoker, which is why they were sued big time by the Stoker family. Good movie though.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|very intriguing book.  A little slow at first, but kept my attention.  Never read this author's books  before.  read another
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It was a beautiful story and the writing was excellant, buy I liked the author's other two book best, especially the Kite Runner.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Really liked the book and was fascinated that I could see my own reflection in the kindle as I read it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book! I rated this a 5 star because it was that good! I love reading Nicholas Sparks books because they are really good, and have a good plot to it! I also love it because he always makes you cry whether it's a good cry or sad cry! I recommend this book to anyone who is into love romance, and who doesn't mind crying their eyes out!!
0201433079|3.0|This book looks great for C programmers.  I didn't view the overview well to see its detail..  I'll see if I can make it usuable.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|I thought the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy very well done but found this first part of the Hobbit overwhelmed by trolls, orcs, and goblins. A bit more time could have been spent developing the individual dwarf characters who add so much interest to the book. I can only imagine what's in store for us when the dragon comes into play. The special effects were good but certain characters took on a &#34;video game&#34; look that I didn't care for. Finally, I found the scenes in the goblins' cavern and the last scene with the orcs laughable, if not utterly ridiculous. I understand that this is a fantasy, but unless the dwarves were made of rubber they could never have survived what was done to them in those scenes, not to mention their escaping with nary a broken bone among them. I am as willing to suspend my disbelief as the next person, but I can't overlook complete disregard for the physical laws that govern Middle Earth.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Title:  Waking Up Married<br /><br />Series:  N/A<br /><br />Author:  Mira Lyn Kelly<br /><br />Genre:  Romance<br /><br />Blurb:  Her first thought: \\"Who are you?\\"<br /><br />It's the morning after her cousin's bachelorette party in Vegas and Megan Scott wakes up with the mother of all hangovers. Even worse, she's in a stranger's penthouse having woken up with something else as well--a funny, arrogant, sexy...husband!<br /><br />Up until now, finding even a boyfriend had seemed impossible--been there, got the broken heart, sworn off men for good. Then a few martinis with Carter...no, Connor Reed and she's gone from first meet to marriage in one night!<br /><br />Megan wants a lawyer. But Connor's shocking bombshell?<br /><br />\\"I don't want a divorce.\\"<br /><br />Thoughts:  Overall, this was a short, light, fun-hearted read.  I particularly enjoyed the lengths Megan would go to try to convince Connor that she wasn't the woman for him.  Most men would have thrown up their hands in frustration and given up, so it was equally enjoyable to see the lengths Connor would go to in order to convince her that she was wrong!  Those things really just made the book for me.<br /><br />From beginning to end, it follows the typical Harlequin format.  After reading the book ( I obtained a copy through Netgalley for a review), I also noticed it was free on Amazon to help launch their first book for the new KISS line of books.  Considering the book is a freebie, it really is a pretty good read.  However, in order to launch a new line?  I think it could have been better.  Everything about it is just okay....okay characters, okay plotline, okay chemistry, etc.  It has great potential, but just seems like the bare bones of a great story.  I would have loved to see more depth to it.<br /><br />It's a great summer read - easy to pick up and put down, but still entertaining and fun.<br /><br />Rate:  B<br /><br />Review by: Sarah<br /><br />[...]

B005DOKIYG|1.0|The case did not fit my kindle fire. I was so upset, that it didn't fit. But they gave me a full refund and told me to keep it.
B0035S996U|3.0|For the time period the movie is ok, I think they could have done a better job showing the different parts of the city that they had to get through in order to get back to Coney Island. But the premise of the movie and the rawness of it are refreshing
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|I think the title said it.  The trailer made it look interesting, but all of the interesting scenes in the movie are in the trailer.  It's a snoozer.  Don't get this unless you really just wanted an excuse to nap on the couch.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|It's the type of game that makes you wonder where did the creativity go in all of the big name players. Amazing stuff, inspiring stuff!

B0050OMJIW|5.0|Simply the last in a long, long  queue of readers who have raved about this wonderful book with its perennial warning to mankind.
1593080719|5.0|This is a timeless tale of rich/poor and the struggle for one's independence with means. Characters are ones you will recognize from today's tabloids.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A surprisingly good book.  It's one that seems to come to an end too soon.  It is about cancer so be prepared to cry throughout.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|I watched this movie with no expectations and was so pleasantly surprised. This is now officially one of my favorites. I laughed, cried, cheered. This movie is a must own!
B00BBW15R8|5.0|Funny, heartwarming...get the kleenex out! and Omar Sy??? Wow!  Both actors are incredibly loveable.  The unexpected bond that is created between these two UNLIKELY characters is on a soul level.  The human~ness is beautiful
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have had this game for about two months and I still enjoy playing it! Worth the money. CAUTION: playing this game may cause joy.
B000W93CHC|4.0|A riveting follow-up to Pillars of the Earth. The format is the same as Pillars: crisis, crisis  averted, 3 pages later-another crisis; repeat. Characters you love to love and those you love to hate. Generous use of sex, violence and expletives.
B00C9PQ7I8|4.0|I love this piece.  It is a wonderfully produced mix of gospel, folk, jazz, blues, rock.  The musicians who accompany Ms. Staples are amazing, the production is clean and about the music.  This has been one of our favorite new albums/cds this year.

B005PK57NU|5.0|Very good plot lines and character development.  Seems pretty true to life.  Accurate portrayal of big law firms. Liked it.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|I have been meaning to see this for years - finally did and realize how great movie making was when characters and dialog could be so entertaining, without need for non-stop &#34;action&#34; and special effects.  All the acting in this movie is great, and it was such fun being entertained by all the various characters.
B004LWZW6U|1.0|I was pumped when I heard about this sequel, especially since they had Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames coming back to reprise their roles, and added David Koechner, Hasselhoff and Gary Busey(!) to the cast. I really enjoyed the original, liked the main characters, liked the campyness, and found it to be an underrated classic slasher-type horror in the same vain as the recent Hatchet series. Boy was this movie a step in the complete wrong direction. The writing was terrible, the plot made very little sense, the cameos felt tacked on and gratuitous, the main characters weren't interesting, there wasn't anything added to the story of the piranha, lots of stupid pun jokes, etc. It was just a mindless bore-fest (not gore-fest, which also felt lacking compared to the first film) and the 3D shots were even more annoying. Resist the temptation to get this movie if you liked the original, it's just not any good.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Spellbinding explanation of this historic era! Follett captures the reader from the first page to the last sentence and word!

B00DHNBPA6|2.0|I was expecting a little more that this delivered.  I liked the original film when I was younger, this one kind of disappointed.<br />It was still a decent horror film, some will probably love it.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I am a big Howl's Moving Castle movie fan and when I heard it was a book I was really looking forward to reading it. After buying my Kindle this was one of my first downloads. I was surprised and impressed. The storyline differs from the movie quiet a bit and you get a lot more information about Sophie and Howl. I recommend this to any person for a quick fun read.
B006T3RM08|4.0|This product makes it easier to have both keyboard and trackpad in the palm of your hand. Comes in handy when I have to step away from the desk and sit on a couch.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|The series is worth a watch, even if just for a brief (and not always) accurate history lesson.  Guilty pleasure.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is a really top rate performance of Emma. The characters including those who play them are all very real, plausible, and amazing. The story shows people at their worst and very best. Very, very good
B003719G40|5.0|I thought the book was very insightful and although its only been a month I have seen huge gains in my marriage. I've implemented many of the principles and it has come back ten fold, wish I had read it nine years ago when I got married to my beautiful wife.
B006XBSAP2|4.0|I LOVE the ET song on here. I like to play it as loud as I can in my car.
140006922X|1.0|One of my friends forwarded me Reza's interview with Fox News. Initially I wanted to read the book. Not that Fox news is a great source of gospel.. but I just wondered how a guy can pontificate so much. He was claiming he was a Professor, and that too Professor of Religion and a PhD and hence was claiming his work as scholarly. Being a rational minded, I cross checked with his employer. He is not a Professor but an Associate Professor! Academics will know the difference and claiming that  he was a Professor when he was not is a big sin in the academic world where I came from (Indian Institute Technology). Next I see that he is actually an associate professor of creative writing!! and not the scholar of religion as he claimed!! He also seem to have penchant for dropping \\"I  am a PhD\\" whenever he got cornered!! and his resume says he is currently working on PhD.. Things do not add up. I am giving a pass for the book because of obvious dishonesty.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I'm a big Supernatural fan, I've been watching the show since it first premiered. This season was quite fantastic. I've nothing else to say on the matter. Good day to you.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|The first few lines of the book will suck you in: &#34;First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed.  Then about the murders, which happened later.  The robbery is the more important part, since it served to set my and my sister's lives on the courses they eventually followed.&#34;  From there you accompany the first person, Dell, on a journey that is almost impossible to believe - then you must remind yourself this IS a novel.  Descriptions of the characters and the places are so realistic that you will sometimes believe this is non-fiction.  Some judicious editing could have improved &#34;Canada&#34; for me, but you will endure some repetition just to find out the fate of the brother-sister twins.

B009KWU6Q2|3.0|Enjoyed the movie with my granddaughter but like the Disney version better. OK for a Sunday afternoon if you want something to watch.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|If I could sum up the pitch for this movie, it would go something like, &#34;I'm going to film Les Mis, the actors are going to sing live, and I'm going to do lots of extreme close-ups of them singing.&#34;  The first two work pretty well for the actors in the movie who actually know how to sing.  For the rest (I'm looking at you Russel Crowe), I'm wondering what kind of ego you must have to think this was a good idea to put yourself in a musical.  Russel Crowe, you can't sing well enough to play Javert.  End of story.  I loved you in Gladiator, but this was not for you.  Regarding the close-ups, my God, I don't need to see the saliva in the actors mouths.  I'm pretty sure I could see the stale bread lodged in Hugh Jackman's molars.

1594204217|5.0|This book is for anyone who is interested in cooking with a dash of science, nutrition, and sociology.  Pollan has carved out quite the little niche for himself as the preeminent food journalist by identifying something that seems a bit off in our society and trying to refocus the conversation.  He started with Omnivore's Dilemma (eat less meat) and has opened up what I think will prove to be a very enlightening and potentially groundbreaking conversation about the role of microbes in our lives.  With the simple premise that there are roughly 10 microbial cells in your body for every one cell that belongs to you, he theorizes that maybe we should be embracing the micobes in our guts (and elsewhere) rather than waging war on them.  This discussion manifests itself through an analysis of lacto-fermented foods (think cucumbers brined in a salt water mixtures rather than vinegar, thus creating an anaerobic environment that breeds all sorts of beneficial bacteria).  He ultimately posits that perhaps there is a connection between many western diseases and the fact that we have systematically been attacking those bacteria in our guts that are mostly there to help us.  Too early to know if this is true, it seems like a pretty compelling argument.  I think anyone who has had a particularly strong dose of antibiotics can attest to the toll it can take on you.  It doesn't seem like a stretch to think that this could have long-term consequences.<br /><br />Anyway, great book.  Highly recommend it.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Now I can watch Netflix on the bedroom TV.  I have a PC and Roku hooked up to the main TV in the living room, so I don't really need a Chromecast there.  Netflix streams without any lag or slow buffering on this gadget.  One note, however, is that a strong Wifi signal is essential.  This seems especially important when streaming a Hulu video on a Chrome browser on my desktop computer.  There was too much lag and choppiness to be acceptable.  When I moved it closer to the router, there seems to be no more problems.  Great buy for around $10 (with the free 3 months of Netflix)!  Even for the full $35 price, I think it's worth it.  I see no advantages to getting another Roku given what the Chromecast lets me do.  Another thing I noticed is that when it is turned on (I usually unplug it when not in use), it takes around 4-5 minutes for other devices to recognize the Chromecast on the network.  Not sure if anyone else has this problem.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Love this series! Quirky and English humor mixed with genuinely talented actors. The entire series is a must have for sci fi fans.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing. The creativity the game inspires is simply unmatched. I love how the game never tells you what to do, it simply throws you into a world and all you know is you have to survive. Sure you may die every now and then or constantly run into Creepers but through trial and error you will soon master the art of survival and be able to laugh in the face of Mobs as they try to figure out a way into your castle.<br /><br />That's the beauty that this game has to offer its up to you to play the  way you want. Prefer the safety of sunlight? Mine during the day and have your mines exposed to the sun. Prefer to brave the night? Grab a sword and prepare to fight!<br /><br />Minecraft is one the few games that truly offer a sense of adventure. And that<br />my fellow players is Really Freakin' Clever.<br /><br />P.S. We're still waiting for v.7.2.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed the book as soon as I starting reading the first few pages. Little disappointed with the ending. Felt there should have been more to it, but nontheless it was an enjoyable read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is a fun and easy way to past time at doctor appts. and I have 4 kids so its easy for all ages to play and I enjoy playing theses games too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Money<br /><br />  Survival  n<br /> is awesome and funny and cool and fun and I just love it I love the new update
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Our entire family enjoyed this classic adventure brought to life in a movie. A little gory for the children at times, but not too bad.
B002PJ8BE6|5.0|I chose this cd because I am a huge fan of both Jonas Kaufmann and Angela Gheorghiu.  It is a special pleasure to find the full opera on a cd, sung by these two contemporary and superb performers.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I like the version on kindle fire. I like how the new sources are selected. must have app. I would like to see more improvements on stability.
B00004T2FQ|5.0|This production is a joy to hear.  Again, Sutherland and Pavarotti are at the top of their game.  Young and vibrant, it is a joy to hear.  I've owned this disc for at least 15 years.  I bought this one for my sister, who is new to opera.  She is in love with this disc.
B000P46QTA|5.0|If you want to know what it's like to live in a country where the Statist run everything, watch this movie.  You get and idea of what political correctness can do to a society and how human decency can win out in the end.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|App is great but it takes so long to long to load &amp; it lags  bad sometimes but other than that great app.
B004TFLYRA|5.0|This book was great. Loved it. Great end to the series. Book nr. 9 in the series. I am 12 years old, boy, and love these books.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|There are 0 glitches. You can breed your own cool dragons. It costs real money if you want to buy gems. But over all its great and you decorate all your islands. Im a 12 year old girl and it kind of gets boring. I think it is better for younger kids and boys
B00BTLSURE|5.0|Very strong album from a consistently good band. Lots of really great songs on it, destined to become a classic.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I know that the game is great because when I played I saw all of every thing. But I know other kids will rate this  5 stars. I love littlest pet shop .I know that this will teach others how to be responsible about pets, really almost everything . This is a learning experience for children , kids, teens.
B005LAII8K|5.0|First of all, I have to make fun of the people who need to point out plot holes in time travel movies.  I guess they are just super intelligent - but WAIT! If they were really that intelligent and science-minded, they would have known going in that time travel can't be presented without plot holes.  That's because it flies in the face of so many basic laws of physics.  It's make believe, people.  That's why it's called SCIENCE FICTION instead of educational programming.  Can you not have fun for a couple of hours without torturing yourselves?<br /><br />Okay, now that that's out of the way...<br /><br />This was a very good movie.  It had twists that really caught me off guard.  It had a bit of a horror movie feel to it towards the end.  The kid's character was classic.  All the characters were good.  Each character had things I loved and hated about them (I thought Willis being the bad guy was refreshing).  That makes them seem real.  Great duality and conflict.  Beautifully gut-wrenching.  It was one of those movies that just when you start to get comfortable with it, it changes, creating great suspense and the feeling of being on the edge of your seat.  My attention often wanders when I'm watching movies, but I was glued to the TV for this one.<br /><br />And, what makes or breaks any movie, the ending was superb.  One of those endings where you find yourself thinking about it hours later.<br /><br />If you're looking to be entertained - instead of testing your science skills - I think you'll like it, especially if you love a good SciFi movie.  Just sit back and enjoy it for what it is.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and addictive. It's easy to play and the graphics are wonderful. I absolutely love it!!
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Too many people to keep up with, and it kept going back in time and I had a hard time keeping up with it.  I have read it other two book and thought they were great, but not this one.
B003HTPHTK|4.0|Romantic Comedy lovers will miss Brittany Murphy.<br /><br />unknown good compact Romantic Comedy Movie, only wide Released in South Korea back in 2007.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I have read all so far of John Grisham's Theodore Boone books and love every one of them - can hardly put the book down - and I read all of them in record time for me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandchildren love it and so their parents.  Fantastic entertainment for my entire family.  I have to keep my kindle hidden from others.
B0095P33IW|5.0|I had already seen this movie, but wanted to demo the HD capabilities of my new Roku. Excellent demonstration to go along with an excellent movie.
B009ZQJ0ME|4.0|Written and directed well. Some of it was a bit predictable but held my attention throughout the film.  The End.
B008JFUPOY|1.0|Yes - this film is nothing but a remake of Revenge of the Nerds.  Maybe Disney figured that the kids who would be watching this had never seen Revenge of the Nerds so they wouldn't figure out that the plot had been copied.  On the other hand, the adults taking the kids to this movie should recognize it right away.<br /><br />Is that really the best Disney can do?  Are the supposedly creative people employed by Disney so out of fresh ideas that they have to (1) come up with another Monsters movie rather than something original, and (2) copy the script from Revenge of the Nerds because they can't come up with one themselves?
B001XUT6AG|5.0|I love every Star Trek (TOS) big screen film, especially Wrath of Khan, but, Undiscovered Country is my special favorite, not only because it was the last with all the original crew but also because it felt right.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I read it in about a week, which is pretty rare for me.  The premise is wonderful, and the author does a wonderful job of making the environments come alive.<br /><br />The ending could have used some work, but I am excited to read more stories that take place in this rich wolrd
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really enjoy this game!  I would like to see more energy though.  I do not have enough when full to collect everything ... and that part is not so enjoyable. I too would like a way (other than purchase) to get energy quicker than every 3 minutes. I would probably buy some with real money eventually, but right now I need too much to do basic tasks to consider it.<br /><br />It is quite fun and  I will just be patient :) The graphics are really nice.<br /><br />I have not experienced any lag times on my kindle fire that others have posted about. That could be that my land is still rather small.  It seems to be working just fine for me.<br /><br />Good clean fun! Enjoy!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I have had no problems with this app till now. The app keeps bugging me to update but sends me to google to do this update. I'd be happy if it would just stop bugging me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game ever nice horses u should get this game it igood it free this game take Carr or your use
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The unit is so portable. The days of logging around my Roku or Apple TV are done. This thing is amazing. Whatever you can display in your Chrome Browser, can be displayed on the TV screen with various degrees of success. Some work better than others. I really hope the other services follow through and develop proprietary apps for this device. The installation is so clean on my Sony Bravia HX800. You can't see anything and the USB port powers the unit. A truly clean installation. The on board apps are limited to YouTube, Netflix, Pandora, and the browser streaming I mentioned before. The YouTube functionality is very cool because it allows you to queue more videos on the fly. No longer must I make a playlist for every event. I can change the mood of the party by sending new requests to the list. Netflix app is very responsive. Wishlist of apps would include HBO GO, Amazon Instant Video, etc.
B003274QH6|5.0|This show is awesome!!!!!! The acting is superb by all the actors on this show.  Wish it wasn't ending this year.
B005HEPN06|5.0|What a great series! The insight into true physics phenomenon and the application is superb. They must have done a lot of research to make the series not only believable, but even today I see inventions that look close to what Star Trek 'predicted' i.e. iPad, body scanners for doctors, computer voice recognition, etc<br /><br />The stories are well written and the actors are second to none. There are also many big Hollywood stars who starred in Star Trek before they made it big. Famke Janssen, Ashley Judd, Kirsten Dunst
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|There is a saying that everyone is born with the capacity to be a scientist or to create a world until we make them conform to what society can live with. Skunk Works is an example of what can be accomplished when red tape, big government, shareholders and bottom line are not part of the equation and collective imaginations are free to create.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I keep the same comment for the first season...Seasons 1-3 are great....I just have to add that the event that happens at the end of season 3 was completely unexpected....and sad....
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It was a good app for a kid who loves horses. It gives them the opportunity to have a horse without actually owning one.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is the best mobile game I've ever played. Like... there's literally not a single bad thing I can say about it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Amazing graphics too. Can't get enough. Has unlimited play. With patience you can play for free. Word to the wise, if you delete this game off of your device you will have to start all over again.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another beautiful book written by Khaled Hosseini.  He brings Afghanistan to life and makes the people who live there real to us.  Reading his books makes one realize we are all part of the same world with the same hopes and dreams and the everlasting desire for love.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|It will help to read the book first - you will have better appreciation.  Hugh Grant's makeup is outstanding.  The movie goes at a lightning pace compared to the book.  So it helps to have an idea what is going on.  Pretty cinimatography.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|A bit sophomoric, but that's what I liked about it.  The F word is a little overused, but that's part of the deal in this movie, especially once Kristen Wig learns that it's OK to use curse words. Definitely an escape from day-to-day reality.  The character of Paul is excellent.  He's the star of the show with Seth Rogen doing the voice.  Kristen Wig does a great job and adds flavor to the mix.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have had no problems with this game. It is a fun yet extremely easy game to play. LOVE IT!!!!!!
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|I really love this film. If anything, it inspires you to change up what's in your world a bit by doing something different.  Our routines dull us.  Our satisfaction with perceived comforts dull us.  Our buying into social controls dull us.  We all should learn to be a Truman- cause you never know where your ship will take you when you sail off.  Ok.. enough cheese. It really is a great film and very funny- not the typical Jim Carry slapstick- three stooges funny - which just bores me  but funny in the scenarios that are created and the situations that the characters play out. It's a shame that some  reviews give a 1 star cause it didn't transfer to blue ray or dvd or some other stupid thing like that.  The film is one of the true five stars in the Amazon catalogue and should be rated for the content- not the technological marketing.  See the film- and break yourself out of your humdrum world.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is how it all began and you must have this to see how this wonderful series began and evolved.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Loved the book!  Hard to put it down. Fast paced with a little bit of everything I like about Lee Child's character Jack Reacher.  But I just couldn't give it five stars.
B0073COMKW|3.0|Not bad, but not great.  Illumination angle is narrower than another brand.  But it's LED, and the price is way better than earlier on why bulbs like this cost around $40.
078401213X|5.0|Loved it!  Really enjoyed the subject and the acting was excellent.  I would recommend this film to audiences looking for a unique sci-fi film.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I used to be a huge fan of this app, all my friend had it, and i could chat and what not to them great! BUT THEN HOWEVER- My messages first off..wouldn't send, then i logged out and tried again..but then it said &quot;Error Please try again later&quot; So in like 10 or so minutes i tried to log back in, and the same thing happended, and one of my friends told me that she had to update it. And There is no updated one..PLEASE UPDATE so i can use this again
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I enjoyed season 1 and season 2 wqs just as good. I already bought a couple of season 3 shows, but now am enjoying the show at a neighbors house.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|The actors were awesome. The portrayal of the times and Viet Nam war were almost too realistic. An unfortunately accurate movie of an unnecessary war.<br />War scenes were graphic and difficult to watch for me. But the story line kept me rapt.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I thought this would be a typical law show. It wasn't. The characters are well developed and the writing is smart and funny too. I like that the women are all strong characters. I also enjoy the sets and the clothes! Louis Litt is a hilarious character.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Outstanding series with good story line, relationships, etc.  Like relationship between Harvey and others.  Jerk junior partner is first class jerk.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Perfect balance of action and humor. These seasoned actors prove that not only young buff actors can create a great action flick.
B0015T6G2G|5.0|I lived in South Africa from 1983~86 still there was apartheid, we ( Japanese) were treated as Honorable white ( I didn't know why), but I knew these things and it is awe to read his struggle. We should learn about apartheid and also how sill to separate people with colors.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I liked it.  It was a challenge at times &amp; that's what I like.  It has to keep my attention &amp; it did!
B0058O84G0|5.0|great story, bit slow and lot of history but generally great read, be prepared for lot of different characters. Ken Follet always good stories
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|I appreciate the attempt to make another Evil Dead, and it definitely had some pretty scary moments. That said--the characters were all very weak, literally, and had a tendency to act irrationally during presented conflicts. When I find myself wanting the hero to die for most of the film (because he deserves to based on foolish actions), I can't justify giving it more than two stars. Also, the final demon and scenes are not very scary or impressive (very anticlimactic).
0547884591|5.0|association of reading a recipe, cooking the meal, and aligning that with the life skills and lessons on the necessity of each part of the recipe to be exact and in order which is the same principle in life to achieve a goal
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I'm going to break this down step by step here so it's easy to understand.<br /><br />First the backpack on the outside, it's a solid black backpack, it's low key which is great for me.  (There's no camera logo that would attract potential thieves.)  The backpack straps are fully customisable to your likings, you can adjust the chest strap and slide it down or up, the belly buckle (there's probably some actual name for this) can be adjusted to whatever size you like and has several stretchy bands to shove the excess straps in, a great feature that I haven't seen on many backpacks.  The outside also has a tripod holder which is great!  The two pockets on the backpack on each side could be a bit better as I don't see being able to hold much.  My big gripe is that it seems to be missing a drink holder pouch, having that would've made it for me.  Otherwise you can put your drink in the stretchy elastic rope thingy thing and hope it holds.  The outside zipper pouches are nice but can't hold too much without starting to push on the insides of the backpack.  Basically a map or umbrella or hat and it's almost full, so the pouches are kind of limited to what can be held without making it bulge too much.  Not a huge issue for me but for some it might be a bit bigger of a gripe.  Another issue I noticed is that your back will easily get sweaty wearing this backpack, I wish it was like some of those hiker backpacks where it had better ventilation.<br /><br />Inside the backpack it's fully changeable to your gear, basically it has the foam dividers with velcro that you can move around to whatever shape you want.  It easily holds a camera, several lenses, and a flash while providing plenty of protection.  The zipper pouches on the inside are good for holding accessories and batteries, however I do wish there was a smaller zipper pouch available for SD cards.  Overall the inside is very well designed and should accommodate everyones uses.<br /><br />Overall the backpack is something that any photographer should consider.  It's comfortable, instead of having one strap that can wear out your shoulder it provides the ultimate comfort like some of those hiking backpacks.  It comes at an unbeatable price and provides storage for just about any of your camera gear.  Even if you have a high end shoulder bag, having a backpack like this makes for a more comfortable experience on longer distance trips.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Bought this for my husband a few weeks ago, and he just mentioned to me that he listens to it in his truck constantly. He says he can't quit playing it.  So, I'm thinking that's pretty high praise!
B000ZI8E5K|1.0|The audio version has been so abridged that it is useless.  It is little more than a few itemized points made by the author.  I found it inadequate and a waste of time and money.  My daughter was also greatly disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series...can't wait until the next season starts. Maggie Smith totally makes this show, but every is great.  It's been a while since I've wanted to watch a show.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Hope it continues for years to come!  Love Noah and the part he plays as well as his children.  Great acting on all counts!
034554398X|5.0|All the elements, plot-twisty action and characters that made \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and \\"A Clash of Kings\\" great reads structure and set the tone of this second sequel.  This grim, bloody, whimsical and sometimes surprising (but always character-consistent) series continues to wow; it has made me excited to be a reader, in a way that I haven't been in a long time.<br /><br />Worth owning, this - as are the first two novels.<br /><br />Followed by \\"A Feast For Crows\\".
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love the entire series!!!!! I wish I could write something like that!!!<br />Someday I want to write a book like that!!!
B000ICZD5M|1.0|I rented the 1984 movie Dune on a lark... It's not very good. I'd say very disappointing. The visuals are dark and often grotesque - as is the story line. Not much good I could say about it - stick to \\"Start Wars\\" for a much better done sci-fi of a similar ilk.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Not a bad game. Don't like the ads but it was free so whatever. It would be cool if there were hints.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I found this second book in the trilogy to be an easier read than the first.  At times, it was a bit difficult to follow the changes in setting and character but it became easier as the plot progressed.  The thing most pleasing to me was the insight I gained about the politics of the time period. I have a better understanding of how the Nazis gained so much power in Europe.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I have this on my pc and now my tablet. It is great on both. I definitely recommend this to all.
0385349947|5.0|Loved this book! I spoke about the book to all of my female colleagues and my husband, gave examples from it on many occasions, and used advice, e.g. Do not leave until you leave . Reach to more than one mentor. Keep your hand up. I noticed even before that women are really not as cooperative towards each other, and Sandberg helped me to understand why.
B008VVT51U|5.0|What an inspiring and delightful film! A beautiful story, with terrific actors, set in the sensory feast of India. This movie makes growing old look like the adventure it's meant to be. Worth watching more than once!
B003V5CFV8|5.0|My sister had never seen O' Brother, Where Art Thou. We had to rent it so she could. It was fun to see it again. A perfect comedy - not to be missed.
B00DU16OJM|5.0|I've heard his name mentioned here and there over the years, thrown around with Townes Van Zandt and Steve Earle... Finally gave him a solid listen with this album - and man am I glad... it's great when one of the mature songwriters can re-prove himself on his own without a bunch of hooplah production.
0307987647|5.0|Made driving to and from work with all the traffic so much better. My only disappoint was how the reader did women's voiced they all sounded the same
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I am sick of people saying \\"Oh, the girls were too thin,\\" or \\"They were inappropriate,\\"  Well there was NOTHING wrong with their physical appearance! so seriously stop saying that, they just have skirts on! They might as well become Eskimos if moms are hating on this! But I LOVED the movie, and the school setting with \\"mean girls\\" and \\"the popular crowd\\" is VERY REALISTIC, but on a very low scale. I would recommend this to little girls, in fact all ages!  But if you are some overly protective mom, who doesn't even let their kid watch Spongebob, I would not recommend your child to watch.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Nice calculator app. No ads. Simple calculator or when in landscape view it does a scientific calculator. Very nice. You can also see all the numbers you typed in before you hit the equal sign.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. horror is my favorite genre, and like all horror fans know, you have to wade through quite a lot of movies that are so-so, downright awful, or \\"good enough\\" to find the few gems -- and honestly, those are usually ones i stumble across on netflix (like \\"The Ceremony\\", which was wonderfully scary).<br /><br />this movie scared the $$#* out of me, no lie. there are some scenes that, if i think about them late at night, make it hard to get to sleep! the story is well-written and holds up through all three acts, and the way the movie is shot is just beautiful. but what really, really made this movie for me was the sound design. i think it's possibly the most incredible sound design i've ever heard in a horror movie. and the way it builds dread is almost exquisite, with enough frightening flashes and creepy cinematography to keep a constant build up of tension for the whole thing.<br /><br />i love this film, and it's right up there with \\"The Haunting\\" (the old version, not the travesty that was the remake), and \\"The Changeling\\" for me (that coal cart seance scene ahhhh). This movie plays with the concept of horror extremely well, blending supernatural horror, psychological humor, and just plain old dread together in a masterful way. and i can't say enough about the sound design -- which makes such a huge impact (to me, anyway) on a movie, especially horror. imagine if \\"The Last House on the Left\\" hadn't had such a terrible musical score, and how much more frightening it might have been!<br /><br />i highly recommend this movie, for the plot, the overall atmosphere, and a story that is layered and complex without being convoluted or unbelievable (there are totally believable supernatural horror movies! those are the ones that really get you -- when you're drawn in enough to be convinced this is possible, and keep thinking about it long after the movie is over.) I didn't even realize the actor was Ethan Hawke until I looked the film up on IMDB after i saw it. great film, i'd love to see hollywood put out more movies like this! even if i might never sleep again ;)
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Had it on VHS and wanted on DVD.. A classic ! Never will tire of this movie and great lines
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Great movie but don't read the book first because the movie does not do the book justice. Great story line and a lot of unexpected turns... Enjoyed it a lot
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show. I love shows involved with law & also good humor. Super Duper Fantastic!!! Couldn't stop watching it. Also Amazon is making type more words so this might sound odd.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is alsome it is fun and good for any age I say 7-69 it is alsome to play and u cant stop playing it
B0014DQSGW|4.0|Funny, cute movie!  This is a movie that will give you laughs and put a smile on your face!<br /><br />Watch it!
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Great movie. I would recommend this movie for any who have young children. Makes long car rides stress free. Great graphics and original story line.
B00A27X972|5.0|What a great book! A look at Humans from a perspective of a far away Galaxy! The perspective of this visitor will get you to thinking - about a lot of things to say the least. Loved every page for the insight into HUMAN ways and also the mathamatics that control the entire story. CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE MOTION PICTURE WHICH IS COMING!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i love this book because theres nothing else like it out. i have read this book 7 times now and it still hasnt gotten old
1781162646|4.0|Short story, but still with all the King suspense and surprises. A very good read for the summer. Will not disappoint.
B00DU73T08|1.0|Hard to watch, and I really enjoyed the book.  The way they did the internal dialogue between Melanie and Wanda was uncomfortable.
B00005JPNY|4.0|friend suggested .... sci fi not my number 1, no sequal expected or so I hear, see with a friend
B00DU16OJM|5.0|Mr. Clark is a true treasure.  You can close your eyes and throw a dart at any of his albums and not get a bad one.  This is no execption.  Go ahead and do your soul a favor and buy this one today.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Beautifully done and was a joy to play.  My only complaint is the game control for some of the moves. Besides that, good job!
B000HAB4KS|4.0|Granted a huge number of reviews have been posted for this film. What I might be able to add is that it is not an easy film to understand,  I suggest that before viewing it you read a number of reviews and undertake some analysis of the ideas it presents. The main idea has to do with what is real and what is not real,  This concept has a long history dating back at least as far as Plato and the cave, While the movie is a science fiction thriller it is much more than that and to fully appreciate it you should do some research.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|this game will suck you in until you've finished all the endings and leave you sitting there in unbridled awe. i couldn't even make sounds or speak for about 10 minutes.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Loved story and  going to read all longmire books. trying to read them in order. Buying from Amazon, best prices.
B009RH9FR6|3.0|It is a cover.  Do not like the lock in system, pops out often. Do not like the way you have to turn the lock in system device around to charge the kindle.  I am hoping it wears out soon so I can purchase a different one.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have been using the wii console for netflix but the control is tricky.  So I bought the chromecast immediately after reading about it being available.  It does what it's supposed to.  I did have to do some of the steps in the set up twice, probably due to speed of the wifi connection, I'm not sure.  I was using an &#34;unsupoorted&#34; macbook, but it worked fine.  I took one star off because it seems to only work for a limited set of apps, and can only run off of chrome.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Ms. Stackhouse's goodbye seems strained, sometimes forced. She had a great run, but the last leg of her journey was the most ponderous and predictable, and the least exciting part of her story. Sure, the story wraps up conveniently. But 'conveniently' isn't a word that goes well with mysteries.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Highly addictive game with great characters. Downside is should be easier to earn tokens. And should add new levels to play.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like games like this, need more! I like all the hidden object games as well and strategy puzzles.  Hope there are more games like this in the futer.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|game wont update. wont let me play. says requires update and to restart the program. reztart...checks version. doesnt find new version. log in. tells me i cant play and must update. frequent problem.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a great game. Especially if u love finding nemo like I do. The graphics are good and its pretty to watch.
B005LAII4E|1.0|Let me start by saying I grew up with GIJOE and its always been one of my favorite stories. I really liked the first movie they did but this sequel basically took out everything that was good with the first one and left you with nothing. The killed off Duke early into it, which any true Joe fan will tell you is sacrilege, and replaced him with the Rock and Bruce Willis. That about sums up this whole movie. They took what could have been a great sequel and tried to make it into a big star movie with the Rock when the things that made it work were the unknown actors in the first one. The plot is also pretty weak in the sequel, Cobra commander is hardly even in it and they totally took out Destro. I give this one star only because you cant give it a negative score. Anyone that gives it above a 2 has no taste in movies. Trust me, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I definitely recommend this game for ALL ages! It's a very cute puzzle type of game that makes u think a little! My 7yr old daughter &amp; I love playing this! :) I also LOVE that it's FREE! I love finding games that are fun &amp; it's a BIG bonus when they are free! :) It keeps you thinking &amp; it's VERY hard to put down! ;) A def get!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book! Can not wait for the movie to come out in November of 2014! Bonn be a great movie!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game but there will be times you want to tear your hair out. If you like logic games you will enjoy this. It really makes you think.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|Yes, this is a great 2 cd set, but there are at least 20 more songs that should have been included and they would have fit on these same 2 cd's. Why not make it a 60 song set ?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app! Graphics are wonderful, and the game is easy enough for my 6 year old to play but entertaining &amp; competitive enough to hold my attention as well. Every horse lover should have this lol
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Really like the challenge it provides.  Great way to take a break yet still keep brain engaged by keeping focused to retain memory of where tiles are.
B003SI605K|5.0|I watched this amazing movie for the first time the evening my mother died. I had no idea what it was about. I cried for many reasons but its a fantastic movie.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Love the dancing, cast, music and story line.  I am so saddened over the recent events.  I think it will be really hard for all concerned.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I wanted to see this because the sequel got such a great review.  I'm far past having small children but I could watch this again and again.  Despicable 2 here I come.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|The quality of the digital image was not what I expected. The color was off, too blue, and the quality of the image was not nearly as crisp as the original slides.<br />Returned item[[ASIN:B007VDN1PA DB-Tech 35mm Film Slide and Negative Scanner - 10 Mega Pixel Film to Digital Image Converter - with 2.4-Inch LCD and TV-Out]] and will use a professional service.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Anything with Sandra Bullock cannot go wrong.  Her body just keep getting better.  The scene with the puppy, cell phone and hawk is hilarious.
B00C6BA4SE|5.0|If you love Firefly, show it by adding the Steelbook edition to your collection. It's worth it.<br />BROWNCOATS FOR LIFE!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like to play Spider Solitaire. So I got the app. Its So Fun!!! So Get The App And Play It! K? K!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I enjoy playing this game of Bing but I have yet to be able to connect to Facebook with it.  I even sent the powers that be an email about it to no avail.<br />Fix that problem and I'll give it a five star, till then I can't.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I've always WANTED to watch this show, but never did until I noticed it on Amazon Instant Video.  Rather than starting back with the Sixties' versions, I started with Season 1 of the \\"reboot\\" from 2005.  Now I'm kicking myself that I have so many seasons to catch up with -- I should have started 8 years ago.  This is a wonderful, witty and utterly charming series.  I know Christopher Eccleston was the Doctor for only one season, but I'm sorry to see him go.  But I have many more Doctors with whom to catch up.  I knew John Barrowman from a very short-lived soapy US TV series called \\"Central Park West,\\" and I've since discovered he's a great singer too.  But I'm glad to see him now as he's first introduced in Doctor Who (I'm aware of \\"Torchwood\\" but have never watched it.  So for those of you who aren't Doctor Who fans yet (and I imagine I was one of the few), this is a must-see series, and great for binge-viewing.
B005EGXTEE|3.0|The trilogy was an easy read. Fairly predictable in parts. Good escapism. Could be broken down and analysed from a societal point of view. The violence was descriptive at times and needed to be for the story.
0425238091|5.0|True then. True now...  This should be required reading for anyone working in a hospital setting. We might have developed fancier medical technology and tons of expensive medications for every perceived illness out there, but the basic premise of this book is still 100% accurate.<br /><br />Lay-people won't like or believe it, but it's the cold hard truth.<br /><br />Gomers don't die. Buff and Turf.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|This program could have gone on forever. I just love show music, and shows about shows, and talented people. The album captures all the best music of season 1.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Phenomenal show for two solid reasons.<br />1.  It reflects a healthy and encouraging view of a historically marginalized cultural group.  Minority women rarely are used in roles like the one Mrs. Torres is playing as the head on a company and as a bona fide leader in her field.  Wow what a healthy image to portray for young minority women!<br /><br />2.  Suits does an exquisite job of depicting challenges of its characters while maintaining the dignity of the person.  Its so subtlety woven into the shows especially the paralegal (name escapes me) disconnected with her father who is a hotshot lawyer coming to grips with his daughters supposed inability to handle being a lawyer approved in her fathers eyes.<br />I can appreciate the fact that the character Mike Ross having a fondness for an African American women and the writers of the show not making an issue about the inter-racial dynamic.  We come a long way America!  (still a ways to go)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Got this to entertain the kid, job well done, then I started playing and got hooked. It's a fun game.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|When I heard this program was going to be on Showtime, I marked may calendar so I would not miss it. Eagles have been my favorite since I heard \\"Take It Easy.\\" This documentary was awesome. It was honest, coming from the band members themselves. I have seen it three times now, and will watch it again and again. I also bought one for my best friend. This is the best documentary on a band I have ever seen, of course this may be because they are my favorite, but I loved it's honesty. I would recommend this to any Eagles fan.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Did you ever wish you could look over the shoulder of that leader you admire, walk in their shoes for a day?  How about being that fly on the wall during the painful discussions?  For IT engineers and leaders alike \\"The Phoenix Project\\" allows you to do just that.  In this fictionalization of a day, actually a few months, in the life of a newly appointed VP of IT Operations, Bill.  We follow Bill as he faces increasingly more challenging issues.<br /><br />Through this journey with Bill you will learn some different ways of looking at IT management that can be applied to many aspects of work and personal life.  You'll also learn about the exciting new paradigm in IT and that is the relatively new, and growing, concept of DevOps.<br /><br />As a fictionalized story you will find \\"The Phoenix Project\\" both entertaining and compelling.  You are certain to identify with one or more of the characters and you will certainly become emotionally invested in the Bill, his colleagues and his antagonists.<br /><br />This book left me wanting to keep reading at every turn of the page and continued to pull me back in until I finished it.<br /><br />I believe this book should be on every reading list, portable device and book shelf of each IT professional who wants to dramatically improve their professional and/or personal life.  Thank you Gene!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book! It was a great continuation of the first two. Can't wait for the next one to come out!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was excellent. It's one that will suck you in and you can't put it down until it's finished. Can Not wait for the movie!
B00DCX08MW|4.0|Brings back the days when I worked in the flight simulator shop during my time in the USAF . I was required to fly the simulator everyday to make sure it was ready for the days missions. Feels like I am there. Good job, graphics are great. I love it.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|One of my favorites for my children.  These are so easy for your baby to find when looking for them.  As they get older, they can hold onto them without them falling all over the place and getting dirty, and won't have to wake you up in the middle of the night if they misplace it, my babies always seemed to find it because of the stuffed animal at the end that is easy to grab.  Some of animals sit better then others - the frog, monkey, and cat have a flat stomach so they can sit flat on your infant, so keep that in mind. I have 2 of these for my second child and he's kept up with both of them.
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|First, I appreciate the dual billing of both the vocalist and a lead instrumentalist, although Paul Franklin can't be considered THE lead instrumentalist here because there's plenty of Vince Gill's guitar playing to satisfy any fan of his as \\"only\\" a guitarist.<br /><br />Second, the choice of material is really solid. Although Buck Owens and Merle Haggard have each produced a long, strong catalog of hits, picking 10 songs of theirs to craft a tribute album couldn't have been easy. But, thankfully, there's no \\"Okie from Muskogee\\" or \\"Made in Japan.\\" Just very solid country songs by two of the best of their generation.<br /><br />Third, these songs do not necessary duplicate the original arrangements or original guitar/steel guitar riffs that we've come to know over the years. And that's really good, because with musicians of the caliber of Gill, Franklin and the others on this work, there's enough great talent to go around.<br /><br />Gill remains one of the great singers in the history of country music (and probably a few other genres). With his crystal-clear tenor and remarkable skills as a guitarist, he is a legendary artist. There are few others in his league.<br /><br />Listen to \\"I Can't Be Myself\\" on this album. While Haggard's original sets the standard for raw emotion and meaning, Gill's version gives it a strong run for the money. It's just brilliant singing and interpretation of a classic country song.<br /><br />I've had the album for two hours, and already listened to it three times. I'll be listening to it many, many more times.<br /><br />I appreciate the musicianship, the selection of material, and the willingness and ability to tackle such a great project.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Bakersfield.\\"
140006922X|1.0|I have been a  scholar of Biblical history for 20 years and have written a three volume work [[ASIN:B00D6XM0AQ Bible Believer's Archaeology - Historical Evidence That Proves The Bible]] which is also available at Amazon.<br />After reading some of his excerpts from his book \\"Zealot\\", my opinion is that Reza Aslan is just another in a long list of liberal scholars that try to reinvent the Jesus of the Bible to fit his own imagination. For Example, he writes in the book: \\"Regardless, the gospels are not, nor were they ever meant to be, a historical documentation of Jesus' life. These are not eyewitness accounts of Jesus' words and deeds recorded by people who knew him. \\"<br />Yet the Bible itself states differently in the Gospel of Luke 1 verse 1-4, which says that Luke wrote an orderly account of the events of Jesus which had been delivered to him from eyewitnesses of these events. So even though Aslan claims to be a Biblical scholar, I guess he just overlooked this passage to come up with a Jesus of his own imagination. Because of this Asaln claims the virgin birth never took place and that Jesus never claimed to be God, yet a simple reading of the Bible states otherwise.
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|If you are below the age of 8 then this game is for you. I am in medical school and I totally agree, you should definitely put band-aids all over yourself when you have huge gashes all over your body. This is wonderful medicine right here lol.
B00CL66FEQ|5.0|It was as if someone filmed my life!  The film was funny, at times painful, but the love they had for each other was obvious.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This developer knows what a game on the phone should be like. Has easy controls and challenging game. The challenge isn't compounded by limitations of the device or design. The challenge is purely the object of the game. Bravo. This game is worth $2-3 not  99 cents.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Every single American should read this book, and try to understand what a true hero is. Will change the way you look at every aspect of life.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Although very predictable it is a fun ride. Good comedic stuff and enjoyed the character interaction. They obviously had a good time making this movie!
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|There are no words to truly express the tremendous impact the Backstreet Boys had on my entire childhood. Let's just say \\"super fan\\" is an understatement. I remember their sad, steady fall from the top of the charts. I remember when Kevin said goodbye. And I remember gradually listening to them less and less as a result. I will admit that although I've always been a fan, the albums they released without Kevin were not much on my radar. It just wasn't the same.<br /><br />In spite of that, the anticipation of In A World Like This piqued my interest. With their 20 year reunion and Kevin returning to the group, I was intrigued. I felt the old familiar swell of pride, the need to support them. I suppose it never really went away. It's a tough feeling to describe but this group and their music have been huge in my life. Yes, I'm married, I'm in my late 20's, a reasonably intelligent and rational human being...still completely enamored by these guys.<br /><br />Just like the old days, I purchased this album as soon as it was released, curious about what direction they'd take. This old fan is pleased. They've managed to produce music that is modern and geared toward their now-adult fans while maintaining a tinge of the late 90's/early 00's Backstreet sound we all fell in love with and grew up on. I hear it especially in songs like \\"Try,\\" \\"In a World Like This\\" and \\"Show 'Em What You're Made Of\\" which sound like they could've easily been lifted off of Black & Blue or Millennium. Yet they're somehow very current. Very nicely done. There's not a song on the new album that I don't like, with \\"One Phone Call\\" making my top pick. They've even thrown in some of those silly lyrics that make you go \\"what?!\\" a la \\"loneliness is tragical\\" (\\"Shape of My Heart\\"). They show up in \\"Trust Me\\" with the lyrics \\"making sweet sexy babies.\\" There always has to be at least one line on the album that is a bit of a lyrical flub. It wouldn't be a Backstreet Boys album without it.<br /><br />Can Ijust finish with this message for all the old naysayers? \\"I told you so.\\" Backstreet's Back. :)
B0063IH60K|3.0|it's ok, nothing special. it is better to know how to play the game BEFORE you play this downloaded version.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I can't believe what a great job they do taking older movies and making them 3D. You can't tell this was done after the fact. Looks like it was shot in 3D. Very good 3D for a great movie. Even though I've seen it a few times, it still makes me jump two or three times during the movie.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|Modern commentary on our pill popping culture with a great story with twists and turns that keep the unmediated on the edge of their seats.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I bought this app and it worked for a while...until about a month after i started using it...IT STOPPED WORKING! I tried everything to get it to work again...i deleted the app and bought it again..now it still doesn't work.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast is what I call Poor Mans AppleTV. With no Remote or UI, no extra equipment to fit you already cluttered TV station, for only $35 its definitely a product to have.<br /><br />Setup was a Jiff, super easy as long as you have laptop or android device. It currently doesn't support Iphone/ipad setup. I've 2 TVs both 2010 models and both needed external power for this dongle as HDMI prot is not good enough. Luckily they both have an extra USB port on the TV itself so I didn't had to figure how to get power source to it.<br /><br />Once plugged in and setup, get the latest Netflix app update and youtube update and latest chrome for you ipad and you are all set. Easy to use that my 3 year old kid can operate.<br /><br />The video quality is not that great as there is no video rendering capability like AppleTv does. Sometimes I saw lag in the video and it takes a while(few seconds but noticeable delay) for action you performed on your Ipad to show up on the TV.<br /><br />I like the device. It's not perfect but for the price I'm not complaining, plus I was one of the early ones to order so got my 3 months of Netflix free as well, but even without that, it's a sweet deal.<br /><br />One more thing, I want to Thank Amazon. A friend of mine ordered on Google Store 30 minutes before I did on  Amazon on Wednesday. I got mine delivered with no extra cost (of course Prime member) on Friday. He payed $5 extra for shipping, and he got notified that his will be delivered on 2nd week of August. Amazon Rocks!<br /><br />I see many application for it, best for travel. Plug it to you hotel TV and you don't have to suffer the crappy programming they have. Use it on the extra tv that you have and not pay for the additional set top box like I currently do with Comcast.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00DR0PDNE Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player]]
B00B29J0I6|4.0|This game is okay, but I almost never play it anymore because it's boring. Roby is adorable though and the game has a good plot!
B00DW39B2K|3.0|Too bad that DeNiro made this movie with Travolta posing as a Serbian with a bad accent.  Come on! Suspenseful enough with a fair amount of gore, but I was so distracted by Travolta's pathetic fake beard and accent that I couldn't concentrate on the plot line. If you can get past that distraction, you're more focused (or delusional) than I am.
1439127727|5.0|This book far exceeded my expectations.  I am loaning it to a Scottish friend and to a lawyer.  I think they will both find it very interesting.  Politics never changes!  It just happens in different ways.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great Book. Kept me on my toes the ENTIRE time. Author kept taking new twists throughout to keep me interested!!
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Metal Gear is a high-quality series - having all the games in one collection for the price of a new game is pretty awesome.
0525478817|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud one minute and sink to the bottom of heartache in the next paragraph. I usually steer away from teenage angst stories but the author pulled me in  on the first page and I never regretted a moment of it. There is so much going on in the story that provides a memorable read.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Not bad.  Sound effects are a little much and graphics can be brutal.  But sometimes the killings of the dead are kinda comical.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an addictive and super  fun game. Keeps you busy and the minions, as expected, are adorable. The graphics are also great and there are  plenty of mini missions within the game
B005SFR7YE|5.0|The minute this aired on my local Public Television Station (Channel 13 in New York), I knew I would want to own it.  It arrived in good condition.

B007R3AZNK|5.0|Bought this on a whim after seeing this guy on TV at the rock and roll hall of fame induction ceremony a few years ago.  The album is great from start to finish and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who loves blues and blues based rock and roll.

B000ID3KU6|5.0|Watch it...watch it again and then watch it with audio commentary.....<br /><br />Directors Sergio Leones Zenith!!!!!!!<br /><br />Even though it ripped off (ok borrowed from) a ton of westerns it is still being ripped off (borrowed) from today.  Get the 411 in the audio commentary.<br /><br />If you don't enjoy this you really need to go see a psychologist and have you head examined  AND Quit Watching Westerns cause as the ol beer commercial says...guys it don't get no better than this!!!

B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Movie is filled with action, thrills, and some slightly comedic scenes. I loved it!  They did a great job at collaborating all the Marvel super heros into one story. Can't wait for part 2!!
B006CHML4I|5.0|There was a time when a self winding watch movement would cost you plenty. I guess some of the really high end Swiss watches still do have them. It seems these days, the cool kids have watches that run off solar power (which is cool). Well who am I kidding here; kids today use their cell phones to keep time (assuming they do).<br /><br />Anyway for the old school watch enthusiast like myself this watch is as good as it get for under a hundred dollars.<br />The watch itself is a handsome gun metal finish that stand up to outdoor or work environments.<br />The crystal and bottom are crystal that has yet to scratch even after wearing the watch at the dog park and doing small projects around the house.<br />The bottom shows the self winding mechanism and mechanics (cool).<br />The day/date are acceptable for my mature vision.<br />The band fits my rather thick wrist 8.5 inch and is very soft nylon type material.<br />The case is a nice size as it is not too big and not too small.<br />The only down side to this watch is that it needs to be worn regularly as it is self winding. But it is really fast and easy to set the time and date.
B008D36INE|1.0|I started watching this movie because I usually like anything that Rachel Weisz is in, but it was terrible! I kept watching hoping it would get better and have some redeeming qualities, but it didn't!

B003QSMCKO|5.0|Disney movies are great for the kids, but they are also superior in their musical scores. This one does not disappoint.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film whether you're a parent looking for safe and clean movies for your kids or whether you enjoy sophisticated music.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Every episode is enjoyable.  I don't really care for Shirley Maclaine; but the rest of the cast is stellar to say the least.  The way the show progresses is excellent!
B000SVZIGC|4.0|This is a great little flick. The evil elements aren't too overbearing and the music is fantastic. I highly recommend to any who enjoy Disney classics, because though this isn't Disney, it's up to par.<br /><br />The storyline is a little vague in a few aspects (like why exactly the princess loses her memory), so if you're wont to over think things, though this is great, you may want to pass - just FYI.
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|This movie was very reasonably priced, and since it never seems to be on TV, buying the DVD is the only way to see this compelling true story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A riveting book from start to finish. I can see the star of \\"Juno\\" playing Hazel Grace. Be prepared for tears, which does not require a spoiler alert, as the book's description gives it away.
0062280228|4.0|There were numerous times I stopped reading this relatively short book, not because Gaiman's latest novel isn't any good, but rather, because he's just too good at evoking how painful and powerless childhood can be at times. It's a book about memory, and he's incredibly good at stirring up ones I only thought I remembered.<br /><br />The story is otherwise fine -- not as good as Graveyard Book or American Gods or Coraline or Neverwhere -- with great world building and evocative phrasing. But the narrator is almost a spectator in his own story, outside of a few key decisions.<br /><br />Worth reading, but only for Gaiman fans who've already ready his A-list works.
B00540G3G6|5.0|Awesome in 3d!  Loved It! This would make a great gift for anyone who enjoys the 3d special effects experience.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The author never does say nasty things about Jesus. He talks about Jesus, the historical person, not Jesus your God. There is a difference. Several well know historians of the age recorded history as it occurred so we have proof outside of the Bible that Jesus and John the Baptist, Peter, Paul and James existed.<br /><br />Its called history. This is not a religious tome.<br /><br />As history, I only disagree with a few minor things. He assumes Jesus was illiterate because most people were then, however the Bible clearly states Jesus could and did write. Since he does use the Bible, I don't know how he missed that.<br /><br />Secondly, there is no historical data anywhere that any Roman census ever forced any family to travel to the city of their origin, so the fact remains that scholars have been questioning the nativity story for centuries remains. If you wish to believe in a literal Bible, that's a real stumper and he points it out.<br /><br />Third, he discounts the slaughter of the innocents, the male children killed to eliminate Jesus in his crib. In a village the size of Bethlehem(pop.1000) we are only talking about 5 kids and for somebody as bloodthirsty as Herod, that is not worth mentioning as an activity. Its no wonder that didn't get into history, except as the Bible. Herod killed his own sons and thousands of other people. what's a few babies to a guy like him?<br /><br />Over all, its a fascinating history of a real man called Jesus and the people that knew him and knew of him. The fights between Paul and James are worth it alone, as is Paul's  claim to be the only one who is ever right(and that is in the Bible, he tells you just where to look for it).
B00915G6YE|5.0|Yes each year Dexter has newer and higher standards to follow and It never forgets that. This was a particular good year I thought.<br />I highly recommend it to anyone considering the show.<br />The fireworks In the last episode. Unforgettable.
055358894X|4.0|Scott Lynch delivers in this debut novel. Excellent story, detailed environment and the protagonists are nicely developed. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the antagonists. SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT: the bondsmagi and their apparent all powerful nature are just plain annoying and the contrast between them and Locke's cleverness is striking. Perhaps intentional, but it's boring.<br /><br />Another gripe with the book is the frequent mention of events or characters that are not discussed in the novel. Yes, I know this is going to be a series of novels, but it feels silly reading about people or events which have no meaning whatsoever.<br /><br />Overall, solid start and I am looking forward to more of Locke's adventures.
159463176X|4.0|I think Khaled Hosseini is a talented writer and story-crafter. It pains me that it has been nearly five years since his last work was published, yet I am glad that he takes the time to craft and hone his stories.<br /><br />Readers be warned-- And the Mountains Echoed is a slower-paced narrative than the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. The plot, for the most part, is confined to one main event, a brother and sister being separated during their childhood. The rest of the book is a character study of the rippling effects of this event, told through the eyes of the people directly and indirectly involved.<br /><br />Bringing characters to life is definitely Hosseini's strength. He describes characters with vivid detail-- their strengths, foibles, insecurities and aspirations. No character can be defined as good or bad, they are each inexplicably human-- complex in their history, circumstances and personal choices.<br /><br />My favourite section, by far, was the depiction of brothers Idris and Timur. I could picture the vastly different personalities of the two brothers, the undercurrent of brotherly resentment, the mingling of disappointment and relief of good intentions gone awry... Their story was both realistic and relatable.<br /><br />I did find some of the story arcs to be long-winded (I had to fight the urge to skim through them), but this did not take away from my enjoyment. If you are expecting to read another Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns, you will be disappointed. And the Mountains Echoed is a different style of story, but if you read it with an open mind, you will be pleasantly surprised.
B000063K2W|5.0|What an enjoyable film.  The fact that there are no men and that the story is about them is interesting.  It portrays all types of women from all walks of life.  The \\"adding machine\\" secretary played by Ruth Hussey; the Park Avenue socialite, who loves to create scandal played by the great Rosalind Russell.  Each actress was excellent in her role even the bit players.  I have seen this movie many times and I never get tired of it.  I recommend \\"The Women\\" to every one.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|This was the movie for movie night at my house. I must say this movie was a major disappointment to me and my husband. As I suspected my daughter enjoyed it. She was the reason for this movie anyway. The acting was very poor and Kristen playing a princess was not convincing at all. It's really hard to picture her in anything but the Twilight Saga. To me this was just ok nothing to boast about for sure. Would I watch it again? Yes being that I own the movie now. But not something I would've went to the movies to see.

0385523912|5.0|You are unlikely to read a better description of life in North Korea. An escapee reaches China and finds food in the dogs bowl and declares, even dogs eat better. Another, by then in Seoul, discovers finger nail clippers and wonders over the simplicity and the lack of them in N Korea. What you see of N Korea on TV is staged, what you don't see is hunger and despair. Nothing to Envy is party line that N Koreans are better off compared to the South and the escapees are overwhelmed by Seoul on seeing the truth.<br /><br />China is a helping ally for food and power and helps enough to prevent hordes of Koreans migrating into China, but it is a persistent threat and N Korea is aware. China is unlikely to rein in N Korea hard over anything short of war. By now N Korea's neighbors, the US and others are weary of N Korea's bluff and bluster by which they have gotten concessions and that easy way does not exist.<br /><br />An assessment elsewhere claims the N Korean soldiers are malnourished and could hardly sustain 30 days of fighting.<br />A Potemkin village

Franco seems to be stuck on himself, having a  video blog in the Special features filmed and starring him interviewing other actors and the director. All in all, it was a good addition to my BluRay collection

B002HJ9PTO|2.0|First off, the sound quality of this mic, when it works, is excellent. I am using it on my Contour camera as an external microphone to record the exhaust sounds for driving / racing videos. The battery is secured inside the spare tire well with painters tape, and wires are taped to the car to prevent excess movement.<br /><br />I ran it for a 3 day trip and on the 3rd day, the wire connecting the mic to the battery compartment broke, where the cable exited the trunk of the car (which has a rubber seal which helps absorb the impact of trunk closures). This was fixed by soldering in a new wire where the old one broke. However, the next time I took it out, the wire decided to go bad right where the joint is between the wire and the battery compartment, where I can't fix it.<br /><br />I was very disappointed that I was only able to use this mic a couple times before it broke. It wasn't exactly in a rough environment, everything was taped down to prevent movement, yet it still did not hold up.

140006922X|5.0|I truly do not understand the uproar coming from the extreme fringes of the evangelical Christians over this book! Since the 4th century, the Church has understood and professed the nature of Jesus of Nazareth as both *fully* human and *fully* divine, not either/or. The Orthodox, Catholic, Episcopal, Lutheran, and other mainline churches that still recite the Nicean Creed still hold to this teaching. This book does not disparage Jesus's divine nature by focusing on his human nature. On the contrary, a better understanding of Jesus's human nature makes it easier for me to relate to him and to strive to be one of his disciples. How else can I, a human, relate to a divine being, if he does not also contain a fully human being within himself?<br /><br />Please, people, calm down and pick up a book by one of the Church Fathers. Read something besides only what FoxNews tells you to read.

B00CDCLL1A|3.0|It was a very captivating story but the sex on full display was peripheral to the story line and reflected what we perceived as an agenda on behalf of the directors to shove those scenes in.

0307888908|5.0|You would expect the co-founder of LinkedIn to have a few insights into start-ups and a few more into how professionals launch and relaunch their careers in the internet age. This practical book gives some clear pointers for outpacing the competition even as it hots up. If you don't want to end up like the City of Detroit then this is a good place to start or re-start.<br /><br />The company director's career is a career like no other; but it is still a career. As such, it can be managed and developed. This requires both a clear understanding of your assets (hard and soft) and a network that will bring you into contexts with opportunities to apply them. For many directors the prospect of networking is daunting and it is a task that few relish. However this book recommends the high-quality / low-quantity relationship based network building that is the natural mode of choice for director-level interactions.<br /><br />The authors recommend extending a network carefully based upon trusted existing relationships and incorporating a high `fun-factor'. Although fun is an `f' word that few directors use professionally the examples of long term relationships based on shared values and interests perfectly illustrate the concepts behind building successful and enriching relationships. This is not to advocate false back-slapping bonhomie but genuine habitual reciprocation based on emotion.<br /><br />The section on cohesive yet diverse relationships is a valuable contribution to the pseudo-science of business networking. For directors, with the group-based decision-making under a joint and several liability regime, networks are not composed of the `hub and spoke' model espoused by most literature on the topic. This is a rare book which looks at the value of introductions and complex associations, advocating a far more complex pattern of engagements. I particularly loved the references to forming an `interesting people fund'. It is something directors instinctively do but never, until now, had a name for.<br /><br />Another refreshing and practical peculiarity is the head on and overt conversation about navigating status. The examples demonstrating how inappropriate assessment and management of power and status imbalances sound uncannily familiar; we have all seen and even (ouch!) done something similar at some stage in our careers.<br /><br />Each chapter culminates in challenging yet simple tasks to assist the reader in putting the ideas into practice. These make the book either a slow read - something to take one chapter per month over a seven month period - or a deliberate act of discipline that directors will return to at various points to refresh commitment to implementing actions drawn at random from the many useful suggestions.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed to find that there were fewer stories of LinkedIn in its earlier days but delighted with the wealth of anecdotes from the authors' own networks which was, for me, an unexpected bonus. The stories are mostly drawn from high technology start-up ventures and this will make the book less relevant to directors with older industry backgrounds but the application of start-up company thinking to director-level career development is a powerful organising concept and drives relevance through what might otherwise be a silicon charged text aimed at employees and entrepreneurs.<br /><br />Overall; this is a delightful and useful book which will definitely help progress a career but that requires some effort to implement.<br /><br />Available at amazon.com in both Kindle and hard copy.<br /><br /> * Julie Garland McLellan is a professional non-executive director, board and governance consultant and mentor.

B00AZMFO9U|4.0|I had to get this DVD, to see if Maggie Smith - my, and everyone elses' favorite British actress - would be her usual wonderful, witty, sarcastic self, and would sing too.  Well, she didn't sing, but she was still great.  Plenty of other actors did, and the music was really terrific.<br /><br />For those of us over 60, the theme of an old folks' (musicians') home, was a little bit disconcerting, but Dustin Hoffman directed this movie with style and fun.  And thankfully, at least to my recollection, no one died.<br /><br />Bittersweet yes, but well worth watching.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|A terrific collaboration by two wonderful authors, this book showcases Neil Gaiman's imaginative and dark storytelling with Terry Pratchett's humor.
B005544V6A|5.0|its so deceitful, full of lies, and schemes and it keeps you wondering how long before it all fall off, at the same time it has so much love and care coming from the characters, they all have a need to be there so long as everyone believes that they are not involved in each others lives you need to watch to understand. I love this show.

B006LXQID8|1.0|This may appeal to some but my 'funny bone' was not tickled. I didn't finish it which is a HUGE statement in and of itself........I ALWAYS finish what I start. I simply didn't like the type of humor in this movie. I was horrified at the manner in which she 'fit'(didn't would be more accurate) in her family and why she went along the path she did.........and that is all I can say. Not funny, not for children(and almost every parent assumes if it is animated it is a great movie for children) and never need to be watched again. I will stay open to further films and hope for an improved sense of 'being sensitive' by this author.  I never shy away from  needing to read along so I will try again with a simular type of movie......
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I have always wanted to read this book and I was not let  down at all. It is a must read.
B005544TRQ|3.0|The story line was very interesting in the first few episodes.  Then everyone started having sex with everyone else and that takes away from the story in my humble opinion.
0345479092|5.0|Great read. Very straightforward. After feeling lost, this book made me feel like I could do it. Expecting the baby in 10 weeks and of all the books Ive read this one is the one I keep going back to.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|The acting is mediocre and the two lead characters are whiny. Why do film makers think we like bratty, disrespectful teenage characters?
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Read the book in a week and thoroughly enjoyed every page.  I think the main point I got out of the book was the distance he goes to ensure the products and services that he makes are perfect.  Perfect in a sense that it's just so nice and easy to use.  Ironically, I don't own any Apple products but would frequently borrow my wife's iPod and iPad.  Now I know the journey that every of these products goes through before it reaches my hands.  I do not agree with the ways he did certain things and I appreciate the author for including those points in the book.
B003R17BV0|5.0|Shia Laboeuf did a fine acting job in the film.  If you love golf, you will love this inspiring, and entertaining story. It's a little heavy on the class warfare theme, but, I tried to ignore that.

B000QCQ8Y4|3.0|Who is killing Jack Reacher's former army comrades? That's the basis of the story. The journey into Jack's past and his army buddies who populated it is the best part of the novel. Author Lee Child is at his best when he is probing his hero's past exploits and the reunion that happens here has great promise. As usual, Jack gets to have an affair with a helper and this affair has a twist that let's us know a little bit more about Jack and his past. The action is strong although the rush to the finish doesn't quite suspend the reader's disbelief. Good for airplanes and sleepless nights.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Works fantastic and would recommend to any one who wants precise yardages.  Battery life is very good and lasts a very long time.
B001NLL8LA|3.0|This is OK Lee Child but not stand-out material. Our hero Jack Reacher is faced with a mystery which involves a senior American politician, a mysterious, beautiful woman and her older companion from ... well that is one of the mysteries Jack has to solve. It begins very well another much plainer woman on a New York subway car that Jack believes is a suicide bomber. What happens to the woman attracts the New York cops, private security, agents attached to Washington in some way and all trails lead to the politician. All of this is fine, but as the plot thickens it starts to congeal. It is as if Child hadn't solved the way out before he started writing and the conclusion leaves one big question unanswered. It's a novel that never quite lives up to the way it starts. Having said all of that, it's worth reading, even if at the end, it all feels a little unsatisfactory.
B000IZ9UEY|1.0|This movie starts off ok, but the plot is so full of holes that if you actually question it you find the entire thing ridiculous.  I am mainly speaking of the finale scene when Tommy Lee is searching for Benicio's character at the end of a supposed climactic manhunt yet somehow they both have time to stop and forge hand made tools, one chipping away an arrowhead the other managing a 1600° campfire in which to forge old steel he finds on the riverbed. He is pounding steel and forging tools and nobody can find him no see his fire...just too far fetch for me....some of the writing was really poor as well.  Too bad...the idea was a good one and the actors are great. Oh well. lesson learned
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|As good as any of the Inspector Rebus novels. Rebus, now working on contract as a civilian advisor on cold cases, goes in search of the killer of missing young women. As usual, Rebus sees what none of the other detectives working on the case can see. His deductive powers here begin to stretch into incredulity but Rebus's old-style policing, disregard for authority and general bad behaviour save the day.<br />The question is: if Rebus is an aging, unreliable drunk with suspect hygiene and at best a condescending manner, how does Ian Rankin manage to portray him as sexually desirable?

159463176X|3.0|I was excited to buy this book after reading the others by this author, and I loved how it started, but then, like others, I had trouble following the decades and the characters.  Each chapter added new characters who eventually had something to do with the story, but I tired of having to keep track of so many different ones that seemed to appear out of  nowhere.  Also, right in the middle of a chapter, when you were finally figuring out who was who, the decade changed to throw you for a loop!  I actually quit reading this book a little over half way into it, but figured I should finish it after paying for it, so I went back to it after reading another novel.  It was ok, but I will think twice before I bother with another from Husseini after this one.

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|I purchased this book after watching the terrible fox news interview.<br />To say I was disappointed by the thesis of the book is an understatement.<br />Dr. Aslan has not provided any new thought or information in his thesis.<br />He has just rehashed old wine in a new bottle.<br />I believe that the ministry of Paul has done more of a disservice to the integrity of the message of Jesus than people<br />may like to believe. Dr. Aslan has not focused enough on the other writings in ancient Christianity (for example the gospel of Thomas, Q and the Nag hamadi scripts) as I would have liked.<br />He has cherry picked over the gospels quoting lines from the different gospels to support his thesis. His entire thesis reduces Jesus to a mere zealot with messianic ideals. Even there he cautiously picks his way, not willing to state categorically what he thought those messianic ideals were. Is Jesus a mere zealot or did he have any divine beliefs which separated him from other messiahs who proliferated the region at the time.<br />The only positive thing about the book is it is a light easy read. Not what I would expect from a so called scholar of religions.<br />I have heard Dr. Aslan speak before base on which I expected much more content wise.<br />The only thesis of this book, (and a not well defended one at that) was Jesus of Nazareth was a zealot who may or may not have believed he was the messiah.<br />I want my money back:-)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Think about it. Building is fun. Battling is fun. Pocket edition has it all. Even though it's pricey, it's fun.
B001XUPF2O|5.0|My son is 8 and a huge Batman fan in every way.  He loves the movies, the Lego's, the toys--you name it, he's all about the Batman.
0399159347|5.0|I'm actually, physically, breathless. Gutted. This book was spectacular. It just came out today...seriously, I had a death grip on it all day. I have never experienced that feeling of having the floor fly away from you, the rug pulled out from under you, so many times as I did in this book. I actually dropped my iPad in my lap on two different occasions. Mind-boggling. A+, extra credit for style and voice. This book has a rotating POV, shifting between 3 women who are very tenuously tied together, and Liane Moriarty did a phenomenal job giving each woman her own voice and style. Whoa. I will be reading this one again, soon.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Super moving, well acted out, high intensity scenes delivered through great acting and beautiful cinematography.  Why are 5 more words required?
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|There are so many added games within this game you never get bored with  it.  I am addicted and can't put it down.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|Funny, touching and original!  What a great combination for family pizza/movie night.  Would recommend this without hesitation whatsoever.  You'll love it.
140006922X|5.0|What I loved about this book is the way it walked the line between narrative and historical. It was like reading a really, really interesting text book with a great story line to it.<br /><br />Having grown up in Catholic school, of course I was familiar with the story of Jesus as presented by The Bible. I also have had my suspicions that there was a lot of embellishment that happened along the way not only by the Bible's contributing authors, but also by The Catholic Church. Aside from presenting the historical evidence known of Jesus the man, what this book manages to accomplish is a thorough examination of how and why the story of Jesus got twisted and molded relative to the history and politics of the time before and after his death. What I learned was that the beginning of the Christian Church was just as frought with with infighting, politics, and special interests as The Reformation.<br /><br />Fascinating read. A real page turner!
B00CWVBTUU|4.0|After presents, cake and running around outside, this was the perfect way to end the night.  The boys got into their pajamas, passed around a bag of cheetos and watched Lego Batman.

B008PEXCBM|3.0|Eventhough you want to expose your children to the classics--the level of interest was just not enough to see it the whole way through sadly.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love the game.  it's very entertaining and my grand kids just have lots of fun as do I and my wife.  Thinking of getting another Kindle so my wife and I can play without bothering each other or the grand kids.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the other two books quite awhile ago. This was amazing. I cried and laughed. Wow us human's sure have done a lot of dumb things and the author wrote it.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|my screen goes blank for a long while and then force close notice appears,  I miss angry birds friends and for the first time I. was winning with my kids.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I enjoyed catching up with the two families however, I did not like the ending.  Is that it!  Will there be another book?
B000FC0SIM|4.0|However you feel about King, he knows how to glue you to his books,  If some of his endings have been a bit sloppy, or if some of his plots a bit thin and meandering, it's always been about the journey, and nobody writes a more enjoyable book than King.  Great characters, perfect pacing, and a fun style that draws you in, like a friend telling you a story, just as entranced in its retelling as you are in hearing it for the first time.<br />If King did not always practice what he now preaches, that's forgivable.  Any aspiring writer would be foolish not to recognize what a strong craftsman King is, and to not dig in and learn from this excellent and heartfelt book,
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Another great caper for Oslo's great, but maverick, detective, Harry Hole ... pronounced &#34;hooley&#34; ... set far from his usual haunts in Norway, in Sydney, Australia ... tracking a wily serial killer of beautiful blondes.  It was mesmerizing from beginning to its conclusion, but so are all of Jo Nesbo's &#34;Harry&#34; novels.  You'll love it, but some of Nesbo's other titles you may like even more, as they are absolutely riveting!
B0063M22QO|2.0|I certainly will not play this game in it's present form.  There does not appear to be a way to see a score.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is easily the most &#34;readable&#34; author I've even encountered.<br />He tackles tough subjects through his story lines without being preachy.<br />He educates with his extensive knowledge of history and thorough research.<br />He gives depth to his characters - though sometimes I get tired of reading about the most gifted, rich, gorgeous, desirable, powerful people.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|I bought this game for iPhone and it was superb. I played it countless times. So much fun I finished the game and started up again from the beginning. The Android version is good, but not perfect. My complaints mainly have to do with the graphics, which seem wrongly sized for the Galaxy S4 screen. Specifically, the full screen images seem stretched and faded, while other elements seem too small. Game play is about as good as the iPhone version, although the action is somewhat laggy. If you played this on an iPhone and switch to an Android phone, though, you have to get this.
0440539811|5.0|If I hadn't already read The Principia Discordia, William Burroughs, The Invisibles by Grant Morrison, & a few others I may or may not have already read now or in the past participle, I would have thrown this book down in frustration like some of the others who have reviewed this. I still remember what it was like to be aneristic, after all...
B0096PYUE2|1.0|This did not work well and was more of annoyance than a help. I did not know what it was even supposed to do. I would suggest not downloading this!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I really needed to read this book.  My min d is always working but not always in a g old way. This b ok turned me to think -- and, more importantly, to see -- in a better way.
B0067RQYNW|1.0|This product did not work well. I did not like it compatibility to Word and could not figure out how to make I function.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|In my opinion the time I have to assess the weather and prepare for the day is minimal and this application allows me to make great use of that time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest and love that I was able to use it on my tablet. It always has great ideas.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|My family has been telling me how much they enjoyed this Showtime series, and now I see why! Claire Danes is fantastic, as is Mandy Pattinkin. I love not being able to predict what will happen next. Once I started watching I couldn't stop!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I just discovered this book last night because I kept reading on Twitter about this horrible interview on Fox News with the author, Reza Aslan.  I watched the interview and it was painfully awkward to watch, the host was...I don't even have words.  I've watched the news for years and I don't know that I've seen anything like that before.  The interview is what prompted me to download a sample of the book \\"Zealot\\" onto my Kindle.  I've just started reading it and I have to admit it's great.  I've already been telling people about it. Thanks Fox News for turning me on to a great book.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Love it. Keeps my attention and couldnt put them down. i am wondering when  the next one will be out?
B003JUGQ38|5.0|When I watched Season 2, I was a little thrown at first, but then realized how amazing David Tennant was as the 10th reincarnation of The Doctor. The season as a whole was great, but David Tennant really made this character shine in this series. In this season, the companion was Donna and she was bossy and opinionated, which brought a whole new spin to The Doctor's companion and a new dynamic between the leading characters. If you love this show as much as I do, you will really enjoy this season.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|It was alot of action but overdone on the violence. Loved the costumes and cast. It is predictable as the tale goes
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I am a big temple run fan and while this game is a little fifteenth it is the same concept but with some fun twists. personally I like it quiet a bit.
B0031KE9C6|5.0|Great show.  Wonderfully smart writing and a great cast.  At first it seems like a show about high schoolers, but two episodes in you realize it's much wittier than that.<br /><br />-Amanda
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Mild thinking game. Little expensive for game I think but it passes the time. I enjoy their other games too.
0385523912|5.0|Nothing to Envy details the lives of ordinary North Koreans from Chongjin and their escape from the country following the famine of the 1990's. I went into this book not knowing much about North Korea and found it highly educational. The human rights abuses detailed Nothing to Envy were appalling and I found myself loathing the leadership in this fallen nation far more than I had before reading it. But the reason I liked the book so much was because it focused on ordinary people and their struggles to accept that nearly everything they'd ever been taught was a lie. North Korea is among the most extreme examples of totalitarianism the world has ever known, and Barbara Demick has captured the details of the nation in a unique and fascinating way.
B000FCKPHG|4.0|Dr. Dweck brings compelling evidence that how we look at life can absolutely affect how much we enjoy it and how much success we can have.  As I work on change in my life, or my students' skills, I will work on it with a growth-mindset.  This is not natural for me, but with this book as a reference I look forward to enhancing my life and my career. I would highly recommend this book for any teacher, coach, or parent. Positive change is possible!
0307951529|4.0|I breezed through this book in a few days and enjoyed Guillebeau's simple messages: You can do it, follow your passions, ignore the naysayers. I especially liked how he focused on very small businesses that were started from scratch and his continual focus on helping others. \\"Make a living by adding value to this world\\" is the main message I got from the book.<br /><br />The only problem I had with it was the lack of website links for the businesses Chris profiled. Yes, Guillebeau lists the businesses at the end of the book and I could google everyone's name, but I wanted quicker access as I was reading and the details of the businesses were fresh on my mind. I went to the book's website, 100startup.com, but didn't get any additional value beyond what was already in the book. With a bit more effort, this book could have been more interactive and earned that last star in my review.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|It actually works great with pictures that are texted to you, but it has a little bit of a problem with printing pictures in your gallery.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|A little predictable but has some great dialog and is well cast.  Does not feel to drag on like some many 2+ hour movies do.
B00BJZJXWG|5.0|Wonderful album, I love every song on it. I look forward to hearing more from this artist. I'm curious, is his voice really this soft and beautiful or if some sort of vocal filtering is being used. Doesn't really matter because this is a very soft, soothing album of love songs.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I  think  this  second  book it´s  better  than  the  first one ( almost  like fifty  shades).<br />I found  a novel  plot adn  I like it..
B001NLL93W|5.0|I love this whole series. I can't wait for this to come out as a movie. One of the best paranormal series ever.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I found this book a be rather good but at times a little hard to understand what was going on, so I had to re-read some pages.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Enjoyed the diversity of the characters, great stories and exciting to watch. I hope the producers entertain thoughts of developing a movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i think the horse is very needy. it takes a lot of time but it is very fun. i love being able to clean andntake care of the horse
B00915G6YE|5.0|It is hard to write a review of a product like this with out giving away the plot. So all that I will say is this season kept be glued to the TV until it was finished. It left me wanting more. It is a great show with amazing acting and you will find yourself rooting for Dexter all the way through.
B0035OC7OU|1.0|Usually I enjoy fantasy books but this particular book was way too all over the place. I found it really hard to follow and I am surprised I got all the way to the end. I found myself reading it and thinking about the dishes, and what I was going to cook for dinner etc
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is quite intriguing and makes you think and reason. I often play it for a bit then I have to leave it for a while. But it always keeps my interest. Good game highly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very addicting, and tons of fun! Our whole family enjoys playing Minion Rush. Works just fine on my Kindle fire, haven't had any problems at all.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|LOVE the challenge!!!! Really makes you use your brain!!!! Would definitely suggest this app for everybody that enjoys a good rack your brain challenge.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Gives you the weather, looks nice. I think this is an ok program, ok program, ok program, ok program, ok program yeah whatever.
B008KE3960|4.0|This is a great twist on the classic tower defense approach. Good graphics, UK and game play. Can't seem to put it down.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This was a great read ... Engaging and believable characters, good flow of the story. I look forward to the next books.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|Guy Clark is a rare breed -- a song writer, story teller and -- oh yeah -- he performs. life's tales told, and thankfully we have them here to listen to time and time again. This album is full of gems and it is rare to find one you can track all the way through.
B0095MVOMC|1.0|Just wasnt a game I liked the grapics and direction was good didnt like thst hsd to sighn in with facebook info
B00847KFDS|5.0|My husband absolutely loves it! He tells all of his friends about it and even plays it for them to listen.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I received Officesuite Professional 7 with my computer,  cant do much with it.  So I purchased Pro OfficeSuite Professional 7, it proformd the same way, HATE IT! A WASTE OF MONEY!
B004XMMSZG|5.0|No more need to plug in to the dock!  I often would need my iPhone 5 for something and have to interrupt music to be able search or answer a text.  With this it simply continues streaming the music regardless of where it is or how I am using the phone and it is just as easy to stream from other devices too!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I usually don't review apps but this turned out to be very simple fun. Ive already spent a couple of hours here and there on this game because it auto saves and you dont need to load the game everytine you just want to play a single level. Definitely recommend buying.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|I originally purchased one of these because it matched one of my cars...  I have used Spigens screen protectors before and have come to love them even more than the Zagg protectors I am use to using.  It offers good protection, has a hard rubber inner piece which prevents marring of my iPhone 5, and the color hard shell can be swapped out easily if you have more than one (I just purchased a second one to match yet another vehicle).  Low profile, not bulky, easy to slip in and out of a pocket...its a great little case!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|An excellent read.  I think Professor Brian Green, acclaimed physicists and author, also teaches that all matter is connected at the subatomic level in his String Theory.  OTHER WORLDS exist around us.  THERE IS AN AFTERLIFE.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|It is a fantastic movie.. a must watch for cinema lovers!!! I watched it 3 days ago and its scenes have been coming back to me since.
B009E3EY38|5.0|A Must have Period! If you love LED ZEPPELIN, Nothing more needs to be said. Just more outstanding work from the greatest rock and roll band in man's existence.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|A new puzzle idea wonderfully implemented with clean graphics and unobtrusive music and sound. Loved playing through all levels and would love more!
B004ZNARH4|5.0|Finally everything and everything about one of the greatest albums of all time is out. It has the quad mix released in the 70's which is essential for me being a devout musician and fan of this great, great group. Every instrument can be heard so clearly, and the vocals of Clare Torry's backgrounds is awesome. This is a very must for anyone who loves Pink Floyd!
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I didn't have time to watch Grey's Anatomy when the show began airing.  Now I can't wait to watch it in the evening - and without commercial breaks!!!!!!  The show is amazing!
B003B02O14|5.0|This book was great.  I read it three days.  I could not put it down.  Good book to read at the beach
B006M4F67A|4.0|This version of Mahjong is fun to play and is a good challenge as well.  I like the feature that allows you to highlight all the possible moves.  It helps on some of the larger boards.
1597801585|1.0|I'd give this book a zero if I could. The Windup Girl's interesting point is its setting, which the author describes very well, however he beats his reader over the head with repeated descriptions of his universe, case in point, his constant mentions of green methane lamps. Establishing shots are fine, but this excess just slowed down a book that barely oozes along as it is. I understand that part of the point of this novel is to show just how deplorable people really are in real life, but the author could have at least thrown us a few compelling characters. Kanya and Jaidee are the only sort-of bright spots in a blighted cast of dull and unlikable folks. The book's namesake is nothing but a walking, talking, rape fantasy. And while we're on the subject of rape, I have to ask the author why he felt it was a must to include a scene where Emiko is violated with a champagne bottle? Seriously? It was when I went online to learn more about the author that I discovered that this waste of paper had won the Hugo and the Nebula. I'm guessing that the voting panels for these award either had to pick the best of the worst in 2010 or they simply have no taste.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The iphone app has not worked in over 2 weeks. Does not update and constantly is cycling trying to get information. You would think these people would have the sense to fix their app with all the money they make off of Facebook ads
0142421715|2.0|Of the trilogy, this one is the dog. As with a lot of middle books, this one slowed down and didn't get a lot accomplished as far as truly advancing the story. It could have been condensed down into a 60 page or so Part One for book three. Really, all the that was accomplished by this book was a lot of teen angst in the desert. Dull.
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|I enjoy this game a lot ! when I  am going on a long ride or sitting in the doctor office I played this game for hours. It really made me think. sometime I get friend involved to help me solve the puzzle.
B00006NSGX|5.0|This might be my favorite live performance concerts EVER!  I am a EC fan until the end and this set of music is a fabulous combination of old blues, classic EC tunes and a few borrowed tunes as well.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|It works great! It's free! Most popular titles are available that I have searched for or downloaded. Wonderful! Nice to get something good for free
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is awesome and I really enjoy playing it. Even my mom plays with me and we love it. We have unlocked lots of stuff. Best game ever. The level is challenging but it is addictive. I am seven years old and mom is thirty and we both enjoy it equally.
B008Y73940|4.0|Not exactly an action thriller, but the movie moved fast enough and had enough twists to keep you interested. I would definitely recommend it.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I'm not a huge Country fan, but thought I'd give the Nashville CDs a try after hearing some of tunes on the show. The music is great and I love that the talented cast actually sings the songs.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I have always liked this app but for some reason they made it more complicated. It was easier originally but it is still the best app for getting a clear idea for the weather in my area.
B007T99ENE|3.0|Perhaps this rating reflects my lack of enthusiasm for this genre. I liked the cover, knew the author so thought I would give it a go. However, despite a strong start I found my enthusiasm and interest waning as the story progressed. I am sure there would be many who may enjoy this book. I was not really one of them.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a wonderful book. I would highly recommend this book the everyone. It's heartwarming and gut wrenching. I couldn't put it down.
B005LA3Z9M|4.0|An interesting story based on foster care. I liked the way the floral meanings supported the story. I also found the relationships and pertinent topics such as homelessness were handled. The story kept you guessing and interested.
B000002J0G|5.0|I won't claim to be a Testament die-hard, but the songs on LOW are great and its a wonderously produced & recorded album. Cant go wrong for metal fans.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book which kept me guessing until the end. The characters were beautifully portrayed and the story was very well constructed and suspenseful. Well worth reading.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Jax is so good looking... How could you NOT love SOA.  No really I like the motorcycle drama!  Can't wait for new season
B006M4F67A|4.0|Easy to see and clearing the board was fun. Played for about a hour and cleared five of the games
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I'm rating this with 5 star because of the unique story telling method that the author used and the level of world building was truly amazing. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the book series by Patrick Rothfuss titled &#34;Name of the Wind&#34;, it uses a similar story telling style that is very engaging.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I'm usually a pc fps player, not interested in these types of games but this one is FUN. Basically, you're a shaaaarrrrk! Have fun being the top predator.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|for the longest time I had an ipod and I loved the facebook app on it.. than I got a kindle and the app that came on the kindle sucked. then I get on the app store and I seen the real app . and now I cant even use the one that came with the kindle.
0345529057|5.0|So I got into this series by watching the first three seasons on HBO, and than heard that there were books. I read the first book so far and its an amazing series so far.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a good calculator and does everything I ask of it.  I especially like the % option which many other calculators do not have.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is fun a crazy. The minions are so funny and would like to keep this game forever.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like the features of this clock, the weather forecast is an added bonus.<br />I would have rated this 5 except for the fact that it does not go off once my kindle has been powered off.  To leave the kindle on all night just eats up the battery.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|The characters were well defined and the scenery was great.  I would recommend it to my friends and maybe even my book club
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another wonderful story and a very original approach bouncing from on  character to another, giving different perspectives of the same story, an unusual depth....
B00COQKE2M|5.0|Ronnie has always been my favorite! And this cd is kick ass! Buy it!! You'll love it! BUY IT!  That's all I have to say.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is just fun and creative i found it to be funny as well its a great game and its free so why not try it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Keeps your interest with fun puzzles and cool graphics but isn't so difficult that you get frustrated and give up.  There are different difficulty levels so you can change it to your skill level which is also nice.
B00CDY6HW6|3.0|Nice game to play on kindle. On my samsung 3 is pretty small to play on. Downloaded it for my baby cousins, they liked it.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I really liked the Jack Reacher movie, so I knew the book would be good.  The pacing is really good, plenty of action.  My wife bought me the last 2 books in the series, not realizing they were a series so I decided to start with the first book.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|If only all children's movies were so good.My 6 year old daughter loved it!<br />What a great cast,the casting director should get a medal.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Bravo, Bravo, Bravo!!!!!!  I saw this after I saw Red 2 and liked it every bit as much.  A stellar cast!  Stellar script and stellar acting.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I agree with the review by mcro. I love the suspense of the game and the surprises that pop up. I would have never expected them. This game is well worth the money that I spent for I 4th. Please make more games like this.
1442346949|5.0|A good read.  Portrays Jobs as the flawed genius he was, in my opinion. Many insights into his character I had not read before, such as his inability to furnish his home because he could not make decisions about style.  This obsession with perfection reveals itself throughout the book in his food, expectations, management skills and philosophy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids like it and I like it as we'll and even down loaded on my ipad like it like it
B0093LINVK|5.0|I think the other reviews cover this pretty well so I will not try to rehash the info.  But I thought I would comment on my experience when building a new XBMC system (right now on unbuntu minimal).  I started with a Gigabyte Brix i3 because it has USB 3.0 - which is probably the reason I had to returned it and go with the NUC.  Windows 7 on both worked fine.  But I could not for the life of me get the USB3 ports on the Gigabyte to work with LIRC and the USB MCE IR Receiver.  If you are not worried about linx then this will be a non-issue.  I tried it with Ubuntu Minimal and Full v13.04 - 12.x would not even install.  Also tried OpenELEC - same thing.  The OS did see the receiver (lsusb) and if I open the port to see the raw code it was receiving but IRW would simply not see anything. Everything else worked great.  Note that Gigabyte has USB3 drivers posted for Windows but NOT for linux - if they did or do in the future this may change.  Also note that it did work with a Streamzap ir remote but that does not support Wake on USB from sleep mode (S3).<br /><br />So I returned the Brix and went with the NUC.  Everything works as it should with all 4 of the OS's mentioned above with both remotes including Wake from sleep with the MCE remote.  I have it running on a crucial m4 msata and 8 GB of ram.  It is not noisy although you can hear the fan kick in if the room is quite.  It is a solid box (so was the Brix) with no flex.  Some differences between the two:<br /><br />- Intel has one more USB port then the Brix which I actually need so that is useful.<br /><br />- Intel has 2 HDMI while the Brix has 1 and 1 Display port - think I would rather have two HDMI ports since DP doesn't really seem to be gaining much momentum but then again its good to have the option I suppose and you could always get an adapter to go to HDMI.<br /><br />- BIOS:  No comparison, the Intel blows away the Gigabyte in terms of options and tweaks.  The Brix has very few.  True, most people will probably never need all of them but I would rather have them then not.  The Brix is newer so the may more in the near future.<br /><br />Overall, I like the little guy - really slick.  Yes, it is pricy but really that is to be expected because: 1. Its a niche market right now so they need higher margins for any kind of ROI;  2. its not easy cramming all that tech in such a small circuit board - pretty impressive actually; 3. its sooooo easy to hide this thing - definitely a cost associated with convenience.
140006922X|4.0|This book is hardly an anti-Christian polemic. In fact, what is missing from the anti-Muslim rants here and elsewhere is the fact that Dr. Aslan became a Christian at a fundamentalist day camp when he was in his mid-teens.  It was his study of the scriptures in college and afterward that led him back to his Muslim faith.  At least this is what he explained in detail on \\"All Things Considered\\" on NPR.  In some ways this book seems to be his explanation for his leaving Christianity.  So what?  What he has to say is hardly shocking to those of us, \\"Christian\\" or otherwise, who have read the New Testament with a critical eye.  He answers a number of questions I have had since I first read the Gospels and some of the Epistles as a Lenten discipline when I was a teenager; and he raises a number of interesting questions for all to consider, particularly if one cares about arriving at the truth and not at what \\"some wise man told you.\\"<br /><br />That said, I agree with other reviewers here that the lack of specific footnotes is a major disappointment.  I am also amazed that he does not cite any work by Dr. Bart Ehrman, who likewise became a fundamentalist as a teenager but who now claims to be an agnostic.  While Ehrman's view of who the \\"Son of Man\\" is meant to be differs from Aslan's and many others', and while Aslan apparantly is not bothered by the attribution of a number of books of the NT to those who clearly did not write them and Ehrman is bothered enough to have written an entire book on the topic (\\"Forged\\"), Aslan and Ehrman share a number of views and I was surprised that Ehrman was not even mentioned.  However, I do recommend the book to those with curious and inquiring minds, who are not afraid \\"to follow the truth wherever it may lead....\\"  (T. Jefferson).
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was a definite challenge. Some floors were really trying, especially the last floor. Would recommend the game to my friends.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|We were going to see the sequel but hadn't seen the first one yet.  Our son said we wouldn't be able to follow the second one without seeing the first.  We had no idea what the movie is about--only the actors/actresses who are in it.  This movie was very funny and made us laugh out loud.  We highly recommend seeing this movie!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Great acting. The best mob movie I've seen. Not for kids under 14 years of age due to language and violence.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I was waiting in Houston to catch a plane to Germany when I struck up a conversation with a pleasant gal across the way. We chatted, and she ended up recommending this book to me. What the heck, I figured; I downloaded it on my iPhone Kindle app, and took off for Frankfurt.<br /><br />I was finished with the book by the time I landed. Couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Growing up in the 80's and 90's, reading cyber-punk novels (Neuromancer, amongst others)and playing these games, this book really brought back fond memories, while at the same time transporting them into a gritty future. I loved almost every age.<br /><br />Easy, fun, irreverent read. If you're looking to kill some time and have an an enjoyable time doing it, I would highly recommend picking this book up, especially if you grew up hooked on the Atari 2600 and subsequent gaming machines.<br /><br />Pulitzer prize? No. Lots of fun? Absolutely.

B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this series!  The play between the characters and the amazing production details create an immersive experience.  Love it!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This review was originally posted on my blog [...]<br /><br />I received a copy of this book free of charge from the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />This was my first time reading Liane Moriarty but I'll be looking up some of her other novels now that I finished The Husband's Secret.<br /><br />THE HUSBAND'S SECRET primarily focuses on the lives of three women. We start with Cecelia juggling the busy schedule of her three school age daughters and activities at their school (St. Angela's), while also running a successful Tupperware business, and who is married to John-Paul. Cecelia's youngest daughter is a typically inquisitive child bouncing from one obsession to the next, currently obsessing over the Berlin Wall. This obsession prompts Cecelia to dig out her own little piece of the wall. But she discovers a letter addressed \\"For my wife, Cecelia Fitzpatrick To be opened only in the event of my death\\". But now Cecelia has found this letter she just has to know what it says. And when she finally finds out it will change all of their lives forever!<br /><br />Moving over to Tess and her son Liam...Tess is running a business with her husband Will and cousin Felicity from her basement. Generally going about her own business under the presumption that live is just great, Tess's world is thrown upside down when Felicity and Will tell her they have fallen in love. With a need to get out of the house, Tess leaves Sydney with Liam to visit with her mother in Melbourne. Up on arriving in Melbourne, Tess enrolls Liam for a term at her old school - St. Angela's.<br /><br />Finally there is Rachel, part-time school secretary at St. Angela's, widowed and facing the prospect that her son Rob, his wife Lauren, and Rachel's only grandson are moving to New York City. The anniversary of the murder of Rachel's daughter is coming up in just a couple of days. A murder which is still unsolved after all these years, and Rachel has always had a suspect in mind.<br /><br />So hopefully you will have noticed that St. Angela's school links these three women together? What follows is the days running up to the anniversary and a few after. The lives of all three women are turned upside down, inside out and back to front, and it can all be linked to the contents of John-Paul's letter.<br /><br />There's a small prologue to the story which include's the words:<br /><br />Oh, Pandora. Where's your willpower? You were told not to open that box, you snoopy girl, you typical woman with your insatiable curiosity; now look what you've gone and done.<br /><br />This is true for Cecelia...if only she hadn't opened John Paul's letter.<br /><br />I read THE HUSBAND'S SECRET in a little over four days (three actually since one day in the middle I didn't read a single word!) and it I was hooked from the very start. I would highly recommend this book and if you chose to read it I don't think you'll be disappointed.  It will have you turning the pages eagerly until the very last word. It left me contemplating guilt, remorse and betrayal. And ultimately forgiveness.n mind.<br /><br />So hopefully you will have noticed that St. Angela's school links these three women together?

140006922X|5.0|I bought this book because I admire this author. The way he handled the Fox interview, he showed himself to be a very patient, articulate, and intelligent  in a world of ignorance.<br /><br />This book is well written and very informative; written by a respectable person, scholar, etc...<br /><br />I was raised Catholic, but I converted to non-denominational Christian after college, but I still respect my Catholic upbringing as well as the large portion of my family who remain Catholic. My wife was raised Mormon, we have friends who are Buddhist and Muslim as well as atheist, but we live in Hawaii where many cultures daily interact. It amazes me how prejudice many people (not all) from the mainland USA tend to appear.
B000TU16GS|5.0|The Alex Rider adventure books are great and are perfect for kid`s who like books with action and adventure. I would recommend this book to kids who like the James Bond movies. I totally loved this book and it doesn't matter how old you are because you`'ll enjoy it.

B00005O3VC|5.0|If you know anything about Monty Python and you like british humor, this movie is a MUST see. Funniest python movie ever in my opinion. The stupidness will keep you laughing the whole movie.
145162607X|3.0|Anne starts off as her own in this story; troubles with her father's ambition, her sisterly rivalry, being married to a man that she does not love, and wanting to be with the man she does love. However, her story goes from lightheartedness to down right ugly. This story has too much witchcraft, sorcery, poison, and murder to keep track of anything. Anne becomes (later on in the book) so much obsessed by Elizabeth ( the queen) that it made me wonder if the story was at all about Anne and her path to being Queen of England. Page after page, chapter after chapter, is all about Elizabeth and her ability to curse anyone that crosses her path. Anne becomes obsessed with it that it takes away from her own story. I have read at least one book about Anne, and I will say that that book is much better than this one. The things that Philippa writes about makes this story unbelievable at all. From a scale of 10 I would give this book a four. I was not impressed with Anne's obsession with Elizabeth, and I was not impressed with all the witchy stuff that was going on. I mean, not one woman can do all the things that Anne said the queen was doing. The only character I liked in this story was Richard. He is loyal to his brother, the king, but on the other hand he is very deceiving. I mean, he is willing to make his niece look like a whore to so that she can't marry Henry Tudor. Now, I can see a storyline being built up around Richard and Elizabeth (his very own niece) as lovers. Sick and twisted as it sounds, but it leaves out the witchcraft. So will be selling this book on Amazon I feel that Philippa may have rushed through this book because of the high demand of the series. She should take her take on the next one.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|i wasn't expecting to like this, at first i thought it was a movie for the kids but i gave it a try and it was great! good cast and the smurfs are sweet!
073934272X|5.0|A lot of actual useful full information for a doomsday scenario<br />and if any Zombies do Attack I know how to open a cam of whoop Ass
0451209338|5.0|Fascinating reading and I would recommend anyone interested in this series, to start with book. You learn about art and Italy and the Vatican.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Definitely watch this one! It's perfect! The casting, the action, the romance! I definitely recommend this movie! You'll love it!
B00CATSONE|4.0|I found a deeper understanding about the man.I think he gave us the foundation for all invention and modern electricity.
B0085OELXK|4.0|Strong performances all round. And if I couldn't decide who to root for: that's part of the mystery of this movie.
B00BESJYAY|3.0|I like how they depicted the mentoring relationship - at best, mentoring is imperfect. That said, the 'people of the sea' element was too out there for my liking. I also didn't appreciate how they made the real life character a hero for taking unnecessary risks  - come on! He left a wife behind! That is stupidity not heroism.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I saw the special from Portifino , ( still trying to find the DVD ) the man is the greatest , have all his DVD's but this one and most of his CD's ,I understand very little Italian but you feel his compassion with every word. This was one of his best<br /><br />Jay Bucher
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|A bit cheesy at times, acting not the best, but as a sci-fi enthusiast I loved the special effects and imaginary world they presented. The story moved a bit fast, the kissing was cheesy and the surprise pregnancy was a reach. The could have made the romance less kissy and have them get married before the pregnancy.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|This star studded sound track is so good.  Great for parties to leave on in the background.  I would buy it again.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This was as good as I expected it to be - clever story line, interesting characters, etc. The monkey is a fun character. I enjoyed the twist at the end.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Constant reminder of such a great story. I love the details in her garment, her mocking jay pin and her bow & arrow set. There could have been more detail in the shoes and hair... none the less a great deal for the price. (originally $30)
B0086DBE62|3.0|The dwarves are the best part of this movie. The story line seems to move to fast and the production doesn't seem to match the quality of the opening title and ending title shots.
B005721W9O|5.0|This is one of those movies you just need to watch over and over again (not in a row, mind you).  If you even know the least bit about Star Trek the humor just doesn't stop coming.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The first time I got this app it was so fun I definitely get even sleep it was that fun I definitely do
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Just what I would expect from a couple Britts.  These guys showing up on Top Gear reminded me I wanted to get this movie.  I expected dumb, fast-paced humor and was very pleasantly surprised when the story, special effects, and humor were all much higher quality.  I laughed my butt off -- I'm still looking for it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I have read this book a few times to analyze the dates that serve as the Chapter Titles and enjoy it more and more. Great read. I had to go buy it at 945pm because I finished #2 at 9 and was dying to keep on reading - Life Before My Kindle. #noereader=pain
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Since the beginning got my attention, the Gods are represented well. I read the book and comparing with the movie, there are parts that weren't showed but overall the movie was showing the main parts of the book.<br />Almost at the end there is one part that freezes but it is not a big deal.<br />I like the action I saw and I recommend this movie, I can't wait to see the other movie of this series coming out.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Really good movie! The only thing I didn't like was that Freddie Stroma had a small part! Watch you will like it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I went through this season like wild fire!  Such interesting character development.  Looking forward to next season.  Yes Yes Yes
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|The graphics are awesome but the plot is retarded and the acting is stupid.  It's like someone was trying to polish a turd.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|Get. All my children ranging from seven to one year of age enjoy this game. I play it as well and it isn't too hard or too easy. I like that the graphics are great and that I do not have to worry about having to buy anything. Game companies are getting greedy in my opinion. I do highly recommend this game for any
B00425S1H8|5.0|This worked great right out of the box. I did not even have to get any additional drivers for it, everything automatically installed.
B00BFGT888|5.0|this really was a pioneering series.  If you have fond memories of this series, take a look again.  So many shows owe their quirkiness to Twin Peaks.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the book before watching the movie.  This was very well written, and certainly engaging.  The story pulled me in and it was hard to put the book down.  Love the book - reading Catching Fire now.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I was a little leery of this purchase, as I needed it for my iPhone 5 and other devices, and upon reading other reviews, a few people said that this did not fit their iPhone 5 charger. Hmm, I am still scratching my head at those reviews because it fits my iPhone 5 charger perfectly. To be clear, I can fit my iPhone 5 and iPad w/ Retina Display chargers into the Apple port. I was also able to fit my 4 other USB chargers into the Android side (Including Jawbone, Nikon camera, Sony camera & Blackberry tablet chargers) I am 110% happy with this purchase, really pleased with the dual ports. It got this for an upcoming car trip and it fits the bill. Not that it really matters, but it also looks sleek! On a side note - I am technologically challenged, so those looking for a review on the charging specs, I cannot offer that. Thank you for offering a superb product!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book on a difficult subject for many people - that of whether or not to continue living after a terrible accident leaves you unable to do anything for yourself.  The story is peopled with very believable and human characters who handled the situation in  very realistic ways.  It was beautifully written and I highly recommend it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you love minions, you'll love this game.  It is a very fun and you can do a lot without using real money.
B005544TRQ|5.0|the show is witty, and extremely funny. you connect with every character. Amazon just needs to hurry up and get season 2.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great ! MTG on the Android.  I wish it to match!<br />Now I can play in my lovely game anywhere )
B00C7GZ19U|3.0|Not Carla Bruni's best. I was hoping for something better, but then again, I bought it by accident. Overall, ok listen.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a perfectly amazing book. I loved the dialogue and the chemistry that the characters shared.  It was sad without being too sad. Such a wonderful read, even for an adult (like me!)
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|I have read each and every book in the series. Some have been a hit, some a miss, this one though was worth the wait and worth the wait.<br />I enjoyed the unfolding of the story and the fact that Kaleb remained true to who he was.<br /><br />Ms Singh has impressed with with her ability to weave the arch of the story in 11 books without getting lost and giving us &#34;are you serious&#34; moments like some series authors i have dumped along the way.<br /><br />I look foward to the next installment.
0452295548|5.0|< 4.5 stars ><br /><br />Except for a single quibble, I liked a lot about this book. The author's personal account of her stroke and its aftermath is fascinating, and she presents the neurology of the brain in terms that are easy to understand. I also enjoyed her extensive explanation of the actions and thoughts controlled by each hemisphere of the brain--especially interesting were the spiritual feelings of expansiveness and oneness that come from the right hemisphere.<br /><br />As a practical book, this could be very helpful for patients in recovery after a stroke and for their family, friends, and caregivers. The author has some tips in the appendices (ten assessment questions and \\"Forty Things I Needed the Most\\") and some of the chapters include specifics about her recovery methods. (The colorful brain on the book cover is a stained glass project that she completed during her period of recovery.)<br /><br />In addition, this memoir has some good insights for healthy people, including dealing with emotions and and living in the moment. Those issues may sound cliche, but the book addresses them in a fresh and sensible manner and within a context of appreciation for our brain and other body systems that we often take for granted.<br /><br />My only quibble with the book is a specific editing issue which initially made me suspicious of the book's credibility (which is justifiably a pretty big concern in a nonfiction work). The author explains what sort of abilities are lost in a left hemisphere stroke, including linear thinking (what comes first, second, third, etc.) and other forms of rational thought. She then gives a very detailed account of the thoughts, feelings, and actions that she experienced while the stroke was occurring. Since the stroke was in her left hemisphere, she was in reality losing all the parts of her mind that would have allowed her to remember the events. The reader finds out about 3/4 of the way through the book that Jill Bolte Taylor workedwith a therapist a few years after the stroke to recall exactly what had happened on that fateful morning. This important information on how she retrieved those memories would have been most helpful as a preface to her account.<br /><br />Although the experience of a stroke could be a depressing topic, the book is largely positive and forward-thinking. Due to her own experiences as both a neuroanatomist and stroke survivor, Jill Bolte Taylor is understandably a strong advocate for compassionate care in stroke recovery and a staunch believer in the ability of the brain to heal, given the proper care. She also has a commendable outlook on life and a desire to have her experience be a help to others.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I rate this game a five star because it's just like your in the movie and game and it fun to play over and over
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Never disappointed by Quentin Tarrantino.  Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz and Kerry Washington were just icing on the cake.  Awesome movie.
B004V9MU86|5.0|I don't think I've ever read a book where each sentence seems to be so well thought of and deep. There were times when I would be transported to that time and place as the writers descriptions were so vivid and mesmerizing.<br />I've read many books about or based on WW2, but never from this perspective.<br />A book I will remember forever.<br />Marvelous!
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|No fun at all. I deleted it almost as soon as I downloaded it. Don't purchase this. It's a waste. You have to have the app open for it to work, so once you set an alarm you can't do anything else with your kindle.

B0036BK6MW|3.0|The material is so great but it didn't need to have those silly scenes with the little brother teaching Michael how to play football.  Disappointed after hearing Mrs. Tuohy speak and reading about the story.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good game if you want to pass time and there's a multiplayer but I don't reccomend thst unless you are a skilled player because the online players are tryhards.
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|A splash of noir and a pile of tech all draped into a character that dies in the first few minutes. This isnt a spoiler but the premise... backing up the brain and moving into a new body is part and parcel of this world.  It is a great companion to the tech extension we see in Neuromancer or Snowcrash.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Kik is my default app but I haven't received the new update yet and as soon as it updates it will be even better!
B001LM1456|5.0|The origin of the character is understated, and that works out better than spending the first 40 minutes on it.  I actually liked this story better than the Avengers.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is the best game I have played in a long time. It's user friendly. Very colorful. A little challenging to move up a level, but not impossible. It does require some brain activity. I love that little white ball.

B005LAIISU|5.0|Saw this at my in-laws house because it happened to be on TV. I couldn't stop laughing the whole time. Very cute and funny! Just when you think these animated movies couldn't get any better, this movie comes out! Great for the whole family!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun to work on, even though it can take awhile to update your town. The beginning of the game is productive, but it does slow down after level 30. I would recommend this game to others.

B00CEZJT2E|5.0|BEFORE YOU READ, check out my unboxing/review of this product on YouTube: [...]<br /><br />I am a Power User for Anker so I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest.<br /><br />This is a lovely external battery that features a 6000mAh capacity, a built in micro USB charging cord, a second USB charging port (for devices that don't use the micro standard), 4 LED indicators to see how much life you still have in your device, a USB to micro USB cord (but in my opinion it is way to short and you can see it in the video I posted) and enough power for about three extra charges.<br /><br />I tried using this battery on all my devices that use a wall charger. I tested it using an iPhone 4, Samsung Galaxy s3, and a Nikon Coolpix s9200. Unfortunately when i was trying to charge my camera, it did not have enough power to charge it. I knew this was true because when i had plugged it into the wall at home, it charged up fine. It gladly charged up my other two phones.<br /><br />Tests:<br />I was able to charge the iPhone 4 from 10% to 100% in about 4 hours. When it was done it had the last two LED's lit.<br />Then, I charged my s3 from 27% to 100% which took about two and a half hours. It had only one lit LED when it was finished charging.<br />My last test was the s3 again, and it charged from 47% to 85%, which took an hour, but died before it could get to 100%.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Very slick, thin, design<br />Built in charging cord<br />LED indicators showing how much \\"juice\\" you have left<br />Dual USB charging<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The included USB cord, in my opinion, is extremely short<br />Couldn't charge my s9200 Coolpix camera<br /><br />This battery is great for those who need an extra charge throughout their day. It fits nicely in a pants pocket or you can just through it in your briefcase or backpack to school or work. I just think that a 6000mAh battery should be able to hold a little bit more charge than about less than 4 phone charges, but its great for an emergency charge.<br /><br />If you are in need of a reasonably priced external battery, then this is the one for you.<br /><br />Thank you Anker for sending this product out to me.of a reasonably priced external battery, then this is the one for you.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I can edit the alarm easily while lying in bed. I can set multiple alarms and control recurrence. Oh yeah, it's free.<br /><br />I love that the alarm doesn't just blare out but starts quietly, then increases in volume. It is much easier on the psyche than being jarred violently from a deep sleep. The tone is not overly piercing, but does eventually get loud enough to permeate my entire house.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone. The free add-ins are excellent also.

140006922X|5.0|Seeing the exorbitant amount of trolling Dr. Aslan is getting, I went ahead and purchased  both the text and the audio versions of this book to see what the fuss is about. I will be honest with you: right now I'm on page 93. That means this is not a holistic review, but at least I've seen something beyond the image on the cover and Lauren Green's blatantly ignorant questions.<br /><br />Here are a couple of textual fragments that called my attention. The page numbers come from my iBooks version, so page numbers may be different:<br /><br />\\"Meanwhile, in triumphant Rome, a short while after the Temple of the Lord had been desecrated, the Jewish nation scattered to the winds, and the religion made a pariah, tradition says a Jew named John Mark took up his quill and composed the first words to the first gospel written about the messiah known as Jesus of Nazareth--not in Hebrew, the language of God, nor in Aramaic, the language of Jesus, but in Greek, the language of the heathens. The language of the impure. The language of the victors.<br />This is the beginning of the good news of Jesus the Christ.\\" (92)<br /><br />This does not sound biased. It is factual, to the full extent that academia can prove.<br /><br />[Regarding the sacrificial rites at the Temple during the time of Christ]<br />\\"This is as close as you will ever be to the presence of God. The stink of carnage is impossible to ignore. It clings to the skin, the hair, becoming a noisome burden you will not soon shake off. The priests burn incense to ward off the fetor and disease, but the mixture of myrrh and cinnamon, saffron and frankincense cannot mask the insufferable stench of slaughter. Still, it is important to stay where you are and witness your sacrifice take place in the next courtyard, the Court of Priests. Entry into this court is permitted solely to the priests and Temple officials, for this is where the Temple's altar stands: a four-horned pedestal made of bronze and wood--five cubits long, five cubits wide--belching thick black clouds of smoke into the air.\\" (29)<br /><br />While the sensory image is grotesque, this is part of what used to take place in religious rites back then. It has nothing to do with Jesus, just the time He lived in. I have to admit this is pretty darn good writing. While reading the paragraph above, I was immediately transported there and could smell the burning incense trying to cover up the smell of flesh of sacrificed animals. The fact that he also has a MFA from The Iowa Writers' Workshop helps tremendously with the style and aesthetics of the text. The penmanship alone makes it a good purchase. I am actually enjoying reading this book.<br /><br />I am looking forward to finish this book, and this is what I can humbly share with you thus far. Once I complete my reading, I will give you a more critical response to the text itself.<br /><br />[Side note not related to the text] My parents and I are Persian, like Aslan, but we are not Muslims. We are Baha'is, and we respect all religions. Baha'is have been (and are currently being)  persecuted and killed by Muslims in Iran, but that does not make every Muslim an evil, murderous tyrant. Consequently, I don't see every Christian as an ignorant bigot because of a few Bible thumpers who come here to give a one star review to a book they've never read. Religion in itself is a good thing, but some followers give their religion a bad reputation. Religions teach peace, love, unity, etc. One admission I have to make about my own bias is that I am very sympathetic towards Jesus because of the message of of love and tolerance He brought and the cruel punishment He received at the hands of ignorant people. As a Baha'i, I also love Christ and accept Him to be the Son of God.e cubits wide--belching thick black clouds of smoke into the air.\\" (29)<br /><br />While the sensory image is grotesque, this is part of what used to take place in religious rites back then.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|I'd gotten tired of every Beatles album out there, through overplaying and also the many mediocre aspects of the Beatles songwriting, song choices, 60s production etc.<br /><br />Take Abbey Road, the B-side is still pretty interesting, but the A side is tough to get through. Even songs like Come Together, Something and Here Comes the Sun on Side B are a chore to enjoy anymore. The simple melodies got old, and all you have are bare sounding vocals and a few instruments to create a real thin sound. There's nothing more to look forward to musically like you had in Moody Blues and Pink Floyd albums then.<br /><br />The original Let it Be was ridiculous beyond belief. Only the geeks would enjoy ad libs and studio banter after hearing it 2 or more times. This is meant to be music, not novelty items. An album starting off with Two of Us?? Followed by Dig a Pony? I never felt like listening to that crap. And I can't believe some defend the horrible Spector orchestra on Winding Road. Talk about having no feel to match the song.<br /><br />Like I said about Two of us, the tracklist order change was badly needed and this rectifies it brilliantly - no complaints. Now I can finally enjoy For you Blue and One after 909, I got a Feeling, it sounds right the way it is here. And cleaning up of studio talk and removal of Maggie and Dig it; replacing it with Don't let me down. Now I can even enjoy THAT tired old song! This has become my most and perhaps only really listenable Beatles album. I wish they could use this treatment for a new White Album, and perhaps others as well. New tracklists (Adding Strawberry Fields to Sgt. Pepper and taking out one or two like Good Morning, Kite), better production. The Beatles had too many throw away duds which took away from the serious (Winding Road) and rocking (Get Back). To hell with the Holy Grail mentality, a lot of things can be improved about the older stuff and as with Naked, it's not too late to do it.

Once you start watching, you can't stop.  The dry British humor is hilarious, the characters are well developed, and the plot keeps you up late watching &#34;just one more.&#34;  I highly recommend this show & series.

B002GHHHKG|5.0|the story behind this movie was awesome...the angels were interesting...and the fact that one went beyond his purpose and fell in love with a human...to sacrifice all that he had (Life eternity) and gave into his unknown emotions...than to lose everything after his love was taken away by a tragedy...there should be a sequesl to this...I was left hanging...wondering if she would come back for him
0345529057|2.0|Just wanted to add to the chorus -- my Feast for Crows is missing over 100 pages! Unbelievable. I didn't want to bother with refunds, so I just got the book from the public library (very inconvenient -- I had to drive 1/2 an hour). I bought the books because they were all checked out at the library, but what a nuisance to be reading along and find that the next couple of chapters were missing!<br /><br />Of course, the books are terrific and addictive (hence my running out to the library just to read those 100+ pages), but I'll be careful about buying online in the future.
B00000ICD9|5.0|this movie was so real...it was like reliving so many emotions and dreams that ever person on earth probably wonder about...the actors and actresses were excellent...it amazed me how even after death they were still connected and his love for her made him cross over bounderies that normally would have been impossible,

B00A4VGUIG|4.0|This game is pretty good, amazing graphics I must say. The only thing I would improve on is being able to do multiple tasks per day instead of just doing one or two. For those of you having issues on Day 3 where you need to give Eddie the bucket, you don't really give it to him, but tap on the arrow to keep going. I to was confused so I contacted support and they told me the following; \\"When you've talked to Eddie you'll notice that there is a little arrow in the dialogue box. That arrow is blinking. Once you tap on that arrow you activate the next available action or dialogue. In this case: The possibility to get fish from Eddie.You'll need to tap on that arrow in the dialogue boxes again, while the game progresses.\\" Overall this is a pretty good game, even better if there was more to do on it.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Love it!!! Did not know what to expect from this game. If you like challenges this is the app for you. 44 is the goal!

B0091REZMW|5.0|Good but sometimes shuts itself down at random times. I also think it wold be better if these games asked for the money up front since they seem to be getting a bit money hungry
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I am really amazed at how much longer my battery lasts since I dumped this app. I was losing lots of battery power on a kindle that is only 6 months old.

B005LJITS0|4.0|Some didn't like it but I thought it was just fine.  Ryan Reynolds is growing on me as an actor.  A little off from the DC Comics Universe but you can only do so much in two hours.  BUMMED to learn of the longer version.  THAT should have been on the big screens, movie MIGHT have done much better.  Don't want to buy it but AM waiting to rent it for $1.99 on Amazon like I did the shorter version as soon as it came out.  Hope they protect their original investment by doing a sequel.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|Much better than I thought it would be and very close to the book.  Makes me wish there would be a sequal.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Watched EVERY episode of Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis (not so much Stargate Universe, but most of them).  Good stuff.  I remember not unlike the death of Elvis or JFK where I was and what I was doing when I learned SG1 was being cancelled after 200 episodes (in a beach front cabin near Deep Brook, Nova Scotia, Canada, watching SG1 on their version of a Sci Fi Channel).  Was similar to the death of an &#34;old friend&#34;.
0812982622|5.0|The material could have been used to wear down the reader with its abject bleakness and horror, but instead Johnson crafted a narrative that becomes increasingly humane even as its world grows more violent, arbitrary and absurd. No less, he managed to do this in a way that feels natural, almost necessary, to the story. As satisfying as it is devastating, The Orphan Master's Son is a fascinating book that I did not want to put down.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I personally did not care for Season Two and was unsure how this season would go. It vastly exceeded my expectations, and might be the best season yet! It continued with ongoing plot lines, yet did not extend them too long and wrapped them up in a timely fashion. I highly recommend it!
B000QZTNQ6|5.0|One of my favorite bands.  Nice mix of rock and gentle music.  Not a lot to say, listen to the samples.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|An innovative way for social media and music to merge in harmony!!! Plus, you can play rare to find tracks!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Totally enjoyed each character.  It was written in such a way that reminded me, sadly, of the ugliness of man to man during that period.  Well written.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so much fun hours of non stop entertainment. fun to challenge the kids and play against them. recommend highly. buy it!!
B009XIXVU6|2.0|After the Kite Runner I thought Hosseini would be one of my favorite writers.  His second book left me flat, and this one was hard to follow so many characters that never really came together.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great capabilities. Very easy to unstall and use.<br /><br />My Samsung Galaxy S2 could drive my 55\\" TV from more than 50 feet away.  But anyone with chrome cast  can take the TV over.  It's like someone else having a second remote for your TV and changing the channel without your approval.  If it had a password protected login, it would be perfect.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I love any books with history in them and this had just the right mix of paranormal/history and love. I cannot wait for the 3rd book! Reminds me of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series...another favorite
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|If I've learned anything from my studies it is that you should never take someone else's word on a topic; you need to read it for yourself. In light of the controversial interview involving Dr. Reza Aslan's new book Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth, I decided that I would examine the book myself.<br />I tried to approach the book as dispassionately as possible knowing beforehand that I would probably not agree with a lot of his conclusions. I was more interested, however, in how he got to those conclusions and whether his method was tenable or not. The more that I read the more frustrated I got, with a number of things I will discuss below. I finished the Introduction and the First Chapter and I read through all of the Notes and Bibliography in the back. Once I finished those sections I couldn't read anymore - I didn't want to waste my time and you'll see why.<br />First - One of the most disappointing things about the book is the way that Aslan uses sources. His immediate position is that the NT documents are not accurate because they are \\"faith-based\\" and therefore unreliable. He says, \\"Regardless, the gospels are not, nor were they ever meant to be, a historical documentation of Jesus' life. These are not eyewitness accounts of Jesus' words and deeds recorded by people who knew him. They are testimonies of faith composed by communities of faith and written many years after the events they describe. Simply put, the gospels tell us about Jesus the Christ, not Jesus the man.\\" His position is an old one, that the New Testament record of Jesus is based on kerygma and not history. In this he has completely ignored the work of a number of scholars including Richard Bauckham, Richard Burridge, and N. T. Wright (whose works have also been left from the bibliography and notes). Considering these three names alone are huge influential voices in historical Jesus studies it is amazing that they didn't even warrant a place in the bibliography to indicate inclusion/discussion. Anyways, back to the sources. So Aslan disregards the New Testament evidence for the reasons above but then every other non-faith-based source that he encounters (from Josephus to the Letter of Aristeas to the Gnostic Gospels) he simply treats them if they have no bias at all. He says, \\"If we expose the claims of the gospels to the heat of historical analysis, we can purge the scriptures of their literary and theological flourishes and forge a far more accurate picture of the Jesus of history.\\" This reiterates my previous post (here) discussing how in the minds of many scholars like Aslan, faith contaminates scholarship (thus why he is so sensitive about Lauren Green mentioning his Islamic background). But, again, this idea of a \\"bias-less\\" perspective is completely impossible which leads me to the second point...<br />Second - Aslan seriously glazes over the diversity in scholarship. He says, \\"For every well-attested, heavily researched, and eminently authoritative argument made about the historical Jesus, there is an equally well-attested, equally researched, and equally authoritative argument opposing it.\\" What a massive overstatement and generalisation. Exampled further by what he says later on, \\"The very brief outline of Jesus' life and ministry presented at the end of the introduction to this book represents the view of the vast majority of scholars about what can be said with confidence about the historical Jesus.\\" Who is this vast majority of scholars that he is talking about? I would sure like to meet them and read their work. Because as far as most of us know there is no such vast majority. His statement here: \\"Long gone are the heady days of 'the quest for the historical Jesus,' when scholars confidently proclaimed that modern scientific tools and historical research would allow us to uncover Jesus' true identity,\\" really just shows how Bultmannian he is in his thinking and how he is so blithely unaware of the so-called \\"Third Quest\\" of thehistorical Jesus. Of course that term is ambiguous and is not fully descriptive of where historical Jesus studies are heading today, but important findings and conclusions from the \\"Third Quest\\" are important for any study proposing to be a \\"life and times of Jesus of Nazareth.\\"<br />Third - Reza is seriously ignorant (or purposefully selective) of recent scholarship. Just taking a look at the journals that he was using a majority of them (an actual majority not an `Aslan' majority) were from before the 1980s. This makes sense considering most of his suspicion of the New Testament historical texts come from the pre 80s Bultmannian tradition. However, even outside the articles that he uses, he lacks a number of serious works on historical Jesus research including The Historical Jesus: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies, Craig Evans' 4 volume mammoth work. If Aslan's book were being assessed at an undergraduate level he would have been criticized for not engaging with many of the important works from the past 20 years<br />Fourth - The justification of his conclusions are underwhelming and overstated. Aslan states early on in the book, \\"I have exhaustively detailed my research, wherever possible, provided the arguments of those who disagree with my interpretation in the lengthy notes section at the end of this book.\\" This is hyperbole bordering deception. His \\"exhaustive\\" research misses so many key works in historical Jesus scholarship (as noted above). Additionally, he says that his points will be justified in the notes, but when you go to the notes there is little to no decent justification. Furthermore, even in some of the notes there is an absence of justification whatsoever. For example he says, \\"Josephus, who was writing his history of the war for the very man who won it, presents Titus as trying desperately to restrain his men from killing wantonly and in particular from destroying the Temple. This is obviously nonsense. It is merely Josephus pandering tohis Roman audience. Josephus also sets the number of Jews who died in Jerusalem at one million. This is clearly an exaggeration.\\" Both statements \\"This is obviously nonsense\\" and \\"this is clearly an exaggeration\\" are left unqualified.<br />I could not get all the way through this book because the historical methodology used by Aslan is so antiquated (and frankly) naïve, that it is a wonder that his conclusions have cohesion. Poor historical method, poor research methodology and scope, and incredulous overgeneralisations and assumptions. It is right that on FOXNews he claimed that he has a \\"PhD in the history of religions\\" because it is clear from this monograph (if you want to call it so) that he neither has a PhD in history nor in religion.<br />Post Script - Shame on Random House for posting this pseudo-academic work.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I got this book as The Hunger Games was the most reviewed book on amazon.com. There was a lot of praise about the book and it had won many awards, so naturally I was curious to read it. The story is about a post-apocalyptic US which is now known as Panem comprising of 12 districts. Every year teenagers (one boy and one girl) aged 12-18 are taken from each district in a forced reality show where they have to fight each other like gladiators to the death. 24 teenagers compete in the game and there is only one winner. The story is told through the voice of Katniss Everdeen who takes her sister's place.<br /><br />The story is very well constructed, and the feel for the arena is very vivid, as everyone struggles to keep their wits and survive. Most chapters end with a twist and force you read the next one. Collins is really good at keep you hanging around. The book is paced very well, and its a real page-turner.<br /><br />I read somewhere that Collins had problems writing about the deaths of the characters. This is one of the things that works against her as far as plot goes. Also, I didn't like the gruesome way the last death happens. Maybe its just me.<br /><br />But overall, its a good read to while away your time. Read the book description, and then decide if you want to read it.
044024367X|1.0|Nothing to Lose takes place in a desert town called Despair and Hope.  Jack Reacher has been booted out of Despair but stubbornly walks back and takes on a company town owned and controlled by an Apocalyptic charasmatic cult leader, who is also the mayor of Despair.  Jack Reacher does what he does best, which is hurt people, but the Despair PD continually try to boot him out.  What are they hiding?  Depleted uranium.  The cult leader is using it to make a huge dirty bomb, but Jack does what he does best and the threat is eliminated after 500 some pages.  I don't recommend Nothing to Lose.  I am a fan of Jack Reacher and this author, but I think this one is best left on the store's bookshelf.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|I do not feel the need to add more than all the other great reviews of this album. Just wanted to give another 5 stars to it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Book was amazing.. One of the best books I have read so far this year! Very interesting..Thought it was written well..
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Reza Aslan is a lively writer... but he just isn't the historian he pretends to be.<br /><br />The book is a fun/intriguing read, and is unique among biographies in that it relies to a great extent on Dr Aslan's imaginative reconstructions of what he believes probably happened in the life of the historical Jesus.  This style also undermines the book severely from a scholarly standpoint.  It reads more like a work of historical fiction than a biography... which is exactly the problem.<br /><br />Aslan accepts only two \\"hard facts\\" about Jesus: That he was A.) a Jew who led a movement in 1st-Century Palestine, and that B.) he was crucified.  However, he still manages to cherry-pick any items from the Gospels that support his thesis, while ignoring or casting doubt whenever Gospel accounts contest his claims.  These same propositions can be found in numerous other *scholarly* books on the same subject. If Aslan had just gone ahead and written a work of historical fiction (which he basically did), it would be a commendably interesting read.<br /><br />As it stands, this book reads more like a new collection of old conspiracy theories, complete with a tinfoil hat.
1401233066|4.0|This wasn't my favorite story from the Fables collection, but it was pretty good. I don't know if it's the villain that turned me off, or some of the side stories. Still a great story.

B00CZAYNOC|4.0|Heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch really set the bar high after their last release, American Capitalist, which was likely their best and most mature record thus far. But after this release, they only set the bar even higher, likely topping all of their past albums with a very solid output here. Although it was nowhere near perfect and may take a couple listens, it will grow on you and will make you really appreciate the unique and special sound that they have created. It features the classic vocals from Ivan Moody, who really seems to have some negative emotions throughout this album. But this is a good thing, as he channels these emotions to create some great music.<br /><br />The album starts out with a very good track called \\"Lift Me Up,\\" which actually features metal god Rob Halford of Judas Priest. Halford definitely adds to this song, providing a very different change in vocals from Moody's low screams. It sounds just like a song that could appear on any of their past two albums, but seems to be a step up in some way that can't be explained. The next song, \\"Watch you Bleed,\\" starts out very uncharacteristically with soft vocals and an acoustic guitar, but soon turns into a classic, pummeling FFDP song. The chorus has a wonderful hook and is possibly the best one on the album. \\"You\\" is a very heavy song that features verses that are almost rapped they're sung so fast. I like when they do that, like they did on their last album with \\"The Pride.\\"<br /><br />This album isn't 100% heavy though; it features a couple of their usual slow, emotional songs that appeal to a greater range of listeners. While I didn't care for the ones they've done in the past other than \\"Walk Away,\\" \\"Wrong Side of Heaven\\" is actually pretty good. \\"Burn MF\\" is probably the angriest song on the album, and that should be apparent by both the title and the chorus, which is kind of repetitive, but still packs a big punch (no pun intended). It's also by far the most explicit song on thealbum, so stay away if you can't handle bad language. I.M.Sin is just a classic FFDP song, featuring very heavy riffs and Moody's screaming verses and sung choruses, which has another very good hook.<br /><br />\\"Dot Your Eyes\\" is another really solid, heavy song from the band that will not disappoint the long-time fan. Overall, I like the lyrics in this song, even though the part with the title isn't the greatest lyric. \\"M.I.N.E (End This Way)\\" is another slow song that has very slow guitar riffs and has a lot of pathos, making it a very relatable song. The rest of the album is just okay and not that memorable, but the diehard fans will likely appreciate it.<br /><br />While I thought American Capitalist was good, it was inconsistent and only had half an album with the rest being filler in my opinion. This album has no filler at all, with every song having a purpose. That is, except tracks 12-14, which are all the same songs as previous songs on the album, except it features another singer to create a duo with Moody. Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed really adds to \\"Dot Your Eyes,\\" but there's really no need to have three sets of doubles on one album...those should be the bonus tracks instead of being included on the actual album. Whatever though, it's not that big of a deal.<br /><br />Overall though, I can definitely say this is their best album. It doesn't blow anything they've previously done out of the water, but it's just another great album that makes improvements on the last one and is more consistently good. There is quite a lot of bad language in this album, especially the F bomb, which means he's definitely not moving away from his cursing. He might almost rely on it too much, but at times it brings another level to the emotion. Overall, I highly recommend this album to any fans of the band. You'll like it.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Karl Urban is amazing as Judge Dredd and Director Pete Travis did amazing job tell the story of a day in the life of Dredd. I hope they make a sequel or even a trilogy.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|Although the movie is okay I don't think it is worth spending more than a few bucks to watch  I'm glad I didn't go see it at the box office or I would have been very displeased. I personally think that advertising that Morgan Freeman as a co-star was very misleading. He was in all of about 3-4 scenes and they were relatively limited. I don't know the two girls' names who were co-stars, but they both had far more scene time than Morgan did. As usual he did - as usual - do a fine job.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is pretty fun. It has plenty of different activities in it so there's plenty  for you to do.

B00CWV8TIU|2.0|Very slow and there was no big surprise ending.  Figured it out in the middle.  I can see why Steven Soderbergh has decided to stop  making theatrical releases.  His movies are generally slow moving and uninspired.  The last good movie he made was Traffic.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Mr Brooks had an interesting concept but I don't feel he carried it out. I found the narration disjointed. I was not able to easily follow the story line. He kept jumping around and I had a hard time following it. I hope the movie was better.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|What a good book!  Mr. Follett has started another great series, the same calibre as Pillars of the Earth series.  Getting ready to read the second in the series, and will be looking for the last to be published.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I'm eternally grateful to Fox for tipping me off regarding this book.<br /><br />Aslan does an excellent job of historical reconstructing Jesus' times and the century immediately following his death, showing how a Jewish revolutionary became transformed into a savior for all mankind. He wisely avoids the predictable historical traps (\\"Did Jesus actually perform miracles?\\"; \\"Who cares?\\" answers Aslan. \\"Everyone at the time THOUGHT he did and he was only one of a number of miracle workers active in the region. What impressed his contemporaries more is that he performed his miracles for free\\"), concentrating on the crucial part of the Jesus story: his execution as an insurrectionist.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for anyone to read with the possible exception of those who feel their interpretation of the Bible needs must be absolutely true and literal.<br /><br />Athiests will find a fascinating discussion of the political and religious milieu that gave birth to Christianity. Christians who are secure in their faith (and who don't need every word in the Bible to be the literal truth) will be moved by the story of the plucky, illiterate Jewish day laborer who took on the world's most powerful empire. Members of other religions will be fascinated by the tale of how Christian truths have changed and evolved over the millenia.<br /><br />Aslan has written a book that only someone who has engaged with Christianity as he has could write (converts to evangelicalism, earns multiple degrees studying the historical Christ, returns to his fathers' Muslim faith, ultimately sees God as an eternal and omnipresent force motivating people of all faiths). It is no wonder this book so annoys rabidly nativist Americans. It's not Aslan's interpretation that bothers them, but the fact that a man who they don't see as a \\"real American\\" can read Biblical history and come to his own conclusions and do so brilliantly.<br /><br />The Tea Party crowd ultimately believes that their understanding of Jesus (whatever that is this week) is not only the only possible one, but is the sacred property of \\"true Americans\\" like themselves.<br /><br />Being that I'm also an immigrant, I applaud Aslan for writing a work that is, ultimately, very deeply American: a scholarly and personal interpetation of Jesus' story. Aslan has truly subverted the prejudices he encountered as a young Iranian immigrant in the most incisive manner possible, by writing a paean to the freedom of conscience that was once the cornerstone of American thought.<br /><br />(One of the reasons I'm giving this book a five star review is because Faux has turned this whole thing into an \\"up or down\\" sort of vote. The other reason, however, is that it truly deserves 5 stars.)

B0054SMIH6|5.0|This is such an amazing movie, with phenomenal music and great plot. This is a must see film if you love those hustling and gangster movies done with a touch of class.
B000005Z0G|5.0|This album title alone made me get it and once listened to I thought he named it for me. 2Pac flow was so raw and real the struggle the determination to uplift a culture. Strong topics and that hip-hop feel is what you get from this album not that commercial DEATH ROW PAC. This is that hunger from a starving artist \\"holla if you hear me\\".
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This overviews everything you need to do to get your book on Kindle Store. Well worth reading before you start writing.
B00CLVEPFC|3.0|Loved the plot and acting but could do without the foul language.  I would have let my kids watch it if they didnt say the F word every 5 minutes.
0425263924|5.0|I was completely enthralled by all three of the Crossfire novels.  Sylvia Day is exceptional in knowing how to hold a reader's interest.  Gideon's and Eva's love, passion, past sexual abuse, sex addiction to each other, etc. was addictive reading.  Since Entwined with You came out several months after the first two in the series, I am in the process of reading Bared to You and Reflected to You for the second time.  Can't wait for the next one as Ms Day indicated at the end of Entwined with You that Gideon's and Eva's love story has not ended.
B00CEJ2H6K|3.0|This album missed the mark with me. It seems very uninspired and watered down. The 4 bonus songs are just dumb to me. Yeah they tried something different, blah blah. This just showed me they should stick with what they know. The death metal part of playing viking death metal is just gone. Some parts bordered on power metal. The die hards are problably not going to like this review but I am not about kissing a bands butt. Sorry but this to me is there worst disc yet.
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|I was awaiting the release of this CD for a while now. This is not my first Marc Anthony CD and now I am sure it will not be my last. I like all types of music and on the MA CDs I do have, I enjoyed the few salsa selections I had but I would not consider myself a salsa fan. Until now... There is something just really great and comfortable about this CD. It is accessible even to the salsa novice and I really enjoy it. I think you would too.
B00CZAYL76|4.0|Just listened to 5FDP's new album and I can say I am impressed!  I love the lyrics and the music is pretty good.  Up until you get to Mama Said Knock You Out.  Now, I am not a rap fan AT ALL!  So maybe that part of me is being too judging.  My husband says he misses their sound from their first album and I you can def hear a difference.  But their attitude still shows!  They don't show so much of a softer side until the last song.  some songs do slow down then they get really angry and loud.  The first play through kind of makes you think \\"what the heck?\\" at first, but again I like the lyrics more than anything!  I like their extras too! (if you get the deluxe edition)  I have seen these guys live twice and met them both times and its great to hear their concert set as well as the kick ass drum solo they had done!  It takes me back to my first metal concert ever!  Haha!<br /><br />Bottom line is, their sound isn't the same as their first album, I don't know why they have a rap song or a part rap song on this album, but all in all a good album!  Lyrics are angry and get to the point.  especially Burn MF.  Ivan doesn't hold back!!!!  He sounds tough, but he is an awesome guy!  They all are!!!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|What a great series, many of the characters make you 'hate' them but the story line is excellent, I would highly recommend to all zombie flick lovers!!
B00003CXA6|5.0|On the 150th commemoration of the battle at Gettysburg--this is the perfect film to watch.<br />What an amazing portrayal of the times and the soldiers!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I love Lez Miz......love it. I have seen it on stage 7 times. I read the Victor Hugo novel (huge and haunting). I have viewed it as dramatic film 3 times (well actually there are two of the film versions that I have in my video collection and watch whenever I catch them on cable). I also have the musical on video in the form of the 25th Anniversary Concert and the Dream Cast in Concert. It has four of my all time favorite &#34;show tunes&#34;: Look Down, At the End of the Day, Do You Hear the People Sing, A Heart Full of Love. AND the line in the finale speaks to the deep truth in this fine play:  &#34;To love another person is to see the face of God.&#34;<br /><br />I enjoyed this 2012 treatment of the musical. It is gorgeous- France takes center stage; although the actual sites are almost entirely English. The orchestras (four of them) pull out all the stops. The acting is top drawer. BUT, the singing is not as gloriously elevating, or deeply heartrending, or gut split funny as it was on stage. Why? Well....Hugh Jackman as a fine cabaret voice; Russell Crowe is one of my favorite actors and he does a good Rex Harrison talking-song; Anne Hathaway has a good voice better at sounding hurt than outraged; and the rest of the cast is much the same. This could have been a disaster but the directors decision to mic the actors as they did each scene and to record their live singing rather than going to the studio works because it is the drama that carries the singing and not the other way around.<br /><br />I own the DVD because it is an essential part of my Les Miserables collection, just not the best part even though it made nearly $450 million dollars. WoW!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Before watching, I knew of this series by name, but nothing of the context. I am came across this little diamond in the rough and fell in love with it. The writing is great and the personas are even better! The next rainy weekend, I suggest a healthy binge watch of a season or more. Plenty of helpings of action, drama, and trauma!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Captain America was crafted in 1941 as a comic book hero drafted to fight in WW II. For nearly all of the character's publication history, Captain America has been the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young man who was enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum, in order to aid the United States government's efforts to win World War II. Captain America wears a costume that bears an American flag motif, and is armed with an indestructible, boomerang-like shield that can both be thrown as a weapon, and defend against others' weapons.<br /><br />Unlike the comic book, the transformation of Chris Evans into Captain America is complete. He is never Private Rogers after that and this is where the film takes a risk but it pays off. In the film the chemical transformation is very risky and death defying. Evans is convincing. The rest of the ensemble is convincing. The WWII environment is convincing.<br /><br />I saw it twice in the theaters and purchased the DVD because it will be on my regulars list.  Rotten Tomatoes summarized the reviews in this way: &#34;With plenty of pulpy action, a pleasantly retro vibe, and a handful of fine performances, Captain America is solidly old-fashioned blockbuster entertainment.&#34; Yep.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered this Chromecast the day it came out and it has worked beautifully for the week I have had it. The Netflix and Youtube integraation is awesome and my family loves using eachof their phones to add youtube videos to the queue whioch then play directly on the chromecast.

B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Having been a fan since 1995, I have EVERY BSB album ever made. Longtime fan of Never Gone, I never thought it would be replaced; but I was wrong. Never Gone has been dethroned, I LOVE THIS NEW ALBUM! It's a mixture of OLD and NEW Backstreet Boys. If you really like Brian's voice, he isn't on the album much to be honest. But the other guys sound amazing! Kevin has some leads as well for the first time since Backstreets Back! Simply put. ALL Backstreet fans should give this album a chance! Don't be surprised if it becomes your new fav!
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Terrific movie!  Saw it originally at the theater and knew it was one we'd enjoying seeing again and sharing and passing along to the rest of my family to see.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I love this movie so much. I watch it on the IPAD and tv. NICE JOB!!! Laughing out loud  :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is important to note that this doesn't have the kind of depth of features of something like a Google TV or Apple TV device. However, for the price tag ($35 when I purchased it), it's a very impressive product that performs extremely well.<br /><br />Setup was impressively easy. Even as a computer programmer, I was mystified how it auto-detected the Chromecast at first without Bluetooth or the device being connected to the internet, but I have since learned that it (semi-obviously in retrospect) uses an ad hoc WiFi connection to do so. Regardless, it makes the setup process incredibly painless.<br /><br />Currently, the device can have a \\"native\\" cast from an app setup to use the Chromecast SDK or a \\"tab\\" cast from a Chrome tab. I ordered mine on release day, and when it arrived, the only non-Google app to support native casting is Netflix, however, many developers have already publicly expressed that they are looking into implementing the SDK, so I'm sure the comparative lack of apps capable of native casting will be a very short term issue.<br /><br />Tab casting, on the other hand, just mirrors a Chrome tab exactly on the Chromecast in real time. I have heard that people with slower computers have had issues with video playback, but I had no issues whatsoever myself tab casting a 1080p video on a Core i7-equipped computer. Watched all of Ocean's Thirteen that way without any stuttering or hanging at all.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I am 100% sure that my TV has HDMI 1.4, and yet I cannot get it to power the Chromecast without the bundled power adapter. Apparently many others have had this issue. However, the power cable is not that inconvenient and can even be plugged into a USB port on your TV if it has one available to avoid having to take up precious plug space.<br /><br />All in all, for the price tag, however, I am very impressed with the device, and it's a great way to add powerful functionality easily, cheaply, and quickly to any HDMI-equipped screen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just as good as the movie.  Loved both!  The book is hard to put down!  Even though I knew what to expect, it was still suspenseful!

B00BWJ91XK|4.0|A little disappointing after the greatest movie trilogy ever, The Lord Of The Rings. But The Hobbit is still a good movie.
B00005NKK8|3.0|I wanted this for the songs in the movie.  When there are extras, l don't like that, only because we may not like them.<br />This soundtrack has some songs in it that were NOT in the movie.  I was disappointed only with that.  The show is great and<br />the songs from the show are to.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|A little hard to get used to the letter and telegram format.  Seemed like the book finished up at the drop of a hat.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I realize after reading two of Kate Morton's books now that I love her storytelling and her writing.  I really couldn't wait to get back to this book.  It does get slightly confusing because there are so many characters from the past to keep straight but that was a minor distraction.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I have never read a Malcolm Gladwell book and I didn't know what to expect. This book was very easy to get into, and to me it was a quick read that held my attention the whole time.<br /><br />This was a book that could have gone heavy on the statistical side, but all the information was presented in a manner that will keep you turning the pages.  I like to read books about successful people and what it took for them to make. I find those books inspirational, but they can also be redundant. They all say that it took hard work, a high IQ, and a lot of sacrifice. Well, Gladwell agrees that it does take those things, but he proves that you also need to be in the right place at the right time and finding out when and where you needed to be is what makes this book shine.  Great job by the author and I would highly recommend this book.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just writing a quick note to say that the Chromecast works very well with the Spotify Web Player. I use my Xbox 360 for most of my web streaming (Netflix, Hulu), but had no way to play Google Music or Spotify wirelessly through my sound system. Casting the web player tab in a browser works flawlessly - no stutter, great audio quality. Also, setup was incredibly easy. I do hope Spotify integrates native functionality into their app, but for now, casting the tab is a great solution.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I am a financial planner and this book really hits home on so many levels. It tells you the mindset that successful people have vs those who are unsuccessful. Everything that you do in life is dictated by your mindset and this book explains the differences in the minds of the rich and poor. I didn't feel like it was a sales book for Eker, I just thought it was very interesting.

B009OYSFDM|5.0|As a comic book lover from back in the 40's it brings the thrill of the super hero into the 21st century and beyond.

I can hardly wait for season 2 to start!  Great show!

0446563048|5.0|Really fun book about a great company.  A great role-model for other corporations.  A great reminder to focus on the customer and treat your employees with excellence.
B00338QENI|5.0|Wonderfully informative and well written.  I had a hard time putting it down. The author's research and style is very impressive.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is great, its always got multiple missions so you dont get bored its got great graphics its very nice and everyone I know that has played it loves it! All in all I highly recommend it!
B00CATSONE|2.0|Tesla is a very interesting person, but this is not the book to communicate much about that. It strikes me as a confused motivational book based on glib references to Tesla's life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it's a great game!!!!!!!!I just started my horse is very good.its a little weird that there are unicorns! ?
B000HAB4KS|3.0|This is a very fun little movie. Even after almost 15 years, the fight scenes still hold up pretty well. This movie is also incredibly stupid. The plot no longer seems relevant, there are a ton of plot holes, and this movie stars Keanu Reeves. All the other actors are pretty good, and the agents are a highlight. I think it's worth watching, but I wouldn't buy it. I rented and I'm glad I did. Sometimes all you need is a stupidly fun movie.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I'm a big fan of author James Lee Burke.  This is an excellent film adaptation of a very fine book.  Enjoyed it very much.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|got this game as faotd- most levels fairly easy but some are challenging- played through all in about an hour and wish there were more
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I had the other app ff on my Kindle, but it has glitches, won't advance. This app is faster, isn't messing up, shows things in a full screen and Works. Thumbs up! My security app gives it a red light, however. Not sure if it's just the risk of being on facebook. But the other program actually seems riskier the way it looks and works.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Love this series and always look forward to the show each week and if I am bored I pull out one of the series and put it on....
B008NW67E0|5.0|I ordered Babel and Sigh No More at the same time.  Love their sound.  Had never been a fan of Blue Grass until I heard them.  Great Band!!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|L:ove this show and wish it was still on.  was a great story and Loved the the cast  they were so funny in there parts.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I had never heard of them until we saw them perform with Emmy Lou Harris on Palladia.  Have never cared much for Blue Grass type music.  But, they are new, with a new sound.  I love watching them playing because it looks like they are enjoying the music as much as the audience.  Love Mumford's voice, the banjo, the piano, all of it.  Great music!!!!!!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Incredible story  Exquisite filmmaking. Ir's a wow! OMG kind of experience. I've re-watched it 4 times (already). Love. Love. Love.
B003L16FAE|5.0|I've been looking forward to watch this film on Blu Ray after having a cheap copy for many years. It doesn't disappoint, such a great film. So many classic lines!
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|This is my favorite album of the year (so far).<br />Just like always, their songs are full of sass and I love it! I love it more than Riot!
B00506NRBS|5.0|There is few books that have essence of the true entrepreneur spirit and philosophy. This one have it. There are many counterintuitive lessons in it. I will read it another time. Is it that good.
B006ZS7ZLS|4.0|It's a very good album from Lana Del Rey.<br />There is not a song on it that I don't like.<br />I don't know who to compare her to, because I can think of any similar artists<br />My favorite songs are Blue Jeans, Dark Paradise, and Million Dollar Man.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Being a horse lover myself,  This Game lets fantasies of owning your own horse come true.Great Game,  Never Slow or Blurry. I could play this game all day long!!! Anyone who loves horse should get this app. Best of all,  its free!!!  :3. #head.over.heals.in .love
B0080CKGZE|1.0|I was expecting so much with this film, but it was disappointing.  A young man seduces women to gain wealth and status.  It's predictable and slow.  Some of the actors mumble, making it difficult to follow what little plot there is.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|From being a fan of the Despicable Me Movies Myself I thinks the creaters of this game showed the funny side of the yellow Minions .<br />By enhancing  them in this game with Vector,Meena and other villains as well as Gru and the Three girls .
140525355X|5.0|It&#34;s a gift for a Baby Shower!The Mom to be asked for them, I hope she loves them!<br />Shipping came in a timely manner
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I have been looking for this collection for awhile.  I didn't want to pay too much for it,also.  I was very pleased with the fast service, price and quality
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|I agree with the other readers that bemoaned the fact that the editing was poor, character development was lacking along with other disappointing aspects of this book.  Why is the writer giving us Francs for currency when the Euro has been in France since 99/2000?  Descriptions are verbose and repetitive at the same time.  We want something better, n'est-ce pas?
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This is a great album by one of the greatest artists in country music history.  I'm a huge Merle and Buck fan, and also a huge fan of Vince.  I think he does a great job on these tunes.  His delivery on these songs are pure Vince.  I'm sure singing these popular songs, it's hard to not sound a little like the original artists that you've heard do them for decades, but Vince does a great job on them.  The musicians are excellent, and it's great to hear COUNTRY music again.  I would recommend this to any fan of COUNTRY music, and would also recommend fans of today's cookie cutter packaged country music! Take a listen to what REAL country songs should sound like.  Meaningful lyrics, backed by solid musicianship... not overbearing rock/pop music backed by sing songy corny words that rhyme!  Let's get back to what country music should sound like people!<br /><br />Great Job Vince and Paul!
0440241901|5.0|great book.. i really love all her stuff.. its such a fun story line ..great book to reas tanning by the pool
B00E25RD68|5.0|Unless you abhor violence, you should check this movie out.  If you are normally distracted by subtitles, the story, pacing and action scenes will outweigh that minor issue by far.  You'll be left with mouth hanging open and wondering why they haven't remade an english-speaking version yet - which Spike Lee has and will be releasing toward the end of the year.  But don't wait, regardless of how his version plays out, you will want to see the original!
0060763280|4.0|got this book for my mom and she really did enjoy it ..its full of little hints and tid bits of info..fun read!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Reading for the second time, following an audio version, I still find pieces missed that enhance every part of the story. Thank you, Mr. Brown,<br /><br />C. Rosynek, 32, F&AM of PA.
B005PK1G76|5.0|this is such a great product for the price.. its easy to manage and attach to the stroller ..it really fits well and is very handy..thanks!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Weather channel recently changed their app.  It is okay, but I miss the older version which was a little easier to navigate.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is so good! I love it! its realistic and doesn't make you buy a bunch of stuff to be able to play the game! I want to hug the creator;)
B003G4W49C|5.0|Just read it. You'll like it and buy another one in the series. There are many to choose from and they are all great too. Enough said.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|Fab book, loved that it only really focused in kings landing! But missed some of the other characters. Can't wait to read te 5th book!!
B004SIP6A4|1.0|I received the disc and did not bother opening it due to work that was being done in our home. When I finally got around to view the disc it was the 24th of July. The disc would not load. I cleaned the disc thinking this may clear it up, without success. I ran the &#34;properties&#34; on the computer to see if it was alright and was surprised to discover that Amazon.com peddles blank disc to rip off customers. With the narrow return policy I will be forced to purchase a &#34;real&#34; copy of Chicago from a reliable/source that I will be able to trust.<br /><br />D. Budaj
1592332803|5.0|I bought this as a gift since I already have this book and absolutely LOVE it!  I love spreading the 'joy of vegan baking'!!
B002X6PTH8|3.0|This is a great movie, but it took some of the fun out of it paying $10 to buy it!! Either way, my kids love watching this silly Jim Carrey movie over and over!
B000ID37RM|5.0|This is an eye opener to how things were in the South back in the day. Gregory Peck was outstanding in his portrayal of his character. Brings to mind just how far we've come and just how much further we need to go.
B001NHNG64|5.0|... is one of the best series ever written. I am reading them all again and remembering why I have been a fan of Childs since the first. Simply one of the best.
0670014893|2.0|Not my usual type of book but it was a free reads book, and they ask if you can write a review of it so that the giveaways can continue.<br /><br />That being said I found it to be a very confusing book as you had to really follow along closly so that you wouldn't miss anything and so I found that it isn't a book or authour I would read again unless I get it as a free read<br />flag
B008XNZMOU|5.0|First off, the new album contains a lot of pop influences (\\"I Knew You Were Trouble,\\" \\"22\\").  The opening track, \\"State of Grace,\\" actually is more of a rock song.  That being said, there are still many country pieces that are as strong as ever.  The tone ranges from the bubbly \\"Stay Stay Stay\\" to the somber \\"Sad Beautiful Tragic.\\"  Also worth noting is the duet \\"The Last Time\\" with Snow Patrol's frontman.  Lovers of both the country and pop Taylor will love this album.  In my opinion, it's her best yet with \\"Fearless\\" coming in second.
193700788X|5.0|Started reading it after Amazon was able to send it out the day before it was released so I got it on the 7th & was able to start reading it right away.<br /><br />Great thing about having Vertigo for 2 weeks is the only thing I was really able to do was read as everything else made my head spin.<br /><br />Ended up eating a late supper (11pm) as I had to wait to eat after have to endure 2 car rides to get the the afterhours clinic and home again. So I read till I was feeling better and then I just couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />Am sad to see the series end but what an ending it was
B001UV4XUG|5.0|Watched this movie once on cable, and immediately had to own it. Good explanation of unrequited love, many often face.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|A book well written but the notes should be tied to the text by footnotes. This would have made his conclusions more or less credible. As it is written verification is tedious at best.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I love the game because it's not bad I like batman even  I love the dark knight rises<br /> Even if it's hard to beet
B00DHNJGCU|5.0|Because we Loved the movie and had a great time watching it i love amazon movies because i can watch them when i like
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is so awesome really fun and don't have to pay. A great game for everyone. I love twilight sparkle.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This was a fantastic movie! I just wish they would continue on with the other great stories in this classic series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Please keep this game coming with updates with New stuff,I play the he'll out of this game, minions are super cool, Great game!!!!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I'm a huge superman fan and I can say this is my favorite take on superman ever. I enjoy the Christopher reeves movies as well as smallville and the Lois and Clark show but this movie is what comes to mind when I think of superman. Its well acted, the special effects are top notch and the story is solid.
B000GKW4HG|5.0|He wants to study more about dinosaurs and really thinks it looks like the real thing.  He thinks it is great.
006226303X|3.0|The Story was well read and at some point along the way captured me.  Early on I was tempted to jump ship.  Biggest problem I had with audio version was in knowing that it was time to change the disc.  Always listen my car;  no prompt (soft music, something- indicating time to go to next disc).  VERY disconcerting.
B0036MDNN0|5.0|My son thinks it looks like the real thing.  He loves it.  He has built a shelf to put it on.  He doesn't want to scratch it.
B004OZOTSQ|1.0|This  I am so confused that I do not know how to go forward. They try to explain<br />and do not succeed in the process.If it isx so confusing to so many people as in<br />the folks that have remarked they should start over in the process of it.
B00D611UMM|5.0|Cannot say enough about this wonderful album. Have had it on constant repeat in my car since I bought it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|DA is one of my favorite new shows and I absolutely loved Season 3! Full of twists and turns and unexpected plots. I can't wait for Season 4. :)
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I read Richard Ford's book, Canada, as I have been following his career since the 1970s, when I met him at the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, where he was a workshop giver--I studied with Toni Morrison--so didn't take a workshop from him. I remember him and his wife sitting in front of me one evening, at one of the readings. He certainly wouldn't remember me. \\"Canada\\" is, to me, so far, his best novel. I am always interested in his narrative style, with long paragraphs, no action, much rumination, little dialogue, and the first person narrator discoursing on every little detail of every little and big scene. One could almost use the word \\"turgid,\\" to describe his prose. But the locations and detailed descriptions are also cumulative, and the reader finds herself skipping less, pushing the turn the page swipe on her Kindle less. I think I gleaned the essence even while scanning quickly about two out of three paragraphs--.  The details of Great Falls, the details of going over the border, the details of the landscape and life in a small town in Saskatchewan, were all very interesting to me as a reader, as I am fascinated by landscape, and Ford excels. Having also cleaned and hunted Canadian geese for hunters (in South Dakota), I loved his detailed prose about the processes. The book took me 1/3 less time than the predicted pace at which my Kindle predicted I would finish the novel, due to my skimming, not to my repute as a fast reader. Full disclosure:  Amanda Urban rejected a novel recommended to her 25 years ago by Nora Ephron on my behalf--so I'm a little jealous, too! Love the locales; hate the turgidity.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I was slightly wary of yet another supernatural romance but this book is so much more than that! Deftly blending history and mythology Harkness grabs the reader's attention from the first page and keeps it right up until the last page...and beyond. As soon as I finished it I was straight into the next book. A great read.
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|It was too long a wait to hear more salsa from Marc Anthony. I'm so glad he went back to his roots.
0486284735|5.0|The book is in great condition, aside from a few stickers on the front & library stamps on the bottom, there was no writing in it or any other defects. Haven't read the book yet but will edit once finished.
B004X4R3FE|4.0|A rare treat of a film.  This character-driven film of a king and commoner 'making friends' is a compelling story and makes for a rich and nuanced escape.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Another feel good movie where good triumphs over all the bad thing that impede success.  The dance scene with Billy's teacher just continues to blow me away.  It is so special.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very time consuming and addicting. Great game and you don't have to actually buy anything unless you arr very impatient.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app is working great on my Kindle Fire 2nd Gen.  It is exactly what I have been looking for.
B000255LNE|5.0|I have always enjoyed listening to Phil Collins music beginning with when he was with Genesis, I believe I have all of the albums.  So this Compilation of Old & New is very much enjoyed.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, but I had liked both actors in other shows. Turns out this show is very good and well worth a look. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good political drama/thriller.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I enjoyed. playing. this game it has plenty. of hidden object scenes. and fun puzzles. I liked the story. and graphics
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I've been following the show since I was young...and this was amazing. This was my favorite season so far. :)
B002DJZJT8|5.0|Favorite movies of all times !!!! This movie never gets old and the soundtrack is to die for! Love all the actors in this movie!
0788859544|5.0|DVD arrived early than expected and presented it to a family with popcorn who's two little girl's<br />excited to view from begining to end and view again.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|Stupidest movie ever !!!! Please don't waste your money on this ridiculous movie! The original is way better this was a joke!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It had me in tears several times. I think I finished the book in less than a day because of how well John kept me wanting to read more. Outstanding novel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched when I heard one of my favorite authors watched it. I knew she wouldn't steer me wrong. Great show. Constant drama and dilemmas with real, satisfying resolutions. The end of season three has made me nervous for season four, but I suspect I know where they're going with it. (I won't spoil it.)
B007MDB71O|4.0|I was first introduced the sci fi/fantasy genre through the John Carter of Mars books in the 1970s and was always puzzled why no movie studio ever undertook making them into movies.  The movie does a good job in capturing the first books with only a few liberties - Dejah Thoris is more of a warrior princess in the movie than in the books but not obnoxiously so.  The casting is good and the special effects.  What is awful was the marketing and promotion of the movie by Disney.  John Carter says nothing to a new audience without the \\"of Mars.\\"  You get ignored by a new audience, existing fans of the books become suspicious, and not building on the countless writers and movie makers who were inspired by these books (George Lucas not the least), was appalling.  Then again, Disney marketers are now thinking an Avatar-land at Disney is a good idea.<br /><br />Ignore the poor marketing and poor press reviews.  This is a fun popcorn adventure movie of a sci fi classic that really deserves a sequel.  The director got it right - hopefully the promotional people will second time around if the property is given a second chance.  I'll even make the plug - if you like the movie and want a sequel, go vote at [...] to let Disney know.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I love the magic game. a definent must play for any one that wants to see what magic is all about
B00821OX98|5.0|I think I watched the first 2 hr pilot. Was not to inpressed. Although it does have a great cast and directors, it kinda let me doubting.<br />  After going back and watching the first 2 seasons. Well i was amazed at what I had been missing. Well written with the acting first rate you cannot help but like it.<br />  What can I say but the best sci-fi series since star trek.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|for any young lady. I've loved his book since I was 13 and enjoyed adding it to my eBook so I could revisit it some rainy day.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|In the midst of all the vampire hoopla, it is good to go to the original source. A tale of good and evil, of redemption, of community, and faith, hope and love. Very difficult to put down.
B001EBYMB2|5.0|Have always loved this movie, thrilled I can watch it on my kindle to kill time whenever I want, love the prime movies
B009E3EY38|5.0|Celebration Day is the CD/DVD that Led Zeppelin fans have been waiting for all these years!  After years of specualtion and anticipation the band reunited for one live concert in 2007.  The concert was outstanding and the CD/DVD proves that the musicians still have the \\"right stuff\\".  Robert Plant may not have the vocal range that he did when Led Zeppelin was at the top of the charts in the late 1960's and throught the 1970's but it didn't make a difference in the reunion concert.  His unique voice and emotion in the songs still made all of what he sang fantastic!  Jimmy Page still is a maestro of the guitar, John Paul Jones is still an outstanding bass guitar and keyboardist, and Jason Bonham filled in his late father John \\"Bonzo\\" Bonham on the drums that would of made his father proud.  Led Zeppelin performed their classic songs from \\"Ramble On\\", \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and \\"Kashmir\\", and a few hits that were lesser known.  I wish that they would do a World Tour one more time or at least one more reunion concert that Led Zeppelin fans would enjoy and remember.  However, until or if or when that happens, all Led Zeppelin fans can enjoy this truely outstanding live CD/DVD of their concert in 2007.  The band dedicated the concert to Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun, who passed away a year before the reunion concert.  Mr. Ertegun would of been proud at the truely remarkable concert!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED CD/DVD!
B004ELSDZK|1.0|It's like the spot game of dragging the spot. It did get more challenging, but not more interesting. I played for three days and deleted.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love this game, always have, always will! this works great on my kindle fire. no problems at all. very relaxing
B008JFUP0I|4.0|Just not as furious. Still a great movie, but like most sequels, it's starting to lose some of it's edge and flair.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was engaged in the story from the first paragraph to the last. I have read and enjoyed his other books, but this is my favorite.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|BROUGHT THIS FOR MY SON LAST CHRISTMAS<br />I'VE LEARNED TO ALWAYS CHECK AMAZON FIRST WHEN LOOKING FOR MOVIES<br />THANKS SO MUCH
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game is really good. It works your mind. Sometimes it was a little easy but sometimes it was hard. Would recommend for adults or children ages 10 and up who love puzzle games.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This is a very good app but it is also confusing i think it still needs more detail and sometimes it doesn't wake me up
B00BSTVEDE|3.0|Despite being cut from digital mastertapes this is a good sounding rendition of the classic Vangelis score on red vinyl.<br /><br />Does not better the original German CD though.<br /><br />The vinyl is nicely packaged but poorly manufactured.<br /><br />Both my copies were warped;<br /><br />One beyond redemption, the second mildy - not enough to prevent playback.<br /><br />Caveat emptor.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|The later novels are much better written than this one. I don't think it's a problem with the translation, because the same translator did a great job with the later novels, which he translated before the first one. The plot drags, and mostly it feels like the author is saying &#34;I've been to Australia, let me tell you all about it!&#34; I was also shocked and disappointed that Harry could so casually dismiss the death of a woman he claims he loves, when he was the one who put her in harm's way by suggesting that she be used as &#34;bait&#34; for the killer! Once you've read the Harry Hole novels, it's understandable that you want to know the full story. I would recommend that you read only to fill in the start of the Harry Hole story.
B007XNAQLA|4.0|A great album with bonus CD of the band in action.<br /><br />Highlight is violinist Jean-Luc Ponty.<br /><br />Nice presentation.<br /><br />Good sound.<br /><br />Perfect for RTF fans.
