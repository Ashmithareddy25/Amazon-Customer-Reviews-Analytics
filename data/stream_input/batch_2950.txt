B000HZGNEU|5.0|Brilliant Star Trek comedy both for fans and the casual watcher. Kirk and Spock's travels through San Fran are hilarious.
B004PLWGVG|5.0|I love most songs on this album! I have it on reply since I bought it. Soulful, fun and delightful!
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I love, love, loved this book, and it convinced me to go on to the next book immediately. I'll definitely be reading the whole series if the rest of the books live up to this one!
0385486804|3.0|What would cause an academically advanced, athletically gifted, socially respected, and financially blessed young man to forsake his family, abandon his possessions, renounce his identity, and hitchhike to Alaska? Furthermore, what caused him to turn up dead four months later? Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild tells the bizarre story of this young man, Chris McCandless, and explores the conflicting issues that confront each of us: independence, family, dreams, duty, love, pain, determination, hardship and more. Unfortunately, Krakauer's poor organization of the material slows the pace and stifles what would otherwise be a gripping story.  The result is an account that reads less like a biography and more like a socio-psychological study. Ultimately, McCandless' story proves that, for some people, the call of the wild is not a call to find oneself but a call to lose oneself. (3/5 stars)
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|so happy they finally released this INCREDIBLE AMAZING PERFECTION the best nirvana concert ever i been having this for about 10 years now its about time we got the real thing on high def
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is a great game. The kids love it. I hope you keep adding to it.  Everyone should try it.
B001A4LYN2|4.0|I will not recap as so many others have. And to be honest I could not<br />come close to doing a better job.<br /><br />But I will say this. My attention span is not my strongpoint. I get bored<br />easy watching slow moving movies. But the depth of the realism is startling.<br />The realism of the storyline. The acting performances. the cinematography.<br />they all combine to make a classic film.<br /><br />If you have the time to really sit and watch a film this is a great choice.<br />But it is a movie that's like a good cognac. It's meant to be sipped not guzzled.<br />point being watch it when you can really sit to appreciate it.  Enjoy!
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|My family likes the music, we all listen to the album on the kindle since my car stereo is not working.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|Just one more story!  Thought this would be short and quick but we spent over a half hour going through the fun pages.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Enjoy waking up and going to sleep with your favorite songs and not some crappy ringtone. Perfect for any time and any place.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Long build up for an astonishing and great ending, very pleased, the book got better and better as it went on.
B00F2362IE|5.0|i think it should be free because people like free games. with out free games we will not have money on their cards.
B0080BFVPU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I love it when people who have an odd skill/life are thrust into common everyday situations and have no clue what they are doing. Exceptional at such and such, failing at everyday life.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|I AM A MAGGIE SMITH FAN AND I LOVE ALL HER MOVIES!  I AM SO GLAD TO HAVE THIS MOVIE IT REALLY MADE MY DAY!
B00F91SCXC|4.0|The movie was entertaining for the most part, but like most of these movies, the endless parade of close calls and unbelievable luck grow tiresome. I have not read the book, but after watching the movie I think I will make it a point to.
0800141849|5.0|I HAVE ENJOYED JEFF BRIDGES MOVIES FOR YEARS AND NOW I HAVE ANOTHER MOVIE TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION, I AM VERY HAPPY
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Its too bad that it takes so long to see more this is a great show and done in taste, and all the caractors are great. I don't like tom, means he's a good actor
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Good thinking movie...kinda top gunish.  Worthy of a rental.  You may need to rewind a few times to figure out the plot.
B005XQLBU4|2.0|Memories come back from playing this game when I was younger. Unfortunately not a fan of it on the phone, never made it far so can't speak of it a lot.
B00181JGI2|5.0|One of the greatest cult movies of our time.  I strongly suggest that everyone see and appreciate this one!  I enjoy it each and every time that I watch it.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|First off, it appears to me that anyone who has not seen the earlier episodes, will not enjoy this as much as the ones who have. The film has its own merits but lack of background on the \\"Mutants\\" (people with super powers) makes it pretty much like walking into the theater halfway through its running time.  At any rate, there are, for those who are familiar with the characters, various opportunities to watch the burning and freezing powers, the super strength, mind reading, and bridge moving mutants, to  label only a few types. There is even less room than in previous episodes for actors to show much individualized skill but the action scenes are entertaining, particularly in the free-for-all which marks the culmination of the series.<br />Overall, if you  are starting the series, I would suggest going for the complete set. Those who have seen the first two should find this less engaging but nonetheless entertaining.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|Words cannot describe how much I love Hope Sandoval and Mazzy Star, but here are some that describe Seasons of Your Day... beautiful, wondrous, magical, enigmatic, enchanting, mystical, gorgeous, trippy, sublime, revelatory, and haunting...<br /><br />Hope and David, if you happen to read this, I just want to say thank you for creating music that has brought me so much joy since I first heard \\"Fade Into You\\" so many years ago. I can't wait for your next release, even if it takes another 17 years...
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's never laggy! It's fun I like how you can dig secret passage ways into houses that you built. You can make towns .
B001FES0IE|5.0|The is a classic album, right up there with Zep 4 and the White Album if you ask me. And if you're inclined to agree, this vinyl pressing wont disappoint. Amazon always ships fast obviously, and the clarity of the particular pressing was impressive even for my sub-par Crosley record player. I would definitely recommend this vinyl pressing of Night at the Opera.
B008OOYALE|5.0|My daughter downloaded this game and really loves it.  She plays it all the time and never has any problems.
B002E2M3KM|5.0|News of the World is a freaking amazing album in the first place, but the vinyl pressing is simply beautiful. Great clarity, even on my s***ty little Crosley. I definitely recommend this record for and Queen fan.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|This is definitely Cher's best work to date - not one filler or clunker.  Love the power ballads & catchy dance numbers - in a word, irresistible!
B005PW3OS8|5.0|The little good guy is a great reference for children to look up to.<br />We could all use a good reference.
B008HFWF3U|5.0|The Orchestrion Project, from the mind of Pat Metheny, was nothing less than what one would expect from Pat. I'd love to see him perform this in concert.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|it keeps saying it had an error. I paid for it too. I want my money back. I cant play. wont download.
B00005MP58|5.0|A classical that never dies. I love this movie and I watched it many times. It is a great tribute to Jane Austin
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really liked this book. Everyone makes mistakes in their lives, but everyone changes in their lifetime as well. No one is the same person today as they were in their teenage years. Biological and neurological things happen in our bodies and minds that effect our ability to make decisions at that age. We witness these characters making decisions, even in adulthood, that effect everyone. Humans go along in life pretending that things just happen, when in reality looking back we can almost always see a fork in the road where if we chose another path our lives would be different. Then again, these paths help create the person we are. Choosing to keep moving and eventually to forgive helps create smoother roads for us all. It's hard to know how this story would have ended if everyone would have been so forthcoming about the bad decisions they made as soon as they made them or as honest about the feelings they had as soon as they felt them. In the end, would the results have been the same?
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|2011's Take Care earned Drake a grammy and solidified his place in a genre he made his own. From the slow RnB influenced tracks to the arrogant, boastful and confident rap tracks \\"Take Care\\" was an album to be reckoned with. Back for Round 3 his Senior album Drake showcases his darkside but in a manner that is smooth. My personal favorites are Connect, Wu-Tang Forever, All Me, From Time and Tuscan Leather. I have not finished dissecting the album by any means. But if you are a true listener you listen for the first minute and a half to gather the theme of the song and then skip ahead until you determine the tracks you want to truly dive into. So from a 35 minute car ride those tracks struck me that way.<br /><br />The formula is pretty much the same from Take Care except NWTS's tracks are a hybrid of his RnB/Rap style. While Take Care had exclusively RnB and exclusively Rap tracks. NWTS has both on one track, genius to me and seen before on some of the tracks he has been featured on. The transtion from singing to rapping is very smooth and he doesnt break from his one tone harmony but it works for him. If I had to choose one track to be a standout it would be From Time, beautifully written and definitely a dedication song for any man to his woman (or woman to woman, man to man whatever your flavor). I love the fact that Drake is a rapper in touch with his sensitive side, and while he speaks words most would find degrading the context in which he uses them isnt.<br /><br />My personal favorite song is Connect but it is a biased opinion since I was born and raised in HTOWN (Houston, TX) when I heard the word swang it just brings back the memories of Color Changing Click, DJ Screw, Slim Thug (in his prime) Z-RO, and Lil Keke. This album is definitely worth the buy and I suggest it to any Drake fan currently and potential one.
B00AS1Q93S|2.0|Threw the DVD in the trash after wasting 1/2 hr. of viewing. My wife and daughter also dislike the movie.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|The withings I got couldn't really syncronize with my android device, and compared to the GPS and another step counter, the distance and steps seemed to be undercounted. The pulse meter usage is a bit tedious. But it has a nice display, very neat design, it's great that you can see history on it, its silicone case and wristband are neat.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I can't say that I really liked it, but it was o.k. for a remake. I bought it to see it again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I first learned about Hugh Howey through listening to the Geek's Guide to the Galaxy podcast. What struck me was his humble demeanor, true appreciation of his fans and his unique path to success via self publishing through Amazon. It was the only time I can recall where I knew about the author before the work. I picked up The Wool Omnibus and it was fantastic. The world had some familiar apocalyptic tones. In my mind it's closest to the Fallout video game series, which is called out in the podcast. Not a problem at all. You won't be able to put the book down due to the characters and how the plot unravels in a series of magnificent reveals. It's a gray and lifeless world but written with vibrance. I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being a classic. It's a great book from an inspiring author. Hugh is a guy you want to root for. I'm definitely looking forward to reading his other work.<br /><br />Hugh, I know the movie rights were already optioned. If you're reading this I want to direct the movie! :)
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was really great.  I felt a connection with all of the characters and didn't want it to end.  Highly recommend!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|The movie and the book have nothing in common which is such a disappointment.  I'm guessing they had to have a central action character...because that's the ONLY way an action movie could possibly be made.  I'm tired of this simplistic formula.  How about just take the best parts of the book and make that into a movie?  Seriously, if you want a great zombie/action movie watch Dawn of the Dead 2004.  I'd bet their budget was about $100 million less, and it's so much better.  This was a huge chance to make an epic well funded zombie flick...it's an waste of time and money.
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|The movie was ok but there are several holes in the plot line. Later in the movie when it's explained how several of the deceptions are done you are left saying to yourself &#34;yeah right&#34;
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|All in all the book was amazing, not a waste of time, but not quite my favorite, I prefer books with a little more action.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I did not think I was going to like this movie, much less be entrenched and glued to the screen the entire time.  This was well made and I loved it.  It is fast past but never looses you.  One of the most intense and well acted moments was by someone playing a zombie. I want say what scene as to not give away anything.  See if you find the same single interaction with one zombie and Brad Pitt as electrifying as I did.<br />Great movie, buy it, you'll be watching this one over and over.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Phenomenal read. Always had you on your toes wondering what else to expect from Grey. But then again,  I find my husband to be so much like Grey so I can totally relate to the book.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A fabulously imaginative story. Well written and intriguing. I woul recommend this book to anyone wanting to be transported to a different world.
B000002H97|3.0|The music is Great but the new CD was shipped with a broken case as well as another one bought from the same seller.  No big deal but it's nece to have new cases with a new purchase.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have an Amazon Prime membership and was looking forward to being able to read books for free with my membership.  I found out, after I downloaded everything, that the Amazon Prime membership only has free books when you have it on a Kindle and not on your android.  The advertising for this application is very misleading.  I uninstalled the application as soon as I found out this information.  Extremely unhappy with this experience.
B000002H6C|3.0|The music is obviously Great but the new CD was shipped with a broken case as well as another one bought from the same seller.  No big deal but it's nice to have new cases with a new purchase.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|very powerful story, depressing, disturbing, but so touching, i was holding my breath a couple of times while reading it, overwhelmed by powerful emotions while reading it, but i didn't appreciate the ending, specifically when the author decided to tell you how shall feel about Mariam and the reference to 9/11
B000NV55RY|5.0|I first seen this movie in the Winter of 98-99 during Joe Bob Briggs Monster Vision on TNT and could not remember the name of it later on. I finally did a search and found it on the internet over a decade later. This film is quite the adventure and has a good combination of comedy and horror. I would rank this in my top favorite Dracula/Vampire movies of all time, with Bram Stokers Dracula and Interview With The Vampire.
1592402038|5.0|My university writing teacher assigned my class to read the chapter regarding commas, so my review is not about the book in its entirety. I'll admit two things, I am a bit nervous to be writing this review as it would be horribly embarrassing to make a grammar error while writing a review for a book about grammar errors. My second admission is that I am certainly an excessive comma user. This book showed me just about glaring my excessive comma use is. From lawyers to Thurber, many people prefer to not use commas. One quote I particularly liked was from Thurber. He said \\"all those commas make the flag seem rained on.\\" The book was eye-opening and simply solidified what I already knew about my writing style. I am glad that I now have this reinforcement to continually remind me to cut down on my comma use and improve my writing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read this book six times and saw the movie five times. I really enjoyed it from beginning to end. It never lost my interest once.
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|No matter what style of music he sings , he puts his heart and soul into every song . I am a huge Bolton fan and have all his cds and cassettes.  Thanks for another great cd.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I picked this book along with a few others to give me some good escape reading for the summer. Very original story line. I also enjoyed the method the author used to tell each character's story. It really was quite surprising.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addictive and fun game. Takes a while to regenerate coins at first but goes into high gear when leveling up.
B000063S31|5.0|I am a big Elvis fan, grew up hearing his all his music and he was a great entertainer, and I still like his music.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Great computer graphics and action that's about it really, still not as good and legendary as stallone's version of the movie
B0001AUAU4|5.0|This cd is awesome. Another great addition to my cd collection. I have all of Carla Brunis' cds except one and that I will order at a later time.
0061950726|5.0|Orphan Train was our latest book club choice and it is fabulous! The characters and settings are so real and the story makes a real impact. It was eye opening to read how poorly we took care of lost children, the innocent children. This is one of those stories I'd read again.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Started playing the game and love it for the first couple of days. Now, the game will not appear again. Tried to reload to no success.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game because they keep making new plases and new minions and the minions are funny and cool
B0043JDUNS|5.0|It's IRON MAN what more do I need to say about it, Awesome movie just like the first one if not better
B00E6890RG|5.0|Haken has made ENORMOUS strides with this new record. Songwriting, technical proficiency, production quality, everything. MILES ahead of Aquarius and Visions. Not to detract from those records; they are both great in their own way and I listen to them frequently, but this is on a whole other level. The idea of a recurring theme has always been present in Haken's music, in a very up-front, in your face kind of way. &#34;The Mountain&#34; presents a recurring theme not through musical themes present in most every song (like in Aqu. and Vis.), but through the lyrics and the story they tell, as well as the mood of the music as the album progresses. I can't say enough good things about this record. It surpasses Dream Theater's self-titled record, even if not by all that much. But, for a band this young, that is absolutely remarkable.<br /><br />Also, they are muppets, which adds to how amazing this record is. I mean, can you imagine how hard it is to play a guitar solo when your hands are fingerless and made of felt?! Incredible!! Don't believe me? Watch the music video for The Cockroach King. Facts: checked.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I had seen the movie, along with &#34;As Good As It Gets&#34;, and loved them both.  I wanted to have them both for my collection, and was pleased with the price, packaging, speed of shipping and quality of the product.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is cool to play .the obstacles make it challenging and  fun.i wish there was an amazing book about it..
B00003CXFV|4.0|Fantastic women's empowerment film. I liked the fact I could see the deleted scenes, some would have added more to her character and story. Loved her humor and honesty!
B0068THAGY|3.0|An enjoyable movie for the most part. Definitely kept my interest throughout; I bought into the storyline. The special effects were excellent, and there were a bunch of questions that I kept looking for the answers to.<br /><br />Three stars ? Several of those questions never got answered, or where answered inadequately, and I felt the ending was rushed and unsatisfying. That happens in almost every sci-fi movie, or so it seems, that I've come to expect it.<br /><br />Still, worth watching, no question.
B00DMM3WVM|3.0|This is a decent game where you essentially run through an area trying to avoid bumping into any zombies in the horde that you apparently feel compelled to run through. It's not great, but it's not bad.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|I always wondered about Shirley MacLaine's daughter and why she didn't live with her, so when I saw a TV interview with Sachi promoting her book I checked my kindle book store and bought it. I was so glad kindle had it available. It was very worth the price I paid for it a and it was very enjoyable. Very good book and well written.
B00AAX68HG|3.0|I don't hate it. It's just sort of average. It's challenging enough for me, but easy enough for my 6 year old to understand the concept.
B00F5PS5P2|5.0|I bought the Recover EP on the strength of the title single, but was disappointed with the remixes and one other track, figuring this band to be hit and miss.  But everything else I was hearing I really enjoyed, so I knew before I bought that I'd like at least 4-5 of the songs on this record.  After my first listen I am happy to say that the entire album is rock solid and strong through and through.  They saved their best tracks for the full release, and I can't imagine skipping any of them.  Lauren's singing is like audio crack, just spectacular and addictive.  If you like Chvrches' sound, the album is not a gamble - you'll like the whole thing.<br /><br />This is one of the most innovative and satisfying records of 2013.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|This just might be my favorite album. Honestly I hadn't listened to BSB in years until I went to see them in concert recently as one of my bucket list items. I was a tween during the boy band love phase of the 90's and BSB was my true love...ok mainly Brian Littrell. I bought every album they have done after that concert. There are so many things I like about this one. I love that they spent so much time writing for this album. It shows lyrically as well as being a great testament to their growth as artists. &#34;Madeleine&#34; is probably my favorite song. It's on repeat daily. &#34;Love Somebody&#34; has my favorite lines. I am so glad to have Nick, Brian, Howie, AJ, and Kevin back in my life.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Confusing, boring, not interesting. How could anyone read that script and say, 'Oh yes, I want to do this movie.&#34;
0345543971|5.0|My all time favorite series, such a great book.  I was needing to replace my old one. This is the larger sized paperback, which is exactly what I wanted.  These books are so big that I find the smaller sized paperbacks hard to handle.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|A totally enjoyable story. I definitely see the appeal here and why they would want to make this story into a movie.
B00F1RR3Y8|5.0|My great granddaughter spent several hours playing this game. She loves being a little lady and having things such as these to play with.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's a great app, there's plenty of people on here and I've all so met New people. So great app
B00CWY76CC|1.0|The instructions are just the goal of the game! No guidance about how to play. I immediately discarded it because I got frustrated trying to figure out.
B0014JKJHK|5.0|i love these shoes shoes for my job.i work in fast food services and these shoes are the best ive ever had.being a baker i must be comfortable for long periods of time.these are the shoes for my feet.could use more breathing and more non slip but there great.
B002VECM6S|5.0|¡Bella! Beautiful! Extraordinary beautiful! See Sandra Bullock with that big heart and reflects on screen, touch the sensibility of one.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|Used to watch this with my dad have not seen this movie for a long time my dad is gone now i came across this movie on Amazon it brings back a lot of fond memories. thanks Amazon
B000683VI4|5.0|Based in the book of Nicolas Spark, I love it. This movie is about a true love. I recommend it
0446555002|4.0|This lived up to their other novels.  I would recommend this series of books to anyone who likes a different kind of mystery.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Couldn't wait for it to come out.  Worth the wait!!  Voice sounds great and songs are a perfect mix (dance and ballads).  Welcome back Cher!  You were missed.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I can get any machine I please - I built my machine with the 965 black edition when it came out years ago and I still have no need to replace it - this is one of those deals. You can run benchmarks til the cows come home but youll have a hard time beating the overall performance even with todays octo cores - I can run black ops wide open - far cry 3 wide open -- youname it - the proof is in the performance - btw im using a 2gb 6950 ati card which is older ... get it?
B009C7JS14|5.0|I use it every day to plan our day. it has never let us down. we take it with us on our trips.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I have been a Star trek fan from the very beginning.  I enjoyed this new movie very much.  I hope more are made.
0425252868|5.0|This book has completely re-written my image of the German warrior in World War 2. An amazing story that is incomprehensible in the context of the routine war rhetoric that paints all WW2 German soldiers as blood-thirsty evil Nazis. But as always, the truth is never black and white. This story puts the reader in the shoes of some of the best fliers and fighter pilots the world has ever seen, men who lived by an honor code that preserved their humanity even as their world collapsed on them in biblical proportions, killing nearly all of them in the process. It is a story of skill, heroism, tragedy, grace, post apocalyptic survival, and finally, reconciliation and closure that makes you wonder if God Himself did not have a hand in it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|The game would be great, but its buggy with poor swipe recognition. Multiple times you swipe your finger on the screen and the game doesn't recognize.
B003L77GH4|1.0|Once again I did not order this product! Nor did I receive it . Nor am I giving it a review.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|I'm not going to lie, I did download the leak of this 9 days before the release, 3 days later I found myself on here buying the album! now as I patiently wait to have my physical copy, I sit back enjoying my Authentic Copy Courtesy of Amazon's AutoRip feature. I've been listening to this mad steady, I'm even afraid that I listen to it too much. This album is definitely something you want to say hey You Own a Physical copy as I'm sure 10 years down the line, Values going to go up.<br /><br />Great lyrics, Great songs, feels like a Fresh breath to the rap I've been hearing lately. As someone who Records, Mixes & Masters Music I can definitely tell that Drake worked a lot on this and that's why its really worth it.<br />Just my Two Cents.<br />Buy The Album!<br /><br />Cant seem to stop listening to:<br />Own It, Worst Behaviour, From Time, Furthest Thing.
B00F91H666|5.0|Streaming worked great! No issues! Movie is good! Unrated, much better than theatre released version. Yes, I watched both versions.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Excellent series!!!  This &#34;final&#34; book begs for another installment, however.<br /><br />I mean, this cannot, cannot be it.  There's so much more we need closure on.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Good story line, with challenging searches.  Great HO sections with good zoom.  A lot of back and forth but the map helps.  Great visuals!!  I recommend if you enjoy this type of game like I do.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A great, convenient tool. Works well too. I have had no problems. Even my kids use it and it helps in number recognition.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|I bought all the seasons because this is one of the most fun TV show I have come across. My favorite is Sheldon and it is interesting to see how Amy changes his personality little by little. Big surprise with Raj in season 6, but no spoilers!! Enjoy!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great book i recommend it for all ages because it teaches you a lesson to be nice to others think about how you want to be treated before you do something mean to them someday someone might do that to you and you might not even know why. So over all great book about a boy named August when he was born he deformed he said his ears were like a ball of pizza dough flattened out a little and his eyes were in the middle of his cheeks and his smile was always in a strait line in the middle of his face his sister is kinda overprotective for him and once she got so mad at someone because they laughed at him she gave them a mean glare and she kept her eyes on them August went  to school for the first time ever and it didn't go so hot this boy named Julian was really mean to August and put mean notes in his locker them a boy named Jack Will at first pretended to be his friend and in the end they became best friends and August kinda got a girlfriend named Summer she was really nice to August but they both tried to just be friends in the end August graduated fifth grade and had pretty much the whole grade as a friend
B00F35BV64|3.0|I just don't like the &#34;new&#34; Kirk character.  The Gene Roddenberry character didn't seem as arrogant and self centered somehow.  I felt like if I met tho old character I would like him.  This one I think would annoy me and I would go out of my way to avoid.  The plot was predictable.  Even the first movie in the new series was more enjoyable and the parallel time was a brilliant way to deal with the new and old trekkies.

B003EYVXT6|2.0|This movie is a modern take on the \\"Frankenstein\\" theme - basically, it's not a good idea to tinker with Mother Nature.<br /><br />O.K., so the genetic engineers would have to make one bad decision here, or there wouldn't be a plot, but  in \\"Splice\\", these guys just make one hilariously bad decision after the next. The special effects are believable, but the story isn't.<br /><br />In the spirit of this movie, they should have named the creature \\"Emal\\".
B00EUVG3P6|5.0|I used this processor to build a low power machine strictly for internet usage.<br /><br />The 54 watt power consumption is great for people that leave their machines on all day.  It really doesn't generate much heat at all.  The box stayed VERY COOL after several hours of web surfing.<br /><br />It was simple to install.  It comes with a beefy high quality fan that mounts directly on top of the processor.<br /><br />The added bonus is the on board video.  This means you do not have to shell out extra cash for a video card.  You just have to buy a compatible mother board, plug in the cpu and plug in your monitor.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this for gaming, graphic editing, or any heavy duty work.  Go with an i3, i5 or i7.<br /><br />Overall, a great processor to use for building an internet surfing machine.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Nice that it senses where the card goes and moves it with just 1 tap. Really speeds up the game.

140006922X|4.0|So much of what we think we know about Jesus and his life and times are really just assumptions that we have picked up from years of Sunday School classes, Christmas plays and church sermons.  But so much of what we think we know about Jesus is really gleaned from various contradictory sources taken out of context and that were never meant to be historical documents in the first place.  In Zealot, Aslan  tries to separate Jesus the historical person for Jesus Christ the Christian saviour  of mankind.  Much of what Aslan's says about the historical Jesus that can be determined from the gospels has already been written about by other scholars such as Bart Ehrman.  What makes Aslan's book different is that it widens the focus and looks at what was going on in Palestine before, during, and after Jesus's life.  This allows the author to employ more sources.  The event of Jesus's life may not be that well documented but the history of the Roman province of Judea is.  By describing the political environment of the highly volatile area that Jesus lived we get a more complete picture of Jesus.  The book presents Jesus as firmly within the revolutionary Jewish movement of Roman Palestine.  He is a man much more concerned about the politics of the Jewish temple and much less about the salvation on mankind.  Most of the information in this book is nothing new.  Anyone who has read the four gospels cannon help but notice the inconsistencies in the accounts.  Or the fact that Paul's letter make little or no mention of what Jesus actually said.  What makes this book different is that it firmly puts the bible and Jesus in the historical context that is so often neglected.
B00ESY6TKY|4.0|Fantastic acting and beautiful CGI/cinematography make up for a somewhat stinted script. The best rendition of the classic to date

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I don't know of many households that doesn't already have at least one way to get Netflix or YouTube onto their television.  Between gaming consoles, Blu-Ray players, smart TV's, etc., most people can already watch these services from their couches.  And because of this, I only had one hope for the Chromecast, and that was to be able to watch internet video in a browser on the television.  With all of the network and cable channels posting shows you may have missed the night before, it seems like a great convenience to be able to do this.  Enter the Chromecast.<br /><br />How Do You Control Chromecast: There are many reviews as to how easy Chromecast is to set up, and it is! But what wasn't clear to me was how to control Chromecast.  I knew it could be controlled from your smartphone, but didn't realize it would make a difference which one.  I have an iPhone and iPad, both of which can control Chromecast.  Much to my disappointment, you can only broadcast Netflix and YouTube to your TV when using an iPhone / iPad product.  I know I purchased this solely to want browser video, but it would have been nice to get more than two apps (of which I have 5 other ways to already play on my TV).  If you have an Android phone, you can add Google Play to the list of apps.  Wow!  Very disappointing for two of the biggest smartphone platforms.  Oh, and neither will broadcast through an internet browser.<br /><br />That's where your laptop / desktop comes in.  I only have a PC running Windows 7, so I can't speak for Apple products.  But there is a plugin for Google Chrome to allow it to broadcast to the TV.  The key to this is that the PC / Laptop MUST be on your wireless network.  It will not work if your only connected to a wired network.  My PC is connected to my network via CAT 5 cable.  Fortunately I had an old wireless card laying around so I didn't have to invest any more money.<br /><br />The biggest problem with using a PC is that it is usually in the other room.  This means you have to run to that room every time you want to pause, FF, REW, etc.  So, the convenience of a laptop is better.<br /><br />My bottom line......Netflix, YouTube and Google Play are not even close to enough apps to premier this item.  And broadcasting Chrome only from a PC / Laptop is too limited.  I would have given this two stars for all this, but then you have to consider the $35 price tag.  That bumped it to 3 stars.<br /><br />Someday, this Chromecast can be amazing if Google gives it the support it needs.ns you have to run to that room every time you want to pause, FF, REW, etc.  So, the convenience of a laptop is better.<br /><br />My bottom line......Netflix, YouTube and Google Play are not even close to enough apps to premier this item.

B0025UHKNS|2.0|I  have used this product for 2 years now for running and cycling. Its an excellent product no doubt. GIves a lot of motivating features. But THe unit has malfuncitoned in the second years.( The display goes off intermittently and returns and I lose data in between) The PREMIUM HR MONITOR malfunctioned in the first year. I purchsed it from USA. I am based in INDIA. ITs such a hassle to get this repaired. I hvae to courier the UNIT TO TAIWAN to get it repair it. THE COST OF REPAIR IS MORE THAN THE COST OF A NEW UNIT. Its such a horrible feeling. I never knew this when I purchased it. These are all business stratgeis to make money. How can the cost of repair be more than the cost of the new one? I say this statement as I include the courier cost too. Its bad for people using it in countries where there is no official support. So Guys think twice before purchasing this unit. I would like to know from customers if they have faced similar problems and what they did to rectify this?

B00ELE8D4Q|4.0|Cher is finally back after 12 long years.  Twelve years is a long time for fans to wait for a new album, and a long time with which to harbor anticipation.  Closer to the Truth is a strong effort from the biggest diva of our time, though not without its shortcomings.  Still, fans should be more than satisfied with this record.<br /><br />The road to releasing this album has been sketchy though.  It seems Cher really wanted to go back to her rock roots for a while.  The smashing success of 1998's Believe album caused a huge derailment for those plans, however.  Cher became queen of the dance floor after that album, for better or worse!  Following that up (not counting the independently-released not.com.mercial album), 2001's Living Proof album took Believe's title track and morphed it into an entire album.  The resulted in a fun dance record, but not really the strongest album in Cher's catalog.  After a long hiatus, we got the Diane Warren-penned power ballad, \\"You Haven't Seen The Last of Me\\" from the Burlesque soundtrack.  Cher was set to release a full album of such material, hearkening back to Heart of Stone's sound.  But then the attack of the dance club came back, as dance remixes of \\"Last of Me\\" took the scene by storm, so the album was changed to dance pop again.<br /><br />But this isn't bad at all.  Unlike Living Proof, the grand majority of the club bangers here sound like they were meant to be slower rock songs that were handed over to Mark Taylor to work his magic.  The lyrics and melodies are much more complex, even if the backing music sounds fairly typical.  And of course, none can deny the sheer presence that Cher commands on her music.  That alone sets this collection apart from her modern-day competition!  Highlights such as \\"Take It Like a Man\\", \\"Red\\", \\"Dressed to Kill\\" and \\"My Love\\" are as brilliantly energetic as they are beautiful.  But starting with track seven, the album takes a more contemporary turn.  \\"I Walk Alone\\" is a truly fantastic foot-stomper.  Not dance, but not slow either, it's a great sound for Cher.  After this one though, the album slows down to a handful of excellent ballads.  Clearly, this is where Cher's strength lies, as she sounds 100% committed to these songs.  While some may be disappointed that the album isn't 12 straight tracks of dance music, I love that we get to hear this slower side of Cher again.  It's a great snippet of what she can do outside of the club. \\"Sirens\\" and \\"I Hope You Find It\\", in particular, are truly gorgeous.<br /><br />My only criticisms are about two tracks in particular.  The first single, \\"Woman's World\\", sounds wildly out of place even among other tracks.  Paul Oakenfold, while a brilliant DJ, isn't the strongest producer and it shows.  \\"Woman's World\\" sounds too remixed, and too clubby.  It would sound more at home as part of a DJ set or compilation than a track on a studio album.  And then sadly, there is \\"Lovers Forever\\".  Don't get me wrong, I love this song as it appears on this album, but having heard the original version I can say I ache to hear Cher sing this as it was originally meant.  \\"Lovers Forever\\" was given to Cher to record for the soundtrack of Interview With The Vampire in 1994.  Instead, it was recorded by Shirley Eikhard.  The song is an absolutely amazing gothic ballad and Cher's voice would've made it soar.  And while we still get a hint of what it could've been, the dance music does take away from it.  If this were given to, say, Jim Steinman to produce, it would've been downright epic.<br /><br />In the end, it's just great to have Cher back.  This is easily her strongest album since Heart of Stone.  Listen to it!
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Cher is back and takes no prisoners!  The voice that can sweeten the ballads and plow through the power/dance anthems is as strong and well tuned as it has been for the last 45+ yrs.  Cher's new album beats strong, with one of the explosive, dance-able track like 'Red' and then has the pop chart power of a single like 'I Hope You Find It' !  Anyone who has been a long time fan or if this is a new discovery for you; you'll find something on this CD to enjoy.  Bravo Cher! @PenseurNotreDam #CherCrew
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|At first it seems to be just a re-hash of The Secret, Course in Miracles, or manifest theory, but she has a very low key style and nice examples to encourage you to get out of the box you're stuck inside.
B0057EYACI|5.0|As a long time Jim Croce fan I was glad to see this collection put together at such a great price.  It was an excellent deal no some timeless music.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|Those who have seen the movie will want to see it again after reading Clarke's original sci-fi novel.  The novel puts the movie in a much larger, clearer context, and it removes some of the mystery of what Kubrick was trying to convey.  Otherwise, Clarke's writing is a trip unto itself and the knowledge of space exploration and technology is a revelation, especially for the time it was written.  The only drawback is that it's a bit over long and the ending is nearly as mysterious as it was in the movie, which may be exactly what Clarke and Kubrick intended.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|If you don't care who Jennifer Lawrence is, then I may give this movie a 3. But it's definitely not the slum of these teen horror movies. It's got enough to keep your attention. If you are a Lawrence fan, then you'll definitely like it. She does a great job :)

B000FBJG04|5.0|As with most titles, I saw the movie first then read the book.  Band of Brothers (BoB) was no exception.  And as usual, the movie did not do the book justice.  The book was so much better (informative, heartwarming, invasive, and fearless).  For example, the author was absolutely not afraid to write the truth about Lieutenant Sobel`s demeanor, cowardice, and bullying personality.  Sobel was not fit to lead a kindergarten class, and especially not a company of men about to go into war.  The author to the reader on a journey that thoroughly explained Sobel`s issues.  Excellent book !!!!!!!!!!!
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This is a light stroll through history with an unusual Forrest-Gump-like character. It provides a  potted overview of some major recent world events. It is humorously written and engaging.

B004XIVQ7Q|4.0|Sarum does not provide a great storyline. But what is does do...very we'll... Is provide a wonderful walk through history with insight into the times and the impact of events during those times. Most chapters start with good historical background as the &#34;novel&#34; jumps between ages updating the fortunes of a range of families throughout their ancestry. It an be very difficult to remember the family trees despite a graphic at the front of the book but, to be honest, I didn't bother trying to most of the time. I just appreciated the opportunity to reinforce and add to my historical knowledge in an enjoyable way. I enjoyed this book and recommend it.

Otherwise, this game is fun and somewhat creative. I would like there to be more independent gameplay; however, it is better to be led to a specific goal set than to be set loose in a new environment without any guidance.

B007ZXK08C|2.0|I expected great things from this book, and what I got were two profoundly unlikeable characters playing out a psychodrama that was very much telegraphed. I read to the end to see what happened...again, predictable and somewhat dull. Finally, while I realise the book is written by a woman, it is full of misogynist tropes about manipulation and deception into marriage and pregnancy.  The only redeeming feature of this book is that it was well written.

Only from a laptop, tablet, etc.<br />- casting from the Chrome browser (on a laptop) seems noticeably choppier, pixelated & out of sync, though this might be due to WiFi issues.<br />- casting from Apps designed for use with Chromecast (Netflix/Youtube) is beautiful -- just like normal TV.

Even my original Macbook Air that doesn't work with Apple TV's Airplay, works with Chromecast.  I'm not saying it's perfect, yet.  Support is limited and for the most part requires that you are in a Chrome Browser if you are using a PC, and mobile applications are all updated to support it yet but it is getting better.  I hope they allow this to extend your desktop or duplicate your desktop soon as that's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars and I expect they will if they haven't already.  Oh and did i mention it's only $35!

B0063S3DMK|4.0|The plot of \\"The Whale Rider\\" follows the story of a young Maori girl named Paikea Apirana, Pai for short.  The story begins in the hospital the day of her birth where both her twin brother and mother have died during child birth.  Her grieving father, Poro, is being pressured by his father and tribal leader, Koro, to try again for a male child as soon as possible.  This is important to Koro because according to tradition leadership is handed down to the first born male child.<br />Poro defies this tradition in two ways.  First, he refuses to accept the leadership which should traditionally be his as he is Koro's eldest son, going so far as to leave the tribe to live as an artist in Germany.  Second, he does so by naming his daughter Paikea.  Paikea is the name of the Maori ancestor who according to legend led his people to their current land while riding on top of a whale.  Koro and all the past leaders of the tribe are direct descendants of this legendary leader.  Since Pai is female she cannot traditionally inherit tribal leadership. Koro and his wife raise Pai and although it is clear he loves her, also condemns her and blames her for conflicts happening within the tribe as she is a break in traditional line to the leadership of the tribe.<br />To fill this gap in leadership Koro starts a cultural school for the first born village boys, hoping a new leader will emerge.  He teaches the boys traditional chants and use of a taiaha, a fighting staff, which are traditionally reserved for males.  Pai feels that she could become the leader and should be allowed to take part in the school; she secretly follows Koro's lessons and seeks out her uncle, Koro's second son, to teach her the use of the taiaha.  When Koro finds outs his relationship with Pai further erodes.  This becomes exacerbated when none of the boys succeed at the traditional task of recovering a whale tooth, the symbol of tribal leadership, which Koro had thrown into the ocean. This was the final task which would identify one of them worthy of becoming leader.  Koro falls into despair with the loss of the tooth and with it no one identified to take over as leader.  He calls out in chant to the ancient ones to help resolve his conflict, while unbeknownst to him Pai is calling out in chant as well from down the beach.  Shortly thereafter, while on a boat outing with her uncle, Pai is told where the whale tooth had been thrown and she dive out of the boat and down to retrieve her grandfathers symbol of leadership.  The family hold on to the tooth, not certain of how Koro would take to the fact that it was recovered by Pai.<br />In an attempt to mend the relationship with Koro, Pai invites him to be her guest of honor at a concert of Maori chants her school is putting on.  During the contest it is revealed Pai had won an inter-school speech contest with a touching dedication to Koro and the traditions of the village calling out that leadership should be shared among the people thus reducing the burden on one person.  Koro misses Pai's speech. He was late, and while walking to the school, he comes upon many whales which are beached near Pai's home. The entire village attempts to get them back into the water, but all efforts fail.  Koro sees it as a sign of his failure and admonishes Pai against touching the largest whale because \\"she has done enough damage.\\"  The largest whale traditionally belongs to the legendary Paikea.  When Koro and the other members of the tribe walk away in expiration and exhaustion, Pai climbs onto the back of the largest whale and coaxes it back into the ocean.  The entire pod follows Pai and the large whale back into the ocean.  As Pai is going out into the ocean on the back of the whale the family shows Koro the whale tooth which had been recovered by Pai. It is only then that Koro realizes he has been ignoring the true leader the entire time. Pai nearly drowns and is lost at sea for a good duration.  When Pai is found and brought to the hospital, Koro asks her forgiveness and acknowledges her as his successor.  The film comes to an end with the tribe, including Pai's father, uncle, and grandparents, celebrating her status as leader, as the newly finished ceremonial boat is hauled into the sea for its maiden voyage.<br />\\"The Whale Rider\\" is a poignant movie which entwines many themes of traditional Maori religious beliefs.  There is a strong sense of the interconnectedness between the past and the future.  Koro and Pai both call out to the ancient ones, their ancestral leaders, for guidance and help.  While they are calling out images of whales are shown to symbolize the connection between nature and humanity. This connection is also illustrated in one scene when Pai's father comes to take her away to live with him.  On the way to the airport, on a seaside highway, Pai sees the whales off in a distance swimming parallel to their vehicle.  Pai interprets this as a sign from the ancestors for her to return to Koro's home and to pursue her rightful place as leader.  She has her father turn around and take her back.<br />Another theme of traditional Maori religious belief in the movie is the legendary Paikea who is shown riding his whale in a carving which sits atop the pavilion Koro uses as the site of his school for teaching the old ways

B008JFUO4U|5.0|This movie just goes to show that you do not need 4 letter words and a lot of skin to make an entertaining movie....thanks movie maker for a completely enjoyable film that the entire family can watch.
B0001AUAU4|5.0|She composed most of the songs and wrote most of the lyrics, and I think they're wonderful! When my husband heard 'quelqu'un m'a dit' he said &#34;Wow!, Who's that!&#34; 'L'excessive' is in-your-face and &#34;Le Dernier Minute&#34; is droll. &#34;L'Amour&#34; is reminiscent of Norah Jones.  This is a very listenable collection of songs
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I downloaded this app just to see what it was all about, and I'm glad that I did. Although I've only done the first lesson in Spanish, I do like the concept of the app. It is similar to the Rosetta Stone in which you are given pictures and you have to choose the one that corresponds to the word. But it's not all about matching pictures to words. You are also given small sentences and phrases, you have to translate from English to the language you're learning and vice versa. The app also uses your microphone so that you can repeat what you hear. However, you can opt to turn the mic off for a period of time.<br /><br />With this app, you can learn one or all the languages offered (Spanish, French, German, Italian). You will have to create an account (or sign in using Facebook), but the good thing about that is that if you install the app on different devices, your progress is maintained. I can use it on both my Kindle Fire HD 7 (although the mic feature is kind of iffy) and my Droid RAZR phone.<br /><br />This is a great way to learn a new language. Or, it can also be used to review a language you've already learned. My daughter is taking French 2 in high school, so this app helps to keep her mind sharp and helps her to review what she's already learned last year.<br /><br />Another great thing about this app is that it is also designed for people who are learning English as well. I would recommend this app for anyone who wants to learn or review a new language.
B00007M5CO|5.0|I first heard some some of these tracks on the DVD of my tango maestro's wedding, that my husband and I attended, in Buenos Aires, so anything that takes is back to BsAs is bound to be well received. The more I listen to this the more apparent is the artistry of the performers. &#34;Naranja in Flor&#34; is mesmerizing, and &#34;Perfume&#34; is genius.  &#34;Mi Corazon&#34; makes me laugh, and all of it is both listenable and danceable. When my son wrecked my car a few months ago, losing some of my CDs in the process, this was one of the first ones I replaced.

B008N9AASC|5.0|I FOUND MYSELF MESMERIZED.  It's like a video postcard to home-world from an alien visitor to Earth. (well...without explitly showing war.) I kept finding myself thinking \\"It sort of says everything pertinent about the current evolutional condition of mankind on Earth; and, what is not explicitly shown can readily be extrapolated by whoever might be interested in Earth-humanity's progress and/or lack thereof.  I mean, the ghastly wars need not be shown, since it would be an obviously war-prone world to an elevated race who sees the staggering evidence of disparity of poverty juxtaposed with conspicuous wealth at any cost.<br /><br />This is NOT TO SAY IT'S DEPRESSING---JUST PROFOUNDLY TELLING: THE LOVELY, THE WONDEROUS, AND THE CONSPICUOUS CORRUPTION OF A PLANETARY RACE WHICH HASN'T LEARNED TO REVERE LIFE AND NURTURE ITS OWN---YET.<br /><br />INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL FOR IT TELLINGNESS!! AS WELL AS LOVELINESS THAT HUMANITY AND EARTH CAN REFLECT.<br /><br />Forgive the capitals; I just needed to be emphatic.  This film can prove transporting in SO many important ways!
B00E1SM5UA|5.0|If you want to hear these wonderful classic Beatles tunes close to the original but in instrumental form, this CD is probably not for you, but if you love Al Di Meola's masterful technique and inimitable style interpreting some of his favorite Lennon/McCartney songs, then I think you will enjoy this. Be warned: On first listening without looking at the title listings, you might find some pieces initially unrecognizable, but give this great CD several plays and you will see a new depth to the songs and appreciate Al's treatment.  Di Meola is very reverential towards these pieces and I believe he honors them quite well.  Give this interpretative work a chance!
B00013F38K|3.0|I really enjoyed this series when I was growing up.  It has a lot of good learning lessons throughout the three season run.<br />However, this set for Season 1 had an area of scratches on the second disc that I was not happy with so I had to send it back.<br />Not saying it would not have played, but being brand new, it should not be scratched right out the box.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Love this Movie.. Its a must see! I would recommend it to everyone and Im definately going to buy the DVD

B00F91RYL8|4.0|Fun to watch, full of action and suspense from start to finish. I think they should have developed Pitt's character a little more but otherwise a good movie!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We loved it , but we had a problem viewing the last part of the tape . Do not know whats wrong , it could be damaged .
B00F91RYL8|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in awhile. Action packed from the beginning. I watched it twice and can still watch it over again.
B00F3HPELK|4.0|For those of us who have been following Krewella, this album feels a bit like a \\"greatest hits plus a few new tracks\\" album. Happy to see their greatest on there though (Killin' It, Come & Get It, Alive) since this album will be a lot of people's first taste of Krewella. New stuff is sick as well -- Ring of Fire, We Go Down, Dancing With the Devil are my personal favorites. Been seeing a lot of \\"I miss old Krewella\\" and \\"not filthy enough\\" across a lot of channels. All I can say is, this IS Krewella. It has the different energies you'd expect from them -- they're not just one of anything or any genre.<br /><br />So for people who aren't familiar with Krewella, I think this will be a unique listening experience and super fun. Those of us who have had Killin' It et al on repeat for the last year and a half, it's a nice addition to the library (but I definitely understand paying twice for songs we've had for a while, hence the 4 stars). That can be forgiven, though, when you factor in the free downloads they've been giving out for the past month or so (Party Monster, Alone Together), which are stronger/dirtier than some of the songs on the album anyway (if that's what you're looking for).<br /><br />4.5 if I could, but gotta go with the 4.<br /><br />Kudos to Kris, Jahan, and Yasmine -- can't wait to see what's next!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can not wait for the movie!  I hope it stays close to the book. The visuals should be amazing!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun and thrilling you have to get it!! It's thrilling exciting and the best game in the world. It is really slow loading when you open it but that is normal. All of my friends have it and we send challenges to one another.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This show truly is one of the best shows in ever!  I'll always go back and watch all the episodes. If only you could give more stars!
B003IEJZUG|5.0|First saw the movie and knew the book had to be even more substantive, and it was. It's a gold mine assignment for English and Literature instructors--from the boy's first naming after the most beautiful and pristine swimming pool that his revered, athletics-motivated Uncle ever swam in, to his abbreviated name PI...the constant...the ratio of the circle's circumference to its diameter--the Allness of a human spirit divided by the fine line between one's higher aspirations and one's more primeval/self-preservative nature--the dividing line between the shadow and the light. \\"Which story would you prefer to believe?\\" Pi asks at the end. \\"The tiger story or last one I told?\\"  This is either an initiation story of horrific but heroic consequences, or a horrific story of base survival tactics, full of psychological/emotional extremes and gruesome consequences. The author, who keep in mind, is also a character in the story himself, makes the statement that \\"the story does have a happy ending\\" and you can see the physical evidence that Pi's survival meant the continuation of the species and the family name  ('the end justified the means' sort of thing), but you also see evidence in Pi's demeanor that while he may appear to be at peace with whatever happened during his time adrift, crossing the ocean by the mere flow of life's currents that pushed him to the distant shore, that he deeply missed \\"the tiger\\" who never turned back to say goodbye.  Deep stuff indeed.  Loved it.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|What can I say? This is the ultimate edit of a seminal work.<br />I loved this move when I saw it as a young man.<br />As a grew up, and as my knowledge of film-making matured, I came to see it for what it is: A Classic.<br />A much beleaguered and initially under appreciated work, Bladerunner could have vanished into the vaults and fading memories of fans like me forever.<br />I'm so glad to know that another generation will be able to uncover it's genius.<br />The added features in this Blu-ray set are Superb.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very fun, exciting and addictive. Loved it! A very strong recommendation if you like puzzles, object find, and very neat levels. Makes you think.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Dungeon Hunter is a lot of fun, I'm surprised at the quality of the graphics on a mobile game. The animation was clunky in my first session, but once I logged out and logged back in it smoothed out. For now it seems like only the most basic equipment is free, but it is effective for the time being. The three potion limit is odd, but so far I haven't needed more. Over all it's fun, I would like to see updates in the game and in the series in the future.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is an intertwined story of Molly, a 17 year old vegetarian Goth in the foster system in Maine, and Vivian, a 93yr old woman who was once an Irish orphan sent out to Minnesota on an \\"orphan train.\\" Orphans were rounded up and sent out to be farmed out to families needing cheap (read \\"unpaid\\") labor or, if babies, adopted to childless couples.<br /><br />Vivian and Molly meet when Molly has to work off community service by helping Vivian clean her attic. The boxes in the attic are stuffed with mementos of Vivian's past. As the story unfolds, we change from New York and Minnesota of the early 20's, to current day Maine and Molly's life with her foster family. Naturally, there are a lot of parallels between an orphan of the 20's and a foster child who lost her father and who's mother is a druggie. The intertwined story is deftly done.<br /><br />My grandfather was an immigrant farmer in North Dakota (he later moved to Kansas to run a grocery store.) My mom's book club was reading this book and someone who knew her dad's background suddenly asked \\"Was your dad on the Orphan Train\\"? No, he was educated in New Jersey when he came off the boat in New York from Sweden (where he'd been a sailor after leaving Latvia.) He migrated west to farm. Not an orphan, but...a good question. How many of us who have Midwest roots have relatives who ended up transported out to farms because they were orphaned in New York City?<br /><br />The characters are well-drawn and the story has those gritty details that make you feel you are standing right there in the room with Vivian or Molly. I just couldn't put it down and read it all in one go. And I'll probably read it again, though it's a tough read in many places. The cruelty and neglect people dumped on the most unfortunate among them is downright despicable. No pity on the hired hand. Especially if it's a family-less child. Sad.
B005I548B4|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks' books! This is no exception. It's wonderfully balanced in love, lost love, hope and tragedy. There aren't necessarily a traditional happy ending to his books, but they are always fitting and always emotional. I love that you actually THINK while reading and how I always fall in love with the main characters. Flawed as they may be (and always are, as he is very good at describing real people and real emotions).<br /><br />Recommended!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I hope there will be a sequel to this book.  I'd love to know what new emotional growth the characters find, what journeys they now take, how they pass on this knowledge.<br /><br />I enjoyed the parallel narrative and the life is circular theme.  This book will be one to think back on for quite a while.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|It's a non stop ride, it's very different from the book but it's absolutely a great entertainment.  It looks to me like this is open to more sequels.
1402270275|4.0|Kiss of Steel is a mix of fantasy, romance and steampunk. It has vampires and werewolves, albeit in altered forms, as well as mystery, danger, intrigue and, of course, romance.<br /><br />The writing is excellent, the world is interesting, and the characters are layered. The story is gripping, the romance remains a part of the overall story rather than being the story, and the action is non-stop.<br /><br />Definitely a book worth reading.  Not your cookie-cutter vampire story!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This was a brand new processor and was exactly as described. The Price was good as well. I had no problems.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I read the reviews in Rotten Tomatoes and one of the reviewers mentioned this version, and thought it was better, and urgently recommend to see the original.  I borrowed (library) both.  I watched this one on one night and the American copy the next.  While the American one has more to the story, I thought it was really poor.  I truly don't understand why people prefer that one.  This version was touching and the chemistry of the main characters were genuine.<br /><br />The American version, I thought that there was no real chemistry, and they and the dialog was like cardboard.  The CGI (which this version has none) was terrible.  And in one part of the movie Oscar grabs a pole to take care of a bully and the bully calls it a stick!  Another thing (spoiler)they continually focus on the girls' bare feet, to show her resistance to the snow/cold.  There is more I could say.<br /><br />I know this is supposed to be a review on Let The Right One In and not remake, and not to review as to what it's not... I watched this movie again and got more out of it, especially the sound track which really sets the tone and heart of Eli and Oscar's relationship; both being outcasts of society (she is after all, a vampire)who find strength and worth in their friendship.  This version isn't as gory and in your face, over the top as the American version - which I guess appeals to that audience).  But if you like foreign films, or indy, or who enjoys the classics and likes a good story, then this is for you.  And get the soundtrack, it's really good.<br /><br />Also, the dubbing was done very well.  I didn't know it was dubbed until after I watched it.  Maybe I was too engaged in the story.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The action and passion were there. I fell in love with the characters and their every move. They are real. I am obsessed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very addictive, and well put together! I've played this game for hours without even putting any money into it! And most of all the game is FREE!!! I highly recommend downloading the game!

B00B10DZQE|5.0|My son's favorite movie.  He was seen this movie probably 10 times and now is very happy to &#34;own it&#34; and have it at the ready for road trips or plane rides.<br /><br />Movie is well made with good acting, lots of surf action and a compelling story of human resilience.  I can't remember what the rating is but it is suitable for most children, especially if they are into surfing.
B00F2362IE|4.0|My six year old loves it and plays it every chance she gets. She does wish they had a pink nija turtle though.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|This Batman movie I must say is on the same level as Batman & Robin or worse. The plot was horrible making the few times you actually saw Batman look like a pathetic wimp. The title was completely wrong in my opinion. I believe they should've called this movie \\"Catwoman Begins\\" because for the most part you don't see Batman much, but you see plenty of Catwoman.<br /><br />I liked the first two movies of this trilogy, but this film was just out of place. Lately, it seems that writers have no clue how to end trilogies. This film was a total dud, Iron man 3 was horribly written, and Transformers 3 was good, but could've been better. Hollywood needs better writers or editors or both of them. I wish they would stop ruining such great stories with horrible films like these.
0393035158|5.0|In my quest towards the truth and liberation, I discovered this book, through the readings of other authors such as Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, both of which I highly admire. Sam Harris not only postulates his positions with intense virtuosity, but also provides convincing and supporting evidence to substantiate his ideas, whether it is through the scope of history, science, psychology and current events, statistics and trends. I appreciated the footnotes and the bibliography section to enable readers to conduct further research and observation. The arrangement of chapters and the details provided makes this book a pleasure to read similiar to reference material, while refraining from being too academic or boring. For most portions of the book I agreed with all of the author's sentiments; however, there is a section where Sam Harris edifies the notion of American exceptionalism and intervention throughout the world, seemingly at all cost in order to combat so-called terrorism and opposing ideas mainly of religious doctrines, even in some cases justifies hostile military force. He also contends that policies and actions by America are nearly immune to reproach, because of the perceived good intentions and morality to a degree of the ends justifying the means, based on the premise that it is of American interests to defeat an opposing mindset. While I firmly disagree with the author's assessments in this regard, the book in my opinion is worthy of being considered a classic and standard-bearer within the scope of this subject matter. This wonderfully written classic is well worth the investment, for the facts and discourse are most certainly thought provoking and in some realms controversial. This book ranks within the realms of great written works such as The God Delusion, God is not Great and the Portable Atheist.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|While it was neat how they gave Tony PTSD, I feel that they overdid it and really made this movie the most PC of this trilogy. The way they made the War Machine into the Iron Patriot was pointless, and why even have him in the movie when he does basically nothing but get captured? They should've called this \\"Fiberglass Man 3\\" due to how the suits that could handle so much damage, even getting whacked by Thor's hammer, fell apart so easily is stupid. My thought also is how can he still be Iron Man and power the suits if the power source for them is gone, thanks to having his \\"mini-arc reactor\\" taken out and throwing it in the ocean?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|GOOD FUN! Fun in our house from 7 to 71. Now we just argue who's turn it is! Just give it a try.

B00D7NWTSI|5.0|I'm not a super hero nut, eventually it becomes dry and loses meaning however, with Iron Man 3. Its a masterpiece.<br /><br />Since the 'Avengers' stunned the world I've been eager to watch the next chapter, as a huge Marvel fan I was not going to miss this. The movie is brilliant, the plot is genius!<br /><br />Positives: 1: Downey is superb as Stark 2: Cheadle is simply brilliant 3: Guy Pearce really shines as Killian 4: Harley was great 5: The humor is great and not overused 6: The plot is superb 7: The visuals are stunning<br /><br />Negatives: 1: My only complaint is the lack of MENTION as to where S.H.I.E.LD are.<br /><br />Many believe this to be the final Iron Man movie and Downey will only appear in the Avengers sequels. If so, they couldn't have done it better. This is simply one of the best, only beaten by the Avengers. Amazing.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Certainly not the most authentic Grisham book, but the storytelling was classic Grisham. If you can decide from page one to simply read this book for entertainment and refrain from analyzing its plausibility, it is highly entertaining.  I had a lot of fun reading it.

B009V3KKXY|4.0|The preview is good -( LOOK INSIDE) but the books it's self is chucked full of so many more<br />Knots. It is defiantly worth it. I bought it in kindle format which is even better.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love how informative this app is.  It gives me all the information I need in one place, and it's easy to navigate to more of the information I want.  For example:  I have a widget set up to tell me the current temp, and the high/low for the day....and it also gives me the forecast for tomorrow.  Then, I just touch it, and it goes into more detail.  It's super easy to navigate to the hourly forecast and the 10 day forecast, etc.  LOVE THAT!<br />I didn't give it 5 stars because it has some features I'm not excited about.  1) I cannot get rid of the current temp from my notification bar.  2) The widget is very unattractive.  I liked my previous one much better for it's asthetic features (it was slightly transparent so you could see my wallpaper underneath, and it had a big clock for me....I pretty much exclusively use my phone for telling the time these days).  Overall, it was worth getting for me....but I still don't like the way it messed up the look of my home screen.
B00CP4RZCU|5.0|This is a wonderful acoustic live double CD release titled 'Unblackened' (23 tracks) by the band Black Label Society (BLS). Coming from their critically acclaimed acoustic CD release titled 'The Song Remains Not The Same' in 2011, these double CDs take acoustic live music to higher level in my book. The music was recorded live in Club Nokia, LA on 6th March 2013. Zakk Wylde, a prolific band leader of BLS is a great guitarist of note who also plays piano in this live CD release and he is just as wonderful and comfortable on the piano as he is on guitar. Check out some great guitar works in the tracks \\"Sold My Soul\\", \\"Road Back Home\\", \\"Spoke In The Wheel\\", \\"Queen Of Sorrow\\", \\"Rust\\", \\"I Thank You Child\\" & latin flavoured speedy guitar playing in the tracks \\"Takillya (Estyabon)\\" & \\"Speedball\\". Wonderful piano playing in the tracks \\"House Of Doom\\", \\"Sweet Jesus\\", \\"In This River\\", \\"Song For You\\" & \\"Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow\\".<br /><br />Disc 1 (11 tracks): this is the 'more rockier' of the two CDs. Apart from a 'bit noisy' track \\"Losin' Your Mind\\", the overall the sound quality of this CD is great. Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks (wonderful guitar work/piano playing with orchestral sound, melody & vocals) \\"Sold My Soul\\", \\"Road Back Home\\", \\"Spoke In The Wheel\\", \\"Sweet Jesus\\", \\"In This River\\" & the closing \\"Throwin' It All Away\\".<br /><br />Disc 2 (12 tracks): this is the more mellow of the two discs. Quality of sound of the CD is great. Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks \\"I Thank You Child\\", \\"Won't Find It Here (Unblackened Version)\\" (great orchestral sound, wonderful speedy guitar solo/'acoustic overdrive'), \\"Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow\\" (beautiful piano playing & orchestral sound), \\"Takillya (Estyabon)\\" & \\"Speedball\\".<br /><br />On overall, BLS presents themselves as a powerful live band in this double CD release titled 'Unblackened': incredible acoustic song arrangements, playing and production. BLS in my book really takes live music to another level. A highly recommended CD listening for your pleasure.

B00DURHYWC|5.0|The 18 months odyssey in the making of this CD release titled 'Get Happy' (16 tracks) by Thomas Lauderdale and the lads Pink Martini is a rewarding combination of classical, cabaret, jazz & latin musical styles that would make Phyllis Diller \\"Smile\\" wherever she is. Actress and comedienne Phyllis Diller who's featured in Charlie Chaplin's track \\"Smile\\", it was her final recording with Pink Martini before passing on. It was then that the quest was spurred on by the band Pink Martini to make a credible follow-up to their 2009 critically acclaimed CD release 'Splendor In The Grass' as well as an excellent farewell bid to their friend Phyllis Diller. The 16 tracks were selected and arranged by Thomas Lauderdale and the outfit Pink Martini hosts an array of numerous and diverse guest artists including cabaret sensation Meow Meow featured in the track \\"Zundoko\\", French eccentric Phillipe Katerine featured together with China Forbes in the track \\"Yo Te Quiero Simpre\\", radio superstar Ari Shapiro featured in the incredible track \\"Je Ne T'aime Plus\\", The von Trapps featured together with Rufus Wainwright in the delightful track \\"What'll I Do\\" & Rufus Wainwright who is also featured in the second track \\"Get Happy / Happy Days\\" just to mention but a few guests.<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks \\"Ich Dich Liebe\\" (opening orchestral/classical track with a wonderful melody and vocals), \\"Quiza's, Quiza's, Quiza's\\" (latin jazzy/classical track featuring China Forbes), \\"Je Ne T'aime Plus\\" (beautiful orchestral base track on this jazzy/classical song with a great melody & vocals), \\"She Was Too Good To Me\\" (a slow-tempo jazzy track with wonderful piano playing and enjoyable sweepy drumkit), \\"Kitty Come Home\\" (wonderful classical track with a great melody & vocals featuring Storm Large) & \\"What'll I Do\\".<br /><br />On overall, modern Exotica / Easy Listening band Pink Martini has a great album release in 'Get Happy': wonderful tracks, music is well executed and produced. A highly recommended CD listening for your pleasure.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Another great story,  I was afraid that I'd have difficulty getting back into the characters, but Mr Archer masterfully wove enough details into the telling that I picked the story right up from the first chapter. Looking forward to the continued story!
B00EMIE0CA|4.0|Contemporary jazz supergroup Spyro Gyra (for 30 years in the music industry) has tried in this CD release titled 'The Rhinebeck Sessions' (9 tracks) something new that it has n't done before: an impromptu jamming and improvisation sessions over three days in a studio in Rhinebeck, NY. The result is this entertaining contemporary jazz CD: typical jazz sounds dominated by great horns playing (7 tracks) and a welcome surprising 2 tracks with incredible sweet & different arrangements as compared to the rest of the album in the tracks \\"Clubhouse Jam\\" (a 'stacato' track with great guitar/piano playing) and \\"Who Knew!\\". The tracks may only be nine but tracks are relatively longer with a total of 56:14 playing time.<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks \\"Sorbet\\" (up-tempo track with a great melody and horn playing), the 'stacato' arrangement tracks \\"Clubhouse Jam\\" and \\"Who Knew!\\".<br /><br />On overall, the supergroup Spyro Gyra has taken a gamble in this new CD 'Rhinebeck Sessions': time will tell if the gamble will pay-off and see their fans embrace these jams sessions.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Much like the original movie with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, I found the movie a bit on the boring side.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Truth be told, I didn't have any interest whatsoever in Star Trek until J.J. Abrams got his hands on the franchise. I really enjoyed the first reboot film and I genuinely liked this one as well. Sure, there are things I didn't get since I'm not a hardcore fan; however, the film still had enough action, humor and great acting to carry the movie even through the moments of muddled confusion.<br /><br />The movie is about prowess, sacrifice and the bond of people with differences, even at a time of conflict. I did find the films undertones to be a bit darker than the previous film, but it was still an amazing film and look forward to the sequel.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|This movie has some of the best music ever and the most outlandish cars chases ever seen. Belushi and Akroyd rock!
B00F91G5BS|1.0|No plot, no character development, no suspense. Looks like the whole thing was filmed on a soundstage in two days then some nerd spent a month on the graphics. Hollywood can't make a timeless film anymore.
B00634GHJA|5.0|The app is very easy to use and has worked very well do far. I have been able to transfer my pictures from my phone to my Kindle.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this disband great game for families with young children ages 2. and older. I highly recomind this game on family...
B00000J2SP|1.0|I listened to this cd  four time's thru and that's enough for me. i'm taking it and some other clunker's I have to my favorite music store and trading 'em in,i'm done buying Rainbow !
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Actually this season it's not the best I follow the series and need this to complete my collection, great quality
B00000J2SR|3.0|well,i read a number of review's,i like the rainbow cd ''right between the eye's''.this is not in the same league. the only song I like is ''street of dream's''.the rest is filler.where's the guitar solo's? where's the ''hook'' in the lyric ?not very memorable for me,NEXT !!!
B004J2TPSI|5.0|It's perfect, do all and is very simple and connect with mi PSP perfectly, now I'm testing with a 3DS and the same doesn't bother you when you have your console in your hands
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I like it because you can find anything you are looking for. I recommend it highly. People make use of it. I have used google for a long time
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|i like this game its fun to play<br />I will play the game more and let people know about it
B0063GORYU|5.0|Super and like it very much.  Let the dust collect around me !  LOL. I agree with the person who would not like to admit how many hours of playing time has been racked up.
B0012BV9FG|4.0|It's heavy plastic with good skin detail.  Most impressive is its solidness - my son can beat the you-know-what out of it and it's fine.  It has no moving parts, so you have to let it stand, or you can pick it up as a whole unit (AND CRUSH STUFF!!! - oops! I said too much).  The fun (noises, movement, etc.) comes from your kid's imagination - which I love.
B0009VSB06|5.0|This was our first metal detector and we have been using it every weekend since we bought.  It works great and is very easy to use.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Setup was not to difficult but it was not seamlessly either. The dongle requires a power source either usb or outlet, so you don't just plug it into an hdmi port.<br /><br />The biggest problems with this is the lack of apps for it,reliability,latency and performance.<br /><br />In regards to the lack of apps you can use the chromecast extension on a PC with the chrome web browser , but that is not up to par. The extension is in beta and acts like its in beta. The sound and video can lag when casting from your pc web browsser tab and can be out of sync at times as well. The other beta option with the extension is to mirror your pc which also lags but doesn't provide sound. So that basically nulls using the extension as a reliable and non annoying work around to the lack of apps.<br /><br />It has huge potential but as of now its not worth even the 35 bucks unless you want to stream netflix and youtube from a device with no other means to do it.
B00B1ME3DQ|4.0|Fully content not to so much as break new ground (or Earth) as make an album that all of their fans will love, Maryland stoner metallers Clutch emerge onto the scene with full-length number ten in 2013. Said year's \\"Earth Rocker\\" finds the band taking a much heavier, angrier, and more guitar-oriented approach than on their most recent previous outings, thus recapturing the sound achieved in their glory days (i.e. think \\"Blast Tyrant\\" and before). And yes, there might be still some blues rock influence prevalent here (particularly in the ballad-esque sections of songs), but \\"E.R.\\" is far and away first and foremost a stoner metal effort. The end result is one of the heaviest, nastiest, and most metallic things that Clutch have ever recorded, and easily one of the best hard rock recordings of the year. (And on the whole, it sounds like early Black Sabbath jelling with \\"II\\"-era Led Zeppelin, Monster Magnet, Ozzy Osbourne, Jethro Tull, Soundgarden/Audioslave, and Thin Lizzy -- a Clutch tour mate that traveled the globe with them just prior to this recording.)<br /><br />This newfound musical hunger and vigor possessed by the band reaches almost epic levels on such raucous standouts as \\"Crucial Velocity\\" (a big riff-rocker that evokes vintage Down, what with its John Bonham-approved thumping, crashing drum beats, meaty, downtuned guitar licks, and very decent soloing), \\"The Face,\\" and \\"Unto The Breach\\" (which is an up-tempo riff-fest that sprinkles some niftily memorable, wah-wah-inflected guitar leads into its mix of dense, Black Sabbath-derived riffing). But in addition to all of this whole-hearted heaviness, there are other bases covered, here, as well, thus making \\"Earth Rocker\\" more of a meticulous and well-rounded affair. For proof of this, proceed directly to the record's centerpiece, \\"Gone Cold,\\" a Southern rock/bluegrass-flavored acoustic-strummed ballad; and \\"Book, Saddle, & Go\\" which is a piece of almost straight-up grunge, as it follows the Alice In Chains-patented, soft-hard, verse-chorus structuring. (As a result, the tune's choruses are made into really memorable ones, as they lumber out of the speakers with heavy, crunching, churning guitar licks.)<br /><br />There are highlights found elsewhere, too, like in the album's rousing opening title cut (which is complete with anthemic, hooky choruses, and Mastodon-themed vocals), the Jimi Hendrix-influenced vocal and lyricism in \\"The Wolf Man Kindly Requests...,\\" and \\"D.C. Sound Attack.\\" The last of these three songs boasts some catchy, Rush-like swing and swagger, as well as moving, bullyingly heavy walls of sludgy, droning guitars, deft and inventive drum fills (a and propulsive drum intro and some ringing cowbell crashes included). \\"D.C. Sound Attack\\" also makes use of the occasional blast of what-sounds-like a stabbing harmonica, thus recalling some Motorhead and UFO stuff. But it is track nine, \\"Cybord Bette,\\" that is the album's epic. It finds frontman Neil Fallon singing about such topics as \\"firepower\\" (among other things), and very fittingly so, too, because it is a fast and fiery metal song that boldly showcases the guitarists' pyrotechnic skills (i.e. brutal, Zepp-meets-Sabb riffage, catchy, wah wah/whammy bar licks, and rambunctious leads).<br /><br />As hinted at in previous paragraphs, Clutch sound uncannily hungry on \\"Earth Rocker.\\" And this works out very well for the listener, because while the band might sound like they are starving, they are certainly not lacking musical skill or songwriting prowess. And as a result of this, they have produced a piece of music that is sure to completely satisfy hard rock listeners everywhere.tented, soft-hard, verse-chorus structuring.

B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|i just bought the full version and already a snag. the &quot;back&quot; panel on girls HO hides the last crayon!!!! i cant continue without it!!!!!
B00BOXZAG6|3.0|\\"Upside Down\\" starts with an unusual vision of dual planets close to each other, but the French-Canadian movie is primarily a love story about two lovers from totally different worlds. In this unique universe any communication between the rich \\"Up Above\\" and the poor \\"Down Below\\" is strictly forbidden. Also, it is physically impossible for the people of the Down planet to live on the other planet, and vice versa, because, due to the \\"double gravity,\\" they would be \\"falling\\" onto the ceiling.<br /><br />Adam (Jim Sturgess), inventive resident of Down, infiltrates a big company, disguising himself as an employee from Up, in order to meet again Eden (Kirsten Dunst), a girl from Up he met in the mountains ten years ago.<br /><br />The \\"double gravity\\" of the film is the force that divides the people into two. The stark contrast between the haves and have-nots is nothing new in sci-fi films these days (as seen in \\"In Time\\" and the new \\"Total Recall\\"), but in \\"Upside Down\\" the conflict is visually presented by the upward/downward force.<br /><br />The interesting concept serves as a metaphor for social issues like North-South divide, but it becomes tiring pretty quickly. The characters are not fleshed out enough, and action is often confusing. The most disappointing part is the ending, where it looks like the director suddenly stops telling the story as if he could not think of any better idea.<br /><br />\\"Upside Down\\" has stunning visuals of the dual planets, but is in need of a story that can interest us for more than 90 minutes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game because it gives a challenge and a different one everyday and a different mission every time you complete one, making this game always interesting and fun
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Light and dark. Standing alone and with family. Loosing everything, then being rebuilt to be so much more.<br />Masterfully written!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|The science is engaging, the characters are well developed, the plot is fantastic! I loved every minute of this book.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Gets back to basics that the cave man didn't have three squares and your body actually functions well with minimum food for periods of time.  Anyone can do that !
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Full exposed tang (the strongest design possible), 1095 high carbon steel (time tested and proven), comfortable decent scales,,drop point design with full length spine (great for battoning), nice thumb ramp for normal control and finger choil for more detailed work, slightly recurve design for nice woodwork up close and just enough belly out there for enough weight for light chopping. Did I mention it was thick? Just at a quarter of an inch. decent sheath. No its not American made but for $40 it is what it is- a great deal.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I didn't know if my kids aged 8 and 10 would like it as much as I did, but they thoroughly enjoyed the puzzles, and got a lot of satisfaction from seeing the intricate devices and pictures click into place as the game progressed.<br />The optional clues feature is nice:  doesn't give away the game, and doesn't give the answer immediately, but nudges you in the right direction.  Fantastic game.
B00021HBGS|5.0|Great toy for kids to play with during bath time to keep them entertained and engaged! They stick well and kids can lear about planes, cars, trucks, etc.!
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|We've started on season 2 which I is overdramatized.  This is a fictional, cute show.  I always enjoy when two plots can weave together to reach their climax at the same time.
B00D3LA5WG|2.0|It is just not my type of movie. I wouldn't recommend it to Natthew MaConaghey fans! That says it all!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love games when i am bored or on road trips. this keeps me occupied and not asleep on the road trip
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is such a great film!  It was funny and sad in parts and was also a learning experience about the South in days gone by and depicted such poignant experiences from the perspective of &#34;the help&#34; as well as from all the other characters. I had read the book but the film made the experiences described in the book really come to life.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I cant use any other website. i love google and this app is awesome. its fast and very effecient. :)
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|Gutsy musical/drama with a very talented cast.  It works very well, I liked it greatly.  It was a satisfying experience.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Such  lovely book. Although I left me absolutely gutted at parts, I loved the powder of love, strength, and friendship in this book.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Very happy with The Weather Channel Ap.  Easy to use, quick and accurate.  Just check it each night, most times weather next day is as forecast,  which helps when planning the coming day.  DEBE.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|high production quality, surprising new approach to zombie concept, Brad Pitt is a very like-able character and it is nice to see an action hero portrayed as intelligent and caring not just a big powerful oaf.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|Yes a very scary movie.It managed to be quite realistic. It delivered the unexpected and had a good story line.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is very entertaining and grabs you in and you just can't stop playing it. My kids really enjoy it when we are needing to pass some time.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I found the book to be fascnating. I did not realize there were such trains. The book has two stories en twined and I felt the author did a great job with that. The book was heart wrenching at times. I would highly recommend it.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Jim Caviezel does a great job. I liked the blend of a future and Viking story line.<br />Scenes, costumes and sets seemed realistic. I enjoyed the movie. A fan of<br />Jim Caviezel.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this is a shocking version for the kindle fire hd. nothing but trouble and glitches, i have deleted and downloaded this ap 3 times and no change. News feed is not able to be changed and i have no 'new' updates showing up at all. Constant forced stops and half my vroups have gone missing. Very disappointed
B009QW7HMC|5.0|The Walking Dead is amazing overall, from the first episode I knew five minutes into it, it was going to cause me to binge watch. Luckily Netflix (can I say that?) had season 1 and 2. However due to my addiction, I needed to see season 3 literally after the last episode of season 2 ended. I purchased it from Amazon. It was a little costly, but was worth it, especially compared to the gouge iTunes wanted! I highly recommend this show. It has been one of the best shows I have ever watched. The special effects are amazing, not to mention the cast and plot. Season 3 moved away from \\"The Walkers\\" slightly for my taste, but still! The complications between human beings in an apocalyptic \\"society\\" were pretty spot on! You must buy this!
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|I think it shouldnt hav high expectations when the cost is worth what you receive!; its worth the time! Works though
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Yes, I borrowed someone else's title for the review because it summed it up so perfectly.  Erin Morgenstern did a masterful job with this book.  The imagery is amazing, the story is enthralling.  And while you don't want it to end, when it does, it leaves you in a good place.  (And how often does that ever happen with a book?!)<br /><br />While I half hope they make this into a movie just to see the Circus in another medium, I hope they do as good of a job as the author did writing it.<br /><br />You do need to pay attention to the dates at the beginning of the chapters though because it does go back and forth between two time periods.<br /><br />Erin, please write more books!
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Well written and intriguing.  Might be more of a woman's book, but i really enjoyed it ad have recommended ti to many peoplle.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I love the way Khaled takes me for a journey into the lives of his characters.  In his books I discover the perseverance of humanity (the good side and the bad).  His books stay with me, and touch me in ways that I think makes me a little more compassionate, appreciative and understanding person.<br />I recommend everyone to read at least one, especially Westerners.
B00F88GRSS|1.0|Yes, yes, I know Michael Douglas won an emmy for this.  And I agree - he did a terrific job of portraying Liberace. And Matt Damon was pretty good too.  But the movie itself was incredibly bad. The stereotypes were embarrassing.  The movie was incredibly slow.  Though based on a true story, of course, the plot was predictable, down to the very smallest detail.  It was hard to have compassion for any of the characters.  I couldn't wait for it to end.
B005SDMDRW|5.0|First time reading michael's short stories but they are just as intriguing as the bigger novels. I love the characters and plot lines are always exciting
1594203334|4.0|Found this book to be very readable and entertaining while providing perspective and insight about a logical method of parenting. This appears to work better at providing a framework for solid, well mannered kids who grow into strong adults without the need for constant propping up and reassurance. Our American constant managing of our kids lives seems to provide the subliminal message that they are incapable of doing so themselves.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|A great read, I did not want to put it down, real life story of prison life. I would highly recommend it!
B000001GQP|5.0|I love this interpretation. Ozawa did a great job and the sonics are still very good, even if they are ananlog
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was so excited after seeing Hunger Games and reading the book to get into the second and see what happened next! I thoroughly enjoyed this book and was shocked at how it ended but it left me wanting more so I bought Mockingjay and started it immediately on finishing Catching Fire. Wonderful books, well written and captivating!
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|I was at a party when someone pulled out this book and a lot of laughing ensued. I gave it to my daughter and she frequently carries it with her. Super funny and lots of great ideas to be grumpier.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Cannot wait for the movie! This series was incredible! I thoroughly enjoyed it! I couldn't wait until the next available moment I had to read and then I had trouble putting it down.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Mr. Aslan does a wonderful service by taking the incredible diversity of opinion, factionalism, mysticism and historical records of early Christianity and makes logical sense of it. My only criticism, and it's a minor one, is that he doesn't take the results of the Nicean creed and project it strongly enough against his thesis of Jesus as a devoutly Jewish revolutionary, who may have recoiled at the ideal that his Christhood became.
B00B5DWI2O|5.0|I choose to buy this product because i first heard of Olafur as composer of the soundtrack of &#34;Broad church&#34;. i went on line and became enraptured by his free downloads and purchased this product. This is similar to Flesh Quartet ( Wallender) and I love the  soulful violin, piano and the edgy electronics
0307742997|4.0|I got this book which was recommended to me years ago when I bought the Stieg Larsson Dragon Tatoo trilogy.  So far so good.  I am a slow reader so it will be a while before I finish it.  It started off nicely so I have good expectations about it.
B009JZZRGE|2.0|I've liked this series a lot, but the relationship between Kalinda and her husband is mutually violent and repulsive. This whole season has gone down hill.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I'll admit to not having completely downloaded this app.  I cannot have an app on my Kindle that gives my son the ability to spend money freely buying tokens or whatever during the game.  When I tried to disallow his ability to buy things, the app would not open.  Following the directions given did not work.  It was a great disappointment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Game for entertainment when you need a quick pick up one as it stops and starts quickly.  The more you run the more points your receive if you don't fall to often
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Think this was one where all the best parts are in the trailers.<br />As the plot moved along, it just seemed disjointed, and even though it was a comedy, they seemed too hard to make it believable, and not succeeding at it.<br /><br />Still good for some laughs.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I enjoyed seeing the collaboration of Michael's finest work. Watching this took me back to the days when misuc meant something. Great movie!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It had so much suspense and action I felt like I couldn't stop reading it. I usually don't enjoy reading but this book made me want to read. I would recommend this to anyone who has read the first book because this one is just as good as the first or maybe even better. I would highly recommend reading this because this is one of my favorite books and I can't wait to read the one after this.
B002HFWBUS|5.0|So many stars...how does Tarantino involve so many people?  I've watched this dozens of times and I'm surprised when my girlfriends went, &#34;Ewww...this is your favorite?&#34;  Still is.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|Good Book to read, keep a open mind thru the whole series, allows for interesting conversation. I enjoy them all.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Each Star Trek series introduces different elements of diversity that mirror our culture. Then they takes situations and events in our daily lives and shows ways to adapt and learn from each other. Love these shows!
B005OTGS4E|4.0|I am a big Sean Bean fan and have been collecting all his films.<br />You might call this a B movie, not the usual Hollywood style, but it was actually a very good WWII movie.<br />Loved their British accents, the bad guy was evil and had enough action to keep you happy.
B005V20JKI|1.0|I had the full paid app of this game and with the latest update I can no longer access half the game. Bad form angry mob. .
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The book was it seemed a work in progress. It held you from the minute that you started to read. You could almost feel yourself moving along in the journey with the author. It was very spiritual and enlightning. The only possible drawback were some of the big words. I would recommend this book.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was a good way to pass time, entertaining, a little predictable, yet still enjoyable.  I recommend it for a rainy day read.
B008602KQI|3.0|I was disappointed and I thought the action just about me fall asleep. The seemed like a movie was thrown together in a short amount of time.
1476727651|5.0|This is king in great form, a wonderful sequel to the shining. The story of Dan and the overlook taken to new places !
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I wanted to get my girlfriend into to this show since it is currently in the last season. $20.00 and 2 day deliver with Prime is a hard deal to pass up. Item arrived on time and in great condition. Thanks!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book! It is an amazing read and I recommend it for everyone. It really teaches you how people feel and makes you more cautious.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I couldn't stop playing it once i downloaded it. I have spent countless hours playing the angry bird series and now i have another series to play. l
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|Don't let the bad reviews fool you. I cried at the end. Will smith and his son are great the only complaint is that I wish it was longer. I can't believe the reviews are bad. WATCH FOR YOUR SELF!!!!
B000VWYNNW|5.0|Led Zep Rocks! Excellent performance & album. Expanded content great too! I would recommend to any hard rocker. Enjoy! Peace!
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Excellent book, easy to read and hard to put it down ! One of those books which i would read again!
B00F35BV64|5.0|If you're a Trekkie or even if you're just a fan of the Star Trek movies you will (or do already) love this movie. The new generation of Star Trek films make excellent use the &#34;alternate reality&#34; scenario in creating riveting & emotionally charged story lines carefully sprinkled with continuity content & characters. Excellent flick, well-done!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved the book and would recommend to those who are looking for an easy read and who love twists in the story.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I can't put these books down, they are so engaging! I am downloading the Kindle books now for the following novels to finish up this series. I read the prequil Clockword series first and I have to admit I do enjoy those characters a bit more but the books are still great.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Each time I have tried to sign into my kik, it always has error or something. I know there is nothing wrong with my kindle or internet connection.....please fix the app -.-
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|retract the death certificate, rewind the mortal coil, and unbury the dreams - carcass is back with a new album! it is SO good to see these guys active again. i saw them live a few years ago at the Trocadero in Philly and they absolutely destroyed it! i have had Heartwork in constant rotation since it came out when i was in college.<br /><br />surgical steel is a strong release - i have listened through the album in its entirety about 6 times. all the amazing guitar harmonies are there, the signature vocals, and there's some really catchy riffage. they've returned to their roots and grind it like no one else. i went back and forth on 4 or 5 stars and ended up on 5 stars. i was originally comparing this to Heartwork, which didn't seem fair after some thought, and then i decided to let this album stand on its own. great stuff, very much looking forward to seeing them live again. stand-out tracks on the album for me:<br /><br />thrasher's abattoir<br />a congealed clot of blood<br />the master butcher's apron<br />noncompliance to astm...<br />316L grade sugical steel
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this app is the best for kindle fire. it does exactly as u say. It will help you stay alert .:-)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love it, fast, colorful, lots of countries to visit and ways to get more items to bingo with.  Competitive and chat in all rooms
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Suits has done a fantastic job with their character development. You know someone (or wish you knew someone) just like each of the characters. I love this show!
B005PK553C|5.0|I discovered this show after season 1 and 2 were originally aired.  I cannot stop watching....it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  If you like a good thriller/horror, this is sure to please.  Anxiously awaiting season 3 starting in October on FX.
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|My 12 year old son LOVED this dragon rider; it made his day when we received this in the mail.  Schleich really puts out quality items and this one is probably our favorite to date.  So much detail, it's simply gorgeous.  My son likes to play with it, causing the dragon rider to attack his Lego towns - so much fun!  I marked it high in education because I believe that using your imagination is of great educational value.  The dragon rider is also hefty and has a really nice quality feel to it, so I marked it high as durable.  Overall I'd recommend this to any collector of dragons, or anyone who knows a child who would love to have a new villain to attack their Lego towns.
B009EEVMC8|5.0|If you are a Christian, and even if you're not, this a must see movie. This movie will move even the hardest hearts.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|This was a very enjoyable vampire romance.  While I was expecting suspense and passion and love and danger - all of which was delivered ... In addition there were several parts where I literally burst out laughing.  The story line was intriguing and definitely had my interest throughout the book.  Don't miss out on reading this one.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was a good read...surprising twist.  Sad story that comes full circle in the end.  Good over bad triumphs - I enjoyed it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Starts slow but picks up.  Sort of like the movie \\"Crash\\" where there is a few clusters of main characters yet everyone is intertwined.  Good read.
B0093QHWLC|5.0|Love every star in this movie.  Great performances. Really sad story that made me cry a few times.  Worth watching again.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|This is probably the only Stephen King movie I've ever thought ranked as \\"near greatness\\".  Had no clue about the story, or anything related to this movie, going in.  Starts as a solid movie, and just gets better and better as it goes on.<br /><br />But the ending...  without a doubt one of the most memorable endings to a movie ever.  Talk about guts, for the filmmakers to do what they did....
B0012GMXBK|4.0|Accepts 5th effort is an another classic German metal monster attack. With the opening song with a Eastern feeling into the driving sound they are famous for. Awesome !! Their following tracks such \\"Up to the limit\\" are powerful and catchy! Any Accept fan or metalhead needs this in their collection to complete it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I listened to this book on audible and it was so good. I am so grateful for my life and so grateful to have a book bring our focus of blessing to mind
B009XIXVU6|4.0|READS LIKE A SLOW SOUTHERN BOOK ... LOTS OF INTERESTING CHARACTERS BLENDED INTO THE HOMELAND. THE AUTHOR HAS A DEFINITE FEEL OF THE COUNTRY.
B00AK77WPE|4.0|MUSIC OUT OF THIS WORLD. BETTER VIDEO BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. I WAS WONDERING DO YOU HAVE THIS ONE ON BLUE RAY ALSO ?/
B009FTAH3W|2.0|Book's core ideas are good... brilliant for that matter. If... and only if... there was a story. Had lots of expectations but found it difficult to complete. Had to skim through the last few chapters in the end.
B0027UY8B8|5.0|The script of Battlestar Galactica is perfect, the production is amazing and the performances are some of the best in the genre. This show is breathtaking from begining to end. If you are into Sci-Fi you need this collection. The Blu Ray edition is the perfect way to enjoy the beauty of this show on HD.
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|It did not work on my kindle I bought it and I  can't find it so it did not work
B00AEBB8H4|5.0|A really nice movie, full of comedy and sparks betwen Grant and Kelly. The film restoration is neat and clean on the close shots and midrange takes, the audio is perfect. Charming elegance on every detail of the script. Highly recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think this book is a good book for me. I like the fact that katniss is nice she stands up for more rights.I think it's wrong that president snow sent all the prievros victurs in the arena.
B00BF2RTO2|4.0|A great concert from Iron Maiden, I must admit that the first 5 minutes the image suffer because of the red lighting of the stage nevertheless after that the restoration of the film is neat and spotless. The audio is near perfect.
159420411X|5.0|Statistics for everyone to understand...you don't have to be a mathematician to enjoy this book. I also loved Silver's interview on YouTube..what a sharp mind.
B005QUQP76|3.0|Pros: Up to 5700 DPI and 1000Hz polling. These are the most important features for a gaming mouse, everything else is preferential. I like the left and right click on this mouse; short travel and just enough tactile feedback to avoid friendly fire incidents. The finish feels nice even after hours of gaming and doesn't absorb palm sweat. All the buttons can be mapped to keyboard keys except the sniper button. Cable is long enough to not make me wish it was wireless and is made from braided nylon so it doesn't tangle or get caught on my desk easily. Oh, and did I mention that it looks badass?<br /><br />Cons: Drivers, drivers, drivers. Like other people said, the driver software for this mouse is a nightmare. I did the initial configuration and then saved it to the mouse so the damn Corsair utility didn't have to run in the tray all the time. Never did figure out how to record macros, but many multiplayer games ban macros anyway so I wasn't worried about it. The center mouse button (the scroll wheel click) requires far too much pressure to register a click. The adjustable weight is rather pointless, as most gamers want the lightest weight possible so long as it glides smoothly. I thought the sniper button would be useful, but as I became a more experienced gamer I found that it only interfered with my muscle memory, or worse, I would accidentally press it and throw off my whole twitch.<br /><br />Conclusion: There are much better options out there. This mouse has the most important core features for a gaming mouse but the tough center really is really a deal-breaker regardless of what your personal preferences are in a mouse.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I've never written a review before, but this book really touch me. It will make you rethink your life and return to the hurts in your own past. I felt so many emotions in the two days it took me to read this book.
0802473156|5.0|This book is a must read for new couples and old alike. It opened my eyes to how each of us perceive love differently. When we become aware of how our mates feel loved, it becomes so much easier to meet their needs and give them the love they really deserve. Loving is so much better than fighting!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|You create your own reality and if you doubt it, read this book and do the exercises in it. We can all take responsibility in our lives for helping things go our way. Yes, you might have some deep-seated baggage that isn't moving, but you CAN help create a better life with your thoughts and words and habits. We're so lazy with our thoughts. If we paid more attention every minute, our lives WOULD be better.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|This book is a great found for any working woman that starts wondering what is more important in her life - love or career. The book helps to re-discover your goals and dreams and continue to fight for starts!
B005PK57NU|4.0|Well written and acting is great.  Story dialog has stayed fresh.  Could lose the sex scenes.  Love the characters and how they work together.
B00B19G01C|2.0|the movie needed more gore suspense and drama, and more elaborate explaining to what the box meant. three more words required
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Playing this App, I always have something to work toward. The updates are well timed,  and include some awesome surprises.
B00E66QPCG|5.0|Excellent starting point for exploring fx/futures. Positive tone with good explanation of a simple approach to trading. Small but delightful book for the price.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a great app, so easy to use. Really convenient, don't have to grab for a calculator. I love having the app with my kindle fire.
B000JMLFLW|1.0|idk how this is i havent had the chance to read this yet so yea this is my review sorry
B008ZDC7M8|1.0|Luckily, I recorded this series to DVR and did not waste my money on the DVD set. After less than 30 minutes of playback, I stopped and erased all the episodes I had recorded. The lifeless narration and poorly formed content were too much to bear. I couldn't believe that the Turner Movie Channel gave this terrible series air time. Save your money and DVD recording space.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|It's hard to believe it's been seven years since \\"The Captain and the Kid.\\" That break represents the longest span of time between solo studio albums thus far in Elton John's more than four decades of records, tours and hits. The quality of the aforementioned autobiographical masterpiece did not demand a hiatus, but it appears to have been helpful anyway. This collection of songs is Elton's freshest and most interesting album since the mid 70s.<br /><br />The album starts off the way more of Elton's albums should: Just him and that piano on the sparse yet epic \\"Oceans Away\\", a somber reflection about veterans of World War II. Things pep up from there for \\"Oscar Wilde Gets Out\\", A Town Called Jubilee\\" and \\"The Ballad of Blind Tom.\\" There are many up-tempo songs on the album, but those expecting \\"Bennie and the Jets\\" or \\"The Bitch is Back\\" will be disappointed. The album is more heavily influenced by jazz, blues, gospel and country/folk rock than pop. The closest any song on the album comes to the sound of Elton's many Top 10 hits is \\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight\\", which is comparable to \\"I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues.\\"<br /><br />This sounds like the album that would've followed \\"Madman Across the Water\\" had Elton decided not to go with the more rock n' roll style that debuted on \\"Honky Chateau.\\" I'm glad he did go in that direction for a time, which resulted in classics like \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" and \\"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy.\\" But he mastered that sound. 2006's \\"The Captain and the Kid\\" was a great send off to those days. With \\"The Diving Board\\", John has released the album he might have thought about doing more than 30 years ago, and I for one am fine with that.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this book even if it wad written for teens it was very good and I can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B007A2O3FO|3.0|I like anything with Maggie Smith in it and that is why I ordered it.  She's a wonderful actress.<br />I'm not terribly fond of paranormal.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|One of the best period drama's ever. A must see. IfF you haven't seen it, get the DVD and watch it!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|After watching the first season, I just didn't have room on my DVR watching schedule for Seasons 2 and 3. I made up for that this weekend. I watched all of Season 2 and am halfway through Season 3. Wow! The writing, acting and plot development just continues to soar. Butch and Sundance back together again, as it should be!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very well written and interesting to see how the rich control and manipulate the less fortunate. Question is, how can we develop imagination?
B00BESM14U|5.0|first of all yay Emma Watson!<br /><br />second it's more than just being a social outcast, It's very interesting esp from a psychology-minded perspective
B00D5LC4GY|3.0|You have to have a steady hand when playing this game,  It doesn't drop precisely in the spot like some puzzles do.  You have to center is exactly or it will drop in another square and add to your number of moves....other than that it is a good game.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This app is the best app ever. I downloaded it about 2 weeks ago and it has so many characters. Can't stop playing keep em comin
B004XZR63M|5.0|this book can be slow at times but Robert really gives you some good points to think about, I would definitely reccommend this book to firends. Robert is already making me consider investments for my financial future!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a touching story and enjoyed reading it.  It might prove to be sad to some who don't want to think about death and family drama.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|Sarah Jarosz is an original artist and musician in full-bloom on her new record, \\"Build Me Up From Bones!\\"  The singer/songwriter/multi-Instrumentalist takes the listener on a magical journey through her musical palette of song and sound.  This record is full of great songwriting, singing, and amazing musicianship from start to finish.  A perfect mix of original and artistic modern sounds with traditional overtones.  A true work of art from an artist who has already given us so much great music in the past and she is only 22 years old!<br /><br />Thank you for all the great music, Sarah!
B00COQTZLS|2.0|It says it will sync with google calendar but it won't. So I wasted money on this! It works great with my Ipad. Really don't it when they it will do something it doesn't
1451695195|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the near-death journey of Dr. Alexander. I am awed that he recovered fully from such a devastating illness. His experiences, while unexplainable by some physicians seem quite plausible. The &#34;mind&#34; sees what it will see on the journey to self-discovery.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I'm glad I got this Calculator Plus Free! I've used it several times and its easy and simple to use!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|When my grandchildren downloaded this I did not think I would like as much as they did but I love playing it
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Love this Love this Love this.  It is very entertaining for all ages even my 3 yr. old granddaughter Thank you
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|best freaking slenderman game in the market! i always check ratings and reviews before buying a game, and this had the most stars in the market! just get it people, i promise you will be satisfied! :)
B00E7SFAAG|3.0|At first i am trying the free version. And I find the game quite fun. So i unload this one.<br />I haven't play it in many days. It does have some hard levels.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Summary: I got this device to save my sorry behind from having a dead phone or tablet. It so far can charge my phone, a samsung galaxy s4, about 1.5 times. And keep my kindle fire hd from dying by extending the battery by about 5 hours. I think any tech oriented person should get this or any external battery pack. Super useful and can even charge 2 devices at the same time. I one time caught myself plug my phone in the battery and the slipped the phone and battery into my pocket for \\"wireless\\" charging. A must buy and im super happy I did.<br /><br />Pros: slim. Light weight. Dual charging capablitys. Built in micro usb charging wire. A slim and well built case. Excellent build quality.<br /><br />Cons: you cannot charge the battery pack and then charge a device at the dame time. But that's nothing to be worried about.<br /><br />It does have a long charge time when its depleded. So use a higher output charging cable or source when you want to charge.<br /><br />Other thoughts: I wish there was a better meter to tell you the exact charge it has left. 4 led lights make you guess if it has enough for a full or half charge of your device. A simple Mw meter would be enough.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|this is a good app for my kindle and i love it.  it works better than the one that is usually used and i like it.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|My husband and I are totally in love with this CD.  If you like John Mayer, this is the one for you.
B00407PNY2|5.0|this cd is the best.  we had looked for it in several different places and could not find it.  thanks.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|This was a great movie.  It was not very gory and a little bit suspenseful.  I hope there is a sequel.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love the updated version. It's a great way to end a hectic day. I wish they would add more free puzzles like they seem to add the ones that aren't. I like to get a new one free with every purchase.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This is a one really good album. &#34;A Dramatic Turn of Events&#34; is better, and it is my favorite release from this band, but this one is good also. And I like this version of DT with Mike Mangini on drums. I think this album really allows each member to showcase their skills on their respective instruments. You hear the Myung insterting his style a lot more, Labrie is just on fire, Jordan...well, he never sounds bad, Mangini is an absolute beast. In addition to this, I think Petrucci's playing is absolutely his best in his career on the last 2 albums. I mean, tone, technique, creativity, feel, ...the whole package on EVERY single solo. He took his own style and expanded on it. He has matured as a player, which is impressive considering what he has achieved in his very successful career in DT.<br /><br />And about Mangini, oh my gosh, he has been my favorite drummer for years, way before he was in DT. I love Portnoy, and his impact on progressive metal and metal drumming in general is solidified. No one can take away what he has done. But Mangini, also,  is great in his own way. I prefer Mangini's style, tone, and technique.<br /><br />Overral, this is a mature DT. The songwriting is better than ever, the musicianship, the chemistry between the players, production. This album is a winner.<br /><br />Additionally, I they just were nominated for their 2nd Grammy! The first nomination was for &#34;On The Backs of Angels&#34; from their previous album &#34;A Dramatic Turn of Events&#34;. This new one is for the song &#34;Enemy Inside&#34; off of this album I am reviewing.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Took a flyer on this as a free preview last year. Went with the wife, with me kicking and screaming, expecting a bunch of sentimental, bleeding heart crap. Good Lord was I wrong! One of the most entertaining, hilarious movies I've ever seen with nary a bit of sentimentality.<br /><br />I NEVER pay more than 6 buck for a flick, but snapped this up immediately when I saw it for 15.<br /><br />Don't let the thought of subtitles put you off. Within 5 minutes you won't even be aware of them, assuming of course you can read English or know French.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Had never heard of this (yeah, I know, where have I been), but tossed it in an order with the complete Originals and Next Generation movies. For me, it's light years better than any and all of the others. Watched it 4 times in the first week. Gotta get a life...
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|Probably the best Priest DVD yet ! Still my favorite Metal Band. And the addition of Ritchie Faulkner on guitar .... BRILLIANT !!!
0307341577|5.0|All of Flynn's books are good reads. This is suspenseful and she keeps you guessing all the way to the end.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|Love this album.  I was what I'd thought it would be, nothing was out of place. I'll definitely be buying more things off  amazon.<br />  (\  /)<br /> (⊙_⊙)<br />(__l__( &#34; )( &#34; )
B0082SU98U|5.0|I was very GLAD that I decided to read this book again having read it as a child. It reminded me that I have so many things to be glad about. A most enjoyable read.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Thank goodness for pillows while watching this. It's a great adrenaline spike. Doing marathons with a friend is highly recommended. Don't watch alone.

B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I am 6 years old and I love this game! Star wars and Angry birds is a good combination.  Great!
1579128149|5.0|My husband is a big nerd and loved this book. It sits on his desk where he opens it daily to read something in it. He just can't get over how great it is and how much info is in it.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Essentially a mediocre chase movie, \\"World War Z\\" does little to build any real tension or interest in any of the main characters. As for the zombie scenes, while technically an amazing feat to manipulate so many CGI creations at one time, they create a sort of \\"can't see the trees for the zombies\\" situation in that they lose any individual \\"personality,\\" if I may. And don't get me started on the whole airliner scene. I mean, granted, zombie scenarios are kinda ludicrous anyway, but you bring down an airliner and only you and your other star survive? We should all be so lucky. Brad Pitt was the biggest zombie of them all. Walking through this role as if animated by the need to devour a paycheck.
B00E95ED32|5.0|I love this album's sound. All the songs are catchy, but my favorites are Lay Me Down, Hey Brother, Hope Ther's Someone and Heart Upon My Sleeve.
B00ARA4SLU|2.0|As chance would have it, this appeared at roughly the same time as \\"The Girl,\\" drawn from accounts of Hitchcock's abusive treatment of actress Tippi Hedrin. Toby Jones in \\"The Girl\\" did a much better Hitchcock impersonation than Anthony Hopkins does here. \\"The Girl\\" also has the benefit of being about a real personal crisis for Hitchcock and Hedrin, one in which the celebrated director became a contemptible creep. \\"Hitchcock\\" tries to gin up all kinds of phony drama about the production of \\"Psycho,\\" actually going so far as to have the spirit of Ed Gein -- the cannibalistic serial killer who inspired Robert Bloch's novel -- turn up in the director's bathroom. A waste of the cast's talent, and your time.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|We found this movie to be exciting, tense, and well done.  We bought it on Amazon instant, and were able to watch it prior to the DVD release!  Never a dull moment, and we liked it so much we watched it again with our daughter and her husband.  Not your typical zombie movie!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Kept me guessing the whole time, Great actors, great plot and tricks were used and the ending was awesome!<br />I would watch it again!
1592401791|5.0|Profoundly insightful not only regarding the Beatles and Geoff Emerick's career, but the role serendipity plays in the creative process and life in general. Soberly well written sans distracting literary affectations.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|came in day of release. great price with great batmobile extra doc on blu ray. I love this movie. Thanks
0920668372|5.0|I discovered this book in the 80s when I was doing family and Christian education workshops around the United States and used it as part of my presentation. I often used this book to read in the intergenerational setting of people of all ages together. Just the other day a woman who is 97 asked me if I remembered a book I read to them about 35 years ago and we pinpointed Love You Forever. Yes, that was it. We bought it for her as a surprise gift, and she loved It. She read it to every family member who came to visit her. If you have an elderly mother or friend you want to give a gift to, make it this one!
B004ZH66XO|3.0|I've played so many versions of what used to be the hungry shark game, that you'd at least expect some sort of polish. This is slow, clunky, and the mechanics are a bit off.
B008GOAFBQ|3.0|I'm listening to this as I write this, it seems bigger, not sure why a classic album was even messed with, but...  But the thing I'm writing about is the artwork on the new cover. Ace's face looks terrible!! Contorted and out of proportion. How did they let that get through? And to remove the classic 76 costumes???
B001GJ3BPU|5.0|I watched this with my boys. There has been a lot of criticism of the choice of Ben Afleck as the new Batman. We thought DareDevil was very good and enjoyed the action.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This is like wild west meets space opera, very fun series. The characters are well drawn, the acting is good. My only complaint is that it ends without resolving the burning issues ... what happened to season 2 I wonder? Very enjoyable, fun and ultimately upbeat entertainment despite some scary subject matter.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is amazing. make sure to unlock the other locations. enjoy THE FUN! help get theminoin to be minion of the week. REMEMBER Vecter is EVIL!!!!
1442366621|3.0|I felt that the authors did do their research and presented compelling evidence of success. However, I found a full day of fasting to be difficult with a resulting headache and shakiness. while I am not a diabetic, I am prone to migraines, so this is not the way I will lose the 10 aggravating pounds I want to shed.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome  such a good book to read, I loved it and would recommend it to any of my friends, :)
1465001107|2.0|THIS CALENDAR SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.  THE PICTURES ARE VERY DARK & THE QUALITY REALLY ISN'T THE BEST. I'M PRETTY SURE MIKE WOULDN'T APPROVE.
B006PW0F52|4.0|I expected that the blog was just a teaser for what is in the book, but I was wrong<br /><br />I check Dan's blog every week and lot of the material in this book is just the same as in the blog, just with a more elaborate explanation. Given that he is pretty good at explaining the general concept of what is being discussed, this &#34;more elaborate explanation&#34; kind of becomes redundant.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|Robin Williams showed his compasion side for patients, in this movie. His desire to change the institution of doctors, and the concept they stand by was interesting.
B00BS7HNTK|3.0|But I was disappointed with the rest of the album. Don't you just hate when that happens?<br />Super sad face.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I recommend this show for the science fiction, drama, and mystery elements that this show brings.  The writers do a great job of blending the previous show to the next one.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Good for long distance flights . Long hours at the airport ( As you HAVE to finish ) ! What else is needed to say !?
B000M2O6AQ|4.0|Good movie very spiritual.  The only thing is that they run through each level to fast.  It's really not as good as the book (of course) but worth watching.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I want Candy crush saga or whatever on my Kindle fire.  I am not buying a new phone just to get candy crush so why not let it be available on the Kindle.  I do love my Kindle.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Works seamlessly between Kindle Fire HD and my Dell PC.  If I am downstairs with my tablet, I can access files, music, photos from my PC.  It is taking time to learn some of the actions to negotiate tasks, but it's coming along.
B00621E94E|3.0|Kind of hard to get through.  I didn't watch the final season the first time around, so I've dedicated way too much time to getting through it this time. Season 5 is all over the the place but gets fun towards the end.
B00742GBDM|4.0|I believe BBC was involved in this, but it's hard to fathom.  It is very loosely related to the book, but the liberties taken by the writers are very interesting.  Why a letter exchanging relationship with Susan, what ever happened to poor favourite brother William (and therefore the artificial gratitude to Henry that never actually exist in this film) are just some of the curious questions an avid Austen reader would ask.<br /><br />Johnny Lee Miller is fantastic in this adaptation and the inclusion of the moral conflict the family has with their &#34;holdings' in Antigua are awesome elucidation of what the financial issues the Bertram's have.  It never occurred to me when I was reading the story, got caught up in the romance.<br /><br />On its own a very good film.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|All the haters check out the b-sides! They are so thought provoking and comforting. The album is good too but it loses steam somewhere in the middle. Still you gotta love a band that is still going strong and travelling on a world tour even after Dave had cancer.
B001HBWY8M|3.0|If you want to bond with your pre-teen girls and not be worried about what you will see or hear (too much) this is it.  A little flirty  one or two kisses and henna tattoos is the worst you'll get with this rags to riches young adult film.  I like to watch this when I want to do work and not worry about changing the channel when my kid runs into my office, and it even holds my attention for a couple of seconds.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Very engaging! Characters popped out of the pages. Story was so intertwined and made you feel for each of the characters.
B00BEYX7TW|5.0|Once again Tommy Lee Jones keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the unexpected.  A really worthwhile movie to watch.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The whole family enjoys watching the first season.  The writing is excellent and acting is equally as good. I've watched the episodes multiple times.
B002DS3982|4.0|Denzel, what more can I say?  Love him or hate him, the man can act.  Watch this movie and enjoy the story.
0345803485|5.0|I don't read books like this but my wife does and I listen and every so often she will gasp or giggle or laugh and with this book she sat in her chair for 2 days reading it.

B009LDD590|5.0|I love this series. I had to get it before the new shows began in order to refresh my mind as to where it left off. I love gangster shows and this one is from the early 1920s. I simply love the music of that era and the simpleness of life then. Great acting, good cast and a wonderful drama. Highly recommend it.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|LOVE LOVE Lady A<br />Hope to hear more from her soon<br />Have 2 of her CDs and love them<br />Not a country music fan but I love Lady A...
B005HED11Y|5.0|I watch an episode a week. I remember watching it religiously, when it was a new show. Still love it!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I am trying to read at least a chapter a night. I just started in a new role for my company that some would consider a step back, to spend more time with my family.  I think this book is very honest about what professional women face in the workplace and even as early as college when trying to decide what to do for the rest of their life. Although Sheryl Sandberg is priveledged, much more than many of us reading the book, she acknowledges that and still manages to send a meaningful message to women trying to be successful at home and at work!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I enjoyed the sound of here voice and the songs are cute and catchy. My daughter love all of the songs on this 5 track EP.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. It was just difficult enough to keep me interested and would like more levels please.
B007F7XXKA|5.0|I had the good fortune to pick up this book about 6mos after it was published in summer 2011. It was a great read then - very interesting approach to SEEING emerging market countries not just analyzing them on a spreadsheet. There is nothing dry about the book. It's a fun to explore his thought process.  I have worked in financial product sales for over 20 years and i have read a lot of research over that time. Ruchir Sharma looks at economics in  uniquely personal way. For example, did you know that the cultures of India and Brazil are so in alignment that they share some of the same tv programs because popularity is assured in both those cultures (but no where else).<br /><br /> Mr. Sharma looks deeply at the politics of countries. What trends in political spirit are evolving? When a country has the same leader for extended periods of time ( think Erdogan and Putin) , the government starts out reform - minded and ends up lead by a megalomaniac who's only ambition is to stay in power.  Turkey in fact had a regime  change in the early half of the 20th century that rendered much of the population 'illiterate' when the official language changed.<br /><br />Reading this book, you will  learn a bit about the world around you (if you are not in finance) and if you are.. you will  learn a new way of deeply understanding the path that various countries will take.  What is more remarkable is that as of 2011 , he had correctly predicted the future of many countries.  Since i read the book, emerging markets have come on surprisingly hard times and their worst weaknesses have been exposed. This is making asset managers all over the world re think their long term investments and that will change the face of the future. I can even draw the  conclusion  that  for the future, the USA is the 're-emerging' market to watch.<br /><br />Mr. Sharma travels a lot (1week a month) and its fun to follow his shifts in view  since writing the book. He has said in text that he is now focused on Thailand , the Philippines , Eastern Europe and Mexico. Don't worry while reading that the view has changed, but do take in the 'method' by which he arrives at his views.  I have sent 25 copies of this book to my various clients and it's a great read.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I am glad that this app was create so that tablet users can search for Wiki info. Kudos. And it is free too.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I found cast, plot, settings to all make this one heck of a wonderful movie and more, great food for thought-oh, startle you? Thinking, yeah it can be tough. Done so very well in all scenes. Think Brad Pitt should be very proud of having taken this, one of his best and very well done.
B004VOBIE8|3.0|Doesn't show a file directory tree like Windows Explorer, and the filenames on a kindle are in no way descriptive, so I am not sure how helpful this app will be. But perhaps I need to spend a little time learning how to make use of it.
B008JFUO72|5.0|I had read reviews and they seemed to feel it was least of series of 3 thus far. I was not disappointed one bit, enjoyed it very much. It's fun, it's not life nor real, it's simply to enjoy and take time out of an elsewise near fearful day-if you watch news or keep current- so allow a diversion-no not a lie, diversion-photography, loyalty, special effects and  I simply adore cast.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Good game. I really like to play it. It is very relaxing. Highly recommended and it is free. Very cool.<br />Peace.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This book was very interesting and I can't wait to see the movie. I also liked the last two books
B005544TRQ|5.0|What a unique concept! Fabulous writing, acting and chemistry! Love Donna! More, more! Keep this one alive and kicking, please!
B004GYY714|5.0|works great for me.  Allows me to list to certain sportscasts that I couldn't listen to in the past.  I would recommend
B0050DIWFC|5.0|One of the best books i  have  ever red<br />It is much more than a legal thriller. It is the story of  parental love  and heartache.<br />Anyone who has ever had a child should read this book
B00F91H666|5.0|Good old fashioned entertainment with a satisfying ending to boot.<br />Kept me engrossed throughout.<br />Heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys action films.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Hands down my favorite Iron Man! It has the typical Tony Stark humor, not too much but just enough, and naturally it contains a lot of action! But there is so much more going on with it than just that. Marvel has always excelled in making their superhero movies have great character development, a moral purpose and amazing plots that almost make you believe this can all be real; and in my opinion this one takes first place over them all. I will admit I was slightly disappointed with certain aspects but nothing extreme. It has a very interesting villan and introduces a kid who gets to help out. It definitely takes Iron Man, and all the other characters, to new levels and it will leave you excited to see what will come next. Or at least it does me!
034580404X|5.0|I think everybody will love this sound. It's amazing!<br />I would reccommend it to all my friends and family it's a beautiful song
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I can't understand how some people can claim to be fans and then proceed to dis the diva.  Get a clue, people!  True fans don't knock their icons.  Ever!  A couple of the songs here, like Woman's World aren't very special but most are.  Any real fan would appreciate what she does with her voice  here.  I am very pleasantly impressed and surprised.  Listen to ballads like Sirens and Favorite Scars. She never ceases to amaze.  On a par with Believe and Heart of Stone.  Like fine wine, Cher's voice seems to get better with time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product came faster than I expected. Seamless set up and works great. No bells and whistles like Apple TV, but it's great for streaming content from your mobile devices.
0307474275|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read.  I hate reading but I could not put this down and finished it within a week.
B00CATSONE|3.0|The subject matter is very interesting, but it would be a lot better if it included more depth and supporting details.
B006PIXKVW|4.0|Heartwarming, suspensful film worth watching. Kept my interest throughout the entire film. A great film that a family can watch together without regret.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a cute fun game for the kids! who doesn't love the minions???? i know in my family we all do!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|The music, color and story lend themselves to gaining the rapt attention of my 1 1/2 year old grandson. The same for the older ones, but they also get a good message from kindness, caring, responsibility and ecology. Kudos to the writers and producers.
B00881VLCE|5.0|my kids enjoy doing the puzzles on this game, and all tho they are very limited they have several options for sizes.
0767817664|5.0|The actor and actresses in This version of Fright night are more realistic, more frightening, more sexy, less forgettable than the new one that came out more recently.  Been looking for this version for awhile.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Remember, plan, share, etc, etc etc..<br />Is an excelent app, Just add and enjoy it!!!<br />I use it every day.
B00003CX8V|3.0|I thought this movie was alright, but it's one of the few best picture winners I haven't had a hankering to watch again.  The actors are both great, and so is the movie, but compared to other best picture winners I'd have to give it a 3 out of 5.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game very much. Love the challenge. It excites and ignites me anytime am about to play it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I enjoyed it just wished there was more puzzles that u wouldn't have to spend6$ on!! They sur were hard but fun
B001QD5OSS|3.0|This is Not his best performance, I was offset by the poor following of the events, way to fast did the movie pass all the years of georges life.
B00F35BV64|4.0|a great movie. It exceeded my expectations. one of the best in the Star Trek franchise. I recommend it to all Star Trek, as well as sci-fi fanatics
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|just a great clock it helps me sleep knowing I have it to wake me up and get ready every day

B005COO1X6|4.0|Stephen king at his best. A really good evil critter story. I wish it were longer, It ended too soon.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but perhaps I enjoyed it because I had different expectations than it seems some readers did.<br /><br />First, I'm not particularly a King fan anymore.  I loved his early work, and I believe The Shining is my favorite of his novels (followed closely by The Stand), but I haven't followed him much since, and some of his later books I have not enjoyed.  I reread The Shining  last year, and I think I maybe enjoyed even more than I did on previous reads, when I was younger and read it for horror rather than for what I now think of as the subtleties of the book.  Like another reviewer here, I see The Shining as a novel of psychological horror even more than being a ghost story:  to me the scariest parts were the ways in which Jack Torrance's rage and alcoholism destroyed himself and almost destroyed his family.  That was a real horror to me.  While I love the rest of the story, especially the scary hotel itself,  it is the characterization and the portrayals of an alcoholic that really stuck with me.  So I was actually quite pleased to see that Dr. Sleep does the same thing:  it dwells on characterization, especially of Dan Torrance.<br /><br />Another thing about me as a reader is while I enjoy some horror, I much prefer atmospheric, gothic horror to gore, and I tend to also be a reader of literary fiction.  So I was not going into this novel looking for shocks or a certain kind of horror. I do see that this book is, perhaps, not typical of most horror novels, though, which was fine with me.<br /><br />That said, I found much to enjoy in this book.  What this book does well is characterization, and Dan Torrance was a complex character.  As some readers have noted, the early chapters hit on tough subjects:  child sexual abuse, extreme alcoholism, etc.  Dan, like his father, Jack, was not likeable when he was drinking.  I will say I was a bit worried by those first chapters:  I thought that if the book had to much about child sexual abuse, I didn't want to read it.  But that was one character's history, and while certainly what the True Knot did to children with the Shining was awful, it was not in that realm, and also, it was not so explicitly described that I felt it was too much.  Once I got past the opening, though, and once Dan found stopped drinking, it improved.  While some reviewers here said Dan was boring, I didn't think he was at all; I actually felt invested him in a character, and so I was also invested in his sobriety.  I felt the same about the AA parts--it's not a world I'm familiar with, but I found it interesting, and believable and it made him more of a compelling character to me, and I liked to think that this might also be the writer's experience, and I like to see the way writers integrate their personal history and experiences into fiction.  As for his role as \\"Dr. Sleep,\\" that was one of my favorite parts of all; I found Dan's work as psychopomp moving and intriguing, especially because it was the dead who had caused him so much trouble as a child.  For me, reading this book was much like it seems King meant it:  I was getting to find out what happened to a character that was almost like an old friend, and for me it was wonderful to see what had happened to that brilliant, wounded child, and to see the man he grew into, even with his flaws.  But then again, unlike some readers, I always have found Danny the more compelling character of The Shining; I never found Jack Torrance that sympathetic.<br /><br />And as for villains, Rose and the True Knot were as good of villains as you may find, scary and rapacious.  I do wish we could have found a bit more about their history through time, though.  and I did love how King played with the idea of them being RVers....that was a witty touch.  There were other witty touches too:  references to other books and characters, and even authors--yes, we see their names.  I'll always think of Eliot's \\"Hurry up Please, it's Time\\" in a different way now!<br /><br />There were some things I had problems with though.  I wanted to love Abra, but.....I had to make an effort.  She was a bit too much:  too perfect, too beautiful, smart, the warrior queen.  Could she have had one flaw other than the temper, something which she actually needed?  She was not as complex to me as some of the other characters, even as some of the more minor characters.  I also found the plot a bit.....slack?  It seemed in some ways not enough was on the line, and while I didn't know the specifics of the ending before reading it, the outcome seemed a bit obvious.  I didn't need great chills and gore, but a bit more narrative tension would have improved things.  And there was also one rather major plot detail that was just too much of a coincidence for my taste.  I won't say what it is, but it's related to Abra's \\"theory of relativity.\\"  And finally, while Dan's \\"secret\\" was not something to be proud of, it didn't seem quite as horrible as he played it up.  Of course that's part of the point; the shame he carries is a weight somewhat unrelated to the long past action.  However, I still found it not as interesting as it could have been.<br /><br />Some people have suggested it wasn't a sequel, which just puzzles me.  Of course it was.  It had many of the same characters, and knowing the first book (NOT the movie!  You need to read the book!) makes this book much more powerful and resonant.  No, we don't get some of the same characters/settings, but, um, the Overlook Hotel is gone, and of course it can't be the same.<br /><br />Anyway, while it wasn't the best book I've ever read, and not as good as The Shining itself, it is still a novel worth reading if you enjoyed the first one, and for me it was wonderful to spend a day or two with Danny, who seemed like an old friend, and old friend who'd been through terrible hardship (some of his own making), but had come through it older and wiser, a flawed man who still had something to give.ow!<br /><br />There were some things I had problems with though.

B00DZVKQGY|5.0|I got this as a freebie here on amazon.  did not know what I was getting really.  I loved the story and the materials inside were so close to home for me.  I have to say.  it is well written and easy to follow.  thanks for writing this awesome book.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|This movie will easily make you cry, laugh and keep you glued to your seat. Coming from a 14 year old boy who normally only likes action movies I think that's saying a lot.
B0007CYW5A|1.0|We bought three of these.  They perform so poorly that we thought we had counterfeit ones.<br /><br />We used them to power LED lights.  These LED lights can run multiple hours on an NPF570 or NPF770.  So we thought, &#34;hey! We'll get a 970 and they'll last a REALLY long time.&#34;<br /><br />The first thing we found is that they won't charge in our Pearstone chargers that charge the other batteries no problem.  So we then bought special Sony &#34;dual&#34; chargers that really only HOLD two batteries at a time, but charge one a time.<br /><br />Then we let them charge overnight and tried them.  They died after just over an hour of use!<br /><br />We must have not fully charged them, we thought.  Must be that dual/single charger issue.  So we let them charge for many days, and verified the Sony charger said &#34;full charge.&#34;<br /><br />I did a test yesterday and the same thing happened.  They died after 1 hour of use.  I can't explain it, but these things are crap.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|Very funny and clever.  I'd say more R than PG-13 as was a bit heavy in adult subject matter for a 12 year old.<br />Other than that loved it!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|a bit limited for now, especially outside US.<br />google should add upnp support to it and would be perfect :)
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Sheryl Crow's voice is better than ever.  I love every song on this album.  \\"Waterproof Mascara\\" and \\"Stay at Home Mother\\" brought tears to my eyes, but every song is beautifully crafted and anyone who loves Country Rock music should own \\"Feels Like Home.\\"
B00514HDNW|1.0|I admit I am not a fan of Vampire or zombie genres. I saw the Will Smith Movie and enjoyed it. Unfortunately the movie offered a more plausible plot line then the Novel.Will's Character was a military Officer portrayed with a high level of training and relevance to the cause of the outbreak.The idea that he had the background to research the cause and possible find a cure was plausible. Unfortunately the novel's protagonist does not. The concept of a man made plague destroying mankind is better explored in the movie. Man sowing the seeds of his extinction is not new and is explored in much better works than this book.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|That ending really... Fu Sylvia day... Finish your trashy novel FFS. Laziness doesn't suit an aspiring author well... I I wish I could get a refund.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love love loved this trilogy. The book was tantalizing and energetic. I loved how Anastasia and Christian interacted. I was happy to follow their journey together and admire how it ended. I look forward to more from this author.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The characters are developed, but each individual story took too long to develop.  Read \\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" before this one.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Excellent as usual! I love all Jack Reacher novels! Showed a more vulnerable side of him whilst in the mountainside tunnels!

B00422LESO|5.0|I really love anything related to Jane Austen and found this book extremely entertaining.  The book is much better than the movie!
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|I love Sting. And I love Broadway musicals. So to watch and hear two of my favorite worlds collide is something to treasure. I went outside to wiggle my toes in the grass and don my earbuds. Mother Nature and I enjoyed the late afternoon sun and all 20 tracks. Sting never lets me down. He loves to make good music no matter the genre. And I love to listen to good music no matter the genre. This man has always been a great story teller with his tunes. But it's usually been one story per tune. Now it's one story-many tunes. A best score nomination wouldn't surprise me at all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game in the whole entire unavers.  sssssssssssssssssoooooooooooooo awesome.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. get the game it is awesome. YOU WILL LOVE IT.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved Mckingjay.it is really sad though in this book beacuase my favorite characters die.and instead of Katniss loving Gale ,she had to love Peeta .im mad .but i still LOVE this book.
1476733953|5.0|From the second I started to read Hugh Howey's Wool I was completely drawn in.  It is so well written & leads you down into a world that is completely new.  This story is one of the first stories I've read in years that I haven't felt compelled to skip parts because they just aren't \\"all that\\".  Reading Hugh's work brought me back to the exhilaration and excitement I felt when reading Science Fiction for the first time as a young kid.  Absolutely love it!
B003YL4KS0|5.0|This is a very informative book.  I've been getting relaxers put on my hair  since I was in the 2nd/3rd grade and I am currently transitioning from relaxed to natural hair. At first I wasn't sure that this is the right thing to do but when I  read this book, I was very touched by the stories that I read. Now I feel more comfortable about taking the next step to natural  hair and accepting it for what it is and not what other people think it should be.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I must say this one had me guessing.  Love movies that have not been spoiled to me yet.  Fun movie!

0345495004|5.0|I LOVED this book. Whether you are a fair weathered Frank Lloyd Wright fan, or a big fan, this book gives some great insight into his life. And if you don't know much about Frank Lloyd Wright, noted architect from Spring Green Wisconsin, he was an eclectic character to say the least.  I, myself, am a self admitted Frank Lloyd Wright Geek.  I am fascinated with him as a person as well as the architecture and furniture he created.<br />I have read other books about Frank that I had a hard time getting into.  Not the case with this book.  This book I could not put down.  I have recommended this book to more people than (just about) any other book I have read.<br />Knowing what I do about Frank and his life, I didn't want this book to end.  I came to really like the characters and really wanted to put the book down about half way through and pretend it ended happily.  It does not. I won't tell you the ending for those who do not know.  This book is based off Mamah's diary.  Mamah was the mistress of Frank Lloyd Wright - falling between wife #1 and wife #2.  If you ask me, Mamah was Frank's true love in his life.  I hope you will read this book and I hope you enjoy as much as I did.<br />Every time I lend my copy of this book out (yes, I still read BOOKS!)and I don't get the book back, I go buy another copy of this book.  THAT is how much I love this book!
B007N8RULO|5.0|A well made spider solitaire game with good backgrounds and good animations. A good way to pass the time away.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|For the crappy standards that we seem to have for movies nowadays this really is 5 stars. Very fun movie no certain character really stands out, everyone plays their par,t works really well, and Hulk smash!
B00CH87HF4|3.0|I downloaded this because I thought it would be fun, until I found out that I had to download almost 1GB of stuff after I downloaded the app. I love RPG's but not that much.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really liked the fast pace of the storyline. The scripts are well written and keeps your attention without being vulgar.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A simple solitaire game that is fun and well made. Get this if you don't have a good solitaire game already.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|I love this movie, its funny and it can entertain the entire family when you have a get together. I would recommend it .
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|If you enjoyed the first one you will enjoy this one even more. All of the new powers the birds have are awesome, and I love to play as the pork side.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Nice to see an author who takes the time to include real science and theories into a story that gives the reader a chance to interpret something new.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Arnold played the part according to his age, not reputation.  A little humor and plenty of action.  Some of<br />Sly's latest made this one look great.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I saw the movie first then got the books!! I couldn't put any of them down! I'm finished now want to see the movie again but it's no longer at the cinema. I guess I have to wait til it comes out on DVD!!
B0047WJ12K|1.0|I found the concept interesting but the movie dull. It could have been nuanced better. It was jagged and unromantic in many ways.
0345534379|5.0|compact and full of facts that would interest older kids and of course adults...good price too. worth the buy! my daughter enjoyed this
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The writers of this show does a great job!  Love all the characters in this show, especially Donna!  Definitely recommended!
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|This is a dark, gritty action film that pleasantly surpassed my expectations. The visual and and audio styling were a perfect match to the grim and ultra violent action.  I like that this film did not try to be anything more than it should be.  You don't need to be a comic book geek or Judge Dredd fan to be blown away by this action.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|A very well acted series. We have enjoyed watching from the beginning the many adventures of the people of  the two towns. It's similar to &#34;Anne of Green Gables&#34; in that you come to love the characters. I have not read the book that the series is based on. The characters on screen are not completely believable because the producers must have taken quite a bit of 'poetic license' to adjust the storyline to fit modern times but there is where the story becomes unbelievable. Perhaps that is why the series was cancelled or did not have a spin off on other characters. The series passes the time nicely. Very clean with no nudity or swearing. The acting is very well done. The scenes are most likely very authentic for the period. Any of the actors in the series are welcome sights on other programs we come across, such as Downton Abbey. It would have been a 5 star if not for the too modern ideas being interjected in a way that is completely unbelievable for the period. If the producers had kept to the original story, it would have been 5*.
B00E00GCF8|5.0|Simply Amazing, the sound is good and the different Mustaine's voice from the CTE CD is makes it different and particular!<br />I hoped for a better set (maybe Argentina or Brasil would have been better) because the people is not very into the show.<br />Megadeth Rules \m/
B003O86FMW|4.0|it is a very entertaining story. nevertheless, it does not come close to the level of another science-fantasy writer. Marion Zimmer Bradley, probably made inmortal with his &#34;THE FOGS OF AVALON&#34;or something like that i do not remember the title, it was the re-writing of the Camelot story.
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|Initially I LOVED this game! I got through the first chapter and was halfway through the second chapter, collecting characters along the way, which I thought was awesome! I was all amped up to continue on this morning and when I loaded the game on my Kindle Fire, MY ENTIRE GAME IS GONE!!! It's as if it was my first attempt at playing!!! I am SERIOUSLY UNHAPPY to say the least!!! FIX IT!! I want my game, achievements and progress restored! I am SO glad that I only have the free version and didn't pay actual money for aggravation! I sincerely hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else, otherwise you will have a numerous amount of people rating it as poop, just as I did. If you fix the glitch I will revise my rating/review. Otherwise, one star stays.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I have tried everything to help learn language alone. this app. reinforces spelling pronunciation grammar. listening reading speaking and it has a huge vocabulary.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Pros: Everything that Chromecast says it will stream works.  I know that other companies are working on getting other applications to work, like HBO Go and I absolutely am excited about that!<br /><br />Cons: If your TV does not have a USB port, you will still have to run a power cord to the wall.  Pretty minor, since newer TVs already have built-in USB ports.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a brilliantly written book proved to have a plot that is cleverly build and pulls the reader's strings to keep the guessing game in play well towards the middle of the novel. Subtle nuances throughout the book went back and forth between the husband's and the wife's treachery. The writing style, character complexity and cleverly constructed plot proves the author to be worthy of the journalist career that Ms Flynn has.  I was disappointed to say the least by the ending when I was waiting all a long for a more powerful exit.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to carry such twisted plot throughout the whole novel keeping the reader on the edge of the seat.  Alas, only a few writers are accomplished in such a triumph.
B00BWHZI0C|5.0|This is probably the hottest album that I bought this year.  I don't regret buying this album at all.  I would give this album more than 5 stars if I could.  Stop looking at these reviews and buy this album now.  You won't regret it!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Because I felt it was just an okay book and not an awesome book.but I'll definitely read it again sometime
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies and I was so excited when it came out on blu ray.  It is a wonderful story about a coming of age and survival of a young boy during the war.  It seems to me that it is an under-recognized gem by Steven Spielberg.
B0063M22QO|5.0|The graphics are beautiful the game is addictive the tiles are pretty<br /><br /> and going on to the other maze levels they get harder as you go so it's challenging
B009XIXVU6|1.0|I felt confused as the story went on. There was so many characters and jumping around I could keep nothing straight. A thousand splendid suns was and is my favorite book of all times. This one could hardly compare.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Fast playing game.  Keeping my interest.<br />Fun fun , yes get it  is a good thing to have for anytime .<br />Make time go by fast, ok get it...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I believe that I would give it a 10 star ratting. I have not had the time to use it much yet, but for what I see so far, It's Great...
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you are doing it yourself, here is your roadmap, couldn't have done my Kindle version without it. Highly recommend.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This was an excellent book, showcasing the author's unbelievable talent for multiple character POVs.  The only reason this isn't a five-star review is the final resolution felt unbelievable to me. I would have preferred she just ended the book without it.
B005WQ4RP6|5.0|Cape Fear (1991) has top-notch acting, which should make it an attractive watch; that is, if the viewer can tolerate and accept the abundance of disturbing subject matter and accompanying violence. This movie is unique, because it shows that you can have a disturbing story and still have great acting. Robert De Niro gives the performance of a lifetime as a disgruntled ex-con who stalks his former attorney (Nick Nolte). A resurgent Nolte delivers big time in this movie, while Jessica Lange is perfect in her role, and brings a certain intensity to it. Juliette Lewis gives a memorable performance as the naive daughter, and is believable in her role. This movie isn't for the faint of heart, as it's a bloodbath for the most part. Cape Fear is sheer intensity, and the characters build momentum as the movie progresses. I recommend this movie.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Although Gone Girl was very good, I think this book may be Flynn's best effort even though it doesn't employ her talent for multiple POVs.  There are two mysteries: why Camille carves words into her skin and who is killing young girls in Windy Gap.  It's a dark, disturbing look into small towns, family dynamics, and escaping the past.<br /><br />I think Flannery O'Connor would be proud.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|It just might be! Keeps close to perfect time, loosing &#60;1 min in 6 months. That's a lot better than my general track record for being on time. The lume is outstanding, lasting easily the whole night. Nice styling with kind of an understated manly look. It's not like a big tool watch that screams &#34;HEY, TOUGH GUY OVER HERE&#34;. Stopwatch functions perfectly, at least as far as timing london broil on the grill, which is what I use it for. Couple of very small issues though; I found the band to be a little uncomfortable, so I put a cheep Velcro band from Walmart on it...problem solved. The only other problem is the date window is very small and hard to read without glasses, but I generally don't care what day it is. Overall, 5 stars. This may be the best watch I ever owned.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I think this book was really good and told a great story about what a family like Brunos could have went through during that time. :)

B001NLKWLW|5.0|I know it was a good book when I had to force myself to put it down. As I neared the end, I stayed up late just so I could finish it. Great book!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Short and sweet, they maintain progress yet solidly hint at the past. They move the progressive boundary forward, yet deliver wide accessibility. They continue to produce meaningful material with new dynamics and directions. This one grows on you fast and is superior in sound to the last release, but is LOUD (not a bad thing)! Is it just me or is James LaBrie's voice just getting stronger with age? Just another fantastic release from DT! Congratulations guys!! See you on tour for sure!
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|I love the idea for a movie of this type.<br />The story was not good, hard to follow and disappointing in the end. It was also unfortunate that the &#34;F&#34; word was used in an other wise fairly clean language movie. There was another part in the movie where a key character who was portrayed as distinguished blurted out a line of obscenities at hostess as he strolled through a wooded area.<br />I was not impressed.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|At first I did not like what I heard.  Songs felt derivative of earlier work.  But I gave it a couple of shots and upon queuing it up for a focused listening I got it.  This is a personal album - for the aging artist and the aging fan. I was in college when the \\"Downward Spiral\\" came out.  It meant so much to me and defining who I was. This new album is a look back at those days.  A look back at the anger, the confusion, the mistakes and the figuring things out.  I think this new album is destined to become as important to me today as the seminal album was back when.  Thanks again Trent!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|great, thrilling episodes!!!! great season to watch... can't wait to see the rest.. A must to see before season 9....
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|My friend has never visited the Emerald Isle but after reading this, I am not sure if it has encouraged her or not. The author covers the Irish angle well and has made this an interesting read, touching on Irish social issues as it does.
B00BDAP66E|2.0|This app used to be perfect. But now I get update notifications for it that I can't download since I use a Kindle Fire HD, but I also cannot upload pictures any more. It always gives a 'failed' message in my device notifications and the photo never shows up. Really frustrating, as this app allowed me to choose the album to upload to, and Facebook's mobile webpage doesn't.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game right here is awesome. The overall gameplay is the truth. Recommend to everyone who has an interest in shooters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the final book just as much as the first!!! Sad it's over....I wish there were more to come.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Initially thought I had some problems and contacted Anker. It turns out it was not the mouse but Anker customer support was nothing short of awesome. The dpi settings are highly modifiable. Scroll works great. Build feels solid. Big mouse for the money.<br />5 stars for Anker. I'm sick of logitech.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The stories of three families are told and as they progress,  the intertwining of their lives becomes evident and tragic.  However even with their faults, the characters all are too sweet when one would expect them to be harsh and the way they react to significant situations including 'the secret' doesn’t always appear normal.  Evidently, the author is trying to show how each person’s actions have unforseen results which if not understood by the end, is made quite clear in the epilogue.
B0064MGU98|5.0|II hadn't watched thid when it ran on TV. I have been catching up with ALL the seasons and episodes and looking forward to watching the new season as it airs.
0785814531|5.0|When I received the book, it was perfect condition. It's huge! I can't wait to sink my teeth into the many storied and poems that this beautiful book holds.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This was thoroughly entertaining, of course. An excellent read. I enjoyed the reflections on being a working mom and the behind-the-scenes of the tv business.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|This movie was always one of my favorites since it's first release.  It was just a matter of getting serious and adding it to my collection.<br />One of Tom Cruise's best performances along with his co-star,  Kelly McGillis.  The two of them together really sizzled!  Also I am retired Air Force and although the film was about Naval Aviators, Aircraft, especially modern jet aircraft are my fancy.  I really enjoyed seeing this movie again.  How many times? I've lost count, but I'd watch it again and never tire of it. Outstanding photography of our Navy in action.
B005PK553C|4.0|Very good show. Great characters, good story. I only wish it had a little more of a scare to it.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|This is definitely a 5 star movie.  It is entertaining and teaches a great family lesson, and is appropriate for everyone.
B00E193Y36|5.0|Great CD!! I love the aggressive nature of the CD. Love the additional sound of Rob Halford. If you liked the first CD's from FFDP, this is a must have.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is the first multi-player game that I've ever liked. If you hate multi-player, don't let that keep you from getting this game.<br /><br />Journey: The name is the game. The controls are simple. The visuals and music are evocative. It can easily lead one into philosophical contemplation.<br /><br />Flower: Lovely. Peaceful. Or am I a budding dictator. Gathering my armies. World domination only a breeze away.<br /><br />Flow: The visuals are not as lush. Still beautiful. The controls are a bit harder to get into. I have to imagine trying to move the creatures as they might really move in order to get them going. Eat, get eaten, or just flow through. The most innovative end credits that I can remember.<br /><br />Extras: The behind-the-scenes stuff was interesting. Exportable artwork and music which can be moved onto a USB stick for use elsewhere.<br /><br />More Extras: Two of the dynamic themes are slideshows of the Journey art. Beautiful, but I find them a little too distracting for use as a theme. The Flow theme is outstanding. Enough movement to be interesting without being distracting. Goes from dark to light over time. The menus remain completely readable. I'm currently using this theme.<br /><br />Extra Extras: The trio of Jammers are okay for what they are. They need another person for local co-op in order to play them. Could be fun, but not a great draw.

B00F5I344G|4.0|You can tell that Warren is bringing his work with the Warren Haynes band on to this new Mule album. This is not the hard rocking mule albums of the past. This is still a fantastic album, and it is even better having guest singers singing all the tunes in the seconds half.

B00ESY77LO|5.0|The lighting of this movie kept me in perpetual wonder of Baz's creative genius. The only thing that was annoying about this movie was how often it stopped to load, I have a fast wifi connection and it still stopped 4 times in the movie.

B00DJ80VLS|4.0|I know Mangini doesn't have much say, being that's he's still the \\"new guy.\\"  But c'mon!  The drums sound like crap!  He's an amazing musician and his parts deserve to sound much better.<br /><br />The album is pretty badass, but the drum mix is ruining it for me.  It reminds me of Portnoy's gated snare on I&W, but that sounded way better!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is a long awaited DVD and I loved it!! I am a huge fan and will be watching this DVD until the next season starts!

Great story line , the twists in the movie is great, but i wont get into this, for your sake . You'll just have to watch it, you will not be disappointed. Live long and prosper!
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|NOTE: There are minor spoilers in this review, but nothing that would deter from your overall enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />While I enjoyed this movie and had a fun time, I think \\"Iron Man 3\\" is the weakest of the Iron Man trilogy. That's not to say it's a bad film, it just means that I liked the previous two Iron Man films better than this one. I should state that while I've become a big fan of Marvel movies, I was never a big reader of comic books - so my feelings toward the film are more about it's merits/flaws as a movie experience (rather than how true it is to the comics).<br /><br />I think about how far we've come since the first \\"Iron Man\\" (and it's not in a particularly good direction). That film was refreshing because it played everything totally realistically - everything was tech-based, there was nothing supernatural. And now, in the third film of the series, we've moved on to Extremis (which is by far the most un-realistic concept in any of the three films). Now I'm not against fantasy movies, but up until now I've considered \\"Iron Man\\" to be one of the more grounded superhero franchises - and I liked it that way.<br /><br />Also, it seems the new mandate from Marvel is to tie their movies together as much as possible, which is fine but it also puts a strain on the individual story being told. This film seemed to draw less on the previous \\"Iron Man\\" movies and instead focus on the fallout from \\"The Avengers\\". I understand why the events in that film, notably the battle in New York, would affect Stark emotionally. But that whole storyline feels unnecessary in \\"Iron Man 3\\", and Tony's random panic attacks seem very out of place (and don't mesh tonally with the rest of the film).<br /><br />PROS:<br />- As always with the Iron Man films, the crowd-pleasers - the action sequences and the moments of humor - were very well-done.<br />- Brian Tyler's score was fantastic, particularly the main theme for \\"Iron Man 3\\".<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Although I love the song \\"Blue\\" that opened this movie, I really missed AC/DC's music. It just seems odd to not have AC/DC in an Iron Man movie (it fit so well).<br />- To me, Tony's panic attacks felt out of place.<br />- As someone who likes a certain level of realism in movies, the concept of Extremis (and in particular fire-breathing) was another step in the wrong direction.<br />- I just wasn't a fan of the Mandarin's character arc. It was a valid choice the filmmakers made, but it just didn't play well for me.the song \\"Blue\\" that opened this movie, I really missed AC/DC's music.

B0081L391C|4.0|For a comedy, the insight into social relationships is really interesting.  And the take on how geeks and accomplishment and social relevance have become cool was smart, and explored playfully, as well as how sex and drugs and parental relationships are different than the popular understanding 10-20 years ago.  Both lead characters transform by the end of the story, and do it in a way that represents some of the better changes that have happened in US culture recently.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Very life-life and believable.  The story is nicelypaced and looking forward to finding out who did it tonight at 7:00.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|If you are into magic and wizards this is a great series for you! I will admit I don't do much reading but this series has got me hooked! Can't wait to get into the next book... oh yeah the only downfall to this book is all of the double words and typos, I got my copy of the book on a Kendal fire HD, other than that the book is great!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Easy to use. Love that you have the option of how many pieces for each puzzle. Nice that there are different categories for the pictures.

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Could not stop playing the game very addictive. I would recommend it for anyone. Once you start playing your hooked
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of my all-time favorite shows ever. I love all the characters and storylines. The stories can be very soap-opera-ish but because the acting is great, the directing is great, and the costumes/sets are incredible, the show is really fun to watch. Can't wait for season 4!
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|I bought this a while ago, and my initial impression was there wasn't a bad song on it,  It's basically everything that was good about Soilwork taken to a new level.  Overall it seems a bit cleaner, while not at all lacking in the intensity from their earlier work.  As usual it's quite melodic, and the melodies here are just deep, complex, and at the same time very catchy.<br /><br />For me the best measure of an album is not even so much how many times you want to listen to it in 2 weeks, but how intense it still feels 6 months later, and this album is in very elite company; easily one of my top 5 out of about 400 albums in 15 years.  I actually think I like it better now than after I first got it.<br /><br />One final thing to notice is that this is truly a double album; at $9.49 you are literally getting 2 phenomenal CDs worth of music.  Easily the best deal in all of metaldom.  Not only that, but each album stands on its own and has its own feel, with the first being perhaps a bit thrashier and the second one darker.  Along those lines, it's all so intense that my only gripe is that it can be too much to take in one sitting.  Although that's hardly a gripe if you consider that it is still two albums, and you can easily remedy this by listening to one album at a time!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is my favorite season, though the very last cliffhanger scene is really sad and I do wish they hadn't ended it that way. The actors and writers are all in their groove and the show is still so well done. Can't wait for season 4 to come to the U.S.!
B00FF56IR4|5.0|It covered all the bases. It was a lot to cram into one episode, but it works. It has a bit of MIB in it. I think we will all grow on the different characters as we learn more about them. Most of all to me, it was just fun tv. I look forward to more episodes.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Amazing series! One of my new favorites. Started watching just because of David tennant. He definitely doesn't disappoint. I love how it follows just one murder instead of a new one every week. You really get to see how these investigations progress.
B0058BI896|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV. I got rid of my cable and now have Amazon Prime. Sometimes I buy full seasons of tv shows like this one and still save money vs cable.

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|But certainly not the best book I've ever read.  Thanks so much for asking......lets see...5 more words.....I thought it was ok
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I really loved how Oliver brought this book together at the end. Yes, the love triangle deepens, but I hardly think that anyone takes a backseat. If anything, the characters grow into their own. She alternates between the POV and gives the reader's new insight into what the cure really does. That people still exist in just a muted way but their emotions are just under the surface. I loved this series and the characters' strengths. It ended perfectly and beautifully, in my opinion.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Great free app!!! Its so cute with all of the Star Wars characters and then to teleport the one you want ( need buy the telepods at Wal-Mart for 39.00 dollars but well worth the price) Very interactive Game and its free. Now you also buy the app for 0.99 cents I am sure there that this games would have more levels and other aspect of the movie(I have yet to buy the app) So I am just guessing what is different between the two.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|If you like the show, you can expect the same humor and excitement in this book. Well written with insight into the characters thoughts and hearts in a way only a book can provide. A worthwhile and enjoyable read.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|If you like angry birds you're gonna love this new one!! So much fun with some new challenges.  Love it .

B003TSEEDY|5.0|It is a very good book I loved the story it was big kid  story it was romantic And it is funny
B00EP0KBXM|3.0|if this was a majority movie, the brownies would be crying foul if they weren't in it.  But, being a brownie movie, there are no majority people in it and they expect us to eat it.<br /><br />We give to them, but they don't give back, so NO MONEY for you, not from me.<br /><br />Like, 'Watch this potato pie or I'll make you eat it!'  All of his movie's, suggest, he is a brownie racist and his movie's reflect this.<br /><br /> Count me out, at ANY PRICE.  If he doesn't give, he doesn't receive.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found this ending to the Trilogy fitting and satisfying. Ending in a positive way, yet still with the weight of the horrors and destruction-more fitting, certainly, than a happy ending.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|Order this  combo so I could give the grandchildren  their own copy yet still have the Blu-ray copy for here at home when they come for an extended visit.
B007MDB6L0|2.0|The teeth that holds the DVD into place was broken. When I got my DVD, it was loose inside its case and had a ton of scratch marks all over it. I was a little upset considering how much I paid for it. The other DVD I ordered from them  had no problems. With this DVD, it was very noticeable that the case was unable to hold the DVD into place as I was unable to put it back into its holding spot.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This movie was not exactly what I expected, but it is definitely worth watching.  It will keep you glued, and guessing.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Who doesn't love Monty Python's Holy Grail?  It's a classic.  I don't normally buy movies, but this one I had to have.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Teslas is endlessly fascinating and as ahead of his time as Divinci. This book taught me a lot about Tesla but it left me wanting a lot more information about how certain things happened.<br />The best story was when Tesla went to JP Morgan, Edison's benefactor and excitedly told him that he had invented a simple coil to be put into the earth and how wonderful it would be for everyone to get all the energy they would need from  this coil. JP Morgan said &#34;yes, but where would we put the meter?&#34;<br />The realization that the powers that be were not interested with helping humanity but only at how much money they could make, soured Tesla<br />and me.Nothing has changed.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|I normally don't but movie videos, but this is one sleeper I didn't want to do without!  Love the story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|cute little game kind of addictive and easy to put down when you're done . It is not a game I would pay for tho
B00422LESO|5.0|I've read it in one sitting and really recommend it for any romantic person. I mean, you might really enjoy it if you do not expect some sort of high lit. I didn't find any faults in the narrative, the writing style was light, easy to read, and quite funny and clean, which were two main factors for my liking of it. Story wasn't so awfully predictable for a romance novel - there were some twists that managed to make me wonder what sort of ending it'll have at last. It really surprised me. In a good way. Now I even consider buying a paperback version of it...
B00ESY77LO|2.0|We couldn't finish watching it .  Not interesting enough for us although the color was beautiful.  We really did not enjoy it.
034580404X|1.0|If this series had not taken another's complete idea of characters and basically the same story line with more sex I might have enjoyed it more.  Not original by any means.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|...because it seems that every time I fall in love with a show, well, you know, I can't even say it.  I love The Good Wife, seasons 1 thru 4 all have their special moments.  Such intelligent writing, it boggles my mind, characters returning, fitting in so well like a picture puzzle.  Drama, romance, humour, in-laws, it has everything.  We can't leave out the actors, some veterans, some I had never seen before, all brilliant.  The acting, &#34;in my opinion&#34; is excellent on every level, the writing superior to anything else on television, and that includes Homeland.  I will be watching The Good Wife on Sundays and catching Homeland on On Demand, when there is nothing else on. Oh that was mean, Homeland is a really good show, but &#34;in my opinion&#34;, it's easy to play crazy, easy to play evil, with a heart of gold.  it's much harder to play a normal person, with everyday problems, everyday victories and defeats.  Heartbreak and passions, with no car chases and bombs exploding.  I guess the major component with TGW is I can relate.  I wish I was as beautiful, with those clothes, OMG, but everything else I can relate to. I can empathize, some shows grab your heart, and others just cater to..._______.  Fill in the blank.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|I happened into this on Netflix during the 4th series and had to go back to the first to catch up.  This was as stated, received promptly, packaged well and nothing wrong with it.  Thank you.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Entertaining story with solid prose. The real reward is the substance of the plot and its development to a 100% satisfying ending which is often missing in works of science fiction. Recommend to anyone looking for some brain food that also tastes good.
B00946ZOT8|5.0|This is a great addition to my collection...my granddaughter keeps trying to get it.  As advertised, received promptly, well packaged and a very nice doll.  Thank you.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is a great app! Rosetta Stone will have a hard time competing with this. Hey it's free, give it a try.
B00B9ZBZ2C|5.0|First of all, don't read this book if you're looking for a \\"serial killer\\" tale.  IMHO the serial killer plot was unnecessary, and distantly secondary to the real tale.  This is one of the most important books I've read.  Why?  It brings to life, in a very personal, character-driven tale, a time in human history of Utopia-chasing.  It betrays man's silly and naive and arrogant - but extremely dangerous and murderous - playing at Dr. Frankenstein on a scale that resulted in 10s of millions of DEATHS... each an individual, with a unique life and story, hopes and dreams.  I recommend this book to everyone - EVERYONE.
B004FEFS5E|4.0|I really learned a lot. t the beginning it was a bit too technical, but I think if I got back I will have. Greater understanding. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to get into manual mode!
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Wow! This album is one of the best that I have bought this year! To think that this album wouldn't have happened until her manager talked her into it! Every song is a gem and nothing less, however, I wish that the duet with Lady Gaga that leaked was included, but hopefully will be released officially in the future! If this is the final album of her career and I hope it's not, she's going out with a bang! This is completely worth buying without regret!
B005F96URI|2.0|Even though I'm a big Josh Hartnett fan, I just couldn't make it through the whole movie.  It just wasn't my thing.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've always thought THE SHINING was Stephen King's best novel.  It was scary in ways that creep up inside your skin and just never let go.  The ghosts in the Overlook Hotel may have been terrifying, but that's not what made that novel so chilling - no, it's what happened to Jack Torrance, a man who loved his son with his heart and soul, but still allowed the demons to use him against the boy.  And it wasn't the ghosts that were the most dangerous; it was Jack himself, and the kind of demons so many of us have inside us.  DOCTOR SLEEP, King's sequel to THE SHINING, brought me back to the Torrance family, back to Danny and Wendy and Jack, back to wonderful Dick Hallorann, chef of the Overlook and hero of Danny's childhood, and back to Tony, the imaginary friend who tried to help Danny through the worst of his nightmares.  DOCTOR SLEEP reminds me of the \\"old Stephen King,\\" the King of DEAD ZONE and `SALEM'S LOT and THE STAND.  It's a great book with a big story, a story that reaches across America and highlights once more that there are such things as Good and Evil in the world, and that it is sometimes necessary to risk everything to stand for one and against the other.<br /><br />In DOCTOR SLEEP, Danny Torrence is Dan, haunted by the horrors he experienced that winter in Colorado when he was five.  He carries with him his father's legacy - a thirst for drink, and a temper that's hard to control.  King fills in some of the story for us, about Danny's struggles in the years following his father's death (Hallorann helps with that), about Wendy's injuries that never quite heal, and about the mess adult Dan makes of his life, including his alcoholism, his self-destructive behavior, and his unrelenting depression.  Then, he finds himself in a little town in New Hampshire called Frazier, and a familiar voice in his head suggests \\"this is the place.\\"  In Frazier he finds AA, forever friends, a job with purpose (using his \\"shining\\" to help hospice patients ease their way into death), and a girl named Abra who seems to \\"shine\\" brighter than even Dan did when he was young.  But there is a group of deranged people out there called the True Knot (Dan calls them a \\"paranormal Manson family\\"); they want Abra so they can feed on her essence (or \\"steam,\\" as they call it).  Their leader, a woman called Rose the Hat, knows how strong Abra is, and how much \\"steam\\" she possesses.  Can Dan help Abra fight Rose and the True Knot, or are his own demons too strong?  And once the True Knot sets up camp at the location of the long-gone Overlook Hotel, will Dan's past rise up to hurt or to help him?<br /><br />DOCTOR SLEEP, like THE SHINING, really is about inner demons.  Some of them are of the paranormal kind (Dan works hard to shut away the ghosts from the Overlook and it isn't easy), but some are a part of us, our own weaknesses and failings that get in the way of our best selves.  Those, Dan discovers, are much harder to defeat and take much greater courage.  The book is also about finding your true place in the world (or purpose, perhaps) and about repaying debts.  Hallorann helped Dan when he was a child; now Dan will help Abra.  As King describes it, \\"Life is a wheel, and it always comes back around.\\"<br /><br />Those familiar with THE SHINING only through the Kubrick film would be advised to read King's book before reading DOCTOR SLEEP.  The two novels are intricately connected, like woven strands of one story.  There are also significant differences between the novel and the Kubrick film which might confuse readers picking up the sequel without having read the original - the biggest difference, of course, is Hallorann, who is abruptly killed in the film but proves himself a hero in King's novel).  A bigger difference, however, is Jack Torrence's character - the scariest, most horrifying scene in THE SHINING is the one where Jack is chasing his son with an ax, raging at him to \\"take his medicine\\" but also desperately screaming for him to \\"run, run, run!\\"  It's this internal conflict between the influences of Good and Evil that define Jack's character - and none of this is present in Kubrick's film.  Since those same conflicts are so important in DOCTOR SLEEP, it would make sense to know what they're all about before diving in.<br /><br />Reading DOCTOR SLEEP felt very much like curling up with an old friend.  I admire King's ability to completely immerse his readers in his characters, his settings, and his stories - I didn't want to put this one down until I'd reached the final page.  I also admire King's knack for combining cultural references (you'll find mentions of \\"Twilight,\\" \\"Harry Potter,\\" \\"CSI,\\" and Nancy Grace) alongside surprising literary allusions (watch for nods to T. S. Eliot, Shakespeare, Malamud, and Dickens).  And then there's one very minor character named for Jame Gumm's first victim in Harris's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (King knows how to turn the screw before you even know he has a screwdriver in his hand!).  This is a rich and satisfying novel that's both desperately sad and beautifully uplifting.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  Very well done, Mr. King.n, run!\\"  It's this internal conflict between the influences of Good and Evil that define Jack's character - and none of this is present in Kubrick's film.

B00003CXTG|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and sometimes watch it twice in a row.  Even though it's long, it's easy to get caught up in all aspects of the story.
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|Really happy with this stuff.  It does stain non-black gloves, as advertised, so be careful.  I'm using it on a pair of Dainese four stroke gloves.  If it didn't require re-application occasionally, I'd give it five stars.  Still highly recommended.  *Update, 1/14/2016* I've found that after the second or third application, it seems to work forever.  Over a year since my last application and it still works great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a fun puzzler that had me thinking! There are so many levels available for free, I plan on buying the extra levels just because the developers are awesome! 5 Stars!

B002QRWJA4|4.0|a great female lead, unexpected male lead actor.  I usually don't like musicals but this one is very well done.
B00APAENUI|5.0|Great book but read the whole series.  I have read them all. I highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed.
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|one of the good ones; the ones you keep and watch over and over.  redford outshines farrow by a mile.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This book, like Sanderson's others, is complete in itself, a delicious read, thoughtful and funny.  Sanderson's skill at setting up a new world with complicated circumstances, and then populating it with interesting characters is just unparalleled. One thing I enjoy about Sanderson's writing is that, while there may be more books in a series, he doesn't hold you hostage by stopping a book midstream.  I've seen a lot of this lately and it makes me feel cheated. This book is one in a stack of Oreos, dipped in milk, and enjoyable all in itself...but with plenty of tummy room left over for another.  David would like that metaphor, I think.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|This book is very suspenseful and It is awesome!! It is probably the best book in the series apart from some things that I can't say.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|With the budget limitations they had I think they did a fine job creating the environment in this film. Even though I don't read the graphic novels or comics for this character I would have been less disappointed at the world created by the makers for this film if I had been sold a story that this was an alternate universe or something similar because it really didn't look very futuristic. Bladerunner was made over 30 years ago and I was more convinced I was in the future over this film.<br /><br />Karl Urban was a great judge and gave his all to sell the part convincingly enough even though at times it looked as though he was possessed by &#34;Grumpy Cat&#34;. Still love the guy and anything he does.<br /><br />Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this type of film, but I found it a bit slow and boring and the whole rookie test pass/fail plot felt a bit lacking, just another day for Dredd I've heard some reviewers say? I don't think so , who gets impaled on a daily basis and then goes to work the next day, nope!
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|This is a remake of Judge Dredd? It was entertaining for a rainy day but too bloody and gruesome. The acting was ok.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|The movie was good kept my attention, a little slow, but very interesting. the end was the big kicker, it just leaves you watching waiting to see what will happen next
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best game that is free and easy to play. it is so fun! !!!!<br />try it and find out for yourself
B000VNMMQ6|2.0|Love the Die Hard franchise, and loved this movie. Blu-ray is pretty standard, has the film and the standard special features. The quality is good, nothing glitchy like some earlier versions. Only problem is that the disk stopped working about 6 months after I bought it. No scratches or anything, it just stopped working.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I agree with other reviewers that this NDE story tops them all. It's great reading even if you are a skeptic. Right off the bat, I was impressed by how Anita says that she is not trying to convince anyone of anything, nor is she trying to make sweeping universal statements of truth. She is simply sharing her story with the aim of helping others, and I for one, found it to be one of the most profound spiritual books that I have ever read. Skeptical in the original sense of the word, means being open, but perhaps also questioning.  Even if you are skeptical in the more colloquial sense used today, that of being closed, then I think it will still be a fascinating read.  Did she merely hallucinate the NDE?  Whether or not she did, it appears that a rare spontaneous medical healing occurred.  Of course, skeptics will say, that such things happen even without any NDEs.  Nevertheless, what is clear, is that her life has changed.  She has become a more loving joyful person and that appears to be the case for most who have NDEs.<br /><br />If you are more open then perhaps you will consider, as I do, that perhaps we are more then our bodies and that there is more to the world then we know.  This has intrigued my interest in NDEs. From what I have read and interviews I have seen, NDEs all seem to have some commonality. Although they differ somewhat, they are strikingly similar. One thing that all NDEs seem to say is that they experience a kind of unconditional love and that upon returning they lose their fear of death.  I look forward to hearing rational arguments and alternative explanations and examination of the claims of this book as well as other NDE stories.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it because it makes you use your brain and its fun. So far it's not too hard but challenging enough to be enjoyable.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Not sure why this is appearing in my Roku as only one star and here it has 3 1/2 stars. In any case, this film is almost a masterpiece, making the zombie genre, seem like something that is actually possible!<br /><br />There really isn't too much gore here, but just enough to let the imagination do it's thing. Yes there is gore for sure, but it seems just right, rather then gory scene after gory scene.  Some of the special effects are incredible! I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and unlike other horror movies, I did not find myself thinking: \\"That is so stupid. I can't believe they are doing that\\". In other words it was all credible and realistic.<br /><br />This is destined to become a classic for sure.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My teenage niece plays with this as well as my 5 year old. It's pretty fun and makes us all laugh.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|I'm not sure how much I buy into the claims of this book, but certainly they are very intriguing.  This will make your head spin, as it contradicts many of the prevailing views, but does offer rational explanations for the discrepancies with existing dietary recommendations. Whether or not you buy into it, it's worth reading so that you can keep an eye out over the next several years.  There are two main recommendations in the book. One is to avoid gluten and the other is to avoid sugar.  Avoiding gluten is suggested even if you are not gluten sensitive. The author claims it's simply not good for the brain. The sugar recommendation doesn't seem that far out, but he is also advocating avoiding eating too much fruit.<br /><br />He also recommends Omega 3s and other supplements.  But the most radical claim of all is to eat a low carb diet high in \\"beneficial\\" fats.  He describes what fats are beneficial but they include Omega 3s, fish oil, olive oil and nuts (not peanuts though) and exclude lots of vegetable oil fats like canola, sunflower, etc.  Read the book for more details.<br /><br />I am all for low glycemic, but high fat is quite radical. Nevertheless, intriguing claims worth the read.<br /><br />Although I am a vegan, I may start to eat some eggs!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Very fast paced and the characters are developed even more in this second season. Lots of really interesting cases and twists and turns.
B0063M22QO|5.0|It`s great, I love making, and I love my kindle so this is a great collaboration of the two. It is just wonderful to me.
B0013V3GN8|5.0|It is only recently that I started looking for Performances by Elvis. After reading other reviews about the first footage of this concert. I'm glad to have seen this one.<br /><br />Just seeing Elvis as he worked with those around him show Elvis as a fun loving entertainer.  My first is the Great performances DVD and of course many of his movies; however, I'm looking to collect more performance DVD's and I know I will not be disappointed.<br /><br />As for this concert; It is a must have.
0920236162|5.0|I love this retelling of the princess syndrome. The ending is a twist on the traditional \\"come and save me\\" princess syndrome. I'm excited to read this book with my little paperbag princes and princesses.
B008JFUO36|2.0|Wasn't what I expected. Thought it was boring and the plot took too long to develop. Wasn't one of Tom Cruise's better movies.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|As a writer, I read a lot of books and watch a lot of movies and when they're over I shrug and say, &#34;Eh. I could have written that.&#34;<br /><br />Not Ready Player One. This is one of the books that makes me jealous. I wish I could have written that.
B004ADF7RO|2.0|Did not like some of the language that was used in this  movie. It was totally unnecessary. For a 5 and 7 year old to watch, what could have been a cute movie, I ended up turning it off. Shame on Hollywood.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone.  I love the characters and the story line.  It's a prequel to a classic.
B00062IVKI|4.0|Scorcese rocks in the making of this film.  Really great camera work.  Love the music.  It was nice to see Liza not bouncing all over the place and actually doing a very serious role with a very serious attitude.  DeNiro is ok.  I like the actor, but in this movie, eh, he's done better work.  Still, he pulled it off and worked well with Liza.  The ending was great.  I won't give it away if you haven't seen it.  But Scorcese makes you believe one thing.....and takes you the opposite way.  Wow.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Khalid Hosseini is the most inspiring writer I've ever encountered. Brilliant, beautiful, hard core truth and motivating. Please keep writing!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Really good start but the more you read the more the author seemed to be running out of a credible plot and rambling on.  By the end you could skip whole paragraphs and not be worst off.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|Jon Krakauer used this incredible true story to address some of his demons.  Idealism won't keep you warm at -30 degrees F.
B0093X805W|5.0|I read this to my five year old and it really got her more interested in learning to read. It is a classic story that will help develop a child's imagination.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|I saw this movie with friends while it was still in theaters and loved it.  However, my very busy had not watched it and have heard so much reviews since its release.  For a week, he bugged me about watching the movie.  I couldn't find it at our nearby Redbox locations, nor did Hulu or Netflix have it.  I saw that Amazon Instant Video had it for $2.99.  Well worth the price for convenience.<br />He watched, he laughed, he loved.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Friends of mine won a &#34;marriage&#34; game, when both responded that Lark Rise was the other's favorite show.  It's just the right combination of drama, history, costume and acting.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|A close second in the trilogy (almost as good as the first, and much better than the second). Yes, you should own it.
B00DGGIXS6|1.0|This is mostly dance music and you don't need a singer for that.  This is way over produced.  Too much stuff going on.  Sounds like old AM radio.  Cher CAN sing, so let her.  Save all the other crap for the pretty young girls with one octave.  This is a real shame.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|A well-written police soap opera, and I mean that in the highest possible way. David Tennant and Olivia Colman are wonderful. Although the plot revolves around the whodunit, more interesting is getting to know the inhabitants of Broadchurch more intimately as the series progresses.
B00DHRLK84|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies, over the past 20 yrs. that I I've seen.<br />It was in 3D, with VERY few 3D special effects. The plot wasn't bad but, the whole movie was anti-climatic. I and my wife kept waiting for something to happen that should have taken our breath away but, alas, that was  not to be. Even good ole Brad couldn't save it. There was no depth and we thought it was choppy, switching from one scene to the next, with not much happening that was note-worthy in most of them.\\"Night of The Living dead was scarier than this worthless waste of celluloid. I'm not a fan of Zombie movies but, from what I was told by a few people and reading the reviews on Amazon, I thought, \\"hey, this one sounds like a good one\\".......NOT....... I'm glad that some people liked this flick but, as for me, this was one that cured my uneasiness pertaining to the un-dead.<br />..................................RICHIE THE \\"C\\"..............DING DING \\"Amazon verified purchase
B003NX76BM|5.0|I think she outdid her writing with  this novel. it keeps you in suspense all the time. It is like she was doing everything that she was writing  about herself.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Although I enjoyed all three books, this book was my favorite. Obviously you need the first book for this one to make sense and you need book three to wrap it up.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|AiC have released yet another successful album. The songs vary from heavy metal to somber to radio friendly rock, as all past AiC has been. Most songs are very well written, especially the title track. You can press play and enjoy over an hour of excellent music... if you can find a way to listen to it without the standard modern mastering that makes everything loud, which is annoying. Other than that, this is a worthy addition to any AiC fan's collection. Highly recommended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed all three books do much, I read them twice within 10 days.  Very well written in my opinion.

B000NTMWYU|5.0|In our daily routines we get so busy that we sometimes forget to enjoy. This is one movie that brings that romance of enjoying everything around you back and deemphasizes our greed for money as a happy maker.
B00AYB1RXE|5.0|This is real, makes you think.<br />My son recommended this film. I watched it with visitors from Israel. We all want to buy and listen to the music.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|It is entertaining and you don't have to work too hard.  It is a little implausible at times but worth the watch.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love it ! It gets the mind thinking.  I could play it all day long. Love it love it love it!!!!!!
B00DNDR29I|5.0|Janelle Monae has done it again. From the first song the Suite IV to the last song, the CD is amazing. This is her style and I hope she don't change it because a few poeple gave it two stars (They must didn't hear the same CD). But we don't need another poppy non-singer selling sex. The song with Prince is so great I wish it was longer. This is a good CD if you are use to her style. First timers give it a shot, this is pure talent and no autotune allowed.
B005LAII12|5.0|Very funny movie, highly recommend to anyone from the New England area that likes crude humor, Mark Wahlberg was hilarious, definitely plays a different role in this movie compared to usual!
B00821PCJS|4.0|Good character development and Sci-Fi drama with quirky special effects that somehow still work. It is an OK way to waste time.
B00821OX98|5.0|Thought this was just going to be a rework of V, but it is much more. Love all of the characters and what they bring to the story.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I was nervous throughout the entire movie. It was full of suspense and wondering how is it all going to play out.
B0017MO10U|5.0|i love the entire stargate series. this movie is great because it shows a what if scenario if the gate wasnt never found. must watch if you are a stargate fanatic.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It's a great show. I am hooked. I just wish I didn't have to pay to see season 3 because I want to see what's going on!
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved the book. Completely consumes you. Suspenseful. It's a story to dive into. One of the best books I've read. Passionate, complex and totally worth it.
B00338QENI|2.0|I hated this book.  The author wrote about the black members of Henrietta Lacks' family and community as if she had discovered a shocking specimen.  It was condescending and gratuituous, and the interesting aspects of the scientific uses for Henrietta Lacks' cells and her family's exploitation could have fit into a nice magazine piece. I couldn't read more than half of it.
0425267695|5.0|This book is nothing short of amazing.  If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.  Going to be buying the hard cover version soon.
B000QUCNXG|5.0|I compare the format/style of this book (first person, slow reveal) to The Alchemist - but this book is so much better.  A muslim man sits at an outdoor cafe, slowly unfolding his personal life-story to an American businessman.  What is his intent and attitude toward this American?  We are asked to ponder one man's personal journey as well as the relationship between the Muslim and American worlds.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Very entertaining and very addictive!  I find that I lose all tract of time when I am playing this game.  It is best to play when I know I'm going to be interrupted like in a doctor's office or on a flight somewhere.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This is a long, dense and challenging book to read, but it provides a fascinating glimpse into North Korea.  Although it is fiction, I believe the author has gleaned as much true information about what is going on in that mysterious place.  The characters are unique and creative.
0399159347|5.0|Wow this book was something else. I actually guessed the secret but never could have guessed the eventual outcome, or all the things that were said in the epilogue. That is the part that really made the book so powerful I think.<br /><br />This was a much quicker read than I thought, I couldn't put it down once I got past the first hundred pages or so. I've seen a few other reviews that said the characters weren't introduced well, I did not get that from this book, although it did take me a little while to get hooked. All in all, highly recommended, do yourself a favor and pick this one up!
B000FFJYB6|1.0|How could anyone think that watching and hearing a wounded deer die<br />is entertainment? I turned it off after that scene.

B000UX6THK|2.0|Being a big fan of the X-files, it was difficult for me to resist the comparison between it and Twin Peaks from fans of both shows, it seems that there was some sort of connecetion or similarities between the two shows.<br />I have never watched this show when it aired back int he 90s, just started watching it recently with very high expectations of course.<br /><br />I must say i was let down by the show, it does have its share of charm, like the opening theme is really haunting and wonderful at the same time, it has a stellar cast and familiar faces of actors who made it big now.<br />the plot also seemed promising and involved a murder mystery which is always something that interests me.<br />at first the show started solid, dark with introduction to a variety of characters that really held my interest, but later on, the episodes came to a stand still, nothing really was happening, no events, just endless circles and the episodes seemed void.<br />Not to mention having some romantic scenes here and there and it truned into a soap opera.<br /><br />I really lost interest mid way, and i actually stopped watching the show, and to date i still did not reach the conclusion of who killed Laura, but really i could not go through the show just to find out the conclusion.<br /><br />Having said that, i still understand why so many people love this show, especially those who captured it as it aired back in the 90s, it was fresh and solid for a 90s show, and i am positive i would have loved it too have i had watched it back then,<br />but alot has happened and many TV shows came out since then that are similar but better executed, and unfortunately for me, i do not have that sweet nostalgic effect that most reviewers have here for the show.<br /><br />Indeed very difficult to rate, i would say a 2.5 out of 5 for people who just started watching it, but probably higher for those who grew up watching it.
B005PK56TA|1.0|I just think this show's content is nasty. Why do they have to throw in all of that perverted sex stuff??? The idea of a house being haunted by past owners....is an interesting plot, but it has been destroyed with the abounding perversions. I simply cannot get past them. It used to be that a ghost story just scared you...

B00DJZR46G|5.0|I suspect that Elton John's 31st studio album, \\"The Diving Board,\\" is destined to be one of the most controversial outings of his long and illustrious career. In interviews, following the release of his highly-acclaimed collaboration with Leon Russel, [[ASIN:B003TWP5JC The Union]], three years ago, Sir Elton spoke of his desire to free himself from the pressure to record hit singles, and to focus on making the kind of records he himself really wanted to. \\"The Union\\" was evidence of this new musical direction; happily, \\"The Diving Board\\" continues the trend. With its stripped-down production, and Elton's sublime piano playing once again in the foreground, the new album recalls the classic Elton John albums of the very early 70s--[[ASIN:B000001EG4 Tumbleweed Connection]],[[ASIN:B000001EGC Madman Across the Water]], [[ASIN:B000001EGI 11-17-70]]--and Bernie Taupin's lyrics, consistently superb for more than four decades now, remain as vivid and evocative as ever, displaying, if anything, a new maturity and emotional depth. Every track in this set is beautifully crafted, subtle, and moving. So why should work of this quality be controversial? Simply because the album is, apparently, a labor of love, and rigorously avoids even the merest hint of commercialism. While already warmly embraced by fans of the artist's earliest--and arguably, purest--work, it has garnered lukewarm to hostile reviews from those who apparently expect the catchy, radio-friendly pop rock of Elton's mid-70s heyday. To each his own; this album will certainly not be to everyone's taste. In this case, brilliance will out, I think. But if you're expecting \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\" or \\"Little Jeannie,\\"  be warned; I have no doubt you will hate it.
B00D5CENXA|4.0|Karen Black's short story MOUNTAIN JUSTICE is vivid and immediate. Despite the compact story, characters are fully realized and complex. (Including the horse, whom I loved!) There are tantalizing questions left unanswered, though.<br /><br />Why did Annie marry George, rather than Rob? Why does Rob not marry her once she's divorced? Why do they seem to have settled into mere companionship when it is clear they feel mutual passion? While the reader believes Annie's and Rob's love for one another, it's perplexing that they are apart. But MOUNTAIN JUSTICE isn't concerned with those questions, and surprisingly, the story works very well without answering them. In any case, the reader has little time to catch a breath as events rush on, gathering momentum.<br /><br />This story is no more and no less than exactly what it is - a glimpse of desperate people at two desperate moments in their lives. The reader is plunged into actions and emotions that are already raging. Annie's peril is extreme; George is vengeful and vicious. Will Rob reach Annie in time? Or will George's vengeance finally destroy her?<br /><br />The ending packs a very satisfying surprise, and the reader will believe, after all, that MOUNTAIN JUSTICE was done.
B0036I62AA|3.0|I am not going to say much, but it is a good educational book to read, and it can open a few eyes in people who eat industrial food.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|I love good zombie movies that this one is lame. It just sort of fades out without a real end.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Amazing show. Gripping and fun. Well acted. Why can't American tv be like this? At least, more American tv like this
044024630X|1.0|This was my first Lee Child book and it will definitely be my last.  I found myself predicting exactly what cliche line a character would say next.  The author would present some \\"clue\\" with a drumroll and I was thinking: \\"dude, I figured this out long ago\\".  I found myself bored and impatient.  When it became obvious that I didn't need to continue reading the book to find out where it would end up, I stopped wasting my time.  The author leaves little to the imagination, diving headfirst into the trashy and sensational.<br /><br />One positive thing I will say, this book has inspired me towards trying my hand at writing.  If Lee Child can write stuff like this and get published, and not just this book - but dozens like it (the horror!!), then there is certainly hope for me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic. Great game for all ages. Highly addictive game. I suggest this game to anyone that loves horses. Kindle freezes up once in a while is only complaint.
B00F91H15W|1.0|Not bad. True fully, I didn't expect much. Has almost a documentary film style to it. Emma Watson plays an airhead really well. Not one I need to see again.
0446573027|3.0|Not a Reacher knock-off, but seems to have been influenced. Seems like Baldacci may be trying to cash in on the Reacher creatures and Child's seemingly stalling plots. I picked up the unabridged audio book and maybe it was the readers, but the dialogue seemed very stilted and B level. A few lines actually had me groaning with how bad they were delivered. Overall it was engaging, but only barely. I won't pickup another Puller novel if Baldacci continues in this track.
B00454U1O2|4.0|This is a great CD!  I already have the &#34;unedited&#34; version.  I ordered the clean version, so I would feel comfortable listening to it in the car with my 5-year-old daughter.  Mission is not quite accomplished.  As far as I can tell, the only 4-letter word that has been removed is the F word.  There are a few other words that I would consider removing for this to be a &#34;clean&#34; version.  Also, I was expecting this CD to have the version of Perfect that is played on the radio - lyrics are &#34;less than perfect.&#34;  Instead, this version has an obvious blank space where the F word was edited.  I love Pink, and I guess I should have expected that she would be resistant to &#34;watering down&#34; her lyrics too much.  Needless to say, there are still words in the lyrics that I wouldn't want my daughter to repeat....
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|I started watching this movie thinking that it was the Stallone version from 1995.  That version is far from good but at least it has the decency to make fun of itself to some extent.  This movie is simply bad.  Urban's acting is probably on target for how his character was written, but between the plot, the gratuitous violence and the acting from the rest of cast, the entire thing was a waste of a couple of hours of my life.<br /><br />If you can find a stack of Judge Dredd comic books, sit down in a corner and spend two hours reading those instead.  The movie is infinitely missable.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|In steelheart Brandon Sanderson goes the non traditional route of having regular people fight super heroes who are all villainous in the extreme. Packed with action and colorful characters as is his forte this book will not disappoint.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is a game that is relaxing, but also you have to figure out how to place the coins to get bonus coins and prizes.  My grandsons (8 & 13) love it.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Maggie Smith at her best what a ride! Scenery and the abbey are gorgeous.  Well acted and historically interesting.  I really enjoyed this season

B00F35B8F8|5.0|As a sci-fi fan and avid start trek guy I loved this film.... it was well put together had constant actions from the start and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.... having the back fill on Khan from Star Trek II was an added bonus as well.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game play it on both my kindle and my iPod  touch, and to lay both days daily
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I was never able to watch the series while it was actually on TV. I really love the convenience of watching the episodes when ever I choose. I think all of the characters are all well-played and absolutely love the character of Walter. An amazing actor. Looking forward to season 2 when I want it.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Intriguing story with signature twists and turns. A lot of characters with connections to track but overall a good read.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Child acting at its best. Many memorable scenes and lines- showing that early adolescence is crazy but truly wonderful at the same time. Back in American history when kids were expected to explore the world- with all the scariness that goes with it.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Well, first I must say, I've always been a Bob Dylan fan. This is a very good cd and I've really enjoyed it. Tempest is my favorite song.<br />  Bob's voice has been changing over the years, taking on a gravelly sound, but it seems to go well with the songs he's writing these days.<br />  Dylan's not for everyone, but this is a very good cd.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Another of those &#34;Will she/Won't she&#34; movies in the &#34;please make up your mind already&#34; genre of films for older people with longer attention spans. The acting is fantastic from the ensemble cast, though, and the cameos from real (old) opera stars are fantastic- especially the addition of information about them at the end. Maggie Smith is wonderful, as usual, but the whole cast is what makes it memorable.

B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary is refreshingly free of cheesy pop-up ads, and the daily featured vocabulary word, famous quote and historical tidbits on the homepage are educational and entertaining. It's hard to believe there's not a price tag on this terrific app!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I am writing to review the series so far (7 books) rather than just this book.<br /><br />In general the books are enjoyable to read however by book 2 I started to cringe whenever reading battle/fighting scenes.<br />The 'good' characters rarely ever miss and often have 'perfect' hits, shots, swings and are capable of cleaving the head off of their foes with amazing regularity. At one point the main character even manages to take several heads in one swing.<br /><br />Although this is a fantastical world and the main character has trained with the most elite force of fighting me in the world I still find this very unrealistic.<br />In addition to this other characters such as both princesses are supposedly also trained in combat and each of them also seems incapable of missing either.<br /><br />I could go on however there were also good points to this story chain. The world written about is both interesting and well enough described and you will find yourself enjoying reading about it.<br /><br />The cringe-worthy moments of battle have not stopped me from reading all the books released and if you are not overly critical I believe you will also feel the first and following six books worth spending time reading as well.<br />3 stars for me.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Do yourself a favor and just buy it now.  This show is brilliant.  If you like Dr. Who, Sherlock, Firefly, BSG, you get the idea...you'll love this show.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I found this book absolutely riveting and could not put it down. A pure science fiction that follows survivors of some cataclysmic event now living their lives in an underground silo.It follows the lives of main characters and how they survive in this environment, how they govern themselves as a society when they are prisoners within the silo and the laws and rules created for them. Are they being told the truth about how they come to be there and what is really outside the silo?  Anyone who likes science fiction and reads for entertainment is likely to find this story entertaining.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Awesome movie! WWZ is a must see!!
B006OCM0G0|1.0|This game is stupid. It makes you spend a lot of money just so you can get decent stuff. Don't get it.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Now I didn't play the first game but the cool thing about it is its another story line so you really don't have to play number one to play this one. It's a good game but can be hard at times that's why it looses one star. It is nice you can skip some if the hard puzzles.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Pac-Man is getting popular again. Unfortunately this version of the game stops after the first round and wants money to continue. The game is locked out at this point. It is also annoying with its advertisements for other Nameco games. Maybe paying for the full version of this game will solve these problems. The game itself is still fun, but not having the game controller in my hands makes for some frustration in guiding the Pac-Man icon around the maze.
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|I was bored of this within minutes. Even kids don't have an attention span short enough to think this game is fun. you do the same thing over and over

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful. Don't miss out on reading this book before it's a film. You'll fall in love with the characters- even the ones you should hate. It's a very powerful book.
B00DC8O6T8|1.0|I honestly don't know where all the glowing reviews are coming from. Aside from Safe & Sound, this album is so boring! I bought it because I loved the single and figured with all the great reviews it must be good. Ha! It was the type of album you listen to once and know you will never touch again.<br /><br />Sorry, but I found the entire rest of the album songs boring; bland; totally unmemorable; blah; irritating and just plain bad. Not one single one came near Safe & Sound. It's like it's by a different band.<br /><br />Just listen to a few before you buy, please--that is what I did not do.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a virtual horse. So if you don't have a pasture or lots money to buy and feed a hay burner but you kid really wants a horse, they will love this virtual horse

B00F5F140U|5.0|Elton John. Many people associate the name with supposedly shallow radio pop, romance. That said \\"romance\\" sometimes is about topics such as suicide, loneliness, depression - who cares in radio land? But well: For the major time his music was generally tolerated and radio friendly .<br /><br />Connaisseurs of Elton John's work know that his most brilliant songs are to be found on his slightly unpoppier albums like \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\", \\"Madman Across The Water\\" or \\"Honky Chateau\\". This is the Elton John I love. Since his 2001 album \\"Songs From The West Coast\\" he's slowly returning to that style. And with \\"The Diving Board\\" he finally arrived. Elton's home again. Is this album comparable with the above? Yes and no. The youthful energy, back then combined with - for his tender age - quite mature song-writing, is gone and made room for... Wisdom of age wouldn't describe it adequately. The lyrics of his song-writing partner Bernie Taupin have become different, looking back, memory, reflection. Elton's compositions have changed as well, instead of rocky tunes we get rich black grooves as in \\"The Ballad Of Blind Tom\\" or \\"Take This Dirty Water\\". But one thing, I feel, is back: The tunes finally sound again as if Elton would've exploded if he couldn't have let them flow.<br /><br />There are few singers who have been through equally great changes vocally as Elton has. Thom Bell, drugs, a vocal cord surgery and age can be mentioned as major influences. Also his singing style has altered, and he has found the perfect phrasing for his now baritone voice. No more dramatic belting, a little dirt (malicious tongues say it's hoarse), and above all, real emotion. The musicians he and producer T-Bone Burnett have picked, go perfectly with it: retro-soul magician Raphael Saadiq on bass and Jay Bellerose as a brilliant drummer and percussionist. The trio of piano, bass and drums goes back to the early live-lineup of Elton John, Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson. This works perfectly andtickles some piano playing finesses out of Elton, who moved out of his comfort zone for this. Can he do it? Yes, he can!<br /><br />Personal favorites (actually I love everything, but I'll pick a few) :<br /><br />Take This Dirty Water - Gospel, coming in perfect shape. Groove and a mind-blowing choir, whose soulful quality gives me goosebumps.<br /><br />Dream # 3 - The last one of three short instrumental improvisations. A very jazzy, original showpiece, which could go on for another 20 minutes (and still be too short ).<br /><br />Voyeur - An incredibly intense ballad that really can stand comparison with songs like \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\". And lyrically I can not help but wondering if this \\"voyeur\\" actually is a fly watching everything from a \\"different point of view\\". That would meet the cheeky humor that's always been a part of the work of John and Taupin.<br /><br />My Quicksand - A melancholic ballad, with a hauntingly beautiful melody. This tune comes like a classical piano instrumental first and gets a wonderfully jazzy note in its run. This is just a personal feeling, but this song touched me in a similar way as George Gershwin's \\"Summertime\\" as sung by Ella Fitzgerald. Magical.<br /><br />The Diving Board - New Orleans blues with an incredible horn section. A friend said that the tune brings up pictures of a black funeral band in the Mississippi Delta in her mind. Couldn't say it any better.<br /><br />The Ballad Of Blind Tom - Another soul groove, whose lyrics covering the autistic, enslaved composer \\"Blind\\" Tom Wiggins, who attracted listeners with unsusual compositions in the 19th century, sometimes military march, sometimes almost jazz. With his song-writing John bows to Wiggins, and still the melody is pure Elton. An irresistible symbiosis.<br /><br />I could go on forever, but for the ones in a hurry I can cut it short: This album may not be for everyone, but I'm honestly in love with it!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I wanted this book to continue so I could stay with the characters a little longer. A wonderful development of the characters and how two people with opposite histories and expectations found a way to help and understand each other.  Without giving a &#34;spoiler&#34;, the ending was perfect.
B000001EL7|5.0|It was in 1977 when KISS became the real giants of rock. Their Japanese tour encompassing four cities was one of the most memorable events in rock music history. In the \\"Land of Rising Sun\\" the band gave the most explosive stage show the world could have ever seen. After coming home to America the band began working on the seventh album. KISS wanted their new album to take after its predecessor (\\"Rock and roll over\\") but with more energy and vigour added to it. The album number 7 - \\"Love gun\\" was issued on June 30, 1977. Regarding the music, \\"Love gun\\" was a smashing LP. It seemed that every track on this record met the expectations of all fans of hard rock, but in particular those who were quite demanding.<br />Gene Simmons wrote four perfect and lyrically absorbing songs (\\"Christine Sixteen\\", \\"Got love for sale\\", \\"Almost human\\", \\"Plaster Caster\\"). The last of them could attract those journalists who were more into rock 'n' roll lifestyle.<br />Taking into consideration the songs composed by Paul Stanley, nothing but \\"Love gun\\" was  regarded as the greatest hit. Nonetheless, two other tracks (\\"I stole your love\\", \\"Tomorrow and tonight\\") added something like a bang to this production. It should be remembered that the only song created by Ace Frehley (\\"Shock me\\") was very impressive.<br />Peter Criss and Stan Penridge were capable of composing very good song about at-risk children and youth entitled \\"Hooligan\\".<br />The album ended with sentimental but fabulous song (\\"Then she kissed me\\") which was the pure team effort by Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich and Phil Spector. Presenting this song KISS made it through to the final. The group also showed their artistic value to the world.<br />The lyrics of \\"Love gun\\" can be referred to:<br />- loneliness, love and sex, prostitution, child sexual abuse (\\"I stole your love\\", \\"Christine Sixteen\\", \\"Got love for sale\\", \\"Love gun\\", \\"Shock me\\", \\"Then she kissed me\\");<br />- social and emotional maladjustment (\\"Hooligan\\");<br />- werewolf fiction (\\"Almost human\\");<br />- rock and roll lifestyle (\\"Tomorrow and tonight\\", \\"Plaster Caster\\").wolf fiction (\\"Almost human\\");<br />- rock and roll lifestyle (\\"Tomorrow and tonight\\", \\"Plaster Caster\\").
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very engaging! Great acting and a lively story line. It's like candy for your mind. The story is like a giant Preying Mantas, it just draws you in. Then bam! You're hooked.
B00BX50UEC|5.0|I'm amazed, Eurovision has come a long way, and in my humble opinion, 2013 is the best yet.  I enjoy practically every number on this CD -- the talent was that good!  My favorites?  Norway, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, United Kingdom, Ireland, Ukraine, Greece, Malta, France, Estonia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania...yes, it was that good!

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is one amazing book!  it not only reinforces things that I have been reading about (ex: Esther Hicks) it's very enjoyable.  I have tried a couple of the experiments and am totally amazed at the results.  I will continue to do all of the experiments and I might actually pick up the actual book and re-read it, it was that good and funny too!  I will be putting into practice all of the things I have learned.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Awesome book. I find the characters easy to relate to and the story to be very entertaining. I highly recommend it.<br />It puts me in the mind of a Harry Potterish type of world where Clary is just finding out who she is meant to be and how her friends help her along this new adventure. So if you're into fantasy type worlds like that, you will enjoy this series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A great season of a fantastic show!  Well written,  well acted and the costumes are amazing.  My husband would&#34;t watch it with me but finally I got him to watch the pilot and he was hooked we both had to watch all three season straight through!

B00DJYKFXG|5.0|Three and a fraction stars?  Come on people, this is a 5 Star recording with The Band at it's very best.  As clean and exciting as a live recording can get.  Great box set with all the best from one of the best bands that ever was!
B0073COMUW|4.0|This lightbulb is really sweet! It's a great daylight spectrum which can be used to grow plants quite nicely. I wasn't aware that LED lightbulbs had come this far, but indeed, these things perform as well as if not better than their cfl counterparts.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Great info but functionality is not as always 100%<br />Freezes and locks up too frequently in map screen w overlays
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|This game is just awesome!! And for $.99 this is a steal!! Recommend this game for all who love racing. Only 4 stars because the graphics aren't quite HD, but close enough.
B00AEFXESQ|5.0|When people say that this is the best movie of 1999, they are absolutely correct. This is a touching, sometimes funny, and sometimes heartbreaking film from Sam Mendes. It takes a look at the dark sides (as well as the fun sides) of suburban America. The film doesn't condemn this specific lifestyle, but it doesn't pay tribute to it, either. It's an examination on many of its unique aspects. Kevin Spacey's character Lester is at the heart of the story: here is a man who can't stand his job and is inspired (by his daughter's best friend) to regain his youth. This may be an unoriginal plot (and some of the characters), but it's the way it's executed that makes it so effective. The realism surrounding Lester and his family is almost to a T. Carolyn, his wife, is almost unlikable because of her materialistic fixations. But then again, Annette Bening gives a completely compelling performance. The younger actors (Birch as Jane, Bentley as Ricky, and Suvari as Angela) also give fine performances. Chris Cooper almost steals the show as the supposedly homophobic military man.<br /><br />Filled with impressive imagery, clever symbolism, and a memorable music score from Thomas Newman, I'd say that American Beauty is indeed the best film of 1999. It deserved all the awards it received. It's an American classic, and I think it's going to become one of my favorite films in the future.<br /><br />Grade: 9.5 out of 10
B0073COMUW|5.0|Nice and bright, doesn't use much wattage, I replaced all of the lights in my apartment with LED, these in the main areas where I wanted bright light, and the 7.5 watts &#60; Equal to 40 watts&#62; in the areas where I didn't need such a bright light.  These however are true when they say the 10 watt bulbs are comparable to 60 watt incandescent or compact fluorescent.

B005PK1G76|5.0|Originally bought the BOB caddy for my BOB stroller, but returned it due to defects in the webbing which made it unusable.  Then Amazon suspended sales of the BOB caddy (I assume b/c others had same issue), so I got this one instead... SO glad I did!!  The quality and design are both much better than the BOB version and it fits my jogger perfectly.  LOVE IT!!  I paid almost $15 for it, so seeing it now at less than $7, it's a steal.  Definitely get this one!  I'd still pay the $15 for it and am tempted to buy one at this lower price just to have an extra on hand... but after 4 months of almost daily use mine still looks brand new.

B00F91H666|4.0|Although it isn't exactly like the book it still held my attention and used key parts to set the story in motion.  The special effects and action communicated the panic and terror of the infection.  I liked the way other countries were to communicate how they dealt with the outbreak.

0142422010|4.0|Stephanie Perkins writes the best couples. That is what makes her writing so special. I really enjoyed Anna and the French Kiss and I was looking forward to another light and contemporary read, which is exactly what I got. I was a little wary because I heard that there was cheating in this story (although why that didn't bother anyone with Anna and the French Kiss, I don't know), however I don't think there was really any cheating in Lola and the Boy Next Door.<br /><br />Lola and Cricket have known each other since they were little kids and they are just perfect for each other. I really enjoyed watching their relationship develop and while they aren't one of my favorite book couples of all time, they were certainly up there.<br /><br />It's hard to really get into the plot on Lola and the Boy Next Door because it's really just about Lola growing up, learning who she is, and falling in love. It was a really enjoyable read, but in the end it is a story about relationships. Since there is a lot of great characters to move the plot forward though, it worked.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is a great summer read. It's light and fun, cute and romantic. If you're in the mood for a sweet boy/girl next door love story  this is the perfect book to pick up.
0062073508|4.0|Obviously, since this was written by Christie, this is a really good murder mystery.  A man is discovered stabbed to death on the Orient Express and it's up to Hercule Poirot to figure our who the murder is.  There really isn't much more I can say about the story itself without giving anything away other than I really enjoyed the ending.  Who the murderer was surprised me, although having been written by Christie, that was expected.  This is my third of her novels and I haven't been close at guessing any of the murderers.<br /><br />The only thing I have found in her novels that I don't care for is meeting so many characters all at once.  You really need a notebook to keep track of them, or at least I do.  It can be confusing.

B00B5AP7NY|5.0|My son is a HUGE fan of super heroes and Legos. He's watched this movie about a zillion times already, I'm pretty sure he watched it about 20 times in the first day! It's great.
B003R4ZMNQ|4.0|Yes, it is the TV show, which since we are on a weird time zone is best watched on DVD. My only complaint is that the chapters are labeled in Hawaiian, which makes it near impossible for us howlies to remember which they've already seen.
0446679089|5.0|My brother gave me the book THE LION by Nelson DeMille which I read and enjoyed so much. I then went online to find and order the entire John Corey series.<br />The first book of this series is PLUM ISLAND which I have now read and recommend very highly. I am now resding the next book in the series The Lion's Game.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|I do believe that more than anything, the author wanted to jolt you with her mid-book reveal. And because of that you shouldn't be reading all these reviews and you shouldn't even look at the dust cover if you're intending to read \\"We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves\\" in the manner the author intended, or more aptly stated, hoped.<br /><br />But the reality of things is that the book has gotten so much attention, the story enough hype, that the surprise is no longer a mystery. Rosemary reveals the nut of the novel when she says, \\"I spent the first eighteen years of my life defined by this one fact: that I was raised with a chimpanzee\\" And then adds, \\"I'd scarcely known a moment alone. She was my twin, my funhouse mirror, my whirlwind other half, and I loved her as a sister.\\"<br /><br />This is a book about the relationship between Rosemary and Fern, her \\"sister,\\" but more so, it is an examination of what it means to be a family. And in addition to Rosemary and Fern, the Cooke family makes up a sideshow of characters that includes dad, mom and brother Lowell. There's a lot of family wackiness (read humor) caring and tenderness, to drive Fowler's story. But what you remember is the heartbreak and longing that is what really defines the relationship members of this family have with each other.<br /><br />Fern was removed from the family when both she and Rosemary were six. And there's the pivot of the story. Rosemary, in her circumspect way, goes on with her life as a child and then an adult and that's the arc of the story. Enrolled at the University of California - Davis, Rosemary hitches up with another crazy cast of characters, roomies who sit around together to play \\"whose family is the weirdest,\\" a game that as it turns out even Rosemary has a tough time winning.<br /><br />Fowler's way with words, her phrasing and her ability to handle dialogue to make talk sound like singing are what make this book feel fresh; I felt as if I was reading an author with a new voice. And that's refreshing, and makes the book such a rewarding read.<br /><br />In a word: Piquantoice. And that's refreshing, and makes the book such a rewarding read.<br /><br />In a word: Piquant

B009D5VNLS|4.0|My 5 and 3 y/o daughters begged me to get them this movie because they watch it at Daddy's house.  I finally downloaded it through Amazon Prime and watched it on TV from our Roku.  The download was super fast - we were watching the movie within 2 minutes from the time I hit the 1-click purchase button.  It's convenient to have this movie available to watch from other devices too.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Various scenarios taking place at the same time so it took a few minutes to grasp and follow the plot, but once it happened I was anxious to know the outcome, for all involved (and all are involved with each other, in some way). A good read and very entertaining.
B008TRH5N6|5.0|I have already recommended this book to several of my family members and friends.<br />It has been a pleasure to read this book in its kindle version.<br />I look forward to reading it again and again!
B009CFZLK8|5.0|This movie is over 10 years old now but still one of the best Matt Damon has ever done. The Bourne Trilogy is excellent and this is the 1st in the series and by far the best one. The other two are great but this one really knocks it out of the park. The 4th one with Jeremy Renner is also good but Matt Damon set the bar really high and really that is not part of the Matt Damon trilogy. If you're looking for an edge of your seat suspense this is it.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|The difference in this Near Death Experience (NDE) over thousands of others that have been reported is that it happened to a medical doctor who for years was grounded in the scientific method. NDEs weren’t believable to him.  But in 2008 Dr. Alexander became ill with a disease that left in him a coma for seven days. Friends and relatives gathered around his bedside and prayed and hoped. He wasn’t expected to live. Miraculously, he awoke from the coma to the astonishment of everyone. It took him several days to readjust to earth existence because it seems he had an experience of the afterlife in which everything operates much differently. Talking about such an experience is difficult as everyone who has had NDEs finds out. The experience was so compelling for Alexander that he tries to explain it in this book.<br /><br />One lasting impression that I came away with is the extraordinary understanding he gained while in the NDE: “You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever; you have nothing to fear; there is nothing you can do wrong.”  He describes the world we can expect after our transition comes when the physical body expires. He feels that the unconditional love that he experienced on this journey is the single most important discovery he ever made and sharing the message is his most important task.<br /><br />In the book he explores what consciousness is and how it has been viewed by science and religion. He relates his own background that leads up to the NDE. From the experience he comes to understand that God is present in us all times and communicating with God is natural.  He gains a sense of the interconnectivity of all things. He points out how all the objects in the universe are made of atoms which made up of proton, electrons, and neutrons, all of which are particles. We don’t know what the particles are made of, but we do know they are interconnected to each other.  It was Alexander’s turn to learn about this interconnectivity and pass it along to us.<br /><br />He writes:  “To experience thinking outside the brain is to enter a world of instantaneous connection that make ordinary thinking seem like . . . a plodding event.  Our truest, deepest self is completely free.  . . .  It comprehends that it has no need to fear the earthly world, and therefore, it has no need to build itself up through fame or wealth or conquest.”<br /><br />Everyone who reads this book will probably take away something different. Anyone who has explored consciousness through spirituality will understand. Anyone grounded in science may not.  But it is a worthwhile book to read and ponder.ng to us.<br /><br />He writes:  “To experience thinking outside the brain is to enter a world of instantaneous connection that make ordinary thinking seem like . . . a plodding event.

B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I'm enjoying the game. Nice way to pass the time while waiting at my doctors office. Glad I got it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I am very picky when it comes to books. Usually my ratings for books are: EH. Yes that is an official rating, EH. A lot of books I read I can't wait to finish to get the torture over with so I skim through half of them. Or I read the beginning and the end to find out what happened or I read half of and go to my book club to find out the rest. With this book, I skimmed through some parts in the beginning but then it really got me interested. I don't usually read crime books so maybe I am very naive in reading it. The characters were not admirable at all. Reading these to psychos was like watching two train crashes, you just could not look away and HAD to find out what happens. The ending was even less admirable but I think it showed just how twisted the two characters are even if it is unbelievable. How do you know it is unbelievable? Are you a sociopath megalomaniac ocd liar? It was interesting, it was entertaining, what more can you ask for in a book. I couldn't wait for the train ride home so I could read. I wanted my 45 minute train ride to be longer so I could keep reading. The ending left me thinking \\"huh\\". But it left me thinking which is more than I can say for most books.
B007712XAU|5.0|My husband and I had not seen a single episode of this show until ordering these seasons.  Once we began watching it, we have become hooked!  It is a first-rate production and thoroughly entertaining.  We would highly recommend it.

B000JMKNJ2|4.0|I got totally immersed in the story.  Be forewarned, it gets a bit wordy at first and is slow in building, but once you get used to the style of the story teller, it grabs you.  Written in a manner that reminds me of tales from the 1800's, it paints a vivid setting for the characters, who take on quite distinct personalities that you grow to love or hate.  I am a huge fantasy fan and not one who would even consider reading anything even slightly related to tales of the Mafioso thus tried this with a less than optimistic outlook.  I'm glad I did.  It's a good book and I really like the author's style.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|One of the most entertaining movie I've enjoyed in years.  Mr. Pitt's performance was dead on.  No pun intended.  His body language and facial expressions added depth and intensity to the plot.  Yes, there was a &#34;plot&#34;, not blood and gore.  In fact that was a big plus.  There was Zombies, guns, bombs, all in keeping with the unfolding drama, not for shock effect.  I enjoyed it so much I, purchased it.

Thought I would see what attracted people to the show.<br />Well first off.. I have a soft spot for red heads so Mrs. Pond stole my heart right away. Second. I love the Scottish Accent as my first Girlfriend was Scottish when I lived in Aberdeen. So I watched the whole episode. It was corny but funny and I enjoyed watching.<br />I wound up watching several episodes that night and one or more each night after.<br />I watched all the seasons with Matt and Mrs. Pond but haven't returned to watch any more. Entertaining.

B00C7JGDBW|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />If you just accept as a given that no movie will ever be able to recreate the magic of a beloved classic like \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" then you can have a pretty good time with \\"Oz the Great and Powerful,\\" a lavish, visually dazzling prequel to both the 1939 movie and the L. Frank Baum novels that inspired it.<br /><br />The movie, with screenplay by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire and direction by Sam Raimi, tells us what happened long before young Dorothy Gale from Kansas skipped along the Yellow Brick Road with her three companions - the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion - and her little dog Toto in tow. It shows how a second-rate carnival magician - a self-described con man and humbug - is carried away by a tornado from a black-and-white, turn-of-the-20th Century Kansas (a clear homage to the original film) to a magical, multi-colored land that just happens to bear his name, Oz (short for Oscar). There he encounters an assortment of strange, funny-looking people and creatures, along with three witches, one of whom, Glinda (Michelle Williams), is good, while the other two, sisters in fact (Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz), are evil. Oz also learns that the inhabitants of the land have been faithfully awaiting the arrival of a messianic \\"wizard,\\" whom it is prophesied, will free them all from bondage to the wicked witches. The movie not only shows how the wizard ultimately becomes the wizard but how the Wicked Witch of the West ultimately becomes the Wicked Witch of the West.<br /><br />In many ways, \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" is really just a rehash of the original story, only with the magician in the role of Dorothy this time around. And while the movie could definitely use some trimming from its overlong 130-minute running time, it's worth seeing for its dazzling re-creation of the land of Oz alone. Its visual schema remains faithful to the original, matching the colors, costumes and art direction almost to perfection, and it is, of course, enhanced by all the marvels that modern CGI technology can provide. And as with the original, this new \\"Oz\\" has some of the actors doing double duty, appearing in both the black-and-white and color sequences in the film, and it nicely re-creates a number of key scenes from \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" In fact, the best thing to be said for this version is that its makers clearly revere the original as much as the rest of us do and they are careful not to violate either its look or its spirit.<br /><br />In the final analysis, \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" clearly lacks the emotional resonance, brilliant characterizations, great score, and enduring themes of the original (that would be a pretty tall order for any filmmakers to fulfill), but Franco makes such a disarming wizard and the whole thing looks just so darn spectacular that you may not mind so much that it doesn't achieve the impossible.ourse, enhanced by all the marvels that modern CGI technology can provide.

B00C5R8364|5.0|Forsyth has always been one of my favored authors. This book lives up to the many of his I have enjoyed over the years. The technical nature of work may be off putting to some, but not to this Wise Old Nerd.
B003Z0BWR2|3.0|*WARNING* Contains a few spoilers!<br /><br />Gonna cut right to the chase. This book wasn't much better than the first one.<br /><br />I just can't get into this series like that. Everyone keeps telling me it gets better, but so far, they haven't made a believer out of me. If I wasn't as avid a reader as I am, then I would be officially done with this series. Expectations are just too high and they're not being met. But my interest in The Infernal Devices and The Bane Chronicles are really what's driving me to keep going.<br /><br />Jace is just as whiny as ever (worse even). Clary ain't much better and she's still so BORING. Add in their ridiculous romance and you have yourself one gagarific situation. That business that took place at the fairy court??? Jace and Clary are brother and sister. They're RELATED. What, because they haven't had sex yet that makes it okay? Am I the only one that thinks this is sick? Notice...I did say haven't had sex YET...<br /><br />Anywho, Simon has become much \\"cooler\\" than he was in the first book and Magnus Bane continues to be the only character that I actually care to read about. He's still awesome and his little \\"situation\\" with Alex is kind of cute. Valentine remains a villain worthy of my time. The best villains are the ones that seemingly don't care about anyone, not even their own children and will put their necks on the chopping block with the quickness to achieve their own agendas. Underneath, I think Valentine cares for his family, but damn, it's hard to see that right now. He wants to be rid of the Downworlders and he'll start a war with the Shadowhunters to make this happen. Does Jace choose to fight for Valentine? Well, of course, I'm not going to tell you.<br /><br />I still like the plot, if for the TRULY mundane characters and their lack of growth and maturity. It's amped up with more action, plot twists and turns and of course, a healthy dose of teenaged drama. But like I said, I also want to read the companion series, so I must continue, regardless of how much Clary and Jace get on my nerves.<br /><br />Overall, just another decent effort by Clare. I already own City of Glass and will read it pretty soon, I'm sure. I'm just not that excited about it and that in itself is disappointing.ies, so I must continue, regardless of how much Clary and Jace get on my nerves.<br /><br />Overall, just another decent effort by Clare.

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|First of all, I know everyone is entitled to their opinion so let me start with my personal opinion with that anyone giving this CD less than 4 stars is either:<br />1. Angry that Portnoy left and will refuse to acknowledge that DT is capable of doing anything great without him (or still bitching about Kevin Moore leaving).<br />2. A general \\"Hater\\" of DT and who is probably a musician of some sort and realizes that no matter how hard they try, they will NEVER match the technical prowess of any of the DT Members and therefore find them \\"Dull\\".<br />3. You only like the \\"HEAVY METAL\\" DT in which arguably there are 2 CDs (Train of Thought and Systematic Chaos (Maybe part of BCASL) and you cannot appreciate the \\"Real DT\\" or the more \\"progressive\\" side of DT.<br />4. You are a Die Hard Rush or Pink Floyd fan (or a fan of some other classic Progressive Rock band) and are pissed that in \\"Rolling Stone\\" Magazine, \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" won the best Progressive Rock/Metal CD contest and you are angry at DT for that.<br />5. You are just an idiot!<br /><br />There....now that I got that out of the way lets get to the self titled masterpiece that is \\"Dream Theater\\".<br /><br />If you REALLY know Dream Theater like me (I have been a fan since 1989 and they became my favorite band in 1992, 2 days after \\"Images & Words\\" was released and have seen them/met them countless times live) then you know by now that it takes at LEAST 4-5 listens to a new DT CD before you can start to get a grasp on how good the material will be and begin to review it objectively compared to past material.  I am admittedly \\"biased\\" in the fact that DT is my favorite band and they can do little wrong but I do like some material better than others and will criticize some of their songs or habits (Jordan repeating some similar KB interludes, i.e.).  This has been the case for me with Octavarium which I didn't like at all at first but I enjoy today.<br /><br />Having said that, I honestly liked \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\" after the first 2 listens better than \\"Dream Theater\\" and that concerned me because at the beginning only \\"The Enemy Within, Behind the Veil, Along for the Ride and (of course) The Illumination Theory\\" stood out.  By the 4th listen, \\"The Looking Glass\\" and \\"Enigma Machine\\" really started to grow on me and today by the end of the 7th listen, it was obvious that EVERYTHING CLICKED and it was another masterpiece delivered by the \\"Gods of Progressive Metal\\".<br /><br />YES there are some parts that seem redundant (influences) from previous work as well as passages reminding me strongly of Megadeth, ELP, Symphony X (opener) and especially Rush are recognized through parts of this CD but when you come to think about it, what music today doesn't remind you of something similar in some fashion (in one song or passage!?)  This is PURE Dream Theater and if you don't get it after 5-6 listens that's fine but don't try to tell us you know DT and are a great fan and then give this 2 stars...that is ludicrous and undeserved.<br /><br />Like it or not, Petrucci, Mangini, Rudess, Myung and Labrie are all in top form and deliver an amazing, passionate and emotional progressive masterpiece that will go down as one of their \\"Top 5\\" or possibly even \\"Top 3\\" CDs they have delivered to date.<br /><br />I wont go through the \\"Song by Song\\" list because many have done that but if this were an EP like \\"Change of Seasons\\", \\"The Illumination Theory\\" alone with covers would have made my day but there are so many beautiful melodic moments in songs like \\"The Big Picture, Surrender to Reason and The Looking Glass\\" to make this a worthwhile purchase for any DT fan or Progressive Rock/Metal fan in general.<br /><br />Today I would rate this behind SFAM and I&W and it is still \\"tied\\" at this very moment for me with \\"ADTOE\\" but that could change by tomorrow....there is just SO much to love about this new work and I cannot wait to see it live.<br /><br />I feel very blessed that my firstlive show was in early 1993 and I have been following them since and I honestly hope that I they can perform for at least another 15-20 years at this level.....they mean so much to so many people and they deserve all the success they are reaping...they earned it by working their asses off!!<br /><br />Mock me or like my review, I personally don't give a ****....remember, \\"Everyone is entitled to an opinon\\" and that is my fact for the day.

The fact that you have to wait 30 seconds for a new coin makes it that much more nerve wracking.  You may think you won't be tempted to buy more coins, but once you are into playing you just want gto keep going.  Great game!
0143034901|5.0|Shadow of the Wind. I've puzzled over this title. Technically, a wind would not have a shadow. Or, maybe, it does; but we need a sixth sense to see it. If so, this title is the best anyone could give this novel, although I must confess, I did not feel that way until I got almost towards the end of the book, 358 pages later, to be precise. I found my initially strong interest waning and actually nearly lost about 300 pages into the book. I put it aside and wondered if I'd pick it up again.<br /><br />But, there was something about the beginning of the novel by Carlos Ruis Zafon that intrigued me. It hints at a mystery. But more than that, the novel is multi-layered, from the story within a story to the layers of subtext about life, about people, and about books of fiction and our relationship to them.<br /><br />So, I picked it up again. I am glad I did. This novel reminded me once more of the ways in which fiction could be great. And why I read it. This is one of the best I have come across in a long time and yet, I cannot necessarily explain why. Greatness is probably impossible to understand and explain, anyway. If I read it a second time, I'm likely to find something in it I did not see before; or I might interpret the book differently.<br /><br />One could see Gothic elements in the story, both in its plotlines--mystery, menace, obsessive romance--and, occasionally, in the style of narration. But, even in its translation to English (from Spanish), that sprinkling of Gothic seems to be thoroughly appropriate to the tale that is told. And it is told, not shown: You do not get a narrative of events as they unfold. What you get are recollections by people the narrator seeks out in his search for truth. This method served me quite well, at first, but it became increasingly frustrating to the point where I found myself reluctant to go back to it after setting it aside for the night.<br /><br />My estrangement from the book lasted for some time. And yet, when I finally did finish reading it, I was awed by how engaging and masterfully written this book was.<br /><br />The story within the story spans several decades from circa 1919 to 1955 and emerges from the quest of the narrator who, as a boy of ten immediately after the second world war, is allowed to choose one, and only one, book from a place called Cemetery of Forgotten Books. He selects Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax, an unknown author. The choice is not at all fortuitous, as it will turn out. The book so intrigues the boy that he wants to find more books by the same author and, of course, to learn as much as he could about him. (Strikes a chord?) Here is, in fact, where the book begins as a story within a story.<br /><br />This obsession by the youthful narrator continues into adulthood to about ten years later when most of the puzzles he comes across in his quest are understood, if not tied together. The enlightenment begins on page 359 (print copy) with the telling shifted to a female character who knew Julian intimately.<br /><br />Impatient souls might balk at having to wade through so many pages first before the truly exciting part but this is where you begin to feel, in your bones, the greatness in this book. And you might find yourself eagerly devouring the remaining 150-some pages.<br /><br />You also realize why the first 358 pages are important. They present the characters in the story (about Julian) within the story (the quest) of the narrator. Not only are these characters useful devices for the telling, they also work up your anticipation for the remainder of Julian's tale. But probably more than those reasons, you see the ravages of time on these characters--ravages that, in one form or another, descend upon all of us, if we live long enough. Thus you see: This story within a story is ultimately about time, about how each person's life spins across it; how events beyond our control can propel lives forward into a miserable existence; how time wreaks itshavoc and memories are all we're left of past time. In those dark wet days in Barcelona, in the shadow of fascism, a civil war, and a world war, misery visits nearly everyone; and time is unkind to them.<br /><br />But this is also a story of hope. Hope that infuses three love stories: Obsessive and tragic between Julian and his Penelope (allusions to Penelope in Homer's Odyssey?); fresh and audacious between the young narrator and his Beatriz (allusions, perhaps, to Dante's Beatrice?); and mystical and poignant between the author Julian and the narrator.<br /><br />The last connection is the type that occurs between kindred spirits and reveals itself fully to the narrator only towards the end. It invites interpretations of reincarnation; or, maybe, it merely alludes to cycles of life repeated across time.  As repeated in the story of the narrator, so like Julian's.  As it may be when  the narrator's story comes to a full turn and he takes his son to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.<br /><br />The novel ends in a phrase, by now full of meaning: \\".......their steps lost forever in the shadow of the wind.\\"havoc and memories are all we're left of past time.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|Good movie, but it was just too long for me to sit and watch.  My husband loved it and has watched it a couple of times.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I like the idea and it was easy to set up and use on both my iPad and MacBook. I already have Netflix thru my TiVo. Don't watch much YouTube. The only thing we use it for is watching TV shows we have missed via a browser on my laptop.  Maybe someday they will expand the functionality.  That said, it does everything they say it does, just not a compelling gadget. with a low price, I can justify it for the 4 or 5 times a year I use it.  Still, an interesting concept that can have more content in the future. Hopefully.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book has adventure and comedy in it. It is an easy read. The story is easy to follow. Anyone with a little knowledge of the Greek Gods will understand why the characters have some of the characteristics or quirks that they have.
B0047SKR54|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and found it to be an accurate representation of river combat. Of course the final part of the movie was mostly contrived and totally fiction but wrapped up the story neatly
B003W0BYQ4|5.0|This is a great Western with lively characters and lots of silliness. It begins with a shocking, brutal crime, but then turns into a rollicking, fun adventure. I'd watch it just to see Martin sing along with Ricky Nelson, and Walter Brennan as Stumpy. John Wayne stands by and looks amused.

Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down and finished it in a matter of days. We actually read this for our book club and everyone (well...all 6 of us) really enjoyed the book. I do typically like mystery/thrillers (James Rollins, Harlan Coben, etc.) and this fit right in. I highly recommend!
B00BMUL2WW|3.0|This is a great work of music. My problem is with the packaging of the LP. The type of paper used for the vinyl sleeves is horrible (glossy type). it's bad because it sticks to my vinyl, and makes it hard  for the vinyl to removed from the sleeve. I have scratches on my record as a result of the friction between the record and the sleeve when trying to remove my vinyl. This is a huge problem for me and I hope it can be fixed. Great album!

B001RLP862|3.0|Tough to get used to.  Very slippery to handle.  Bought them as a gift and bought 2 decks for myself.  I am getting used to their 'feel' and I expect to like them better in a few months.  I play cards with grandchildren who do not have clean hands all the time.  These cards seem to be able to endure this. In the past 2 years I have tossed 4 decks of regular bicycle cards (paper) because they were 'grungy'.  These  cards were recommended by my daughter who played cards every day at lunch time while at work.  I think they will be worth the extra cost.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really wish it wasn't one in the morning, or that I had the patience to wait until morning to review this book... but to quote our incomparable Hazel Grace \\"the world is not a wish granting factory.\\"<br /><br />This book is a beautiful blessing of a book, the kind you have to immediately recommend to someone so it can be shared... it has to be shared.<br /><br />Like all of Green 's novels it is deceptively simple; clear, simple prose and impossibly charming characters (seriously there are almost zero unlikeable characters in this book) allow for its complex ideas and philosophy to go unnoticed until its true, profound nature hits you in the chest in such a personal way that you find it hard to believe that the book wasn't written for your eyes alone.<br /><br />It is a very fine, very special novel about life and death in both a small personal and a large universal sense.<br /><br />I loved it. Read it now. Pass it on.
B00F91FRTO|1.0|One of the worst movies I've ever seen. How do you start with such a juicy story (privileged kids who break into celebrity homes to go 'shopping') and turn it into a snoozefest. I can't blame the actors entirely as the script was just terrible. Save your money.
B00B7FXZQS|1.0|Go ahead and skip this one, don't even bother watching it before PA5. Slowest movie I have ever watched, there is literally no ramping up in any of the paranormal activities. At the very end you are finally treated to a little spookiness but it is not worth the bore-fest endured previously.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This is not just Miss Peregrine's Home, it is her world.  A little slow starting, but once you step into Miss Peregrine's world, you will never be the same.  I am looking forward to the sequel.  Each character is drawn with love and the photos are just wild.
B0046ECFRM|2.0|It seems I am in the minority here, but I was pretty underwhelmed with this book. It is about a pretty normal girl on the eve of her senior year of high school who gets whisked out of her comfortable life in suburban Atlanta when her father insists on enrolling her at a boarding school in Paris. A typical high school senior, she is horrified at having to leave her friends and crush just as the last year of high school begins; the allure of Paris is nothing to her. Then she gets there and falls in love and learns to speak French and everything is a dream.<br /><br />The book did make me feel violently remorseful that I never attended a Parisian boarding school, but that was really about the only emotion it inspired in me, so I'm declaring this to be something of a dud. The story pretty much revolves around the growing attraction between Anna and  &Eacute;tienne St. Clair, a student at the Parisian boarding school. What draw me to this book was a number of reviews praising the author for her slow and careful development of their attraction. I think one review even said something like \\"it's so refreshing to have a female protagonist who doesn't fall in love with her suitor the moment he walks into the room!\\" That sounded great to me. I love nothing more than a painful, agonizingly long buildup of angsty romantic tension, and it is so rare in YA romances these days. Unfortunately, these reviews were LIES. An excerpt from the first time  &Eacute;tienne and Anna meet:<br /><br />The first thing I notice is his hair--it's the first thing I notice about anyone.  It's dark brown and messy and somehow both long and short at the same time. I think of the Beatles, since I've just seen them in Meredith's room. It's artist hair. Musician hair. I-pretend-I-don't-care-but-I-really-do hair.<br />Beautiful hair.<br />\\"It's okay, I didn't see you either. Are you all right, then?\\"<br />Oh my, he's English.<br />\\"Er. Does Mer live here?\\"<br />Seriously, I don't know any girl who can resist an English accent.<br /><br />The scene continues with a few awkward exchanges, and then Anna remarks to herself:  \\"The beautiful boy gives an amused grin. His teeth are lovely--straight on top and crooked on the bottom, with a touch of overbite. I'm a sucker for smiles like this.\\"<br /><br /> Really, if this is not an example of a female protagonist falling head over heels the moment she meets her suitor, I do not know what is. She's in love with him from the first moment, and it's just not all that compelling because neither character stands out that much--neither is terribly developed, and I don't really understand WHY they like each other so much.<br /><br />The other problem I had with the romance is that for the vast majority of the book, St. Claire has a girlfriend (not Anna). Call me a prude, but this just irked me. Even as he clearly is falling deeper and deeper for Anna over a period of about 9 months, he resists breaking up with the girlfriend. I found this obstacle to be really off-putting rather than exciting. DUMP THE GIRLFRIEND, it's unfair to both the gf and Anna! I didn't really understand why he is so resistant to ending it with her, and ultimately I didn't care too much because I just never really felt it with him and Anna.<br /><br />That said, this was not horribly written, and the \\"world building,\\" such as it was, was pleasing, so...2 stars.sh accent.<br /><br />The scene continues with a few awkward exchanges, and then Anna remarks to herself:  \\"The beautiful boy gives an amused grin.

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I waited until I was able to listen to the HD audio before reviewing because you can't really hear the layering off of the free stream that was released on rollingstone.com.<br /><br />Overall, it is awesome. Track by track, everything is a slam dunk. I love the direction the band is going. I miss Portnoy but I think it's for the best because if he had it his way, every track would sound like Enemy Inside.<br /><br />My favorite album has been Scenes up until this album took its place.  If every song on Dramatic Turn was as amazing as Bridges in the Sky I would have said that, but it wasn't as cohesive of an album- more like a bunch of songs bundled together.  This album further develops the musical styling that was experimented with in Dramatic Turn but also reminds me a lot of Scenes. Illumination Theory is so much more epic than Count of Tuscany it's almost funny that's where they were less than 5 years ago.

B00F2LIV4E|5.0|I have been a fan since Images and Words and have seen them live many times. This self titled album is excellent in so many ways. First I am very happy with the mix and production. The album sounds really great coming through my main audio system with a clear detailed sound and wide imaging. I have no problem hearing every player at all times. On my less detailed car speakers, the album also sounds crisp and detailed.<br /><br />Song writing is top notch sounding different with still that classic DT sound. Mangini sounds great on drums and I love the more present bass parts. A perfect mix of crazy instrumentals with insanely catchy vocal melodies.<br /><br />This old time DT fan gives this an A+
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Fun game, hooked the moment it was downloaded. All ages enjoy it. Graphics great and just a nice game to pass the time.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|While the basic plot was a great one and the acting was good (and with this cast, how could it NOT be...), the love interest storyline is SO bad that it ruins the film.  The two &#34;lovers&#34; are at each other's throat the entire time.  He spends the first three quarters of the movie belittling her and treating her so badly and then out of nowhere, they say that there is a spark between them.  WHAT?!?!<br /><br />The entire love interest angle of the story should never have been in there.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I had to find out why this all happened. I recommend this to any adult.
B001N4L38K|2.0|As I watched this movie the one thought that repeatedly filled my head was, &#34;get on with it already&#34;. It was clear from the beginning the director had no intent on developing the characters in this film. From the initial battle when Brad Pitt first appears as Achilles, there's no connection with the characters. His 1 second battle with a beast of a man may emphasize his cunning, but it also robs the viewers of an appreciation for who Achilles is. As we're watching Pitt I never got the sense that I was watching Achilles, it always felt like I was watching Brad Pitt play a role.<br /><br />The same can be said about the other characters of Troy - I felt no connection with the characters, instead I kept wondering who the actors were and how they performed in ore roles. Because you have no emotional attachment to the characters, we don't really care much for who lives and who dies. This, in turn makes the already lengthy battle scenes seem even longer and I found myself skipping forward on multiple occasions. The brief conversational scenes were just as monotonous as the lengthy fight scenes. This movie falls short on many levels.

B00BSZZA3I|2.0|I cannot recommend this case.  I was wooed by the pretty photos of it and that it was made by HTC, the makers of the phone- thinking they had some special insight into the design and hence it would yield a very functional case. I was wrong.  I can say nothing positive about this case and can clearly state my complaints with it:<br />1. There is nothing that holds the top of case down, so it never really closes.<br />2. If you do close it, there is no affect on the phone- didn't the apple smart cover come out over a year ago?  Why not follow their lead?<br />3. When open, very difficult to hold; the only effective way to talk on the phone with this case is to use Bluetooth...
B005544TRQ|5.0|I loved this show, season 1 and season 2. What I don't understand is how is season 1 and 2 free and Amazon charges for season 3???????
B008CLI4N4|4.0|It's great, but, one star deducted for the gratuitous sex scenes. They're just unnecessary.<br /><br />There are more sex scenes in a show featuring children than in any comparable TV program.<br /><br />The shots are titillating, if you need that kind of thing in your life, but there's no real context for any of it. At certain points, Game Of Thrones comes over as little more than pornography.<br /><br />Woman walks in, takes top off, lord tells servants to leave, sex ensues.<br /><br />It breaks up the action, the character development and the intrigue. Yes, it's a show for adults. Yes, people have sex. But people go to the toilet too and there's no effort to show that.<br /><br />I suppose this is all leading up to a series where we can expect penetration shots, and lots of group sex interspersed with an increasingly shonky story line.<br /><br />It's a slippery slope. Is it trying to compete with the internet by showing 'quality sex scenes'? Resorting to so much of it mars an otherwise excellent program.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I read this book on a recommendation from a friend and I was left wondering what he liked about it.  Usually his recommendations are always 5 stars for me but not this time.  The plot was light-weight, the events were predictable.  It is entertaining but not 5 stars for me.  It's just okay.

My only criticism was that I felt the end was a little hurried.  I wanted more and I felt the ending could have been stretched a little further.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I bought this for my 3 yr old daughter, and I think I enjoy it more than she does. She likes the characters and i like the assignments. There is pressure to spend real money in game, but thanks to playing it in kindle free time and my own will power, we've done pretty well not sinking money into the game. You are able to progress through the first 20 levels with just grinding away at it (that's as far as I've gotten after 2 months). I've had some glitches with the countdown timer for Mr Rays homework assignments, but they are optional, so nothing devastating. I have also noticed an increase in ads. It's annoying especially since its the same one over and over.  Despite that, my daughter and i play it together at least 3 times a week.
0812550706|5.0|While reluctant at first, once my son started reading this book, he was hooked.  My son's taste in books include the Inheritance Cycle series, Percy Jackson series, Harry Potter (of course), and the like.  He thoroughly enjoyed this book and wants the next one (which I, of course, got for him because what parent wants to tell their child &#34;no, don't read&#34;).  :)  As an aside, this is my brother-in-law's favorite book of all time.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I would not recommend this book. It had crude language and too detailed sex scenes. I don't think anyone needs to read about people being raped. That being said, I had to finish it because I wanted to know where it was going, but I felt like I was doing something wrong whenever I would be sitting next to someone while reading it, like they were going to catch me reading these nasty things. Ever felt like that? So no, don't even bother reading it.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Well written and engaging, worth the time to read.  A well-written story that maintains interest throughout.  This would be a great read for a book club.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|I had no idea that this box was going to be so small it is just tiny little legos, there's nothing really special about it other than that it says Minecraft on the cover. I wouldn't buy again for the price.
B00AEFY66U|4.0|To really understand this film, or the novel behind, you have to keep in mind the alternative story that D.H. Lawrence tells us in Women in Love. In the same way we are dealing with love in the upper class of the very rich  before the First World War and then after before the big crisis of 1929. I will not compare the two here but the two films also came out in the same period, the early 1970s after the 1968 political and generational crisis. They both carry the denunciation of the upper class.<br /><br />We are telling the story from an outside point of view but yet close to the protagonists. The story teller, Mr. Nick Carraway, is a neighbor of Mr. Jay Gatsby and a bond seller in Wall Street, New York. Nothing to do with present time golden boys, the traders in Brokerage firms. Well-off but definitely not rich and anyway with no rich parents. Yet he is the cousin of another woman who is from an extremely rich family, married to an extremely rich man. Gatsby is the black sheep in the neighborhood.<br /><br />He is from an extremely poor family. He managed to get an Oxford education after 1918 because he became an officer and was heavily decorated during the war and he then took advantage of veterans' privileges. He had also the chance to fall in the hands of a certain Meyer Wolfsheim who introduced him to business, though we are never told what that business really is. We can imagine, due to the speed with which he became rich (less than eight years) that it had to be in some financial speculation in the 1920s. That period is clearly identified with the paraphernalia of the time and with the music, including the dancing, including the famous song Charleston. Note that Jay might not be a real first name, but an initial and that the name Gatsby is not the real name of the man who was the son of  a certain Mr. Gatz we see at the end. Note too that the name Wolfsheim is of course meaningful and the main principle of this man is \\"we can be a friend of a man when he is alive, but not when he is dead.\\"<br /><br />At the end of WWI, Jay Gatsby, alias Major Gatz, fell in love with Daisy, a rich girl. But he was a poor man. She fell in love with him on a short-lived whim and he fell in love with her forever. But a rich girl does not marry a poor boy, as she says so well. So he disappears to build a fortune and she got married to a rich boy and became Mrs. Daisy Buchanan.  She had promised to wait but rich girls never wait.<br /><br />When he is finally rich he manages to get close to her and then to be introduced to her by her cousin, Nick Carraway, and before he had tried to attract her attention by having enormous garden parties every week end in that summer of 1926 or 1927. She eventually falls in the trap.<br /><br />The rest is to be discovered in the film, or the book.<br /><br />The morality, bad word, the immorality of this film is that in spite of the American Dream, rich people attract and mix with rich people and poor people can only eventually be accepted when they are rich. The second lesson is that rich people with a rich pedigree can always manage to get through any crime or accident or whatever particularly by pointing at another of their class but that does not have the rich pedigree they have. This immorality can even be worse: rich men can have as many poor mistresses they will furnish with some luxury as much, and as many, as they want or can afford. But a rich woman is not supposed to have any affair with a rich man of any sort, and she will not condescend to have an affair with a poor man. It would not be in anyway anything but a short and exciting sexual episode that would be doomed even before it starts, and like the praying mantis she would destroy the poor lover after using it.<br /><br />In other words a woman is the property of her husband but in no way the husband is the property of his wife, and social inequality is absolute in the USA, just like in Great Britain, in the 1920s just the way Henry James described it in his novels more than thirty years before. Nothing has changed.<br /><br />The narrator is able to express this immorality and that is the only moral element in this film, and novel. Morality is on the side here of the upper middle class, and a lower stratum in that upper middle class. That means there may be some hope for such a society that is doomed because the rich do not care for their neighbors in all the meanings of this word. They only care for their money and the gossips that can be aired around them about them.<br /><br />This older film shows these elements with great care but at the same time it is obvious Jay Gatsby is not natural as a rich man. He is not able to play the game properly: he is awkward, he is shy, he is inconsiderate in his presents and in his lavish help he may give to someone who is trying to make him realize one of his intentions or desires. One hundred white roses are not even enough in such a situation and he very well may send one thousand. The dialogue is good too in the fact that Jay Gatsby is the only one who has a linguistic idiosyncratic tick and he calls every man \\"old sport\\" and such an Oxfordian tic shows in him a rather recent integration in the class of the super rich: he cuts a role, a character, a behavior and sticks to it: he believes in a way the tuxedo makes the money aristocrat. And he is wrong: the money aristocrat is in the careless and nonchalant way he wears the tuxedo and that cannot be imitated.<br /><br />All together a beautiful but cruel film on the egocentric selfishness of the super rich born super rich.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUribed it in his novels more than thirty years before.

1470335492|5.0|I haven't read many other books by Ian McEwan, but I really enjoyed this charming novel. The characters and story were vivid, believable, and compelling. I especially enjoyed McEwan's focus on what it's like to read and to write fiction. The nested stories told through the voice of the writer within the novel were quite remarkable. Perhaps speaking through another character allowed McEwan the freedom to explore different topics. The audiobook narration by Juliet Stevenson is a wonderful match between reader and material. Her voice, with its spot-on accents and nearly musical tones, gave life to McEwan's words, and was every bit as seductive as the beautiful central character.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|I loved the story and watching it unfold over the years. Worth reading from the beginning more than once in your lifetime.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Great look into the world of putting on a broadway play.  Lots of drama and great performances.  Can't wait to watch the next season, totally addicted to this show.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I bought this book on a whim one evening, curious of what the husband's secret could be. Even after finding out, I was shocked had never expected what it really could be. This book is a fascinating page turner. I'd give it TEN STARS if I could! I haven't read a book this expertly written in a very long time--and I'm an avid reader. The characters are very well written, their tales and relationships amazing entwined. It's a story that will make you think, long and hard, about what you would do in all of the situations portrayed, and leave you thinking, \\"what if?\\".<br /><br />Don't think twice, buy the book!!
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. Plays this role wonderfully. He got into character very well and played Chaplin great. It was a good movie to watch.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|My husband & I have enjoyed SUITS from the beginning and continue, for the most part.  The most recent season seems to have gone over the top with the cursing.  We're used to cursing and foul language when appropriate, but the excessive use in Suits is like getting slapped in the face repeatedly while trying to read a good book.  During one episode, we just started counting the number of times the actors said God-damn.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and thought it was great, but when I saw it again on Blu-ray, it blew my mind!  Great acting, great story twists, and special effects.  Well worth the purchase to add to the collection, plus it comes with a digital copy to throw on the tablet for a flight or camping trip
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I could not have enjoyed the end of the Name of the Wind without knowing that there was more to come!  Such an excellent beginning to a series...and so beautifully written!  I just hope the end of Kvothe's story is as amazing as the first two books have been.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Loved this film when it hit theaters and love it even more on Blu-ray along with the special features!  It's generally predictable as the same world-ending scenario has been played out before, but the \\"fast\\" zombies in this flick are similar to the Rage Virus.  Worth a watch for the typical movie buff who enjoys world-ending movies!  The Walking Dead comes back October 13th!!!
B000RLH2VM|3.0|Not very much new or interesting in this movie, but there are a set of really long car chases for those who love that.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was a shared experience that I did enjoy sharing. Sometimes a bit mundane but still worth the read. hope you enjoy
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|It was nice to find out what happened to Danny Torrance...and I enjoyed the book...but there were some things that really irritated me about it too.<br /><br />1.  The True Knot/The Steam/Rose the Hat - Seriously?  The names just seemed really juvenile and trite.  I like the idea that groups of old people in their RVs might really be evil creatures...but couldn't King have come up with some really frightening names for them?<br /><br />2.  <Spoiler> Half-brother and sister?  How convenient.<br /><br />3.  <Spoiler>  Who knew that defeating evil would cure cancer?<br /><br />I've read other reviews, and know that there are some other reviewers who really disliked the AA stuff.  That part didn't bother me, probably because it's so familiar to me.<br /><br />Things I did like:<br /><br />1.  Danny's ultimate secret and his home group's reaction to it.  Yay, free pizza and cake! - we've heard worse.<br /><br />2.  The whole turntable explanation and description of Danny's and Abra's exchanging viewpoints.<br /><br />3.  The overall winding up of a previous story.<br /><br />As others have written, I didn't find this scary - probably because I read The Shining when I was in Junior High and I'm (much) older now, so I'm scared by different things (more the things that scare Dan Torrance I suspect).  Sad, bittersweet, poignant and a good read, but not scary.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. The main characters are so real I felt like I knew them personally. Highly recommended read!!!!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I have been using this app for three days now, and have really taken a shine to Duolingo.  For me, setup was easy, deciding straight away to begin relearning German, which I took in High School.  The style of teaching here is through immersion: you know it or you don't.  I can imagine that this might be frustrating for those who have never taken a language course, but I think this is the best way to learn: making your brain work a little instead of learning through rote.<br /><br />A note about symbols: if you need to add an accent to your letter, hold down the key for a second and the options will appear, like s&ouml;.  S&Euml;&Eacute;?  &Iuml;t's ea&szlig;y!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Ok it's pretty obvious these books are worth a read. I wish there were more than 3 but I'm glad otherwise I would never get anything done. I think what I appreciate most is the writing in present tense. It's gripping and inclusive, whereas so many romance novels are written in the past tense feeling like you're just looking back on one long memory.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|A funny excellent read! Fey's public persona shines in this book. I have the audio book and have listened to it multiple times.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely captivating novel. Impossible to not read the 2nd novel with an ending like that. Save yourself the time and money and just buy the trilogy.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read the trilogy in a week. Absolute hazard for productivity. Now I have to wait for the movie and the casted characters hold no promise to the flawlessly beautiful characters described in the novels. I hope it's a win.
B0018OFN4U|1.0|It really wasn't funny. I expected a lot and got nothing. I was going to Ireland, and I had heard that this would be a good and funny movie to see as a prelude to it such a vacation. It was not. And I love Irish and British humor. I just don't get why this was so highly rated.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is the 1st of a trilogy.  Immediate after finishing Fall of Giants, I wanted to read book two.  Both were great reads.  Can't wait for book 3 to come out.
B00F35BV64|4.0|This was an entertaining movie.  The actors are well cast and do an excellent job of portraying their characters.  There is a lot of action throughout.  Altogether a very enjoyable movie.
B004DM1ZQY|2.0|The more I played this game, the more often the Ai opponent started rolling doubles nearly every single roll!!! How can you compete with that?? And not only that, the doubles were the number it could use the most to maximize moves towards a win! I'm sorry to say, but I honestly believe there is a flaw in the game that favors the device when in single player mode. If the rolls were more random, or the gameplay were more 'fair', It would definately get a higher score from me, but not the way it is. Also, one othe thing a LOT OF DEVELOPERS IGNORE ; AN EXIT BUTTON!!!!!!!  I'm not a developer/programmer, but how hard can it be? Too bad about all this, I love Backgammon!<br /><br />I read some of the other reviews and most people (as I do) that the dice are loaded. The roll should be as random as you can possibly make them concidering the limitations of programming. The differences should be where the AI decides to move the game pieces, leaving more open, or not, depending on the level. The dice rolls should ALWAYS BE RANDOM and have the same probability for both players. This would be the way it happens in real life with two people playing a real game. If the game ever gets updated to reflect better play conditions, my rating will go up.
B00EL8I8IS|4.0|My whole family enjoyed this. It's not an overly gory film unlike most &#34;scary&#34; movies.  Done in a believable scenario.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I and my family are hooked on the new Star Trek series of movies. We ended up seeing it in the theater twice and bought it so we can watch it again and again. The more you watch it, the more you realize you missed some little tidbits that tell what is going to happen later in the movie.
B00CQZ65SI|4.0|Book was well organized and an day quick read. It's filled with a mix of details on what kind of commitment it takes to be at the top of tennis as well as some practical nutrition advice. I would uveal it a diet book. It's more about how you can improve your neutrino and the impacts it had for him and could have for you.
B008ENNXQI|3.0|I prefer the original ,  this movie was not intended for children , really?  was it?  I am not sure.  It was surely not for adults.
B00F5F0208|5.0|Drake brought his rap skills to this album while still being able to give us his emotional story.  No one has ever done rap like Drake does allowing his listeners into his heart and telling us what he feels.  He says the fame is great but also describes the pains that comes with being away from home all the time and losing his connections between him and his family/friends.  I also believe that people feel that Drake had it easy in life but that is the the furthest thing from the truth.  His family had their struggles and he had his bottom but everyone's bottom is different and he does a fantastic job of telling his story.  Wouldn't be surprised to see another Grammy award/nomination out of this album
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Saw the first one years ago with Sly...this one was better.  Liked the story and the actors.  Hope they do a sequel.

B00CLD65X0|5.0|I don't know how they can make it better. The cliffhanger is gut wrenching. I'm nervous and excited the upcoming season. I definitely root for some characters and boo on the others! There are those villains that you love to hate. I hope this series doesn't end anytime soon. I feel so invested with all the characters. I'm so glad I'm hooked.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|i love  it. it works  great<br />its awesome and is totally easy and keeps my memory refreshed and clean and its quick as well
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I surely hope it wins tons of awards! I love it. I love the length of the shows. I couldn't stop watching; it seemed there weren't enough hours in the day to watch the whole season (and go to work and take care of the family)! This series makes you laugh and cry. I love the attention to detail. I've learned a lot about that era just from this show.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|its been years, and while i love most of the cd, the art work on the last 2 cds, is like ahhh .I know you like blonde hair, but are cher has black hair, the photo looks like bad porn. I am a big fan  I love the fast songs, my love, dressed to kill, red, I think Sirens should be a single, what a great song. Its cher, The first 6 songs are dance cher and i love all of them. She tries new things with I walk alone, and then the rest of the cd is slower. But all and all. I can see Sirens, and Dressed to kill and Lovers Forever being front runners for singles from the cd. Just wish the art work ( cd cover) would have been as great as the music. I wish she would have used the single Womans world for the cover. Great music and great artwork go hand and hand. I hope she changes it like heart of stone, but i liked the first cd cover better than what they changed it to. Please cher, we know your pretty, but do some great artwork that as good as you are.  and your new cd. I love it. welcome back.

B00C8985DU|5.0|The price tag for the deluxe edition may be steep but it is well worth the price of admission. The amount information that is packed into the set is staggering! After going through the set you really have the feeling you were there on the tour with the rest of the band! Those of us who are old enough remember the WIngs Over America Tour this set is a real treat.! In 1976 it was a legendary tour for McCartney and to almost 40 years later have the chance to delve deep in the Paul's archives for the tour is a really treat for the serious fan!<br />  There is so much to the set! The reproduction of the tour itinerary is amazing in its detail. complete with stage plots, Reproduction of tickets and a reproduction of the original tour program is amazing! There is a full book of photos taken from Linda McCartney that document the whole tour from inside!  A 112 page book documenting the whole tour by David Fricke. Plus a hardbound book of sketches done by Henry Ocean on the tour!<br />  Well the music has been around for years! Wings  over a america was a classic when it came out. It is nice to have remastered for the new millennium! The bonus disc from the Cow Palace is a very nice bonus. Living  in San Francisco I remember that show well. It is nice to finally have that show on disc! There is also a bonus DVD that contains the Wings over a America.TV special..<br />  First off I would only recommend the deluxe edition for the hardcore fan that really wants to dig deep into it. This set would be too much for the casual fan that would be happier with the standard cd reissue. Wings over America is hands down the best release of McCartney's deluxe edition releases. I have purchased them all Band on the Run, McCartney, McCartney II and Ram even though all of those sets are amazing in detail they are pale in comparison to this mega set. As I said at the beginning the price of admission is steep on this set but well worth the price for the serious collector.
0451450523|5.0|The writing of this book is simply a masterful and colorful style that fills the imagination with wondrous sights without lulling the eyes to slumber with overwrought descriptions of meaningless baubles.

In a sea of books that put me to sleep with descriptions of various pointless items its nice to actually go on a fantastic adventure.

None of the songs are remotely as interesting as &#34;This Day Aria&#34;.<br />Animation: This is tough, didn't notice anything bad but not movie tier so definitely underwhelmed.<br />Story: They have 75 minutes and they still can't quite get the pacing right.<br />Setting:  boring compared to the fantasy setting of the original.

B000000H57|5.0|Overall, this band speaks to my heart. There is something about their music that appeals to me on a very deep level. It's a mash of alternative, goth, and a kind of dreamy metal. Themes of death, paganism, depression, the supernatural, and doomed love are the main ones. The melodies and music are/is amazing, and no one could do vocals for this type of music like Peter Steele could (RIP). Several of the songs are fairly lengthy epics: Love You to Death (one of my favorites), Die With Me, Haunted. (Green Man and Wolf Moon are my other favorites.) There isn't a bad song on here. I have listened to this CD so much, it is almost time to buy a new one, it's so worn out. I have every one of their CDs and this is my favorite. It's depressing, yet humorous, spooky/creepy, and yet beautiful and so much deeper than most bands could ever be.

B006YTTVHO|5.0|Sometimes circumstances take the words right out of our mouths, so I found that even though some of the things we say are in this book, it is stated in such ways that it makes it easier for us to say and say it with sincerity, not just words that every one says over and over.  I find I come back to this book and re read it when I can't seem to find the words I am looking for. I have this book in my cloud so I can grab it when I need it.

B00D2PIUAM|5.0|seven, yes seven albums into their career, the gentlemen in placebo have crafted their finest work since their third album, 'black market music'.  i KNOW for a supreme fact that i'm going to get chewed to bits here, but let's face some facts: 'sleeping with ghosts' and 'meds' and even 'battle for the sun' (yes, more than a decent \\"rock\\" album...) had their moments, many shining stellar moments.  'meds', 'post blue' 'commercial for levi', 'kitty litter', etc BUT they hadn't made a rock solid track by track o p u s.  shiny, stellar throughout, no b sides needed to satiate fans looking to replace their least favourite album cuts. 'loud like love' is so unbelievably great in every sense of the word that they could do nothin else in their career and still be considered one of indie rock's finest acts.  grueling, glittering placebo shine that only they can do so well.  just an exceptional recording.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|Reading this book was very enlightening as it goes against what we have been taught the last 20+ years.....I do believe that Dr Perlmutter maybe have hit the nail on the head ...the current diet/ nutrition mantra is not working.

B0019X3YXM|2.0|I watched the original South Korean [[ASIN:B00A3TFMDI My Sassy Girl: Director's Cut]] a couple of weeks before this sad American remake and it blew me away; so why you might ask would I watch this very poorly-reviewed retread?  Ehh, it's just one of the things I do, I guess. There's actually an Indian remake also, and a Chinese sequel - the Korean film was a huge success across Asia - but if they're no better than this, I won't be making an effort to track them down (well, not MUCH effort).  Still, I'd have to guess that the mixture of melodrama and broad comedy that the original film captures so brilliantly is not as foreign to other Asian filmmakers as it obviously was to American director Yann Samuel and screenwriter Victor Levin.<br /><br />Canadian actress Elisha Cuthbert plays the \\"sassy\\" (read: obnoxious, rude, nearly psychopathic in this film) girl, given a name in this version (\\"Jordan\\"), and Jesse Bradford plays her hapless savior/suitor Charlie. It's pretty much a scene-for-scene remake of the original, but transplanted entirely to Manhattan and cut by about 40 minutes, which removes any possibility of the subtleties of the Korean film, particularly in class and gender issues; here we get a much more simplistic contrast between uber-rich girl and struggling from-the-sticks guy.  The fantasy sequences here just seem like throwaways, because Jordan just isn't as well developed as Gianna Jun's character was in the earlier film, and because there is little that is endearing about her until near the end.  The Korean film's lengthy run-time (in the extended version) and use of a wider variety of locations helps give it an almost \\"epic\\" feel (if a romcom can be epic) and really does help to make the central relationship at least borderline believable. Here we're just racing towards an ending that feels nearly as cliched as the idiotic intro with our intrepic hero's flyover-country parents (the one signficant change from the original, and a poor one).<br /><br />It's not entirely worthless; some of the virtues in the sentimental ending of the first film seem to work against all odds in this gutless remake, and Cuthbert and Bradford are a very, very attractive couple.  But overall...blech.  There are loads of reasons why I'm so attracted to Korean romances, and why most American examples these days are just horrendous, and nearly all of them could be found just by watching these two Sassy Girls.It's not entirely worthless; some of the virtues in the sentimental ending of the first film seem to work against all odds in this gutless remake, and Cuthbert and Bradford are a very, very attractive couple.

B00E9E4EC8|5.0|You won't find (1) song you don't like! Or at least I didn't. It's true to country roots! and I love most country old and new. You'll kick off your shoes and dance without...smiling the whole time! Highly recommend!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The scenes are very diverse and the objects are hidden differently each time and keeps the game fresh. I recommend it highly.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Such a funny show, great for the entire family.  Zooey is genuinely funny and great for this part.  So happy the new season has begun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My opinion is that minion rush is the BEST GAME EVER it is great for kids age 2 to dead
B00992CF6W|5.0|It awesome and very fun  it's very similar to the PC and Xbox 360 versions  Can't wait til the next update. =b
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's great! It's helpful and I like the bright colors.<br />Never expected this app to be good. I definitely recommend this app
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the fact that it is inexpensive to download the book and also I don't have to wait for it to come in the mail.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|As a star trek fan, I have to say this movie really is only star trek in name. If you like stuff blowing up every minute you will enjoy it enough I guess.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was able to download it within seconds and have it at my fingertips :) Awesome book. Great way to read it.
0790733226|5.0|One of my favorite movies, its one of the few true scifi movies out there. On a side note the dvd thingy that holds the disc down was broken so the dvd was flying around while shipping.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Perhaps not the best person to have as a baseline, but sure you can learn a lot about building great products  and great fans.
B00DYVESVO|4.0|I have always been a huge Hulk fan, but haven't read comic books for years. I came across the WW Hulk series, but the price threw me off at the time. When I saw this for only $3.99, I jumped on it right away. This was an alright story with the Hulk doing what he does best. Smash! He beats up a bunch of super heroes, who had banished him into space. He is angry and he wants revenge. However, the overall story seems rushed and incomplete. If I had paid full price for this, I would have been disappointed. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the story overall and the books really come to life on the iPad. The Kindle app is great for reading comics on the iPad and has caused me to add comics back on my reading list.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This movie should be viewed by everyone, worldwide.  It is shameful what men of wealth can do to keep people under THEIR control.
B009CG29RK|5.0|I don't often enjoy an animated movie made by anyone other than the geniuses at Pixar, but this movie is a delightful exception.  And a fantastic vehicle for the inimitable Steve Carell. Rent it, buy it, love it.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Love Angry Birds and this Star Wars option is fantastic.  The kids love it especially the Yoda.  I think they like it more than the first Angry Birds Star Wars game
B0001I561E|5.0|I remember having this movie on VHS when I was little, so as soon as I saw it on DVD I had to get it for my girls!<br />Love it!
B00358ESI4|4.0|This movie depicts the horrors of war, both on the Barttlefield and on the people on the homefront. It's graffic so if that bothers you don't watch this film. It starts of slow to build up the story line, it is  needed to set up individual lives of the soldiers. All presidents should watch this movie before deciding to go to War!!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|great product, as described.<br />we love this movie. watch it quite often. The songs are catchy, and my girls love it!
B00CF34B2I|2.0|The game literally cheats as it is...in the card game --during combat, your creatures are supposed to take damage before you, not so here.  During damage resolution, triggered effects, such as when a creature deals damage as it dies, are resolved instantly, and not at the end of the opponent's other creatures' damaging effects.
B0053TMP24|5.0|A MUST read book that you can't put down! Love it! Recommend this book to everyone because his books are the best! Well in my opinion:)Can't wait till the next book!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved every bit of this game but I wouldn't have minded it being a little longer! I wish I could find something comparable to this but all the other puzzle games fall short.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love it, and its hugely addictive, however, I will not be spending $4.99 on the c complete game. It's an app, not a textbook. Still, it's gorgeous , and if I we're gonna spend five bucks on a game, this might be it.
1416955070|5.0|I love the book, it's a story world I can dream about.  I definitely recommend the book to anyone who liked the twilight saga, the writing seems alike in some ways...
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|i have amended my review, and have given it four stars after giving it initially three (Is it worth even 4.5?). I must confess I was guilty of judging too early, and after listening much more have come to a different conclusion - this album is good, very good in fact. If you are interested to read my previous review (below), please do so. I still think many of the negative points I mentioned are valid and will prevent Dream Theater from being as good as they could be. But basically any Dream Theater fan should be well pleased with this offering and initiates wouldn't do wrong starting here either.<br /><br />______________________________<br /><br />After the excellent ADToE album, it looked like Dream Theater have re-found their form after spending some time out in the wilderness on the previous few albums. It also seemed that the prospect of a new chapter with a new drummer had invigorated the writing sessions. So with Mangini fully on board for this outing, we were all expecting great things. I must say I'm disappointed, and this album can only be considered average at best.<br /><br />The die-hards are already singing it's praises, but seriously, listen to Images and Words and then listen to Dream Theater and then listen to Awake - can you honestly say they're even in the same ballpark? Dream Theater's first few albums (up to and including Falling Into Infinity, IMO, Scenes from a Memory I like, but the Rudess factor had set in...) were genre defining classics, full of originality and fresh ideas. Dream Theater's self-titled album fails by the standards of their previous work, and also it seems these guys are living in a bubble. There is a serious amount of very high quality prog-metal going on these days taking the genre into still more exciting territory. It seems however that Dream Theater are content to become out-dated dinosaurs re-hashing the same old album time and time again.<br /><br />So why exactly have they failed to deliver? I think it boils down tothis: Dream Theater aren't particularly good song writers any more. Sure they have a few killer riffs and hooks (but not nearly as many as they used to), but they suck at the bigger picture of composition, giving there pieces overall shape and direction. The opening track highlights this point, a short instrumental that is just a barrage of riffs with no structure, and it's over before anything's really happened. They also fall foul of this in the epic Illumination Theory. It's a long juxtaposition of unrelated themes, and ultimately a dissatisfying work. The true prog rock epics (even A Change of Seasons) successfully uses recurring themes, motifs and recapitulations to give the piece an overall coherence and justify their immense length.<br /><br />The Enigma Machine is an instrumental, with no particularly interesting riffs, and really is nothing more than a shred-fest. Compare it to their beautiful instrumentals from a bygone era such as Erotomania of Hell's Kitchen and the result is almost embarrassing. There a couple of tunes that are too uncomfortably close to sounding like Rush for me too.<br /><br />Finally, the production isn't that great, and it's been mastered to hell homogenising it into a monochrome wall of noise. And like everyone else is saying, the drum sound really does suck. The musicianship is stellar, as always, but even Mangini disappoints me a little. He is such a phenomenal talent, and being a drummer myself, am an avid follower of his work. So far I've not heard anything that innovative, just fast tom rolls following the lead work of Rudess and Petrucci. Rudess is still demonstrating how the get the very worst sounds of of his no doubt very extensive and expensive arsenal of keyboards. Since Scenes From a Memory I've always thought he has shocking taste in sounds, and especially his lead sounds are no good at all. Listen to Adam Wakeman's lead sounds for examples of how it should be down on Headspace's [[ASIN:B007RXC416 I Am Anonymous]].<br/><br />I guess the tone of my review is pretty harsh. It's not a terrible album, it's still good fun in places, and worth a listen if you're a Dream Theater fan. But there's a heck of a lot wrong with it. They've done much better in the past, and other bands are doing much better within the genre these days, e.g. Haken's new release [[ASIN:B00ELD19OI The Mountain]], a hugely innovative work that just leaves this standing. I've bought a ticket to see Dream Theater next February, and with a 600 mile round trip (I live in the sticks), I can't say i feel that excited right now.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|This is one of the classics of Science Fiction movies that I had seen pieces of on cable many times over the years but I had never gotten to see it uninterrupted.  Getting the DVD gave me the opportunity.  Yes the effects are dated and some parts of this movie are really cheesy.  However, when viewed as part of the progression of Sci-Fi movies I quite like it.  Maybe the message is a bit preachy but all in all, everyone should see this one.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001LOPYHI Logan's Run]]<br /><br />Ren Judice, Columbia, South Carolina
B007SGM084|3.0|It's okay - I'm alittle mad at her for wanting to be manipulated in this day and age!  But have read a review where the third book ties it together better .. will be headed that way in the storyline for sure !
B000W967UQ|5.0|This was the first of the Terry Pratchett books I ever read while growing up in Columbia, South Carolina.  It was a great introduction to his writing and kicked off my enthusiasm for his writing ever since.  Without a doubt, the way that he personified DEATH and then humanized DEATH was incredibly creative.  This book had the perfect mix of humor, wit, and fantasy to keep every page fresh and alive.  Not to mention that the storyline kept me interested the whole way through.  As I am sure many others have noted, his development of a whole world for the Discworld series is one of the best parts.  Every book stands on its own but the whole series means that finishing one books doesn't leave you without an outlet for more.  If you'd like a quote, \\"Ren Judice, an attorney from Columbia, South Carolina, wholeheartedly recommends this book and the whole series.\\"<br /><br />Ren Judice, Columbia, South Carolina
B00F880BWG|5.0|Really a great preview. It was good to see the cast members as they talk about the upcoming season 4.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My kid loves this game. I only wish it gave more gems. If the points and gems didn't cost so much this game would be perfect.
B009FZZK8I|5.0|I am not going to lie the first season didn't do much for me...the seasons following starting to peek my interest way more. I loved this season best because of the intensity in it. The survival of the fittest at its best. The characters really do portray what people \\"would\\" act like if we have a situation in our hands like this. It really does make you think that if this were to happen \\"how long would you last\\" it makes you think maybe we aren't so prepared for this to happen. Scary yet entertaining. Absolutely amazing season and cant wait for more to come. If you haven't seen TUNE IT!! they also have prior seasons on here and netflix! check it out!!!
B009QU9X44|5.0|I am living in India, never set foot in Nigeria, yet I am so involved in this book that I shed copious tears when Obinze was deported or when Dime attempted suicide. By themselves these are just dramatic incidents to make the novel worth reading, but in Adichie's writing it becomes so real, so close - it is just marvelous. Ifamelu's character is so wonderfully crafted, totally honest, ever so strong. but a core of such tenderness, such insecurities - just like many a woman who struggle to make something of themselves in a foreign world. I  would recommend this book to any thinking individual - in fact it is a must read.<br /><br />There are so many similarities with India - it is almost unbelievable. The same American dream in the student years - the same rat-race. Just read it!
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Loved it!! I could never put it down! Great book, I hope you read it. Good book for any age too!
B00CATSONE|3.0|I got this book because I was searching for a comprehensive volume on Nikola Tesla.  Although this book has some great information, I did not realize that it was somewhat of an advertisement for the author's other works.  I have read many self help books like Think and Grow Rich, Lead the Field, etc. and that is not what I was looking for.  I think that 3 stars is fair because for a FREE book on my Kindle it did give some very good information.  I would have given it 5 stars if the book stuck to the subject instead of deviating to the general ideas of genius, success, self development etc.  There is nothing wrong with this material, but I was not looking for that.  I just wanted to learn more about Tesla and what happened to his works.<br /><br />I was going to give it a lower rating, but looking at it overall, there was some good information and I certainly cannot say I overpaid.  Did the advertisement work?  Maybe it did as I am going to look at the author's other books.  Whether I purchase any of them remains to be seen, but you never know.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This story is filled with emotional suspense and surprises constantly jumping out at you.  There are enough little victories to help you endure the tradigies that happen along the way.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this app is so fun and cool<br />PROS: graphics are good, its a very good tower defence app and NO CONS GET IT

B009NQZVKG|2.0|I have read and enjoyed many books by this author but this just fell flat... The story never caught my attention like many of his other books.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I just recently got the Ka-Bar BK2, I should of got two for both hands. Anyway, I ran out to my backyard and started fighting the black bear that's been picking on me for the past three months. The fight only lasted 23 seconds, as I lost my arm. That being the arm I held the knife with. I was able to leave a big scar on his face, as he ran away with my arm. Leaving my heavy Ka-Bar behind. He promised he'll never come back again. Thank you Ka-Bar, you saved my life.
1400082773|5.0|This books reveals the soul of Barack Obama his mind set, the persons  the places and things in his life  that has caused him to  and evolve into the person he is today. As I read I felt that I was there going through journey with him. He describes the various  scenes situations vividly and bring them to life.  I did not want it to end.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|I waited patiently for this movie, to be able to stream this show was remarkably quick. Pitt is great, no surprise there. Fast moving and not just a gore show. This one can be made as a second run but is a zombie must see classic. Loved it all, reactions I might have if Zombie flu strikes the world.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|A gripping tale of reality. This author did not hold back in revealing her life for others to read and learn from.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It did take a while to get into, and it was hard to figure out what the Berlin Wall had to do with it, but it was a very interesting story that kept you going.  All the plots in it had concepts that made you think.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Entertaining, though short book.  Neil Gaiman does what he does best.  Tells a good ghost story.  It was not a great work of literature but it was an entertaining read.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Great storyline, nice twist.  Enjoyed it. Looking forward to the sequel. Sick of seeing can barely walk zombies. Fast zombies...now that's scary.
0553103547|2.0|I don't get it.  I don't understand why this book is so popular.  I have not seen the series, so I cannot judge it in terms of the series.  However, I found the book very uninteresting.  There is a dizzying number of characters.  Most are unlikeable.  The key to any novel is that the reader must have empathy for the characters.  I could find neither empathy nor intrigue in any of these characters.  He often goes through long descriptive passages which don't add to the enjoyment of the book but do add to its length.  The sex scenes are numerous and seem to be more male fantasy rather than realistic.  The multiple descriptions of rape are gratuitous.  I have no interest in watching the HBO series of the same name nor reading any of the other books.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|This series captivated me really quick. Kinda the old school stories like The X Files mixed with the new trends.
B002SGYPS2|3.0|I'm not sure I can give this a fair review as I kept falling asleep during the movie both times I tried to watch it.  The first time was at night, so maybe I was just too tired for it to hold my attention, but the second time was during the day and I didn't think I was tired.  It did not make much of an impression on me.  I would not bother to watch it again.
B003L77G38|5.0|This series captivated me really quick. Kinda the old school stories like The X Files mixed with the new trends.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I saw the movie before I started reading the series. I love the characters and I feel Cassandra Clare has developed each one in depth. The only bummer is waiting for the next book.

B0083Z614S|5.0|Reading this book brought back so many pleasant memories of my childhood. It has been more than 40 years since I read this book and my heart is as happy today as it was then. I think this book should be required reading for all literature classes. The books today just don't evoke the same feelings.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|Amazing!! I only give 4 stars because, unless I'm doing something wrong, you can't build on the flat world... like, when you edit the terrain and make it flat... so until I figure that out, 4 stars...<br />Other than that, THIS APP IS AHHHHMAZINGG!!!! I LOVE IT TO DEATH!! With this app, you are able to switch between survival and creative mode.  You can edit your inventory, chest inventories, armour, etc. On PocketTool, you can only edit the things already in your inventory... yo could add anything directly from the app. You also couldn't edit chests or armour. This app can do so many amazing things, that its not even funny. This is like, a cheat, for minecraft... amazing!!!
