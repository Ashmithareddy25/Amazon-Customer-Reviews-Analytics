B00003CX9E|4.0|It is a spooky night. Atmospheric dramatic music accompanies the camera to a heavily fenced perimeter. The heavy cast iron entry gate shows an ominous logo, a circle with a big K inside it, right next to it a sign saying \\"No Trespassing\\" and right then we know we will enter a domain, which is forbidden to anyone but the viewer. In the far distance in the darkness we notice a single lonely light coming from a gigantic mansion, but we still have quite a way to go and so we continue our ghostly journey across this mysterious and haunting estate while we keep an eye on the light, passing a lifeless pond, sculptures, a zoo and all in a more or less state of decay. Suddenly the light coming from the house is extinguished. The music holds its breath, what's going on here? We sense it's more than merely a person going off to bed; the music and preceding images have prepared us for something different.  There's a slow transition and suddenly we are in a room where it's ... snowing? in soft white idyllic looking scenery, midst of which we notice a rather ramshackle house. The camera pulls back and we now realize we were looking inside one of these glass toys, held by a hand that, while its owner expels his last breath, must release its grip and it falls to the ground where it shatters, after which the camera zooms in to the lips of the dying man which can still utter one last word \\"Rosebud\\" before closing forever.    This is the magic beginning of a brilliant movie called \\"Citizen Kane\\" , probably the most famous directorial debut in cinematic history from Orson Welles, who the world mostly knew before that as the voice behind the notorious \\"War of the Worlds\\" radio show that panicked half the country as it was taken for a news broadcast, who subsequently became famous with his \\"Mercury Theatre Company\\" both of which resulted in him getting an up to then unprecedented carte blanche for his debut feature which included sole final cut control.  The owner of aforementioned lipsis called Charles Foster Kane, media mogul with even presidential ambitions once upon a time that were thwarted during a senator election because of a cover-up. The movie's premise is simple: a journalist's attempt to track down the meaning of the mysterious last word coming from Kane's mouth \\"Rosebud\\".    We tag along his research which involves a series of interviews of key people in Kane's life that offer us through the flashbacks they trigger a gradual insight into his life: His childhood in poor circumstances, an inheritance on condition of leaving behind said childhood in general and his mother in particular and eventual retreat literally and metaphorically behind walls to shield himself from the outside world by whom he feels unloved and misunderstood. Most of all Kane is a tragically lonely man with emptiness in his heart, created there by the forced severing of the connection with his mother as a child, which he keeps on trying to desperately fill by either earning or trying to buy people's love.    As he is unable to really invest something of himself in any relationship, all his human contacts remain hollow and long term are doomed to fail, which no huge and megalomaniac \\"Xanadu\\" can remedy, the estate he bought and \\"pimped\\" one would say nowadays I suppose, with art and animals from all over the world, to rule his own little empire that the world wouldn't permit him outside its bounds.     Orson Welles with this movie created a first rate masterpiece, helped by the fantastic script by mainly Joseph Manckiewicz (with input by John Houseman and Welles himself), a great director himself, and cinematographer Gregg Toland who came up with all kinds of technical novelties like the famous \\"deep focus\\" shots. Quite experimental as well was the use of sound and light, but those are just interesting little facts. Sure, they contribute to the movie's impact, but it is the story and the cast's performances that give it life.    Our tenacious reporter will never findthe answer to the question of the meaning of the word \\"Rosebud\\", but the director mercifully informs the audience. That being said a lot of guesswork remains for the viewer and to some extend it will remain a mystery as to who this Charles Foster Kane really was.    I will not go into the parallels between the fictional character of Kane and newspaper owner William Randolph Hearst, the included documentary \\"The Battle over Citizen Kane\\" will serve to give all the information one could wish for on that matter and it's quite fascinating, but in the end to me inconsequential to the appreciation of this movie.    All this nonsense about \\"Best Movie of All Time\\" I leave to other people to debate; I do not even consider it to be Welles' best, but to conclude that the movie has earned its rightful place within cinematic history as among its finest is widely undisputed.
B00005JPO1|3.0|Having a baby takes one out of the movie swing of things, so it took a long time before I was able to finally able to see Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. With over 400 reviews at the time of this writing, I'll skip my traditional format of summarizing the movie and just move on to what could have worked and what went horribly, horribly awry.<br /><br />It made perfect sense to place Indy in the 1950s. I appreciated the nods to the 1950s alien invasion genre, which includes everything from Roswell to psychic powers to a rampant fear of Communism.  And the film expertly sets up the 50s, managing to cram in greasers on motorcycles, ice cream shops, Russians, and nuclear bomb tests in the first fifteen minutes.<br /><br />This movie is loaded with fan-service.  There are nods to the other three films, from a fight in the mysterious warehouse at the end of the first movie to Indy starting to speak just like his father (\\"This is intolerable!\\") to his fear of snakes. The quicksand scene had me laughing so hard that I was in tears.  But somewhere along the line, Spielberg and Lucas lost sight of the purpose of the film.  It transformed from making a thrilling adventure to a \\"one last act for Ford, Spielberg, and Lucas.\\"<br /><br />I blame the majority of Crystal Skull's foibles on good old Professor \\"Ox\\" Oxley (John Hurt). He is a raving madman who has already made it through all the traps leading up to the crystal skull's resting place, so it's not particularly exciting to have Indy decipher his mad ramblings or retrace his steps. This is an Indy adventure in reverse - Indy HAS the object and he's trying to put it BACK. Which isn't all that exciting.<br /><br />The villains just aren't all that villainous.  Col. Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) is a caricature of a Russian that's not all that scary.  Her claim to fame appears to be that she carries a sword (how quaint!). The master plan seems to be vaguely along the lines of \\"we're going to capture this artifact we don't understand and use it to conquer the world!\\" It's not even clear the Russians would know what to do with the skull, much less put it to nefarious use. The Australian turncoat is both obviously a turncoat and barely comprehensible. And don't get me started on the bug-squishing scenes that involving ant-ichor splashing on the camera...not once, but TWICE.<br /><br />Mutt (Shia LeBouf) is a cardboard personality - it took me a second to realize that he never actually cries on cue (the camera whips over to him already misty with tears...twice), filled with angst over Ox, the guy we've never heard of. Mutt appears, with a wink and a nod, to be Indy's successor, but it's a heavy-handed portrayal: Mutt doesn't read but he's worldly! Mutt knows fencing but practices with a knife (that he never uses)! Mutt can ride a motorcycle and calls Indy \\"old man\\"! See Mutt swing from a vine and...<br /><br />I saw this one coming when Mutt got separated from the rest of the group during a fight chase. I prayed: \\"Dear Lucas, please, please, PLEASE do not have Mutt swing from vines.\\" Then the animated monkeys show up, in much the same way animated gophers showed up in the beginning of the film and threatened to turn Crystal Skull into a nuclear [[ASIN:B000P0J07O Caddyshack]]. I prayed again.  \\"Please, please, please, don't have the monkeys swing along with Mutt and help him attack the Russians.  Please, please, please...\\" Then the monkeys attack. Ever see the Simpsons episode, \\"[[ASIN:B000FO0AME In Marge We Trust]],\\" where Reverend Lovejoy fights off the baboons?  It's like that.<br /><br />In the \\"making of\\" docs, Spielberg dismisses using the Nazis as villains out of hand.  And yet he went with an off-the-wall sci-fi theme that Lucas struggles to make Indy-esque.  They could have easily included [[ASIN:1892062097 Nazis, UFOs, aliens, and arctic bases]] in one neat, conspiracy-laden package.  Instead, two movie-making giants took a weak premise and turned it into anopportunity for nostalgia. It's like [[ASIN:B0007P0XBO Ocean's Twelve]]and [[ASIN:B000W1V5VU 13]]...you get the impression the cast is more interested in working than in making the movie work.<br /><br />Crystal Skull isn't the worst movie ever.  But as a final chapter in the Indiana Jones canon, it's more [[ASIN:B0014Z4ON4 Temple of Doom]] than [[ASIN:B0014C2FX8 Last Crusade]].BO Ocean's Twelve]]and [[ASIN:B000W1V5VU 13]]...you get the impression the cast is more interested in working than in making the movie work.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout dvd.  I use it every other day and have seen a difference in my muscle tone and weight.  I also do cardio on my other days.
B00004YA0T|5.0|Both of Jochum's \\"complete Bruckner symphonies\\" have long satisfied collectors of every stripe. They're performed by one of Bruckner's greatest interpreters and in the EMI set he is at the helm of a unique sounding group of players, the Dresden Staatskapelle Orchestra.  It stands up well under \\"desert island\\" scrutiny.  The difference between the DGG and EMI versions has more to do with the orchestras themselves than the interpretations.  The EMI is recorded between '79 and '82.  DGG derives from the late `50s through the late `60s with the Berlin Philharmonic and Jochum's old friend, the Bayerischen Rundfunks.  I find the Dresden players give every ounce of energy they have to reach Jochum's great climaxes.  The performances occasionally have an edge to them that the earlier ones don't contain. Jochum makes huge demands on Dresden in their large church acoustic.  On the other hand both the Bayerischen and Berlin orchestras on DGG seem always to have something in reserve.  Of course there's nothing wrong with either approach. At the moment, I like the Dresden the best.<br /><br />Yet most ardent Bruckner fans will not be satisfied with a single conductor for each of these symphonies.  In any given box set there is sure to be one with its \\"betters\\" sitting on a shelf somewhere.<br /><br />In accordance with the last statement, I'm posting two lists of opinions regarding individual recordings by various conductors, including Jochum, that you might wish to consider as adjuncts to any box set you might buy.  You might want to think of looking in some \\"used\\" sections.<br /><br />The first group is from a friend whose knowledge of Bruckner's place in the symphonic firmament is all encompassing.  The second is my limited opinion because it only covers the 4th to the 9th.  That's because I agree with my friend's choices on the first three symphonies.  It should be noted that both of us have based our choices on years of collecting and listening to all of Bruckner's grand epics.<br /><br />Let's start with my friend's first:<br /><br />\\"1) I still think Jochum's DGG version is the best of the Linz Version - Gunter Wand or Chailly for the Vienna version (even if Wand never liked to perform it)<br />2) I like Carragan's 1873 EDITION best -  The best performance is Blomstedt's with Toronto - next would be Chaiilly in Leipzig (both are broadcasts).<br />3) EDITIONS in order of preference: 1, 2, and 3 - the more Bruckner meddled, the worse it got.  1st version - Hans Zender is the best (broadcast) Blomstedt does this very well.  Tintner turns it into a massive edifice; 2nd version - Kubelik and Haitink; 3rd version - Szell is clean and precise - Celibidache makes it mystical<br />4) 1st version - Michael Gielen makes this version work - hard to do;  For the 2nd version, Wand/BPO, Boehm,  too many to choose...<br />5) Horenstein on BBC Classics is a classic, So is Furtw&auml;ngler.  Roegner does interesting things as does Gielen, Wand BPO, Matacic<br />6) Wand, Kubelik, Klemperer, Keilberth - a new version by Ira Levin to come out soon uses the Hynais edition - very interesting<br />7) Too many - so many are very good.<br />8) 1st version - Inbal or Gielen, 2nd version - Too many - Giulini's DGG should be heard, Wand BPO, Horenstein, Goodale, Karajan VPO, Tennstedt<br />9) Wand again, Naito (just for the Carragan Finale), Furtwangler, Knappertsbusch, Jochum,<br />10) B0 -  Haitink, Rozhdestvensky, Skrowaczewski, Asahina<br />11)  F Minor - Skrowaczewski, Rozhdestvensky\\"<br /><br />Here are mine.  (I confess I barely know 10 and 11.)<br /><br />4. As my friend so aptly puts it \\"too many to choose from.\\"  Jochum is always great though here are two others - sonically - Karajan, EMI '71; Solti, Chicago, '81, BBC broadcast, Proms - Royal Albert Hall -rare and n/a commercially;<br />5. Jochum Concertgebouw, '64 live, Philips; Jochum, 82, Dresden; Rozhdestvensky, Orchestra of the Ministry of Culture, 84, Revelation; Karajan, VPO, Salzburg,'69 live;Furtwangler '51 EMI; for fun try Thielemann, Munich PO, DGG - be aware that the final moments of the last movement will push most sound systems very hard as the climax of the final chorale never stops building through the last measure.<br />6. Jochum (any);  Leitner(!), '82, SWRO, Haenssler;<br />7. Jochum, BPO, '52, Tahra; Jochum, DVD or CD, Concergebouw in Japan, '86 Bells of St. Florian (his last); Giulini, Philharmonia, 82, live BBC; Matacic, CPO, Supraphon; Blomstedt, Dresden, '84, Denon; Barbirolli, Halle, '70, BBC; only for die hards: Toscanini, '35 NYPO, Pristine (some small parts missing in mvts 2 and 4);<br />8. My favorite of all Bruckner 8ths: GIULINI, PHILHARMONIA, '83, live, BBC; then, Giulini, VPO, DGG; Karajan, VPO, DGG; Barbirolli, Halle, '70, BBC; Kubelik, Bayrischen Rundfunks, Orfeo; 1st version, Inbal, Frankfurt, Teldec - hard to find; this is just a smattering of so many great versions available.<br />9. ABOVE ALL: GIULINI, VPO, '88 live, DGG - note: NOT CHICAGO/EMI!*; Barbirolli, Halle, '69 live, BBC; too many more to name.<br /><br />My list certainly doesn't negate Wand or Celibidache or a dozen other great conductors such as Klemperer or Kabasta or B&ouml;hm.  But after repeated listening, I think the ones mentioned are the ones I turn to more often than not.<br /><br />No matter what anyone says, the EMI/Jochum/Dresden set may serve your purposes in every sense.  For the price alone it should be bought before it goes away forever.  It's also interesting to see how often Jochum is chosen by both of us.  The EMI/Dresden sound goes well beyond expectations, especially when compared to the American LPs from the last century.  (I've always wanted to say that).<br /><br />*A special note about the DGG Giulini 9th.  For me and many other listeners I've had the pleasure to share it with, the performance stands as Giulini's greatest recorded triumph with Bruckner.  The first mvt at over 28 minutes is only faster than Celibidache's.  But in that 28minutes something quite extraordinary happens.  The Italian maestro, who felt in his early years that he shouldn't be paid to make music, transcends the written page at every turn.  I can say, at least for myself, if I could keep only one CD, this would be it.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|A confession: back in late 2006 before the opening of \\"Casino Royale\\", I was one of the clamoring pack of doubters.  Could blond indie thug Daniel Craig REALLY step into the rarified shoes of Connery, Moore, Brosnan, et al to portray one of the most beloved and long-running icons of cinema?  Though I respected Mr. Craig's acting ability in gritty British drama, at first blush his fit for the role of Bond was not apparent.  I attended a screening with very low expectations, prepared to hate a movie that had booted my beloved Pierce Brosnan out of the franchise.  Well.  To say that Mr. Craig blew me away would be an understatement.  He totally owns the part now and we have to stretch all the way back to Sean Connery to find a Bond with such confident physicality married to a dangerous edge.  Mr. Craig is not \\"handsome\\" in the classic sense.  But he's compelling, virile and relentlessly watchable--a potent combination that's way better than mere \\"handsome\\".  Though I submit that those blue eyes are one of the wonders of the cinematic world, and when Mr. Craig smiles (not often enough as Bond, alas), it's like the sun breaking out over the Aegean, and he is handsome, indeed.  His physicality is unsurpassed, even by Connery; his rising up out of the surf is an iconic moment in the Bond canon--Ursula Andress as beefcake.  The reviewer who labelled Mr. Craig 'effete' must have had a long doze, because the man drips masculinity from every pore.  The stunts, locations and set pieces are all spectacular, but the overriding reason to purchase this on DVD is to appreciate, with repeat viewings, the nuances of Craig's performance.  I have found reason to be fond of all the previous Bonds, but Craig is hands-down the most skilled actor to ever take the role.  Bond is by definition, 'larger than life', but in Craig's hands, we are not watching a caricature of a superman in a tuxedo, but a real man in a dangerous occupation who sweats and bleeds and suffers, who makes mistakes andlearns from them.  He moves Bond beyond the one-note sexism and gadgetry and actually creates a fully-fleshed person who seems almost real.  Mr. Craig has definitively silenced his critics, and has become a Bond for the ages.   Whether his sophomore effort can maintain the high bar he set here remains to be seen, but \\"Casino Royale\\" has captured his Bond at the height of his considerable powers, and is a must-own.

B0000057C5|5.0|This is the THIRD CD of Sensucht that I have purcahsed.  I wore the first one out by listening to it WAY too much  ;)  The second CD got lost in the shuffle in a cross-country move.  This CD was the first CD I had ever heard of Rammstein's, and I have been a dedicated fan ever since!
B000LAZDQA|3.0|I'd never heard of this movie until a straight buddy of mine asked me to review his DVD and share my thoughts on whether if it's \\"borderline gay\\". Uh, yeah. OK, so the credits were the first indication that this was not going to be your garden variety flick. The Q TV moniker for those of us \\"in-the-know\\" told me right off the bat that the demographic was aimed at a gay audience. And then wham! An opening scene that made me drop my Yoplait all over the carpet...the dude's auto-fellatio complete with orgasm. My first reaction was WTF?! So I brushed it off, watched the flick, more sex...singing the national anthem during a three-way...blah, blah. These characters are all messed up in the head. I think the reasons why I didn't have nearly as much angst as it concluded was merely due to the diversion of its gratuitous sex. Great production values, but these people have some serious issues. Stupid ending with that lovefest parade and warm and fuzzy song by some washed up tranny!
0805047905|5.0|I remember reading this charming story to my own kids and also to my preschool class. Now it's been reissued in  board book format, artistically illustrated, and every bit as enjoyable. This is a perfect book for teaching color and animal names, in a catchy rhyming format. Each page foretells what the animal and color will be on the next. Recommended for reading to babies and for beginning readers to tackle on their own.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|To call this a \\"gay cowboy\\" movie is to sell it short.  The heart of this film is \\"the path not taken\\".<br /><br />It is compelling to watch someone look happiness in the eye and walk away from it.  This can happen in heterosexual relationships as well.  Sometimes people feel that they cannot be together.  Perhaps families do not approve, cultural boundaries make it difficult, religious obstacles are too much to overcome, etc.  It could happen to anyone, gay or not.<br /><br />If this type of story grabs you, you should also watch The Lover with Tony Leung and Jane March.  As the wealthy Chinaman wrote to his one-time school-girl, he \\"would love her until death\\".<br /><br />How ironic that this alleged \\"gay cowboy movie\\" resulted in the real life love story between Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams.  Jake Gyllenhall became the godfather to their daughter.  We will see Heath's face in Matilda for the duration.<br /><br />Among other things, I will remember Ledger for his response to all those that called him \\"brave\\" for taking on this role.  He answered something along the lines of \\"no, it's people such as firefighters that are brave\\".  What a humble reply from a remarkably gifted actor.  We miss you, Heath.<br /><br />I believe the Actor's Academy fell short this time around.  It seemed that Brokeback deserved the Oscar for Best Movie, as Ledger probably merited the Best Actor award.  When the chips were down it appeared that this subject matter was just too much for Hollywood to embrace, at least for the time being.

I thought what the heck another surival book but at least i get a deal on the firestarter.  After i opened this book i quickly forgot all about the firestarter.  I was amazed at the greatness of this book.  I can't say enough here about it you have to see it to believe it.  I own about a dozen survival book and this is the best of the best.  Actuall colored photos on edible and not edible plant, color photos on posinious snakes as well.  The section on traps and shelters is top notch.  Knot tying is also a great section.  This book has rekindled my desire to grab my knife and go test myself in the wilds.  simply superb
B000G6BM00|5.0|Seriously, if you like either sci-fi or action movies, I can't really give you a reason not to like this movie. i think people who rate this movie below a 3 are really either not fans of either genre of film mentioned above or really really stupid. Great action scenes, great special effects(for the time) and great pacing. Listen, they already did the suspense portion of the story. You already seen the alien so it makes sense to put you face to face with it. What better way of doing that then space marines. What, are they going to send scientist or another mining crew? Then you have the same movie over again. So, we finally get a bigger picture of who the \\"company\\" really is, and what they will do to secure said alien. What that means to us action fans is a lot, and I mean LOT, of firepower. The action scenes are a delightful mixture of frenetic helmet camera shots and pretty good solid camera work. The camera does not bounce from shot to shot as much as 90 percent of action movies from that era. Oh for the sci-fi fans, we have wonderfully detailed aliens here. The designs are top notch and the way we see how they live and hunt as a pack would scare you out of your skin if you were one of those marines. I loved how this movie played out. To me, it was fast enough that I never got bored, yet seemed to take it's time to let fans of the original get involved in new plot lines and newcomers get a understanding of the alien mythos. I don't know what else to say except, I love this movie.

I am blessed to have his music and i am so thankful that he is not one of those musicians that speak half-truth when they are composing christian lyrics.  Here is a tip: Take the time and listen to the whole album with the lyrics in front of you. It will be a great journey!!

0060899220|5.0|It has been over 20 years since I worked in the restaurant business, but reading Bourdain's book brought back a lot of memories of what the business and the many characters who inhabit it are like.  I found Bourdain's book to be very entertaining and reflects much of what I remember about the world of food preparation and service. Bourdain's management style is quite different from my own and I am not sure that I would want to work for the guy, (or have him work for me), but he is a great writer and accurately depicts the life in the biz.

The best part of the book was how the oral histories weren't just of people in the North America, instead the cast of characters were from all over the globe. And, it was obvious that the author took special care to cross different socioeconomic boundaries with the various survivor stories.<br /><br />I have not read his survival guide completely.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|METALLICA DEATH MAGENETIC REVIEW<br /><br />I had a good feeling about DEATH MAGNETIC while hearing about the preparation for it , in the last few years,  just the fact that metallica was teaming up with Rick Rubin for production, put a stamp of approval for advent music listeners, judging from his track record over the years.  The band  returns to its old  school roots in some ways , while still meshing the great production of the black album with the strong melodic points of load and reload, this is the album metallica listners have been waitin for. The songs on DEATH MAGNETIC are more of epic style, longer with great lead work  from james and Kurt , its great to hear those two back together pushing the limts of metal, with screeching leads and massive rythem collaborations, lar's also displays classic drumming showcasing his growth over the years as a drummer, metallica always set the bar for thrash albums.. The first track \\"THAT WAS JUST YOUR LIFE\\" really sets the tone for the record with its  unforgettable  old -school riffing and clean, precise tone ,  taking  the listener back .  To the power driven \\"BROKEN BEAT & SCARRED  showcases  the band's tight  unified song structure.  The track \\"All Nightmare Long\\"  feels like it could have been on the and justice  , the lyrics remind me of the lyrical chorus and patterns of that album. Overall the DEATH MAGNETIC  is a body of work that fans can listen to from beginning to end , I haven't gotten that from this band since the black album ,  the songs really keep your attention and do not present any lack luster moments. Rick Rubin had the band specifically tap into the feeling of when they where creating those older albums, but still it sounds fresh and new. The instrumental track is a personal favorite of mine  \\"SUICIDE AND REDEMPTION \\"  reminding us all that metallica  can still dish out raw musical track without vocals.  As far as vocals are concerned on the CD Mr hetfield delivers a powerful performance  with deep intricate lyrics.  The \\"Judas Kiss\\" and \\"Cyanide\\" are also note worthy tracks on the CD . On a down side I still feel the sound pushes the limit when IT comes to volume,also lacking bass presence at times,,  Metallica will always have a problem with that because of the overpowering guitars and  drums,  taken nothing away from Mr. Trujillo , job well done , maybe its  the mixing. Anyone who considers themselves an old school metal fan should love this effort by Metallica, I have to admit its my first purchase from this band's catalog of releases in over ten years,  because of growing interest in other realms of  metal and other genre's of music, and to be quite honest I was not feeling what I heard from load or reload or st anger, from the some kind of monster grim representation thinking they need serious therapy , to bouncing back on the scene.. I have to give them major credit for this comeback,  Bottom line metallica can put out whatever they want to after all these years,  it's whatever they feel creatively that works.  I  give the album 4 stars  a definite must  have in your collection hopefully you will buy it instead of downloading it's a cool cd package worth purchasing.<br /><br />Michael Conawayicate lyrics.

0375826726|4.0|I really liked this book and it is definately a worthy sequel to the series. I wont go into what goes on in the book, except to say that Paolini continues to write very entertainingly, its hard to put down this book and there are a lot of very interesting things that the alagaesia realm opens up about itself as in the previous books that really stretch the limits of what Tolkien or Dragonlance series and whatnot have kind of put down as what rules a fantastic realm with elves, dwarves, etc should have.     However, some of the charm and elegance of the first book for me has declined in the third book. In my opinion, Paolini so beautifully writes about Palancar valley (the land of people) that the forest of elves and mountains of dwarves REALLY pale in comparison. Where in the descriptions of human dwellings the writing brings up images as if you are in it, like watching a movie, the depiction of elves and dwarves by comparison are pale imaginations.     Also in my opinion the romantic tention between Eragon and the female leads is slightly failing, also by comparison to the first book.    Anyways, it is a very good book with a lot of its own new ideas and beauty to offer, but not as genius as the first book was :)
B001GM28HO|5.0|I don't like pop music. It sounds generic, overdone, overproduced and just plain bad. This album, however, I can't stop listening to! I was debating whether I should tell my friends it is a guilty pleasure of mine, but I decided to confirm, that yes, Lady GaGa is my new favorite \\"band\\". I love this CD!! It puts me in a great mood, and I this is the reason pop music will be saved!!

B00003CXPD|4.0|Young Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) defies macho convention as well as his close-minded father (Gary Lewis) and older brother (Jamie Draven) to pursue his love of dancing in a small English mining town during a strike.    This delightful film just made me happy with its cheerful T-Rex-heavy soundtrack, exuberant performances, and quirky characters.  It's pretty clear how everything is going to turn out at the end, and some of the changes of heart undergone by certain character may not be entirely convincing, but this remains a sunny, upbeat film.  Despite the language, which earns it an R rating, it also presents a positive message for young people about being willing to think outside boundaries and resist stereotypes.
0399247459|5.0|This book is a must-have for any children's library and was a favorite for both of my boys.  When my oldest son was four, he memorized the entire book, and so we built a puppet theater and puppets for his precious performances.  I recently purchased the book again for a new one year old niece, and the now teenage boys love sharing the enchantment with our family's new little one.  This sturdy board book version ensures that our little one will have pages in tact a few years from now when she's ready to memorize.
0439023483|4.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat with my mouth open wide for more than half of it.  Collins' characters are so perfectly unique from one another, and her descriptive writing of the subject matter is absolutely fantastic!  I enjoyed reading this book so much.  It's a no holds-barre book, that is very raw, and just keeps you pining for more!  I can't wait for the sequal!
0061150142|4.0|I felt it was a little slow to start, but, by the last 2/3rds of the book, I couldn't put it down. I stayed up till 3 am just to finish.

0374531269|2.0|Ishmael Beah's story about a boy who fled his village, was on the run for several months, and then ended up as a boy soldier for more than two years before being rescued by UNICEF workers is too incredible to be real... which is exactly why I didn't buy it at all when I read it.<br /><br />I realize there are child soldiers out there in war torn developing countries. It's tragic, and it's also a good thing that someone shed light on the situation. However, A Long Way Gone reads less like a memoir, and more like a Hollywood movie. Everything in the book happens as though it were written on a script. He barely missed reuniting with his entire family because he got to their new village just moments after rebels attacked. He just happened to overhear their conversation about \\"it was a good attack because no one survived. We got them all!\\" As someone else mentioned, the cassettes in his pockets just happened to fall out of his pocket, miraculously, in the nick of time to save his life... TWICE. He was nearly stabbed by a rebel boy, but his friend stabbed the boy in the back... just in the nick of time, again.<br /><br />The book is also bursting with inaccuracies and contradictions. Ishmael claims his was forced to flee his village in 1993. Because of my initial distrust of the details in his memoir, I decided to google the book. I had no idea so many people had done extensive investigations into the claims he makes in his story. Apparently, Ishmeal is the only person from his village that seems to think the attacks in his village happened in 1993. Everyone else there knows they started in 1995. They've even backed this up with school documents showing that he was in school, when Ishmael claims he was on his own running for his life. This means that if he was in the army, at most it could have only been for a few months (which is still more than any 15 year old boy should have to deal with). Also, despite the fact that several UNICEF workers at that time in Sierra Leon were interviewed and had said that an uprising at one of their camps, which resulted in six killed, would have been a major ordeal in the country, not a single one of them can recall that ever happening.<br /><br />The contradictions I mentioned could simply be the result of bad editing. This is one of the worst edited books I've ever read. As Ishmael is not a native English speaker, the blame for that should be his editor's. For example, in one chapter he talks about a town where him and his friends (the second group he encounters before he's taken into the army) were captured and taken before a village chief who would decide whether they lived or died. In the very next village, the same thing happened (this is where his cassettes saves him for the second time). He then remarked on how this had happened to him a lot. He wondered whether or not it was the first time for his other friends. Except, he JUST SAID IT DID! Ugh!<br /><br />In addition to all this fun stuff, there are all kinds of typos. Like I said, this book is so poorly edited, the editors should rethink their career path. Things such as \\"reasons\\" being printed where it's obvious the word meant was \\"seasons\\". It was something obvious like \\"the change of reasons\\". Then there's also redundancies all over the place. Stuff similar to \\"I'm going to America to speak at a conference in New York in America. It's a conference for child humanitarian issues in America.\\" You would think the editor would weed these things out to improve the flow.<br /><br />Despite all this, non-fiction or fiction, I still think it's an interesting story and an important one to tell. If the editing was better, it would have been so painful to read, but it did hold my interest mostly. I wish it was billed as \\"based on true events\\" or something like that. Instead the author claims it is 100% factual... which it is not.and had said that an uprising at one of their camps, which resulted in six killed, would have been a major ordeal in the country, not a single one of them can recall that ever happening.

B0016Q2D5M|3.0|This is a pretty good summer adventure movie. I enjoyed it a lot in the theater, where I saw it in 3D. I was really looking forward to finally seeing a good 3D movie on DVD. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />The good news: when you watch the movie without the glasses, you just see a normal movie. It doesn't have the weird double image of 3D movies of the past.<br /><br />The bad news: the 3D effect with the glasses is terrible. I was expecting that the DVD would come with the same kind of glasses we got at the movie. Nope, we got the same old cardboard glasses with the red and green cellophane lenses.<br /><br />The result is that when you watch the movie with the glasses, the colors are really distorted. Everyone looks like they've got a really bad sunburn, light colors are washed out with green. It's just awful. And the 3D effect isn't nearly as good as it was in the theater.<br /><br />It turns out that my wife saved our glasses from the theater, so we tried them. No luck... no 3D effect.<br /><br />I would have been willing to pay more for a DVD with the \\"real\\" glasses and the same 3D effects we saw in the movie. As it is, the glasses that came with this DVD are a complete waste. You would be better off watching the movie with your eyes closed.

031606792X|5.0|I've just recently fallen in love with the series, so I'm a little behind on all the reviews. I was aware that there were mixed reviews for the final book, and now that I'm reading some of the negative ones, I'm more than a little upset by them. Please note there are spoilers ahead.     I personally feel that any negative opinions are based on the simple fact that they didn't get the point of the story. Bella's evolvement into a vampire by the last book is symbolic in so many ways. In Twilight she's a teen who feels inadequate and beyond ordinary. She's constantly taking care of her parents and feels responsible for everyone around her. I think she's drawn to Edward so strongly because for the first time in her life, someone is taking care of HER. Her insecurities are enhanced because of Edward and his family. As the saga moves forward and she develops a relationship with Jake, it becomes clear to her that choices need to be made. Even if she doesn't like to make them. This is something we all must face in life (even if they're not on Bella's level)    People who scoff at Bella deciding to marry Edward at 18 and then continues to have his baby are moving past the fact that this is a fantasy series. You can't go through the first 3 books accepting the werewolf/vampire/human love triangle, the various plot points of Bella being in danger from other vampires, and the various abilities some of the vampires have, and then all of a sudden feel it's unrealistic to have Bella marry at 18. That's actually laughable on your parts. I thought marrying him was the most logical thing to happen. It was a condition given by Edward before he'd allow her to be immortal, and if I were in Bella's shoes, I'd do the same thing. Love is a very powerful thing. Is it any more ridiculous for Romeo and Juliet to kill themselves for their love? Considering how often Stephenie Meyer refers to Romeo and Juliet in the first 2 books, it's obvious that the themes are the same. I think Bella stayinghuman and going to college trying to lead a normal life would be unrealistic to the story and not make any sense at all.     I also didn't think Jake imprinting on Resemee was a cop out at all. I actually thought that was brilliant. It added a deeper layer of fate to the whole triangle. Anyone who got grossed out by that, again missed the whole point of what imprinting is. Jake explained it before. When she's still a baby it's not in the least bit romantic. It's a soul connection, so while she's a baby he'd be her protector and like a big brother. I actually find the concept to be really beautiful.      I found Bella's behavior as a vampire to be the perfect ending to her journey. She evolved into a character who could be strong (both physically and mentally), who could finally feel like she was needed and necessary to the people around her (even if she refused to believe she was before), like she finally had a purpose. I think Stephenie Meyer was trying to get that message across to young women; that you're probably a lot stronger than you think you are. Bella's gift was something she'd had since day one, she just never knew that it was there. She was stronger than she ever gave herself credit for, and I think that was the point by the end of the story. Even her ability I thought was very symbolic. Through the whole saga she's the one being protected, constantly in danger (even of herself), and by the end she's able to protect the ones she loves. I thought that was really profound.     I was actually sad to see the story end, but felt totally content by the last page. Like I'd just finished the most satisfying meal. I truly loved it.

0061649694|5.0|Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman -- and it doesn't matter if it's a kid's book.<br /><br />And \\"Coraline\\" -- now being released as a movie -- is no exception to Gaiman's track record. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous \\"other\\" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (not \\"Caroline\\" is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a formerly bricked-up door that leads into an apartment in another world, which looks eerily like her own. In fact, it's so similar that she has a taloned, button-eyed \\"other mother\\" and matching \\"other father,\\" as well as a chorus of singing, dancing rats and magical toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are very attentive. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Without Neil Gaiman's touch, \\"Coraline\\" would just be another story about a kid who learns to appreciate her parents. But he infuses this story with a dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children in a mirror, beetles, disembodied hands, monsters that cling to the wall with souls in their grip, and rats that sing about how \\"we were here before you rose, we will be here when you fall.\\"<br /><br />That dark, cobwebby atmosphere clings to the increasingly nightmarish plot, as Coraline navigates a world where the other mother has every advantage. And Gaiman's wordcraft is exquisitely horrible -- the other mother's hands are compared to spiders, her hair to undersea tentacles. And the fate of the other father is a magnificently ghastly thing.<br /><br />He even infuses poetry into the horror (\\"A husk you'll be, a wisp you'll be, and a thing no more than a dream on waking, or a memory of something forgotten\\"), and a fair amount of macabre humour (\\"I swear it on my own mother's grave.\\" \\"Does she have a grave?\\" \\"Oh yes. I put her in there myself. And when I found her trying to crawl out, I put her back\\").<br /><br />Coraline herself is a wonderful little heroine -- strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint. And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless -- who \\"wants something to love. Something that isn't her. She might want something to eat as well.\\"<br /><br />Neil Gaiman creates eerie, slightly warped worlds like nobody else, and he does an exquisitely horrible job in \\"Coraline.\\" Just never go through the door.other mother's hands are compared to spiders, her hair to undersea tentacles.

B001BR5F4C|5.0|I am a huge Tarantino fan and this movie doesn't disappoint.  I own the dvd and Blu-Ray versions of this movie and I think it's safe to say that the Blu-Ray is a must have if you're fortunate enough to have the choice.  This movie has Tarantino's typical over-the-top action, gore, dialogue, and story that no other director could accomplish like he did.  Uma Therman's acting is on par with her role in Pulp Fiction, which is also directed by Quintin Tarantino.  Buy this movie!

Detroit is as good as pittsburgh, but this Pittsburgh show is more concise and the performance strong too, it is overall my favorite Live Doors available. Robbie Kreiger plays well, the band is tight and Morrison is lucid. As usual Bruce Botnick gets what stands up as very good recorded live sound for the time.
031606792X|5.0|I just wanted to say that I am not a teen but when I was I don't remember too many of my friends being so very impressionable.  This series is not targeted only at teens.  Also, the series was certainly PG13 in my opinion.  On another note, how many of we readers would say we molded our lives after a book we read when we were teenagers?  I definitely didn't but if I had my life may have turned out to be a fairy tale.    I loved all the books and the happy ending.
B00005LOLD|5.0|So much has been reviewed about this movie so I will just put my two cents in about the performances I loved. Marlon Brando....skillfully underplayed role. When I first saw the movie as a kid, I wasn't sure if he would be a sympathetic character or not. He's wonderful. Ricardo Montalban...one of the most under-rated actors ever. I remember reading a long time ago that when he danced on the Kabuki stage, the audience was not aware that it was Mr. Montalban performing ontage. Although one does wonder why a Japanese actor (like James Shigeta) was not given the role, I loved him in this. Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki...this is where the 5 hankies come in. I'm not sure if Japanese people thought her character was a stereotype or not...I will only say that I enjoyed her portrayal. She was so obviously in love with her 'Joe'. And Red Buttons...steadfast, unmovable in his decision to love this woman. What a sin that racism still rears its ugly head in 2008. Let us hope that thoughtful movies like this one will continue to be made.

Do not listen to these idiots with the 4 and 5 star reviews, because if they knew what acdc was like, those would not be the ratings.  I cannot decide if this is the worst acdc album, or Blow Up Your Video.  Razors Edge and Ballbreaker are way better.  Stiff Upper Lip, which I did not like, blows it away.  Angus and company sure sold out this time.  The sucky album also explains the Walmart only release.
B000TGQDZQ|4.0|After first getting into Nightwish years back, I started noticing that there were many similar bands that I had never heard of. Nightwish were so brilliant so I went on a mission, as many have, to find similar bands that were just as good that I could get into.  Years later my verdict is in and I've included a list of bands worth your time and money and bands not worth getting into at the bottom of my review....    Epica fits into my list of brilliant bands. This album is truly amazing and in al honesty I would have givenm it 5 stars if it weren't for the ridiculous final 14 minute track.. zzzz    This guy has obviously been playing with himself to far too many Nightwish albums. All the reviews before me say it too. He's trying way too hard to be Tuomas but he just doesn't have the skill. Beauty Of The Beast, Ghost Love Score, Poet and the pendulum by Nightwish are 3 of the greatest epic songs ever made, but the final track on this album is just rot and noise. It's pointless, meaningless and I like to stop the album before it gets there.    Having said that, when I do stop the album, I skip back to track 1 and listen to the album again. When I bought this, I listened to it on repeat for days on end. It is well worth every cent and is 5 out of 5 (if not for the last try hard \\"effort\\" of a song)    THE TIME & MONEY WASTERS (No Real Musical Value):   TRISTANIA, SIRENIA, XANDRIA, LULLACRY, LEAVES EYES, IN THIS MOMENT ----- These bands are about as boring as it gets with no real talent or anything that makes them stand out.    UNDECIDED: LACUNA COIL (Their old stuff was really good but Karmacode was awful) They said they were trying to sound like Korn on that album and they succeeded (AFWUL)    THE GOOD ONES:   NIGHTWISH, WITHIN TEMPTARION, DELAIN, AFTER FOREVER and.. EPICA ----- It's worth spending every cent buying every album from these artists.
B001DU8T6S|3.0|This is a good rock album, but not a Queen album. If you want to hear some classic Brian May guitar, some ascendant ballads, and LOTS of blues rock and roll, you'll love it. If you want to hear Queen, buy something from the back catalog.     This album makes something about the original Queen lineup very clear: the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. John Deacon brought the pop sensibility. Freddie brought the pomposity and grandeur, along with his song writing skills and, of course, his voice. Those elements are missing. Except for Brian's distinctive guitar and a some nice harmonies here and there, this doesn't sound like Queen.     But that's not all bad. Paul Rodgers isn't just a stand in. He brings his own song craft and voice, making this album more than just a Roger and Brian album with a substitute vocalist. In that sense, this is a great classic rock album, combing the sounds of Free, Bad Company, and Queen to make something new. If you enjoy ambitious guitar and classic rock, this is for you. If you're looking for a Queen album, you'll be disappointed.

B000XGDO04|5.0|I am a huge fan of all 3 and have all of the albums. It is not fair to compare them as we all have. But for me Adele's 19 has the most to offer. I absolutely love 2 songs on both of Duffy and Winehouse's albums. I cant get enough of 7 out of the 12 songs on the album. She is also much more enjoyable on stage than the other two as well. I look forward to hearing more!   I would like it if all 3 would be a little more upbeat. It must be a Brit thing. Between Duffy, Winehouse, Adele and Imogen Heap makes you want to slit your wrists. But I still love the Brittish output of music of late.
B001CC7PP8|5.0|Perhaps no movie in history has been copied more than PSYCHO.  Often considered the original \\"slasher\\", that title doesn't do it justice.  Saying simply that PSYCHO is \\"slasher\\" film alone puts a tag on it that says teenagers with low IQs, having sex, using drugs and alcohol, and are either baby sitting or going camping are going to get slaughtered the whole movie. Basically putting this masterpiece in the same sentence as HALLOWEEN or FRIDAY THE 13th alone is certainly a put down to the movie that the American Film Institute ranked as it's number one thriller of all time.      Now, I am not knocking the movies mentioned above.  I LOVE THEM!! But no movie in history has shocked and awed as this movie did on opening night.  THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE would possibly rival PSYCHO in that aspect.  But even TCM is based on the same person that PSYCHO was, Ed Gein. Loosely based that is.  With that said, TCM was a slight copy of PSYCHO.  Before PSYCHO, there hadn't been a movie like it really. The ever brilliant HITCHCOCK kept a tight lid on the storyline leading up to the opening.  Even during the making of the movie, the actors were given only a small portion of the script at any given time. This was HITCHCOCK'S idea in order to keep the storyline from leaking to the public therefore ruining the integrity of the movie.    Recently I purchased this blockbuster DVD and viewed it at home and realized how amazing this movie is, again. I hadn't seen the movie in years, and I was certainly not disappointed.  Of the nearly 400 movies I have on DVD, this ranks near the top as one that I am most proud to have.  I wouldn't trade it for anything.  The brilliant directing job by ALFRED HITCHCOCK and the uniquely innocent performance by ANTHONY PERKINS that some how seemed to  mix melancholy and madness.      I wish that movies today could be made like this movie was made.  It opened our eyes to a genre that still wouldn't catch on for another nearly 20 years.  At the very least giving us a glimpse of the future of horror and thriller movies.  A truly American classic.  See it, own it, BUY IT!!!
045122499X|5.0|As others \\"Pillars\\" lovers have mentioned World Without End turns out to be what we could have only hoped - a terrific follow up to a one of the great novels ever penned. WWE actually brings the reader right back to Shiring and Kingsbridge without missing a step and the storytelling by Follett is, as in Pillars, captavating and ever so enjoyable. Could he possibly have one last one to complete a tremedous trilogy ?
0784010188|5.0|I understand that because of the 1st terminator presents it changed the future, but the story line was a little weak. I would have love to see Sarah connors one more time. It made the death of the ist scientist useless, or perhaps that was the point when you change the past even for one little pebble it truly does affect the big picture,which mean either one of us could or could not be in the altered future. Humm    The action was good what we come to expect of the terminator Worth owning.
B00000JY1X|5.0|Who would have the creative energy and ambition to release a three disc set containing 69 songs all about the most complex of human emotions, while at the same time giving it a name that is a clever double entendre?  Stephen Merritt, that's who.  The gifted/eccentric pop auteur has delivered a stunning set of songs that examine love from every possible angle.  This is no sappy collection of silly love songs.  Merritt is concerned with more than just the superficial idea of love that we have been presented in movies, television, and, well...... music.<br /><br />The songs on this collection examine the countless effects that love can have upon us.  There is the giddy joy of falling in love and developing a new relationship, the pain of realizing that love is fading from a relationship, the need for love, unrequited love, the pain of a failed relationship, clinging to falsely idealized love, etc.  The list goes on and on.  Sometimes the songs explore the intertwined natures of lust and love and sometimes they examine love in the purest sense.<br /><br />The course taken by these songs is never conventional and neither is the music.  Just like love itself, nothing is ever predictble.  Sometimes Merritt crafts pure pop songs, elsewhere he shows his Joy Division influence with syntheziers and distortion.  But turn around again and he's churning out acoutsic folk or jazz influenced cuts.  The reason that everything coheres so nicely is because Merritt has a singular artistic vision here.  He works with a purpose on these songs and whether he's breaking your heart or making you laugh with his caustic with, he never resorts to cheap sentimentality or easy answers.  We wouldn't want it any other way.  Savor this album.  We may never see it's like again.
B001H5X7JS|4.0|Many months ago, when I first heard the concept behind TROPIC THUNDER, and the names of the cast members, my interest was certainly quite high...but so was my expectation of disappointment. So often, movies with great concepts fail to execute well (good example, HANCOCK).     The concept: a group of film stars are working on a Vietnam combat film, based on a true story about a brave rescue of a POW. Little do the bickering, clueless actors know, but they've been spotted by a group of REAL jungle drug-lords, who believe this group of American soldiers are REAL DEA agents coming for them. Suddenly, these whiny actors find out exactly how useless their guns full of blanks are!     The cast: Ben Stiller (who also directed the film) as a fading action superstar, Jack Black as a grade Z gross-out comedian eager to stretch his horizons in a serious film (but also dealing with some major drug use issues of his own), Brandon Jackson as a rapper trying to add another line of work to his growing list of achievements and most notably, Robert Downey Jr as Kirk Lazarus a multi-Oscar-winning Australian method actor who has undergone extensive plastic surgery in order to play the African-American sergeant of the team. Also along are Steve Coogan as their director, Jay Baruchel as a young, up-and-coming actor who may the only person in the group with a clue, Danny McBride as their explosives expert and Nick Nolte as the old Vietnam vet whose story they are telling.     The result?: I'm happy to say that overall, this movie is a SMASHING success. As with any action heavy comedy, there are moments when the comedy flags and the action doesn't thrill enough to make up for it...but overall, Stiller and company have very successfully made this film and its high concept work!!     The movie is packed full of \\"inside\\" jokes about method acting, Oscar-baiting performances, rap artists who shill for their own products (Jackson plays the rapper Alpo-Chino who is trying to work in references tohis new energy drink \\"Booty Sweat\\" into this Nam epic), etc., etc. I guess if this was the first movie you'd seen in ten years, you'd miss half the jokes. But if you're an avid filmgoer, TROPIC THUNDER is rich with snide digs at the film industry. And best of all, we have Tom Cruise as the most foul-mouthed, obnoxious studio head in history. He's funny indeed, although the character is actually not all that funny...it's mostly amusing to be in on the joke of a fat, bald, excessively hairy Tom Cruise dancing to rap music and swearing like he's in a Tarentino flick. Matthew McConaghy shows up as Stiller's agent, and he's funnier than I've seen him in five years (or perhaps ever).     I suppose I could go on and on about the various \\"bits\\" in the film...but let me just touch on a couple of high points. First of all, be sure NOT to be late for the film. It begins, without warning, with a series of fake movie trailers featuring our various stars in various ridiculous films. These are fall on the floor funny, and set up the 4 main characters very neatly indeed for us. This is followed by a very high budget Vietnam action sequence which manages to make fun of pretty much all Vietnam movie clichés in about 4 minutes. Best of all is Stiller's over-the-top reenactment of Willem Dafoe's death scene in PLATOON. I also enjoyed the unbelievable (and unbelievably silly) gore of these scenes. They poke hilarious fun at how war movies have become so much about showing us the damage grenades, bullets and shrapnel do to the human body. These early moments put me on such a high of hilarity that my goodwill towards the film allowed me to coast over the slower moments with minimal unhappiness.     Also, Robert Downey has received lots of attention for his role. Here's a serious American actor playing a super-serious Australian actor (with the most piercing blue eyes!) whose playing a serious caricature of a black army sergeant in the Vietnam era. It's a boldly tasteless choice, and Downey nails it. He makes fun of self-important, showy acting AND Hollywood's deaf ear towards stereotypes in one fell swoop. His interactions with Alpo-Chino, who really IS black, are hilarious. What a summer Downey has had!!     What about the less than wonderful things? There aren't too many. I'd say that Jack Black fares least well of the bunch. His character is the wildest and most unhinged of the group, and this allows Black to coast on just being manic far too often. Everyone is a TYPE...but Black shows little humanity below that surface. Also, the action sequences near the end of the film make little sense...once again, these bad guys apparently couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with all their machine guns. How many films rely on the villains being bad shots?!?! I think it would have been possible to actually make us feel these actors were in real danger. (Although the FINAL action scene manages to be explosive and funny at the same time.) And, while not a criticism of the film per se, I think it's time for Stiller to put away the dumb lug character: DODGEBALL, ZOOLANDER and now TROPIC THUNDER. It's funny, but now it is also very, very predictable, this character Stiller plays of the successful but extremely clueless schmuck.     Overall though, as the summer of 2008 winds down, it was great to see a film where laughs and a huge budget went together so smoothly. Well done.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is an excellent intelligent series about the interworkings of the White House. I bought it from amazon.com and there was absolutely no problem with the packaging. On the contrary the leather box is terrific. Each season is in a separate file folder and marked with tabs which makes it quite handy. Also included are two books - one summarizing each episode with lots of colored pictures and another with the pilot script. Very classy. The comment from R.C. Harris of Norway is NOT true. Ample space for each dvd and even pockets to hold them in. I don't know how he managed to scratch any. As far as there being no subtitles - I found it totally unnecessary and certainly no reason not to purchase this set. Suspect the comment from Norway is from someone where English is his second language as my sons and I have viewed the entire series multiple times and had no problem understanding what was being said. As far as his suggestion to buy from amazon.co.uk - you will get subtitles but unless you have a multiregional dvd player you won't be able to play them as they are Region 2 while the U.S. is Region 1. Definitely work the money for 154 episodes... about 108 hours!
B001ECQ75A|3.0|KUNG FU PANDA is a perfectly acceptable entry in the ever growing list of CGI animated films. Yet, because the list is not yet long enough to stretch back more than one generation, it is inevitable that the film be compared to TOY STORY I & II, INCREDIBLES, SHREK, ICE AGE, MONSTERS INC, FINDING NEMO, ROBOTS, etc. etc. This may not be entirely fair (it's not like we compare a film like UNFORGIVEN to every western ever made)...but it's true nonetheless. Upon leaving the theatre, my first thoughts were, \\"well, it's better than SHARK'S TALE and ROBOTS and ICE AGE II...but isn't up there with RATATOUILLE and SHREK either.\\" I should be judging it on its own terms. So I'll try to do that.     This is a fairly standard \\"sports underdog\\" movie in many ways. The hapless Panda, voiced by Jack Black, is clumsy, overweight and hardly built to excel in Kung Fu, a sport / art form which he knows inside-out (as a mega-fan would). Yet, when a serious threat to his town is unleashed, a wise old turtle comes to believe that this Panda may be \\"the dragon warrior\\" of legend, the \\"one\\" who can save them all.     Panda thinks this idea is pretty ridiculous, BUT it gives him a chance to hang out with some of his heroes, true Kung-Fu artists such as Tiger (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Cricket, Snake, etc. He relishes being with them, and even blows off most of their insults and mockery.     But his \\"master\\" (Dustin Hoffman, doing a really nice job here) is compelled to train Panda, even though he thinks it is a waste of time. What do YOU think? Will Panda find new talents in himself that he never suspected he had? Will he earn the respect of his heroes? Will he save the town?     I won't answer these questions here...but suffice it to say that you know the answers to these questions before the movie even starts. This is a film where the journey to the answers is the key.     The journey is amusing enough. The Chinese village is rendered lovingly, hinting at the feeling of watercolor painting, yet staying true to the almost 3D style of the best CGI films. There is no question the movie looks great. Within these settings, the journey unfolds with funny scenes showing the clumsy Panda attempting Kung Fu. Yes, there's even a training montage.     In fact, the plot is so predictable that the film would be thoroughly tedious were it not for the relationship between master and student. Black's Panda is a nice creation...he's funny & smart, and while he feels overmatched physically, he doesn't actually seem to think there's anything wrong with that. He gets down on himself at times...but is remarkably resilient. Essentially, even if his self-confidence is low (he knows he is not likely to be a pure Kung Fu genius) his self-ESTEEM is always high. Hoffman's master is a bundle of energy and aggravation, and makes a nice foil.     I was disappointed that the other characters were so minor. While I don't watch movies like this for the actors behind the voices, I had expected the Kung Fu heroes to be more a part of things, and to add more dynamics. In fact, they were pretty minor.     The climactic scenes were not as exciting as I would have liked, either. So in the end, the film was a mixture of amusing and creative bits, covered by a layer of predictability. KUNG FU PANDA, no matter how great it looked, could not throw off the unoriginality of story.     I believe kids will like it, and I wasn't exactly bored myself. But whereas TOY STORY and MONSTERS INC have warranted repeat viewings over the years, KUNG FU PANDA will probably NOT earn a space on my movie shelf.

B001F7XIJW|5.0|This album is strange, yes it is,  if you know this super band that is Gojira, and previous albums this one seems different, and that is good, because each album is different.  I like it though I like more the previous one I must admit.  That does not mean this one is bad or something, there are some really good songs on it, starting with the first, Oroborus and then the second, both great.  I had different favorite songs after I listen to it for first days :)  The album is with simple support, no booklet or something, is just about the music anyway!  Gojira rules!
031606792X|3.0|I loved this series from the beginning. I looked forward to every book coming out and enjoyed every book.. until this one.    It just didn't hold my attention. The first part of the book was pretty good. Part two was decent enough, I was annoyed by it at first, but it was interesting. Part three however.. It just felt too much like someone summarizing at the end of their essay. Like she got to the end and was like \\"okay, this is it, let's wrap it all up\\". It felt like it went to quickly with not enough time spent on the details. It seemed very different from her other work. And even with how quickly she went through everything, the ending didn't feel like THE END. In Harry Potter, when the series was over, you were sad that there would be no more, however, you were content. I am not content with this ending.    I am hoping she will eventually decide to write another book and wrap things a bit more smoothly.    If you read the series and loved it, don't skip this book, you should read it, just don't expect to be reading something up to par with twilight.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|I have seen many great films during my days on this planet, by many great directors, writers, and/or producers.  And I really can't remember when I first saw this 1960 \\"best picture\\" winner, since I was only five or six years old when it first came out.  But over time, upon repeated viewings, I've come back to it with so much enjoyment and a warm feeling that this was (and is), truly one of my top ten Hollywood movies of all time.  My \\"top ten\\" includes many great films (Close Encounters, the original Apocalypse Now, Titanic, 2001, Wizard of Oz, et al present day), but this will, I think, always remain very special.  It's just so good.  And all of it still rings true today.  \\"The Apartment\\" offered and still does, a view of corporate America and the eventual evil of \\"greed\\" versus the good of self-integrity and love, boiled down to a few individuals, with both essential romantic and comedic aspects powerfully intact.  In other words, this movie is still as timely and great today as it ever was.<br /><br />Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine and Fred MacMurray turn in absolutely wonderful performances as the three main characters in this very believable, \\"love triangle,\\" but this movie is just full of great efforts by so many others including Ray Walston, Jack Kruschen, Naomi Stevens, and Edie Adams.  And legendary Billy Wilder, one of the greatest filmmakers ever, contributes here, writing and directing, cookie-wise, a second to none effort throughout.  In retrospect, it's no wonder this film won best picture in its day, and I have loved it for several decades now, and always will.  It's one of those movies that if you first see it and like it and understand it early on, upon further screenings, will only engender even more appreciation and love for it.  This works from moment one to the classic final scene, as BOTH a comedy and a drama, and even as a seasonal Christmas/New Year's movie in some ways, and mixes all within a film without any serious or even minor flaws.<br /><br />Personally, I have been, can, and guess will always be able to identify with Jack Lemmon's character  (\\"Bud or Buddy-Boy\\"), from beginning to end, which is that of the basic corporate/personal \\"nice guy\\" who has always struggled to only finish near the bottom, company-wise, and girl-wise, because of basic morals and ethics concerning both.  Spoilers aside, this is really a movie with one of the most satisfying, albeit brief \\"happy endings\\" where the nice guy actually finishes gloriously first eventually, at least with the girl.  Because while he does not get the higher pay scale corporate position he wants, he does eventually get what he REALLY wants, which of course is, the girl.  And what else really matters?  While lots of other cinematic efforts have tried to do what this movie does, none have ever really come close, and maybe none ever will.<br /><br />Jack Lemmon has always been and will always remain, one of my favorite actors.  Around this time, he had already proven himself as a great actor with earlier Wilder and other comedic/dramatic efforts, especially with his genius performance in virtually the same year, in the brilliant \\"Days of Wine and Roses.\\"  Here he plays C.C. Baxter (corporate ladder-climbing, good-hearted nerd/stooge) in a lighter semi-dramatic/comedic role, in a film which still triumphs from start to finish within its central written cores and still resonates, to this day. with eternal, relevant characters and never-ending, compelling filmic themes.<br /><br />With a wonderful musical score by Adolph Deutsch (along with various other melodies scattered about, music-wise), this is, in my opinion, a virtually \\"perfect movie.\\"  In an early off-screen narrative at the beginning, written nearly half a century ago, our hero (Lemmon) states, \\"On November 1st, 1959, the population of New York City was 8,042,783.  If you laid all these people end to end, figuring an average height of five feet six and a half inches, they would reach from Times Square to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan. I know facts like this because I work for an insurance company - Consolidated Life of New York.  We're one of the top five companies in the country. Our home office has 31,259 employees, which is more than the entire population of uhh... Natchez, Mississippi. I work on the 19th floor. Ordinary Policy Department, Premium Accounting Division, Section W, desk number 861...\\"<br /><br />In the beginning, while more or less satisfied with his lot in life, C.C. Baxter had problems.  One, his seemingly but not really comfy, average Manhattan west Central Park APARTMENT (circa-1960, which nobody but the ultra-rich could afford these days), and two, how he had rented the same off and on to a bunch of higher-up corporate co-workers of dubious moral fiber to fool around in, all in hopes of climbing the corporate ladder.  When \\"Fran\\" (Shirley MacLaine, in her most adorable role ever, imho), the girl/woman he personally loves and wants, somehow, strangely enters the situation, it complicates everything.  Because, \\"Mister Sheldrake\\" (Fred MacMurray as the main bad guy), who Fran seems to be having had a long-time affair with, is the very big \\"boss\\" which Baxter has to impress, corporate-wise.  This whole triangle arrangement begins to fall through however, early on, within, and throughout the movie, where \\"business\\" morals eventually clash with our hero's personal feelings and his real life, outside \\"the office and the desire to get ahead in the business world.\\"<br /><br />I really can't say that any other film I've ever seen deals so right-on with the undefined lines and eventual conflicts oftentimes inherent within conflicting corporate and real-life environments as far as business and personal romance/love possibilities go except perhaps for \\"Wall Street\\" by Oliver Stone (another of my favorite movies, but not a top ten).  \\"The Apartment,\\" released more than two and a half decades earlier, still packs a more powerful punch however, and probably always will, along the same general lines, and every shot, every scene, every line, every individual actor's performance, every situation, is a winner, with no filler.

B0018CAAN6|2.0|Madge, you just pumped this out to finish out your contract with Warner.  We all know that.  You could have done much better.

B001IHJ97E|4.0|The first half of this film, made when Natalie Wood was still alive, is quite good. The story comes together quite well as the tale of a couple that is in the midst of divorce. The husband, Dr. Anthony Brace, (Christopher Walken) is an employee at a company that does cutting edge  research, and he has been mentored his entire career by Dr. Lillian Reynolds (Louise Fletcher). Brace and his wife (Natalie Wood) have a son together, but their relationship has come apart, and whenever they are together there is nothing but arguing and bitterness. Reynolds and Brace are currently working on a device that allows you to actually feel what someone else is experiencing. One night, while working all alone in the lab, Dr. Reynolds has a massive coronary. Realizing this is the end, she puts on the device, starts the recording session of her experiences, and dies. The rest of the film is a battle for Dr. Reynolds' \\"death tapes\\" and the use of the recording device. It is after the point of Reynolds' death that the film gets very splintered. It is hard to see just where the film is going because the decision to go on to the end with the film that contained Wood and not start over with another lead actress severely limited the editors in what they had to work with since reshoots of most scenes were now out of the question. Natalie Wood died in the autumn of 1981, and it was almost two years later before the finished product of this film arrived.<br /><br />Some sci-fi type films that are this old are either irrelevant or so laughably outdated that they are pure camp. Because this film focuses on the idea of the possibilities of healing relationships and even getting a new lease on life by experiencing life through the eyes of others rather than the technology, this film has held up pretty well over time. It just makes me wonder how truly great the film could have been if Natalie Wood had lived.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Here it is Halloween, and it seems like a good time to write a review for Tim Burton's film, \\"Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\". This is Burton's cinematic adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's ghoulishly, over-the-top, classic Broadway musical of murder and revenge with a smile.<br /><br />The story takes place in grim, urban, Victorian-era London. Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp), a skilled barber by trade, has come back to town under the new identity of 'Sweeny Todd'. For fifteen years Todd/Barker had been falsely imprisoned on trumped-up charges. This had been brought about by the self-rightious, Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who had coveted, Todd's young, pretty wife, Lucy, for himself. Todd returns home only to find out his wife has supposably died of self-poisoning and his teenage daughter, Johanna (Jayne Wisener) is now the ward of the lascivious, Judge. Todd, with the help of landlady/pie maker, Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), obsessively follows through on a bloody, murderous plan to get his revenge on all those he feels \\"deserve to die\\" and ultimately get Judge Turpin into the barber's chair \\"for the closest shave of his life\\".<br /><br />Sounds like black stuff, right? Well yeah, it is...black as night. But it is written as a tragedy, that has both a wink and and a small smile and a truely hummable, toe tappin' soundtrack. In the end its sort of like a perverse tribute to our culture's love of family. Its a musical for the 'Goth Kids'. But if your not into copious amounts of blood being spilled with a straight razor, while people are singing, then this isn't the film for you. For everyone else with a morbid, Charles Adams sense of humor, this movie is fantastic! Its emotionally moving, funny and entertaining! Highly recommended!

B001FB4W0W|4.0|I have read all the books and got HBO just to watch the series.  It's kind of disappointing because the books are so much better, but the vampires are great and well cast, especially Eric and Bill.  They are HOT, HOT, HOT! Anna Paquin, as Sookie, is OK, but I think she overacts a good bit. She speaks so emphatically that sometimes she is almost as obnoxious as Tara.    As for everyone else, I feel like I just have to wait through their parts (actually I am usually reading another book) to get to the vampires.  Jason is just disgusting and nasty, Sam is creepy and Tara is totally obnoxious.  And these are still my opinions after having watched the first 8 episodes.     My family is from a small town about 50 miles from Shreveport. I can guarantee you no one is running barefoot through the cemetery in the middle of the night.  Too many snakes, fireants, grassburs, poison ivy, etc.     I don't know anything about Alan Ball, but I think many of the changes he's made are not improvements.  I understand why he needed to make some of the characters' parts, especially Tara's, more important since the books are in the first person and from Sookie's point of view.  But it has almost become an ensemble cast rather than Sookie and the vampires.    I want to see more on the vampires and Sookie.  Especially Eric! Just saw him in the tub scene as I'm rewatching episode 8 as I'm typing this. Scorching hot!

B001EOQWF8|5.0|Wall-E is easily one of the best movies of 2008. 1080P Blu Ray pix looks amazing in almost 3D over 120HZ TVs. Audio over 7.1 Systems is beautiful. Pixar has done an amazing job with the Blu ray technology.     Regarding the load times of DISC 1, set your BluRay Players settings to off for BR LIVE content.  If the setting is set to on, during the first viewing BR Live will attempt to update the Wall E content to the disc on your hard drive and this could take 15-90 Minutes depending on your internet connection.

Can't wait for the next book!
6305291446|4.0|I thought it would be cool to review this movie on this particular day! HALLOWEEN H20 is pretty cool! I remember being 8 years old and seeing it at the theatre. 20 years after Michael tried to kill Laurie Strode, he soon decides to try again. She lives under the name of Keri Tate. She has a son named John. She works as a head mistress at a private boarding school in Northern California. She has a boyfriend. Soon, Michael tears her life up again. She soon decides to fight back and finish her brother off once and for all...until the sequel. If you love the HALLOWEEN series, you'll love HALLOWEEN H20: TWENTY YEARS LATER!!!<br /><br />p.s. HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I'm a huge Coldplay fan, and Viva La Vida does not disappoint. There is definitely a common death theme in many of the songs, but I didn't find it overwhelming or depressing. Chris Martin's voice is not the most amazing I have ever heard by any means, yet their music is still beautiful. His voice just fits the instruments and lyrics so well.     My favorite tracks on this album were Cemetaries of London, Lost, Viva La Vida, Violet Hill and Death and All His Friends. Lost is a great song to sing along to. Buy this album!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I've never been a big Metallica fan. Sure I like them but they just weren't all that to me. When I got the CD I was getting it because hey its Metallica why not? Well I've had that CD for over a month now and I can't stop listening to it. If you weren't a big Metallica fan this CD will make you a big fan. Its just amazing.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|It's almost useless to rally against this movie, but its rather gross in its portrayal of obese people.  It also incorrectly links obese people to environmental problems.  As was displayed by many newspapers, it is not fat people who pollute, but thin and wealthy people.  Most overweight people are middle class, with the majority of poverty level being overweight.  These people create the least amount of waste in our society.  They own less cars, less property, less stuff and pollute less.    Children are unable to understand such nuance and will think be given the message that fat people are to blame for what is the fault of all humanity.    If Disney wanted to make a social commentary, they should have created a movie about an overweight family living below the poverty line whose overweight because the only food affordable to them is low nutrition, high fat, chemically packed food.  It would have at least been a social commentary on a problem that's actually real.
0316143472|4.0|'When You are Engulfed in Flames' is one of several collections of true autobiographical stories by David Sedaris.  They are funny, mostly in a whimsical versus hilarious sort of way.  Some are fairly lame, almost boring.  But overall the book is a very fast, breezy read that puts a smile on your face.<br /><br />Bottom line: perhaps not as good or as funny as his earlier works, nonetheless 'When You are Engulfed in Flames' is a sure way to cure the blues, .. at least temporarily.

B000KF8P52|3.0|this is a great kylie album , a really different SAW sound .the disappointment is the bonus cd which contains just 3 tracks - instrumental versions of the 3 singles . see if you can find a different edition instead of paying more for the 2 disc set
B001GAOY5U|1.0|I was all excited when my copy of \\"Journey...\\" came I immediately played the 3D version. What a disappointment. What happened to the color? I then tried the 2D version and while the color was better it was not as vibrant as a color movie usually is. We need a reissue soon.
B001FBSMW6|3.0|Keane has earned all the glory that they now enjoy due to 2 of the best albums in recent history. My guess is they felt comfortable enough to stretch out a little and experiment with a sound that was slightly different than we have come to know from them. No big deal. I welcome any artist that takes a different course for the sake of exploring new possibilities. Unfortunately Keane seems to have taken a safe route rather than one less travelled. The track \\"The Lovers Are Losing\\" is the only real worthwhile tune in my opinion. It's a refreshing twist on their sound that incorporates their strength, nice melodies and solid vocals to back up the lyrics. Perfect Symetry is by no means a terrible album but Keane has set the bar extremely high for themselves with Hopes And Fears and Under The Iron Sea. And even as those two releases got better with time, I don't see much of Perfect Symetry growing on me like that. I guarantee that in the long run this album will have the least amount of songs performed in their concerts after they are done promoting it.

B00012QM8G|5.0|This was the first time I ever saw this movie. It is a heartfelt enigmatic story about a man who chose differently in a time of monotony. Oskar Schindler's story is one that became lost in the shuffle of Nazi Germany. With his effort to promote his enamelware company in Poland he was able to house and save the lives of hundreds of Jews that became victim to the clutches of Hitler's reign.  This movie is a slight glimpse of the horrors faced by the Jewish people during the holocaust. The movie portrays the heartless, bloodthirsty, brainwashed heart of Germany during the holocaust in the form of Amon Goeth, the General who led one of the Jewish labor camps. It is a vivid description of the soulless torture that took place during that time, and how Oskar Schindler was driven to save the lives of hundreds of Jewish laborers without once thinking about his personal gains.   This movie is related to World Religions because it highlights the period of the holocaust. It also shows the Jewish culture which is rich with tradition. Oskar Schindler, however, was tolerant, he promoted that the Jews carried on their traditions while they worked under him, he encouraged that they carry on the Sabbath tradition, chant hymns and pray according to their faith.  There is even a scene with a Jewish marriage being carried on in one of the camps. The movie also portrays the misfortunes that the Jews faced; the untimely deaths, the crippling tortures, the loss of lives, loves, and traditions.  This story however, merely scratches the surface of the depressing tortures that came to be during the holocaust, or the Cleansing of Germany. Oskar Schindler's tale is enamoring and very inspirational. It teaches us to have hope in times when there is none.
006113399X|5.0|This is book kept me reading far into the night.  It reminds me of the spy novels of John Le Carre.  It moves seamlessly from character to character and from modern Norway to World War II.  Not only were the characters well drawn, but I glimpsed aspects of Norwegian history, like the Eastern Front and the Norwegian soldiers who fought on the side of the Nazis, of which I had no prior knowledge.

I was horrified at the same time intrigued by the characters and I love Katniss, who would'nt? I am not sure why it is a young adult book I would not let my daughter read this till she was older, but I loved it. I can't wait till book two comes out and I am hoping I will not have to wait long, I need to find out what happens to Katniss/Peeta/Gale. At the end my heart was breaking for Peeta and can't wait to see who Katniss ends up with!!!!

B001G9LVGG|5.0|I'm new to the Loreena McKennitt collection, but I\\"m finding her music to be quite pleasant.  This album combines an almost Celtic haunting sound with traditional music.  The effect is impressive.  My personal favorite is the Wassailing song.  I've listened to it over and over.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I'm not a very big fan of Coldplay, in fact their music always annoyed me a little...until this album.  I don't know if they turned a corner writing music or if Brian Eno (the producer of this album) had a major affect in the quality of writing and production.  This album is well worth purchasing and listening to over and over again.  Probably the best album that's been released in the last 3 years.      Give a shot...you shouldn't be disappointed.
0060594896|4.0|This Jack Canfield book is awesome. It shows you everything what it takes to success at any level, any field. i'm sure no one will regret this purchase.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|This movie is just fun to watch in 3D.  Nothing great, just good family fun and worth the Blu-ray price.  A little scary for younger kids because of the intense adventure action and monsters jumping out at you.  Some of the 3D effects actually make you duck!  I can't wait for more 3D adventure movies just like this one.
0156030209|5.0|Read this book. Some have said that the first 45 pages or so are a bit of a slog. I disagree. Those early pages set the story up in a necessary way. Then, it takes off. It is funny, warm, sad, deep, happy, meaningful and glorious.
B001B1R1HC|5.0|This 14 CD set contains all Sviatoslav Richter's recordings for EMI. For any Richter fan, this is self-recommending. You may wish to skip to the last paragraph for buying suggestion and check out the track listing at the end.    For the new-comers, if you have never listened to Richter, you are missing one greatest genius in the history of piano performance. Richter could be mercurial, intellectual, inspired, and profound at the same time. He is a great experimenter, and does not like playing the same piece exactly the same way. When he is in form, as he is usually, he is one of the most dazzling technicians in the recording history. [Fischer-Dieskau: ... fearsome difficult passage was like child's play to him. (my paraphrase)] However, what makes him so special is that his performance carries such level of intensity that I have never found in any other pianists. Just listen to his Schumann, Schubert, and Beethoven (in fact just about anything collected here), you will get a sense what I am trying to convey.    Richter was born in 1915 and died in August 1997. He was essentially self-taught until he was admitted to Moscow Conservatory to study with Heinrich Neuhaus. By that time, he had the piano reduction of the entire Wagner's oeuvres memorized. Although Neuhaus taught many great pianists, including Emil Gilels and Radu Lupu, Richter was clearly his favorite \\"genius pupil\\". While Neuhaus acknowledges that he taught Richter almost \\"nothing\\", Richter claims the Neuhaus \\"freed\\" his fingers.     Richter enjoyed performing in front of an audience, but he hated planning concerts years in advance, and in later years he almost exclusively played at very short notice in small halls, as the big venues have to booked years in advance. That created further mystery around him.    Richter has a striking photographic memory. His huge repertoire ranged from Bach and Handel to Berg and Prokofiev. Most composers central to his repertoire are represented here. If you like this set I'd strongly recommend the DVD [[ASIN:B00004CXNY Richter: The Enigma]] (if you have a multi-region DVD player), and 11 volumes of 2CD sets [[ASIN:B000O77PZ2 Richter the Master]] (only Volume I is linked.) For further exploration, try his Chopin Scherzos (1977) and [[ASIN:B000026OHN Bach: Well-Tempered Clavier]], both have my top recommendation.    The recorded sound of this collection varies. Some are quite good, and some less so. Apparently, EMI does not bother to remaster the old recordings before the new release.    Buying tips: Be sure to compare the price at Amazon's UK site. It is currently priced at less than $50 USD including shipping to the U.S.. What a bargain! (I bought this set even though I already have more than half of this collection.) And it was released in Europe weeks ahead, that's how I got it before Amazon's release date.    Most highly recommended.    \\"The rhythm in Richter's performances makes one feel that the whole work lies before him like an immense landscape, revealed to the eye at a single glance\\" -- Heinrich Neuhaus    --------------------------  Content listing    CD 1    Beethoven:  Piano Sonata No.1 in F minor, Op.2 No.1  Piano Sonata No.7 in D, Op.10 No.3  Piano Sonata No.17 in D minor, Op.31 No.2 'Tempest'  Andante favori in F, WoO.57    CD 2  Schubert:  Piano Sonata in A, D.664  Fantasy in C, D.760 'Wanderer' (revised Badura-Skoda)    Schumann: Fantasy in C, Op.17    CD 3  Schumann:  Papillons, Op.2  Piano Sonata No.2 in G minor, Op.22  Faschingsswank aus Wien, Op.26    CD 4  Beethoven:  Violin Sonata No.5 in F, Op.24 'Spring'  with Oleg Kagan    Schubert:  Piano Quintet in A, D.667 'Trout'  with Borodin Quartet, Georg Hörtnagel    CD 5  Mozart: Violin Sonata in D, K.306    Violin Sonata in B flat, K.378  Andante & Allegretto in C, K.404/385d  Violin Sonata in B flat, K.372 'Unfinished'  with Oleg Kagan    CD 6  Handel:  Keyboard Suite No.2 in F  Keyboard Suite No.3 in D minor  Keyboard Suite No.5 in E  Keyboard Suite No.8 in F minor    CD 7  Handel:  Keyboard Suite No.9 in G minor  Keyboard Suite No.12 in E minor  Keyboard Suite No.14 in G  Keyboard Suite No.16 in G minor    CD 8  Brahms:  15 Romanzen aus 'Die schöne Magalone', Op.33  with Dietrich Fischer Dieskau    CD 9  Mozart:  Piano Concerto No.22 in E flat, K.482  Beethoven: Piano Concerto No.3 in C minor, Op.37  with Philharmonia Orchestra, Riccardo Muti    CD 10  Beethoven:  Triple Concerto, in C, Op.56  with David Oistrakh, Mstislav Rostropovich  Berliner Philharmoniker, Herbert von Karajan    Violin Sonata No.4 in A minor, Op.23  with Oleg Kagan    CD 11  Brahms:  Piano Concerto No.2 in B flat, Op.83  with Orchestre de Paris, Lorin Maazel    Mozart: Violin Sonata in G, K.379  with Oleg Kagan    CD 12  Dvorák:  Piano Concerto in G minor, Op.33  with Bayerische Staatsorchester München, Carlos Kleiber    Bartók:  Piano Concerto No.2, Sz.83  with Orchestre de Paris, Lorin Maazel    CD 13  Grieg:  Piano Concerto in A minor, Op.16    Schumann:  Piano Concerto in A minor, Op.54  with Orchestre National de l'Opéra de Monte-Carlo, Lovro von Matacic    CD 14  Prokofiev:  Piano Concerto No 5 in G, Op.55  with London Symphony Orchestra, Lorin Maazel    Berg:  Kammerkonzert  with Oleg Kagan  Instrumental Ensemble of the Moscow Conservatoire, Youri Nicolaievsky
B00009AOBI|5.0|There's a scene where the horribly facially deformed Rocky is verbally accosted in the hallway at his highschool by another student who tells him to take off his mask. Rocky grabs this other teenager and slams him against the lockers replying, \\"I'll take of my mask when you take off yours\\" and that's one of the coolest lines I ever heard in a movie.<br /><br />If you have a narcissistic or low self-esteem person in your life or anybody that feels sorry for themself too much have them watch MASK (not THE MASK). The acting is great. Cher is Rocky's mother, Sam Elliot is Cher's biker boyfriend and Eric Stoltz is Rocky. Peter Bogdanovich directed. In the film a poem written by the real-life Rocky is read:<br /><br />These things are good:<br />Ice cream and cake,<br />A ride on a Harley,<br />Seeing monkeys on a tree,<br />The rain on my tongue,<br />And the sun shining on my face.<br /><br />These things are a drag:<br />Dust on my hair,<br />Holes in my shoes,<br />No money in my pocket,<br />And the sun shining on my face.
B001G9FFM2|5.0|'The Blackening'(MH's 6th studio album) hits you right in the face and doesn't stop. A step in a different direction is what Robb & the boys have accomplished with 'The Blackening'. An unrelenting thrash attack with hooks, killer riffs and great arrangements. Machine Head has really stepped it up on this one....far more then what they had accomplished with 'Through The Ashes Of Empires' which also stands as a metal masterpiece. The main difference between the two is the distinctive sound of......Thrash. Incorporating their roots (which are 80's Bay Area thrash) Robb Flynn and Phil Demmel have come full circle. Once before bandmates in the thrash group Violence, Robb and Phil are back with a true old school dual guitar attack that doesn't sound dated in the least bit. Agressive and exciting are there soloing efforts.....back and forth between the two.........really awesome stuff. Many influences are heard throughout the album which include Metallica,Exodus, Slayer, Black Sabbath,Pantera and Iron Maiden. And the lyrics are well written with many words of our dismal future. Top notch metal is what you are going to get with MH's 'The Blackening'. An album that exceeds 60 minutes in length on only 8 tracks.......wow.   DIE FOR AMERICA   Now for the special edition.....many complain(as I do) when the rec. execs. reissue albums that were released only a short time ago. Clearly to capitalize on a success. Some are not worth re-buying ie. Life Of Agony's 'A River Runs Red' (top shelf edition). But some are as in the case of 'The Blackening'.  On the first disc you get bonus tracks from the Kerrang tributes, Iron Maiden's 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' and Metallica's 'Battery'. Both very well performed being down-tuned ofcourse. So this adds a different flavor.  But the DVD is where you get your bang for your buck.Clocking in at over 2 hours worth of live performances, videos (Halo,Now I Lay Thee Down,Asthetics Of Hate) along with the making of each video.And ending with a 25 min. doc on the making if the album itself.  Well worth picking up.
B000BISBDY|5.0|I have to admit first that I became a much bigger Cash fan after seeing Walk the Line. Guess I was too busy with rock when I was growing up. So... if you are new to Cash, you lack any Cash cds, and especially if you liked Walk the Line - I think you will really like this cd.  Long time fans are probably likely to be disappointed because there have been other compilations over the years that they may own - but I think this has to be one of the best.
6305910340|5.0|This is my all-time favorite movie. There is not one wasted scene or false note. The performances are excellent. I am not alone in my opinion: Ben Kingsley said in an interview I watched, that this was his favorite of all the movies he's done. If you are a chess expert and expect this to be a technically correct in every way depiction of the game, it's not. If you are not interested in chess and think this is about just chess, it's not. It's about relationships: mainly a father, son, and teacher relationship.  No profanity, no blood, no sex, some tears and laughs, minor reference to drug use. It does not closely follow the book it's based on (a true story written by the real life boy's father) which is fine. It's not a documentary.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|This was the best tv show we i was a little younger so now have all the seasons. It was easier buying here than at a store b/c they always seemed to be out of stock...
B00012QM8G|4.0|Kristi Chilton    Schindler List was a documentary released in 1993 which recreated the events that occurred in the Holocaust. The movie is about a business man named Oskar Schindler who inatiaonally was all about making money for himself. He began hiring Jews to work for him with little pay so he would profit more. However as WWII continued he realized what the Nazis were doing was inhumane and had a change of heart. The whole movie was very sad and will remain in my thoughts but a couple of scene really had me choked up more than the rest. The movie obviously was made in black and white however there was a little girl in the red coat throughout the movie that I believe represented the Jews innocence's. The little girl should not have been seen as a threat to the Nazis but eventually her red coat was also seen among the bodies. This scene to me displayed the Nazis as having no empathy toward other human beings. The second scene was in the end when the actual Jews that had survived with the help of Schindler were placing rocks on his grave. When I watched this movie I was amazed at the effect it had on me. I have always seen Steven Spielberg movies as excellent but he really did a wonderful job recreating the events on the Holocaust. I would have to say it defiantly will give even the hardest individual a new perspective on the tragic events that occurred throughout history. A main focus point for me was although Schindler came from different cultural background than the Jews he dedicated his life trying to save them regardless of the differences.
B001CLG6RC|1.0|Well, another bad album from Michael Cretu. It seems like he just can't get it right without help from Frank Peterson (1st Enigma, Sarah Brightman, Gregorian CD) and J. Godd. Somehow there is no vocals by Sandra too.  He is just making money on the name that Enigma has. I understand why people download music for free of the internet, because of albums like that.  Save your money, that might be the only way to show music labels not to release bad albums like that!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've tried PLENTY of workout videos over the years with good results on each video.  THIS workout dvd was totally different.  I find that the older I get, the less I like working out for hours.  Anything beyond 30-minutes, and I'm done.  But with these 3 workouts only being 20-minutes each, I thought it would be a breeze.  NOT!!!  LOL  These are the HARDEST 20-minutes I've ever exercised.  At one point, Jillian says, \\"I want you to feel like you're about to DIE.\\"  And I was thinking, \\"ORDER UP 'cause I'm about to lose both lungs!!!\\"  LOL  Simply put, this is an extremely effective workout that I've told at least 20 people to go out and buy.  Thanks, Jillian.

B001DU8T6S|5.0|I've been listening to and enjoying this album all week. The more I listen, the more I like it. Some great, truly classic rock to be had here, with a lot of variety and something to please everyone - or at least everyone with an open mind. May and Taylor bring their considerable musical prowess and elements of the classic Queen sound to the table, and Rodgers adds his amazing voice to create something that sounds both familiar and new. It must have taken a lot of guts to put this project together, and these guys pull it off very well. Can't wait to see them on tour next year. They've still got it - and then some!

B0017JKEL8|5.0|I don't watch a whole lot of television. As a grad student in literature, I watch a few shows now and then that people tell me are \\"revolutionary\\" or \\"amazing\\", and most of the time, I've been disappointed.<br /><br />What makes Mad Men so great is not just that the writing is incredible, the actors are great, the sets and costumes are so immaculate and colorful, the sense of time is so shocking and so believable. It's that this show transcends what normal television seems to hit--even the \\"great\\" shows are watchable once, maybe twice before they seem to lose their edge. I've watched several of these episodes three times or more, and the sense of art and space around the characters and their inner psychology is fascinating to watch.<br /><br />These characters and these plots aren't just about something amazing happening; that's what makes them so special. These are normal, powerful men and women in ideal and slightly-less-than-ideal situations, and many of them have no idea why their lives are falling apart around them.<br /><br />Explorations of capitalism at its most brutal, its funniest, its most dramatic and real.
0307269752|5.0|I loved this book!  It's very Swedish, there are a lot of big corporate/financial details (think Wall Street Journal), and the author has a huge gripe about violence against women.  If you can get past these three items, then it's a fantastic story.  I listened to it and I was spellbound, but I also leafed through the text to figure out how the Swedish names were spelled.<br /><br />It's the first of a trilogy and apparently they have been blockbusters in continental Europe.  The next book, The Girl Who Played With Fire, will be released simultaneously in Britain and the US on January 8.<br /><br />This book is about a disgraced financial journalist who takes on an older financier's personal quest (for a decent sum of Swedish Kroner).  He crosses paths with a much-younger computer hacker who is someone you'd likely avoid in person (you have to love the details about the state of her apartment) but is amazingly sympathetic.  Together they uncover details of the mystery that are very different than the expected.<br /><br />The book covers a lot of ground including their personal histories and a complex history of the family that they are researching.  And there's a lot of social commentary, especially about violence against women, but also about workplace ethics.  Most of the relationships are complicated and yet it's all very-believable.<br /><br />Kudos to Stieg Larsson.  Unfortunately, he died shortly after turning in the manuscripts for this trilogy.
B001CRGSKG|2.0|I bought this SHM-cd thinking it would at least sound a little better than the original one! Unless you need a special Shm-cd player, this release on a normal player doesn't sound any different from the domestic one. Usually Japanese releases sound better, but not here. This album needs a remastered job real bad!
B000000WJ4|5.0|I had seen Johnny Winter at the SF Blues Festival and was blown away by him.  A friend suggested this as a good all around sample of his work.  I love every cut on the album.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I was a little afraid that this movie was going to be a hokey version of the original. This wasn't the case. The producers, directors, and stylists who worked on the show all helped make this movie - and it showed. There's a lot of reviews talking about all the great stuff, so I'll talk about some negatives:    I'm going to talk about some major plot points and THERE ARE SPOILERS BELOW, SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW, DON'T KEEP READING!    1) I loved that Carrie and Big finally got married. I love that he proposed with a a Manolo Blahnik istead of a diamond. I love that Big helps Charlotte with her baby. Here's what I don't love: Big gets all worked up that Carrie plans this big wedding and he can't do it. He doesn't want to be embarassed as he's gotten married twice already. This got me a little steamed. I understand his point and I do think Carrie was going overboard. But, Carrie's never been married and she has the right to have a beautiful wedding and not a quickie at City Hall. There is a compromise between City Hall and the New York City Public Library. A bride should have the wedding of her dreams and Big should have \\"manned\\" up. So, he ended up getting what he wanted anyway. And speaking of the library, it was one of the things I think that the movie deviated from the show. In the movie, Carrie is apparently obsessed with library books, which leads to the wedding the Library. When, in 6 seasons of the show, did we ever get the idea that Carrie was obsessed with library books? We've only seen her read fashion magazines!     3) I love that, at the end of the movie, we truly realize how perfect Steve and Miranda are for each other. And I understand that they needed a story line for these two, but I just didn't see Steve as the cheating type. I still don't see it. Merely a plot device and not true to character. And Miranda seems even more like a *&^%^B in the movie than she did in the show. She's always been my least favorite character: she's awkward and cluelessand you'd think after so many years, she'd grow a soul.     4) Big and Carrie's house on 5th Avenue is stunning and it makes every girl dream that, one day, they could have it, too. The downside to this fantasy? Not even Mr. Big Bucks could afford this place. No way, no how.     5) I really liked the idea of Carrie's assistant. I think it was an inspired idea and a perfect way to help Carrie find her way back. But, I don't know what everyone's big whoo-ha-ha is for Jennifer Hudson. Not impressed with her at all, and especially not in this movie. I'm not sure who I would have picked, but she wouldn't have even made my top 50.     6) I left the movie feeling confused about Samantha. Over the course of 10 years, she hasn't really grown any. Sure, she dates Smith for a couple of years, but that doesn't stop her from lusting after Dante the hot neighbor boy or dumping Smith cause she's not getting enough ya-yas. I understand leaving LA because she needs her friends and she loves NYC, but left because she wanted hot sex with random guys. She's 50. Grow up!     Anyway, if you're a SATC fan, this movie is a must-see. If you haven't seen SATC, watch the show first. It'll be worth it, I promise.

A solid film that effectively balances fantasy in a realistic world, Faverau takes the superhero movie to the next level with his fresh, original vision. He crafts a movie that stays true to the comic book roots but looks and feels so realistic I felt like I was watching real feature film about an original character not an adaptation of a 1960's superhero.<br /><br />Iron Man follows the story of Tony Stark the son of a munitions manufacturer who s lived in an ivory tower. Enjoying a life of fast cars, fast money and fast women and hard drinks, Stark could care less about the cost his weapons cause to human life as long as he reaps the profits. His perspective on life changes after a trip to Afghanistan where he becomes a victim of his own weapons. With Shrapnel lodged in his heart, a terrorist group known as the ten rings kidnaps him. They demand he makes a weapon for them. Paired with Yinsen, another kidnap victim, Stark begins work on first the Arc reactor and then an Iron Man to help his escape.<br /><br />Back in the states Stark perfects his armor, not without a few hilarious disasters in the lab. He creates the Mark II silver-plated riveted suit that is far more powerful than the Mark I, but can't go into high altitudes. (Time for a refractory coating.) While designing the Mark III stark creates a gold Titanium Pollyalloy suit (a reference to the golden armor) and paints it red. With the suit perfected, he heads to Afghanistan for a little revenge. (Want to know how Tony flew halfway around the world? He flew all the way up into the Earth's upper atmosphere then flew back down. He did this in the comics to go from L.A. to New York and From L.A to Russia Back in the 1980's. Unfortunately this leads to a run in with some US Jets in thrilling action sequence ripped straight from a Bob Layton panel.<br /><br />The leaders of the Ten Rings find the remains of the Mark I and inform Stane. Stane finds the remains of the Mark I and is eager to get it functioning. He builds his own Iron Monger He confronts stark in his home and takes the arc reactor from his chest. Stark uses his old arc reactor to have an epic battle with Stane taken from an Iron Man Comic- I'm not giving anymore away- THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO SPOIL.<br /><br />As a longtime fan of Iron Man I'm delighted with this movie. Faverau's movie is a translation of the all my favorite Iron Man comic books to film. Starks house on the coast is just like the one he had in the second David Michilene/Bob Layton run of the book. Mark I looks just like it stepped off the pages of Tales of Suspense #39. The mark II reminds me of the old golden armor and all its flaws The Mark III armor is taken straight from the pages of Adi Granov's Extremis run of Iron Man. Jarvis is just like Homer from the Kaminiski/Hopgood run and the Animated series. There's just so much fanboy goodness in this movie.<br /><br />There is only one word to describe the acting in this film: SUPERB. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark. I love the way he plays tony as a cocky, ladies man without a care in the world. Downey's best scenes are with some CGI robots; I love these because he acts just like these robots are people. Jeff Bridges takes his acting to the next level as Obidiah Stane. He steals scenes as the bad guy; it's hard to believe this was the same guy who was in Dumb and Dumber years ago. Terrence Howard is great as Rhodey, his laid-back low key character is a great contrast to tony. Gwyneth Paltrow shines as Pepper Potts. Samuel L. Jackson is a solid Nick Fury.<br /><br />Iron Man is a Shawn James Five Star Essential Movie. Take your Superhero movies to the next level. Get t this along With Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Incredible Hulk Director's cut and Superman: The Movie.ane finds the remains of the Mark I and is eager to get it functioning.

B001BKG9SK|5.0|This is the latest and probably the best Gilmour/Floyd disk in years.  The addition of a live orchestra in Gdansk is great.  There are great versions of \\"Shine On...\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and an inspired \\"Take a Breath\\" live.  Maybe the best is what I consider the definitive version of \\"Echoes.\\" The songs from \\"On An Island\\" deserve a fresh look in the live versions.  Sadly, this is Rick Wright's last live recorded performance before his death from cancer.  If you like Pink Floyd and Dave you'll want this in your collection.
0375826726|5.0|This book, as well as the previous two, is awesome. I just love it, I can read it over and over and over again. The whole series is movie worthy, they need to make the sequels to the Eragon movie they made. I have fallen in love with the characters, especially Eragon and Saphira. It is GREAT!!!!
B00006HYQ5|1.0|Last year i bought my first IBM travel mouse, it looks great with my ibm thinkpad (made by lenovo) but with the ibm logo still on it, it matched perfectly my laptop, so i decided to buy 2 more IBM travel mouse for other 2 thinkpads with the IBM logo on them, but what i got was 2 \\"Thinkpad\\" branded mouses, no more IBM logo on them besides it appeared on the image of the product i choose, too bad, hope next time sellers put the right image on the product before we buy them... i will resell them!
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) is a professor trying to carry on his late brother's work.  His brother studied earthquakes and volcanoes.  But the university is losing interest and it looks like the lab will be shut down.<br /><br />That same day, Trevor's nephew is dumped on his door step for a few days.  Trevor hasn't seen Sean (Josh Hutcherson) in years.  It looks to be an awkward time until Trevor finds an old copy of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth that his brother had marked up.  As he begins to interpret his brother's comments, he begins to think there may be more going on than he knows about.<br /><br />As so the two set off to Iceland.  Hiring Hannah (Anita Briem), they set out to recover a probe.  But a series of events find them falling into a magical world.  Can they find their way out?<br /><br />I went in expecting a highly fun, fantasy adventure.  And I got just what I had bargained for.  The movie takes a fairly healthy dose of suspension of belief, but considering the premise, I didn't have a problem with that at all.<br /><br />This is a special effects heavy movie with the plot at times being nothing but an excuse for them.  But they were amazing.  And the plot works, too.  Yes, it's predictable, but it is fun, so that didn't matter to me.<br /><br />Granted, it helped that I cared for the characters.  And the acting by the three leads was good enough to draw me into the story.<br /><br />For all my praise, I do have two complaints.  The first is the pacing.  The movie took a little too long setting things up before the adventure really started.  Secondly, the ads for the movie gave away too much of the story.  I sure wish marketing departments would figure that out.<br /><br />The film is rated PG due to the action elements.  It will be too intense for kids who get scared easily.  But any kids who can handle some suspense will love it.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a family movie night, give this one a chance.  If your kids won't be scared by it, you'll all enjoy an amazing trip.
1400082773|4.0|Obama does an amazing job at detailing his life story and connecting it to his continued struggle to find his true identity.  Along the way he found his true purpose by helping others achieve change for the better.  He is very open with the reader about his experiences and defeats.  The writing is so well done that I often have to sit back and remind myself that this man is a lawyer and politician and not an author.  He astonishes me with his intellect and ability to communicate with commoners and high-brows alike.  Throughout his recollections I am continually reminded that his sole focus in life is to help out the less fortunate and to create a bigger middle class.
0380799006|5.0|I have two daughters who used to get along quite well.  But since the summer, their acceptable level of sibling rivalry has escalated to a very uncomfortable level.  We were desperate to \\"nip it in the bud\\" before things really got out of hand.  This book is already doing the trick - and it only arrived in the post yesterday!  I practically devoured the book as soon as I took it out of the package!      My husband gave me the task of reading up on things, because I'm a very fast and focused reader, and we needed the help a.s.a.p!  I finished the book today, and have started reading it again to take notes and make summaries to keep on hand. I have already put some of the lessons into practice and notice the difference already.  For example, arguments are easily diffused because feelings are validated.  I've also stopped \\"positive comparison\\", after I read, with horror, the potential harm it can do.      This book may be a bit of a shock for parents who are used to saying, \\"because I said so!\\" or who use physical punishment.  However, for us, it is another step forward in the journey of being the liberal parents we consider ourselves to be.

B001F0VHEM|4.0|p!nk's new album, FUNHOUSE, is an album that will probably help alot  of people, especially ones going through tough times. lyrically it's p!nk at her best. deep, moving lyrics that anyone can relate to. her voice is definitely one in a million. it has the ability to seduce you with it's soulful harmonies and emotional depth and then one track later have you on your feet rockin to her rough, beautifully pitched rock out numbers! stand outs in my opinion include so what, sober, i don't believe you, funhouse, and glitter in the air. a must have for p!nk fans.

B0018QCXH8|4.0|Whether you are a Lewis fan or not you can not help but enjoy this picture.    The plot is simple enough, but the execution of it is a masterpiece of subtle insight and pristine truthfulness into the human condition.    This is one of the all too infrequent breed of movies which is so multi-faceted in its human element, refined and yet with raw and unfiltered boldness as it lays out emotion and character motivations with unhurried bravery, that it sneaks up on you and surrounds you before you realize it.    Whether to explore the historical perspective, to enjoy the lead actor or simply to revel in the well executed totality of a carefully crafted film--you owe it to yourself to see this movie.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Amazing camera work, just wish they had used BD-50 instead of BD-25, still very good.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This movie is the sickest movie ever..i no why its been at the top of the movie list all this time. revolutionary stuff by orson welles  it was worth the money people  if u haven't seen it go buy it... all those majoring in film or just movie buffs starting a collection.. you need this one
B001GAOY5U|4.0|I didn't expect much from the story for this \\"Journey To The Center Of The Earth\\", having read several reviews of the theatrical version.  It was pretty much what I expected.  BUT OH THE 3-D!  Wow!  It's the best I've seen on DVD so far.  There is the problem of color, however.  It's better than \\"Spy Kids 3-D\\", but not as good as the 3-D version of \\"Polar Express\\" DVD.  They have to work on that.  But the 3-D effects had all of us (four watchers) literally jumping at times.  I haven't done that since I was a kid in the theatres back in the '50s.    I hope we are going to see more of these 3-D DVDs.  How about re-doing the original \\"House of Wax\\" with Vincent Price and \\"The Creature From The Black Lagoon?\\"  Then there's \\"It Came From Outer Space\\", \\"Hondo\\", \\"The Charge At Feather River\\"....
0312321376|4.0|Dr. Tucker presents an interesting case for prior lives based on stories of young children who remember living a life before this one.  A must read for those who may have read works by Dr. Raymond Moody, Dr. Elisabeth Kubler Ross, and others who have researched what happens to us after we die.
037571457X|2.0|I read this book, and I was very unimpressed with the amount of opinion Satrapi put out as fact. The story is clearly biased against the Islamic Republic, which is fine, but is overly so. Satrapi never gives explanations on events that are critical to the entire picture. She never gives the reasons for why so many of her family members were harassed, and even killed. From what I read, I understand that her family were communists, and at the time, communists were trying to seize power in the revolution. Many of the groups against the existing government including communists spread havoc, and provoked terrorism, but Satrapi never says these things. She just names who were killed. She claims things like Iran rejected an offer of peace in the Iran-Iraq war from Iraq and Saudi Arabia, but doesn't go on and say that the conditions to that \\"peace\\" would devastate the economy.    Besides these faults, I enjoyed some parts of the book. It portrayed many parts of Iranian culture in a bad light, but was written and drawn powerfully. I would say it is propaganda, but I think it is written too well to have been motivated for propaganda.
0375842209|5.0|I teach a college class on young adult literature, and that is what led me to this book.  While this book is perfectly acceptable as young adult, I'm afraid that classification will scare away a lot of adult readers who would enjoy this book.  In fact to truly appreciate it, you might benefit from a more complete knowledge of WWII than a lot of young people have. The style of the writing is unconventional and that might also make it more appealing to sophisticated readers of any age. I'm not certain the sylistic quirks such as the bold face listing are necessary or affectations.  All that aside it is a fascinating story with interesting characters that defies preconceptions and works on many levels.  For me it addresses the question of how the people under Hitler's rule could allow such a thing to happen. The power of books and words, the definition of family, sense of identity, and ownership are other themes that are explored.
B0007TKNKG|4.0|My son in law loves this movie. He has been looking for it a long time. I was very glad to see it on amazon at a great price. It was a great surprise for his birthday.
B000MNP2K8|1.0|My husband (a Bond fan to the bone) and I (who watches basically to enjoy the manly, handsome Bond men) watched this last night and I have to say I wasn't the only one disappointed.    This Daniel Craig Bond was TOTALLY physically unappealing (to me, a woman) not to mention I thought his acting was HORRIBLE.  I was disgusted the entire film that a man with this guy's looks could even be cast as James Bond.  He's a very effeminate version of James Bond.  (Can you imagine anyone ever mistaking Pierce Brosnan as a valet parker even in jeans?)  For Craig, it was believeable. UGH.  Craig would have been better cast as one of the valet parkers.    The story was choppy and hard to follow.  We both thought the action scenes were well done, but overall, it's one of the few Bond films that we will watch only once.     I hope the Craig/Bond experiment is over.  Bring on a real manly man who is smooth AND fine.  Ugh. (and I rarely write a review, but in this case, I had to.)    Cheers!
B0017MO10U|2.0|A very predictable thrown-together movie to make a few more bucks from an otherwise outstanding series. Better than \\"Ark of Truth\\",but not much.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|As some other reviewers have indicated, Gojira takes a few listenings in order to be fully comprehended and appreciated. I believe this is a quality of really great music. Even I did not like this album the first time I heard it and I am a huge Gojira fan. I think this initial dislike of Gojira's music is due to preconceptions of music. If it doesn't sound similar to something you liked in the past it may produce an initial aversion. But if you give it some time you will begin to pick up on the qualities that make this band and this album great such as their composition, aggression, and technically awesome musicianship. Another thing that makes this album a must buy is that it is a great whole album. Contemporary music today is filled with artists that release one hit single and fill the rest of the album with garbage. Gojira is like Pink Floyd, one of my other most favorite bands, in many ways such as musical innovation and producing great albums that need to be listened to from beginning to end. Do yourself a huge favor and buy this album.
B000WGN3YM|4.0|\\"Live in Hamburg\\" captures E.S.T. better than most of the trio's studio work, for this double disc shows the breadth and scope of the band's abilities on stage. Sometimes the music morphs into some strange plays, walls of discordant sounds that are not always pleasant to listen to, but the journey to and from such places is worth taking. Each CD in this set merits a complete listen---the songs are part of a cycle, a block of music that is woven together with sly improvisation.<br /><br />Each member shines in his solos but sometimes these grow a bit tedious, reminders of the excess that clogged many a double live rock album. But when the band contracts into one seamless unit, the results range from staggering power to subtle beauty. This recording is essential listening for all E.S.T. fans.

B001DDBCV4|5.0|I first saw the movie in the theater.  I loved it there and so i purchased the Blu Ray.  It does have its moments where the movie somewhat drags on but it starts right back up like its a new episode of the show!  I really did enjoy it!  My husband agreed to watch the movie with me (it was my birthday) and he said that he actually thought it wasnt bad and it exceeded his expectations!  Its a must have for any Sex and the City fan!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|As this is one of my absolute must see TV shows, it is easy to give this item a rave review. I didn't get tostart watching supernatural until the middle of the second season and was blown away by the well written scripts and the interplay between the main characters. Not since The X Files has a show been able to hold my attention for a complete hour and yet it always leaves me wanting more. So being able to watch the first season where John Winchester plays an important part has answered a lot of questions, and at the same time opens an entirely new set of questions which I hope the writers get season after season to answer!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This movie was great!  It looked great too!  we have a 58\\" plasma 1080 and the quality of picture was fantasic!  definately recommend the blu ray for a higher quality picture.
0132350882|5.0|I am a front end web developer with a couple years experience and I purchased this book to get a better idea of how to generate more readable and understandable code.  And this book satisfied that need.  If you are a very novice coder, that is to say that you do not yet know your syntax and are unfamiliar with OOP, you will want to wait to pick up this book.  Not that all of the examples and discussion are super technical, just that are many assumptions and no explanations of these subjects.      One of the nice things about this book is its tone - it stays reasonably lighthearted, with a number of naive illustrations to maintain this feel.  Nonetheless, it is abundantly clear that the author is fully versed and a master of code, ensuring that all the discussion is well considered and presented.      I do find that the author seems to go a little far in defining his ideal, tho perhaps that is the purpose of an ideal - to guide one's daily path and provide some information as you build out your projects.
B001DU8T6S|4.0|i would love to give this album 5 stars because i enjoyed nearly every song and nowadays finding an album with more than three good songs makes me ecstatic but it's a bit disjointed in spots and some of the lyrics are a bit weak. overall a good effort from this collaboration of three of my favorite musicians. i'll avoid the \\"Should They Call It Queen\\" or Paul Vs Freddie comparisons and just review the album  Track 1 The Cosmos Rocks-the lyrics are a bit goofy but this one cooks. nice rave up with sweet May solo. it's amazing that Rodgers sounds this good and strong at 59.  Track 2-Time To Shine- i could tell this was Paul's lyrics right away. solid number with a nice guitar solo.***Highlight***  Track 3-Still Burnin-Brian May rocker. the We Will Rock You sample was a bit much but it's got all the elements of a classic rock groove with queen harmonies.  Track 4-Small- this is my favorite on the record. shocked how much it's stuck in my head. catchy chorus but overall soulful. nice job by Roger on  the words. **highlight***  Track 5-Warboys-this version is better than the Rodgers solo version but i don't like them recycling old material for a new album.   Track 6-We Believe-the Worst song on the record by far. Brian lets his hippie politics get in the way on this one with all the preachy lyrics plus it's just not that catchy and is way too long.  Track 7-Call Me-another welcome surprise. This sounds a bit like Dreamer's Ball from Jazz but yet it's Rodgers' tune. real infectious and it sounds like they had some fun on this one.***Highlight***  Track 8-Voodoo-nice bluesy groove. i guess Rodgers background is influecing this a bit though Queen always tried some bits of blues here and there. the voice is amazing and again tasty axework **Highlight**  Track 9-Some Things That Glitter- i was beginning to worry a bit about Brian May's writing by the time i got to this point. he was always my favorite writer in Queen(though i liked them all)but he redeems himself from We Believe here in strong fashion. beautiful paino driven ballad with some lush Guitar treatment throughout. reminds me a bit of Save Me. great words and Rodgers stretches himself nicely.***Highlight***  Track 10-C-lebrity- the first single is rough and tumble. decent lyrics from Roger about celebrity driven culture that he is/was part of but i guess he and the boys still look classy compared to Paris and Brittany. Roger's always been one of my favorite unassuming drummers. strong performance from him on this plus you get to hear he and Brian vocally on the chorus.  Track 11-Through The Night-next up is a cool Rodgers ballad. it's impressive how he can write in the same territory and keys for so many years yet make each one just a bit different. and i have to admit it's cool to hear the Brian May sound embellishing a Rodgers tune. ***Highlight**  Track 12-Say It's Not True-this is another retread from the last live album. they did jazz this one up a bit on the studio. it's a nice melody but more preachy lyrics and it's been overdone by now.  Track 13-Surf's Up...School's Out. this one has Roger's fingerprints all over it. reminds me of something from his Fun In Space record. this is interesting to hear Rodgers voice in a different light. the thing i like about this union of these guys is they seem to be influenced enough by each other's styles to come out of their individual comfort zones on a few of these tunes. the bridge breaks thing up before a rousing finish. ***highlight****  Track 14-Small Reprise-you already know how i feel about this song so hearing a taste of it again at the end was more than fine with me.    a good job by these veterans. there's a ton of young so called rock groups that could learn a lot from listening to the balance of this album. i'm curious to see how they treat these songs in concert. hope they make it out Az way.

B001BGTWXI|4.0|maybe theyve always been immature and its taken me this long to figure it out? idk...    after reading through reviews here amazon, it leaves me wondering. are they wrong or am i?    i think this album is amazing. theres really not a bad song on the album, except dead memories. i dont get why slipknot put a stonesour song on thier album.    let me break it down for you.    execute- the typical intro. builds a nice atmosphere for the album.    gematria- what can i say about this song that everyone else hasnt? most reviews ive read completely bash the album and say gematria and psychosocial are the best songs EVAR!! whatever.    sulfur- nice song. i like the double kick with the heavy guitars. the chorus is catchy and the guitar chug along nicely.    psychosocial- same as gematria. btw i hate listening to this song on the radio. the ultimate breakdown is cut out. it pisses me off so much.    dead memories- worst song on the cd. if i want to listen to stonesour, ill listen to stonesour. im trying to get my slipknot on. when i hear this on the radio i change the station. what a terrible single!!!!    vendetta- same as sulfur, i like the heavy guitars with the double kick. coreys voice sounds amazing in this song. and its cool to chant out 'are you ready for the time of your life'    butchers hook- weird time signatures in this song. very cool and unique song. this song appeals to me alot.    gehenna- what to say about this song....well its creepy. and coreys singing sends chills down my spine.    this cold black- ah, sounds like an iowa song on some parts. although if i had to choose, id say this is the 2nd worst song on the cd. that doesnt mean its a bad song though, its decent.    wherein lies continue- meaty riffs in this song. still not that good though. id say its tied with this cold black as the 2nd worst song on the cd. still a decent song though.    snuff- amazing song. reminds me of circle, but this is like 10x better.    all hope is gone- i think this is the heaviest song on the cd. it melts your face off. crazy as riffing, blast beats, double kicks and screaming in this song.    til' we die- boring song. and theres this annoying 'tone' during the chorus.    overall- pretty good album. dont bother with the special edition. just get the regular version.    i dont see how its possible to give this cd 1 or 2 stars. your not a true maggot if u did...

B001GAPC1K|2.0|Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark character was not hard enough for me and when you are a Superhero, you have to be extra hard in and out of costume!! I didn't like how every opportunity he got to turn down a kiss and sex he did so like he was fully aware of his homosexual following was watching and chose not to disappoint them. The scene where he is with his contraption looked just like he was caught \\"gettin off\\". As for the movie itself it was just ok and not spectacular like it should have been(like 300!). He had no true evil adversary to boost his skill level alot more so all we are left with is admiring his suit which was very cool. Marvel is so trippin' not basing alot of their stories straight out of their comic book pages and it is hurting their attempts to showcase these easy ones and they are not hitting the mark. Big budget advertising and the good box office receipts still don't impress me as I am very well versed on all these characters and see the holes very well. I would for one like it if they start making them R-rated instead of the safe PG(There are enuff kids movies already!!) which forces them to take more chances and be more creative in the action and plots. I saw more drama in Todd Mcfarlanes animated Spawn series on HBO than these movies Marvel has been producing! While it is good that they are coming out more frequently than before, they need to focus more on making these huge budget hero movies for adults where the kids can come with the parents and be braced for a cool and wild ride again like the blockbuster \\"300\\". The audience for it is definitely there and so is the big box office they want as long as the story , action and plot stays in tact. And finally, let the fellas \\"get some\\" please?!!  Better than the new Hulk but not that much. I rate it a C.  Thanks Again Ya'll!!
0060764899|5.0|Few reading experiences are richer and more delightful than taking another trip into Narnia, especially when doing so via the mysterious wardrobe.  C.S. Lewis's enchanting fairy tale is warm, beautiful, and inspiring with every read.  I have personally read it four times in my adult life.  (I never read it as a child.)  And I could probably read it at least forty more times.    In this story Lewis enables the reader to step into the shoes of Peter, Edmund, Susan, or Lucy -- whichever character you find is most like you, or whichever one has the tightest grip on you.  Things like childhood fancy and fun, sibling rivalry, betrayal, sacrifice, and redemption all play crucial roles in this tale.  And it's presented in such a way that a child and adult alike can both learn and understand.    Many readers intrigued by the Gospel allegory the book is so famous for will not be disappointed.  But many may be disappointed by the allusion to Adam having a wife before Eve named Lilith.  This may be a turn-off to some, and I will not defend Mr. Lewis in this area.  But I will say that it is a story and should never take the place of the Word of God.  Parents and educators would do well to keep this in mind should the matter come up.      In other words, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is not a book about theology or a commentary on the Bible.  But it is a fantastic example of what happens when the major themes of the Scriptures are mixed with classic fairy-tale telling and quality children's literature.
B000TETKA8|5.0|There are so many reviews of this album already I don't want to be redundant but as someone who has every album that Bowie ever released and then some, I want to chime in and encourage you to check this out. When reviewers mince about whether the latest Bowie offering compares to his classics, \\"Scary Monsters\\" is typically namechecked as the latter bookend formalizing the classic years of Bowie's peak.<br /><br />I don't agree with that; Bowie's albums may have slumped in the 80s but powerful CDs from the 90s like [[ASIN:B00138F8NC 1.Outside]] and [[ASIN:B00138H7TK Earthling]], not to mention [[ASIN:B000VZY9OM Buddha Of Suburbia]] and [[ASIN:B000XFCTG0 Black Tie White Noise]], measured on a par with Bowie's classics. That said...<br /><br />Scary Monsters is indeed one of Bowie's finest. Once you get past some of Bowie's very best songs, \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", \\"Fashion\\" and the title track, you delve into Bowie's most harrowing work with stellar moments like both versions of \\"It's No Game\\" and the cover of Tom Verlaine's \\"Kingdom Come\\". But it's not like the other third of the album is filler, not at all. It merely had the misfortune of sharing disc space with classics like those already mentioned. Oh, I suppose I could do without \\"Teenage Wildlife\\" but 9 out of 10 is par for the course for so many Bowie albums.<br /><br />This belongs in the shortlist of Bowie's finest, next to [[ASIN:B000TDDIC0 Station To Station]], [[ASIN:B000XFECLU Diamond Dogs]], [[ASIN:B000XFCPIM Aladdin Sane]], [[ASIN:B000TENMNY Low]], \\"Earthling\\", and \\"1.Outside\\", and just a titch better than '[[ASIN:B000TEPKAW Heroes]]', [[ASIN:B000TEVFPQ Young Americans]] or Hunky Dory. The best thing about getting this album as opposed to a 'best of' is that you get the full length versions of some of Bowie's finest moments rather than hatcheted edit versions. Did I mention this album was strongly recommended?
B000001EL7|3.0|A couple of the songs are damaged on the CD and skipped the first time I played the cd
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|Ac Dc fans watch out! There's an actual drum fill on the record. Yes, if you don't believe, then get the record and you'll hear it on the intro to Rock and Roll Dream... There's also a Zep-like slide tune - crazy! There are a couple of throw away tracks, but the rest is ROCK solid!
B001CDLATE|5.0|I won't belabor the comments/reviews left by others; this is an absolutely phenomenal film that deserves a place on the shelf of *any* Blu-ray player owner.  Truly impressive, buttressed by the best high-def video/audio mastering I've seen yet - it looks and sounds fantastic played via my PS3 to a Panasonic plasma HDTV and decoded in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  Buy it.    Unfortunately, the packaging is hippie-dippy crummy.  Yes, it's biodegradable; so much so that it started to degrade during the shipping process!  It's just flimsy cardboard that arrived looking a bit tattered even within the factory shrinkwrap - it'll fall apart with use.    Even worse, storing the disc in the case requires sliding it against the cardboard, which is a big no-no and encourages scratches to form.  A very poor, politically-correct packaging decision for a treasured film that needs to be preserved in perfect condition.    I fixed the packaging today. I'd already purchased a couple dozen new, empty Blu-ray plastic cases to replace broken ones, so I used one of those to repackage this movie.    Instead of cutting up the original box, I first tried scanning it to make new covers, and that worked great. I used 600dpi, 24-bit color, with slight sharpening enhancement and a 133LPI descreening filter to smooth the image. (This was done with an inexpensive Epson 1670 scanner, by the way.) The result is gorgeous!    I saved it as a TIFF file to preserve the scan's full quality, then reduced the front cover 4% and cropped off the top blue \\"Blu-ray\\" line, unnecessary for a real Blu-ray case. What you should end up with is an image height of 5.875\\" with proportional cropping, making the width just about exactly right to fix the plastic case. Printed in highest quality setting on my HP 5550 inkjet (another inexpensive device) it worked perfectly - you have to look very closely to see that it's not an offset-printed factory cover and it fits the new case beautifully.    Similarly for the inside-rightimage; scanned it using the same specs, then reduced 10% this time to fit the case interior - again, great results.    So, problem solved, and I hope these guidelines might help others.  I've added a couple of hastily-shot photos of my repackaging; they should illustrate the final result - I apologize for lack of time to create more-professional images.    P.S.  Want more?  The filmmaker, Ron Fricke, is working on another one!  Entitled \\"Samsara\\", it's tentatively scheduled for 2009 - see [...] for what little info is available so far.
B001DDBCV4|5.0|If you're a sex in the city fan, then you won't be dissappointed!!  And on Blu-ray you can see that much more detail!  So, the fashion and colors just pop!  Be careful, though, you may need to go shopping after!!!  Great movie.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I've always been a fan of The Godfather series. This is a must buy for any Godfather fans that owns a Blu-Ray player.
B0002KVULG|4.0|This 1979 version of Dracula is a beautiful film, harkening back to the old classic style horror film. Wonderfully cast, Frank Langella is a compelling Dracula, in an underplayed and very naturalistic performance, brimming with charm, elegence and intensity. Likewise Kate Nelligan, Lord Laurence Olivier and Donald Pleasance also give very memorable performances. The film is light on gore, stately paced and heavy on beautiful and engrossing gothic atmosphere. The sets, locations, costumes and overall production design are truly grand and the cinematography is gorgeous. John Williams provides the film with a score that fits perfectly and is one of his very best (which is really saying something) - perfectly displayed in the wonderfully psychedelic \\"wedding\\" scene designed by Maurice Bender. A modern version of an old fashioned horror film and brilliantly executed with class and style.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|After months of anticipation and only \\"Green Light\\" to keep us happy, we finally get to bless our ears with Evolver, and man if it aint the best $10 I've spent in a while. I love John Legend as an artist, but I've never been too wild about his last CDs for some reason, I could never get into them. But as the title of the CD suggests, the man has truly evolved and grown in his music, and I am loving this new sound! Granted, John Legend retains the same style that has built him such a fan base, so the stuff you love about him is still there, but songs like \\"Green Light\\" or \\"Its Over\\" show that he's taken a greater interest in who he collaborates with, and therefore put out a much better product then before.<br /><br />There are the traditional heart felt ballads that seem his specialty, like \\"Good Morning\\", \\"I Love, You Love\\", and \\"If Your Out There\\" and those rarely disappoint. He switches it up on you with some newer sounding material production wise, like \\"Take Me Away\\" and \\"No Other Love\\" giving a sort of jazzy, Caribbean feel that works so well for him, especially on \\"Take Me Away\\" which has quickly become my favorite track on the CD. And for those people out there with friends they wish were more then friends, he summarizes those feelings extremely well with \\"Cross The Line\\".<br /><br />The only downside to the CD is that at times it tends to get slow with the love ballads. \\"This Time\\" and \\"I Love You Love\\" and \\"Good Morning\\" are songs are ok, but you have to me in the mood to hear them. Fortunately, he keeps it diverse enough that it doesnt get that much slower then that, giving us a classic album. Spoil yourself, go cop that Evolver. You know you want to
B00004U8P9|5.0|As has been said many times before, \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" is a film that leaves few people undecided - its either loved or hated, and I fall into the former category. Anyone looking for a traditional film with a coherent plot need look elsewhere. \\"Rocky Horror\\" is all about good music, great mood and atmosphere, memorable characters, tremendous performances and most importantly, FUN. Its a very lively, campy, free-spirited film, with some surprising emotional resonance if you care to look for it. And if you don't, that's fine too. Just give yourself over to the experience. I probably saw it for the first time 15 years ago, and I think I like it now more than I ever did. Its just got a special magic about it that sticks with you.
B00151HZME|4.0|Saturdays=Youth is actually very decent for play during web surfing.  Very appropriate for chilling out, calming, soothing.  Happy to have \\"discovered\\" this one by association.  I refuse to part with mine.
B00005JKC3|1.0|The only thing incredible about this Hulk was my disappointment. What a letdown - a boring letdown - and a wasted opportunity. I expected more from Ang Lee. The only saving grace was Jennifer Connelly's amazing cleavage, which never disappoints. Thank you, Jennifer.
0786838655|4.0|Rick Riordan is a great author and his book The Lightning Thief  is one of my favorite books. Two of my favorite qualities in a story are plot twists and suspense. There are many action scenes in this book and all of it leads up to a major plot twist in the end.    In his characters you see a great amount of pride and confidence in themselves. They all have great courage and want to do what's right for each other. In the setting he picks for this book you see an amazing new world, a hybrid of the modern world and ancient Greece. I like how he can explain how the whole world doesn't know that the Greek Gods exist.      Overall this is a fantastic book and series. I hope many people get the chance to read this book as I have. - Thomas Adamson, 12; Sherwood Middle School
0316143472|5.0|Pure Sedaris humor, thus good. Yet this collection stands head and shoulders above other titles. Finally his partner Hugh plays a role in almost all stories, so this time we not only read about Sedaris' family but he also writes on the subject of homosexuality and his love for Hugh. And then there is the best Sedaris story that I know so far: \\"That's amore\\", about this shrewd, shrewd neighbor woman.
B0000B1OFN|5.0|MY HUSBAND AND I SAW THE ITALIAN JOB ON BIG SCREEN AND WAS BLOWN AWAY. I BOUGHT IT ON VHS( OLD SCHOOL) AND WATCHED IT AGAIN IN THE COMFORT OF MY HOME. I DECIDED TO PURCHASE IT ON DVD AND WAS AMAZED AT HOW FAST AND INEXPENSIVE AMAZON WAS. QUALITY WAS GREAT. I WATCHED IT THE DAY IT ARRIVED. THIS FILM IS FANTASTIC. THE ACTION IS THRILLING, THE ACTING SUPERB. I'M A BIG FAN OF MARK WAHLBERG AND CHARLIZE THERON. I'M ECSTATIC TO HAVE THIS MOVIE IN MY COLLECTION.                                    SINCERLY,                                 BRENDA MORAJKA
0446579939|4.0|This is a wonderful book if you're  looking for something fast-paced, uplifting, and not too heavy.  I think Sparks did a great job with character development and while the story was a bit predictable it wasn't always how I thought it would be.<br /><br />Definitely recommend it.
B000TGJ80I|4.0|fairly tired subject matter gets a nice boost in this movie. Rather than go point to point over the movie, I have only to add that the plot is great and never drags, the settings and scenery look fantastic, and the best part: they did not over use wires and impossible body contortions in the special effects to make it entirely unbelievable.     Great show and great special effects. Kate in BluRay? a must have!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I don't think I can express how much I'm in love with this cd. From start to finish it draws you in and never lets go. \\"Hanging on Too Long\\" is my favorite song but \\"Warwick Avenue\\" and \\"Stepping Stone\\" are also standouts. Without question the best cd I've listened to all year.
B001G5IJVK|5.0|I know a lot of screaming fans are not happy with another compilation from kiss , with probably more to come, but I must admit this to me is the best kiss comp to get. The packaging is great , the remastering is also great , and there is a wide variety of real great classic kiss tracks,and not just the hits. This also gives each individual member his own disc with tracks even from the solo albums. This is a good set for traveling and in my case to listen to while I'm working out at the gym.Some real gems are on this set, and I would recomend this over any kiss gh package.

159562015X|3.0|I didn't find anything special about the book. The professor wanted us to do the test, so we did, and I don't need the book anymore. It is frustrating because you have to buy it new to do the test and you can't sell it to anybody. What a waste of money and paper!!! Gready authors and publishers: please think about the environment at least!
0375826726|5.0|This book is definitely the best of the series so far! Chris has matured so much and so the books are better. Writing Eragon he was a green noob, but now he is great!
069111966X|5.0|If you are a student, this book is for you. If you are into self-betterment, then this book is for you. Basically, if you want to learn how to think about problems and potential solutions, then this is for you.<br /><br />Clearly written albeit math-oriented.
0553579908|4.0|As with my last review, I won't waste time going into too much depth in describing this book - suffice to say, I feel the hundreds of positive reviews should adequately cover the overall quality of the book. My own experience is much the same - expect increasingly nuanced and interesting characterization of characters you thought you knew, enough action to keep fans of it happy, and a good amount of progression in the plot, which continues to largely revolve around the politics of Westeros.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended<br /><br />Later edit (2012) - Having read this book a few more times now, I've bumped my review down to 4 stars. It's still a very good to great book but a definite step down from AGOT/ASOS.
0143058525|1.0|One thing became very clear to me while listening to this chronicle of self-love and middle-class privilege: the most dangerous place to be if in proximity of Elizabeth Gilbert is between her and her hugely high opinion of herself.    This puling, grueling, whiny tale of...what?  Someone who's SUFFERED so BADLY because they went through a divorce (well I never heard of such suffering! Golly whilickers!) with a man who has committed unspecified crimes (no doubt: didn't praise her highly at least three times an hour).  It's a cringe-worthy read, especially when she swoops down on a completely impoverished \\"medicine man\\" who cannot for the life of him remember her after her absence of several years (how could he?  She's so gosh darned SPECIAL!!!) or when she suckers some friends into ponying out money so that she can later write about how she saved some Balinese grifter lady's life.      I'd love to see what Liz Gilbert would do if she had to write a book like Barbara Ehrenreich's \\"Nickled and Dimed\\"...where she actually had to go out and do some work and publish something that actually opened up our eyes to the inherent difficulties of most human lives (underappreciated, underpaid, tired, overworked).  Oh let me guess...she'd cry on the bathroom floor until we all got so tired of her we'd raise money and send her to Bali, Italy, an ashram...anywhere, just out of our faces.
0307346617|5.0|World War Z is a well-written book that turns the idea of a zombie infestation somewhat on its head by focusing its attention on the reactions, emotions and struggles of the humans who face(d) the zombies, emphasizing the very real impact such an event would have.    I greatly enjoyed the interview style for the most part, and generally found the characters to be fairly plausible and interesting (a couple didn't work for me, particularly the older Japanese man, though), and some of the imagery is quite gripping, particularly the short description of the Paris catacombs.    Overall, I highly recommend this as a great 'fun' read that also manages to be intelligent about its subject. I'm looking forward to the movie in 2010.
0439023483|5.0|The 74th Annual Hunger Games are soon to begin. The Hunger Games are a fight to the death. In the new country of Panem, in the ruins of North America, each year as punishment for a rebellion and as a control mechanism, the Capitol forces each of the 12 provinces to draw names of a male and female tribute. The tributes are drawn from all people between the ages of 12 and 18. They receive training, are assessed by the game masters and then the betting begins. The games will be televised and are required viewing for the whole nation.<br /><br />The draws are not exactly even though. You can choose to enter your name extra times, for yourself and for family members to receive a terse, a grain and oil supplement from the government. Thus enters our heroine Katniss Everdeen. She is entered this year 20 times as she is 16 and taken the terse every year, for herself, her sister and her mother. Her close friend Gale has his name in 42 times, but this is the last year he is eligible. Then Katniss has the worst fear hit - her younger sister Prim (short for Primrose) is drawn with her 1st and only ballot. Katniss then does the unthinkable; she volunteers to take Prim's place.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen knows that she has at least some chance of survival in the games. She has been secretly hunting in the woods and feeding her family since her father died years earlier. She hunts and gathers what she can with her friend and hunting partner Gale, in the woods beyond the fenced border of District 12. Yet even so, most believe she has just given up her life for her sisters.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta Mellark are the tributes from District 12 for the 74th annual hunger games. As they travel to the capitol they have two mentors - Haymitch Abernathy the only surviving Hunger Games winner from the district and Effie Trinket the Capitol's representative in the district. They will each in their own way try to help them to survive both the Capitol, to win favor with the citizens who can sponsor them in the games, and then the games themselves.<br /><br />This book is very well written, the scenes sharp and crisp, the world believable and detailed. The characters become real as you read. You reach the end and are left hungry for more, which is what you will get as this is book one in a trilogy. The only drawback in my opinion is the lack of a map. I keep hoping for a map of Panem, with the 12 districts, the mysterious destroyed 13th district and the wilderness area's between them. Maybe it is just a guy thing, but I wanted a map. In this book Twenty-four are forced to enter the game zone but only the winner survives. You get a sample online. You can read chapter 1 online but it will only whet your appetite for more. There is also a video trailer for the book you can find online.

055358202X|3.0|AFFC has been derided by some for being the weakest of the series. I happen to agree with that statement, but it's still quite a good book, particularly compared to the vast majority of what is out there. No, it won't provide as many visceral thrills as the first three books in the series did (particularly ASOS), but the quiet tension both above and below the surface still provide a good deal of interesting interplay between the characters.<br /><br />Criticisms; because of the focus on only certain characters, the feeling of missing out on the story of Jon, Stannis and the like is exaggerated ( especially as the delay in getting the next book has lengthened), I also am not as interested in the Ironborn as I probably needed to be, and there's a general feeling that the book is more of a set-up for the rest of the series than a standalone.<br /><br />That's not to say the book isn't good - I think it's *very* good (a 3.5 star book if I could rate it as such, I bumped it to 4 out of affection for the series), but high expectations and the previous three books probably make it seem like less than it really is.<br /><br />*2012 edit*: After reading this a few more times and including ADWD into the greater context, I bumped this down from 4 to 3 stars (it's probably more of a flat 3 star book to me now, give or take). The problems in AFFC were largely repeated in ADWD.
3795753384|5.0|This score is what you'd expect from a German publisher (Schott -- Hal Leonard is only the distributor) -- very clearly and legibly printed on excellent paper -- with the small print in the old men's score in comparison I was hopelessly lost.    Having all parts (including solos) together also helps a lot.    But you lose compactness - you'll have to hold a pretty heavy book in hand, and do a lot of page flipping, so it's not for everyone.
0553381687|5.0|I won't waste too much time on this - the preponderance of highly favorable reviews say it all. Yes, the series is incomplete, so you might consider that when thinking about getting started. Yes, there's quite a bit of potentially 'unpleasant' material in this and the other books, so think about that as well.<br /><br />All that aside, though, this book is a great start to what is already clearly a classic fantasy series - fantastic characterization and immersion in a realistic and intriguing world will do that. Shocks and surprises abound - HIGHLY recommended.
0385340990|5.0|The characters came so alive I did not want the book to end!
055357342X|5.0|If you've liked the previous two installments of the ASOIAF series, then A Storm of Swords is the very definition of a must-buy; it takes the already great plot, characterization and overall workmanship of the previous two books and turns it up a notch or ten.     Be warned, though, several plot developments might result in your book being slammed to the floor or thrown across the room in rage/frustration or (if you're so inclined) wild celebration.
B001DU8T6S|3.0|(Before you read this, just remember this is NOT a negative review)<br /><br />I believe my title of the review says it all... Paul Rodgers influence on this disc is very prominent both lyrically AND musically. So much so, in fact, that the general 'queen sound' is only apparent in the style of how Roger plays his drums and Brian plays his guitar.. otherwise, there honestly isn't much queen influence in the album (apart from some harmonies) both in song writing or in the general feel of the disc.<br /><br />Now before the die-hards start getting their blood boiling, I'm not saying this is a bad thing OR that the CD isn't good..  I'm simply stating that the sound of this much more geared to Mr. Rodgers bluesy, dramatic delivery then the campy, poppy, over-the-top feel of Queen's work.<br /><br />The production itself, in my opinion as a pro engineer, is quite well done... packed with energetic performances from the musicians and excellent mixing and mastering. Personally, Mr. Taylor's drums have not sounded THIS good on record in quite a long time.. The production values alone on this cd merit a listen for the casual fan. ;o)<br /><br />Musically, this album is very much geared towards a more bluesier and dramatic stance that you don't normally see in Queen's work, but is a mainstay for all of Mr. Rodgers work.. It's very much a 'classic rock' album with no if-ands-or buts about it.. and the three don't pretend that it's anything but..<br /><br />This project is very much it's own band, separate from Queen completely.. It's a very good pairing, don't get me wrong.. the songs are great, great production, vocal and instrumental performances are excellent.. but if you are a person looking for the next 'Queen' incarnation, this is not it.. this is 3 like-minded musicians that have a sound all their own.<br /><br />Enjoy you die hard fans! I have! ;o)<br />All The Best,<br />The AndyMan!

0743486285|5.0|I've been a huge Motley Crue fan for many, many years. The very first time I heard Nikki Sixx was releasing The Heroin Diairies, I thought it was just another tall tale of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll excess. I had heard many stories of Motley Crue's debauchery and excesses over the years, and knew Nikki had overdosed and was actually pronounced dead at one point.    I couldn't have been more wrong.     Upon reading this book, I found a much more deeper and complicated series of events led to Nikki's descent into depression and drug fueled madness. His issues of abandonment caused by his father leaving him at a very young age, and being unwanted by his mother and sent to live with his grandparents are all told here with brutal honesty.    Told through his journal entries written in notebooks and scraps of paper, with commentary from bandmates, family members, an ex-lover, and those who were closest to Nikki during the 1987 Girls, Girls, Girls tour, including Sixx himself, this book will leave you laughing, crying, and with your jaw on the floor.     It took and incredible amount of courage for Nikki Sixx to bare his soul and expose his severe depression, self-loathing and drug addiction in this book.     You don't have to be a Motley Crue fan, or even a rock-n-roll fan to feel the impact of this book. It is a bare bones story of a man who had it all-money, success, girls, seemingly everything, only to have his life spiral completely out of control, all the way to rock bottom. He even talks of how the more famous he became, the more he hated himself.     Instead of becoming another Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, or Sid Vicious, Nikki eventually chose the recovery path and turned his life around.     I think this book is a huge inspiration to anyone going through difficult times, be it drug abuse, childhood issues, and/or depression. People can follow Sixx's lead and know that there is hope and a way out. Someone told Nikki that a book like this isn't very rock-n-roll, he bsically told that person where to go. Sixx has always done things his way, and he makes recovery and sobriety VERY rock-n-roll!
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|From what I know of the history of this play/movie the two ladies that worked so hard to get ABBA and others to put this together in GB are now two of the wealthiest women in England - and from what I have seen it drives the critics nuts, (\\"lousy, bad camera work, Brosnen can not carry a tune etc., etc.,) the bottom line folks, this movie fits like that old comfortable shirt your wife (the critic) wants you to throw away because it looks \\"awful\\".  Well, the heck with em, I like my shirt, and I like meatloaf and mashed potatos, and I like Mama Mia, maybe it is mind candy, maybe it does not reach the high brow standard, but it \\"feels good\\" so the pundants can take their \\"expert\\" advise and put it where \\"the sun don't shine\\", this movie makes me smile and who knew Meryl Streep could sing like that - the \\"Winner Takes it All\\" maybe very poorly filmed according to the so called experts because the one I saw said \\"get me off the Merry-go-Round\\" but it sure sent chills down my back - let the experts rave - I know what I like, and this film made me laugh - in times like these I will take that any old time over what the high brows think I should see!<br /><br />PS - as for Mr. Brosnan's singing and why he did the film - straight from the horses mouth -<br /><br />Q. What drew you to this movie? A. My agent called and said, \\"Meryl Streep, Mamma Mia!,\\" and I said, \\"I'm in!\\" I didn't even know who I was playing. I kept thinking, I want to work with this wonderful actress.<br /><br />Q. How did you fare with all the singing you had to do for the role?<br />A. I've never done anything as orchestrated or musically complex in my life. At first, I just made noises. Then I went to London and trained in the studio with Benny [Andersson] and Bjõrn [Ulvaeus] from ABBA. My family let me know that they were very worried for Dad when they first heard Dad sing. But sing I did.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|The holidays become a blur.  We've all been accustomed to seeing Christmas music on display well before Halloween has come and gone.  This idea was given full reign in `[[ASIN:B0019KAQEU It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown]],' with the late Charles M. Schultz's wonderful take on Halloween when Linus gets mixed up between Santa Claus and the famous, fictitious legend who delivers toys on Halloween night.  This is where Tim Burton's `The Nightmare Before Christmas' takes off, but from there all parallels stop, and flair takes the helm for this truly unique animated adventure.    The story is uncomplicated enough.  Jack Skellington (Danny Elfman), an emaciated man who is charming in character and sinister in appearance, is the figure head of Halloweentown, and the key figure of the most anticipated holiday of the village.  November 1st as one might expect, is a let-down, and a down-cast Jack finds himself wandering through a forest all night long.      At the end of his journey, he discovers the North Pole and all the inhabitants surrounding Christmas's festive figure, Santa Claus.  Noting that there is something different abound, he goes back to Halloween Town and brings all he sees back to the people.  Feeling inadequate to convey the warmth of the season, he plots with three mischievous children to kidnap Ole Saint Nick and have the secrets of gift giving unfold for his town.    Embellishing the story are some offbeat characters.  Ragdoll Sally (Catherine O'Hara) is captive to the nasty Dr. Finkelstein (William Hickey) in a Rapunzel-like subplot.       `The Nightmare Before Christmas' could have been a one note wonder, but what I like about it is the charm factor.  In the midst of a cute and macabre background (I'd never thought that would mix until seeing this film.), delightful songs and memorable characters fill the screen.  It doesn't exactly come off like Lucille Ball singing \\"We Need a Little Christmas,\\" but the sojourn from a dark world yearning to be lighter is worth taking indeed.    A J.P.'s Pick 5 *'s =Exceptional    Happy Halloween! ;>)

Ah yes, and for those dumb enough to say you can make a DVD that is 480 lines of resolution even compare to 1080 lines by 'up-converting' it, your an idiot....yes your right, the screen does display a 1080p resolution of a 480 picture, but its still 480, and nothing is changing that, the DVD cant make extra pixels, you cant make data that isnt there....hahaha its like saying \\"dont get xbox cuz nintendo will look better because its being upconverted\\" hahahaha ppl are so dumb....while it may improve the clarity slightly, its only noticeable on the large scale anyway(50\\"+ tvs) Also, DVDs dont have TrueHD (full uncompressed lossless sound)
0060012358|5.0|I have always been told that, as a fan of fantasy and humor, I needed to read Terry Pratchett. And after reading THE AMAZING MAURICE AND HIS EDUCATED RODENTS, I now understand what everyone was talking about. Pratchett's style is simultaneously witty, entertaining, and incisive; he succeeds in this children's book in saying more about society than most adult books ever manage, and he does so while making you laugh out loud.<br /><br />Set in an obscure corner of Discworld, the fantasy world in which Pratchett has written numerous other books for adults, a cat named Maurice discovers suddenly the ability to talk--and not just to talk, but to think and to reason. Maurice believes himself to be the only animal afflicted with this talent, until he discovers a group of rats living in the city dump who have also miraculously achieved the ability of speech and thought. As Maurice is emphatic about his promise to never eat anything that can talk, he and the talking rats get along rather well. Soon, along with the help of an orphan boy named Keith who was raised by a musician's guild, Maurice sets upon a scheme to make some easy money, and the rats go along in their belief that they may someday find a place where they will be free to live as talking rats without the fear of being hunted by humans.<br /><br />Maurice's plan is simple. If the rats will go and infest a town, wreaking havoc for the space of a few days, the town leaders will be sure to call a rat piper to remove the rats from the town. Then it's Keith's job to show up, pipe the rats away, and receive a generous fee for his troubles, one that the rats and Maurice will share. Keith, Maurice, and the rats go like this from town to town...until they reach the town of Bad Blintz, and everything stops working as planned.<br /><br />The story is populated by humorous characters that you can't help but take seriously. Maurice's sly cunning is undermined by the fact that he meticulously questions any rat he comes across before eating it, in order to keep up his first promise to the talking rats. The rats themselves are amusing individuals, self-named after the first things they could read in that city dump where they originated, so that the story is populated by creatures who go by Hamnpork, Darktan, Sardines, and Dangerous Beans. But under these hilarious names, they are at heart a people trying to figure out their own origins and explain the things they don't yet understand about their sudden ability to speak, and what that means for their future.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who's not afraid to laugh, and anyone who's not afraid to think hard about the ramifications of being a person--or rat, or cat--capable of speech, thought, and reason.<br /><br />Reviewed by: Candace Cunardre eating it, in order to keep up his first promise to the talking rats.

0375826726|5.0|Eragon and Saphira have just barely survived the latest battle between the Empire and Varden, and learned the truth about Eragon's parentage. Their encounter with Murtagh and Thorn has made them realize that they desperately need to revisit their teachers in Ellesmera, but their multitudes of promises keep them from returning. They must help Roran recover Katrina from the Ra'zac, rally forces for the Varden, and find a way to thwart Murtagh. But along the way, they'll discover some dark secrets and learn the sickening methods behind their adversaries' strengths.<br /><br />BRISINGR is a well executed follow-up to ERAGON and ELDEST. It moves at a brisk and almost businesslike pace, only dragging slightly near the center of the book, as Eragon and Saphira struggle to fulfill their promises. Readers will be glad to see that the duo, Eragon especially, has not been placed upon a lofty pedestal, and still admit ignorance at times, an element that adds just the right touch of plausibility to the book.<br /><br />Paolini's descriptive writing is becoming easily recognizable, and his ability to draw similes and metaphors between the most unlikely objects only adds to his appeal, and contrary to what one might expect, will draw in reluctant readers. Like with the prequels, the author cleverly manages to sneak in colorful myths and historical stories into the book that only add to the reality and vividness of Alagaesia, and make for a more engaging read.<br /><br />The plot of BRISINGR is a little less developed than its predecessors, and seems to serve more as a segue between the first two books and the conclusion of the lively series, although the revelation of certain secrets and the suspense and tension Paolini weaves into the pages go a long ways in making BRISINGR a quick read.<br /><br />Seasoned Paolini fans will enjoy the story, and be eager to move on to the final book.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  The Compulsive Reader
B001E7OO2I|5.0|I don't usually do reviews for music, but I have to review this CD!!!  I got John Legends first CD about a year and half after it was released and still let it sit on the shelf for months.  But when I finally opened it.  I played it till the wheels fell off!! LOL!!  But I didnt'get the second one. I'm on the prowl for that one now.  But Evolver is HOT!!  Once I heard a snippet of \\"Green Light\\" feat. Andre 3000... I knew I had to atleast listen to that song.  But I just went ahead and got the whole CD!  I can't even name a favorite... \\"Everybody knows\\" is pretty high on the list.  Not to mention \\"Green Light\\"  \\"Satisfaction\\" sounds like a throwback from the eighties and Of course I am an eighties song buff!!!  So that one also hits.  \\"No other Love\\" feat Estelle is real smooth groove.  Makes me want to check out Estelle..see what her cd is about.  I could go on about them all.  But you should get the gist. The title is really on point too. He has evolved.  He may still have some years to go to become a true legend,..... but John Legend is definitely on his way!

Abercrombie is a polished writer and has created some very interesting (and flawed) characters that feel like real people.  Abercrombie also does a great job of world building and leaves you chomping at the bit to read the next installment.  To top it off, the pacing of the book is strong.  An excellent read, and a must read for any fantasy fan.  Highly recommended.

The colors are brighter, the clarity even better and the audio is fantastic - just as you would expect with a great movie in a full HD format.

They're either poorly written, poorly contrived, or just a knock off of some other novelist's formula.<br /><br />But not \\"The Name of the Wind\\", folks. This novel really stands alone with it's head held high. The concept is exceedingly original; haven't we all heard or read accounts of days long past and wondered \\"what really happened?\\". Patrick Rothfuss convincing demystifies a hero, by simply knowing how to tell a story that really confirms the old Truth is Stranger Than Fiction adage.<br /><br />And you know what I love the most? He won't pull a Robert Jordan (whose work I absolutely loathe) on us; he's already written all three volumes, and is having them published at annual intervals.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: A story amongst stories, this will leave you content and salivating for the next installment.
045122499X|4.0|I don't have time to read all 400 reviews here.  But I do find that amazon reviews can be very entertaining and enlightening, my own certainly not included.  Some of the self styled critics in these reviews turn out in depth analysis that outshines anything I ever wrote in college and perhaps they hope to gain employment somewhere in this fashion.  Best of luck, some of you have surprising talent yourselves.    I am one of the many people who have read all of Mr. Follett's books over the years.  He deservedly made his name with those early espionage thrillers, then he seemed to lose his focus or intrest in that genre.    Don't get me wrong, there were still gems and ALL of them were worth a casual read.  Usually Mr. Follett is just not a deep writer, and I don't expect him to be.  He is fast paced and entertaining and that is all I ask of him.    Heck, I read Pillars so long ago that it wouldn't have mattered whether I had read it before or not.  But World Without End, while hardly deep and not as historically intriguing as some top writers might accomplish, is still good entertainment and a very nice daily distraction.  If the plot is a bit predictable, who cares?     Thank you for your books Mr. Follett.  Don't expect the Nobel Prize, but I know you have worked very hard in your life to crank out these books and I will certainly keep reading them.  Hopefully, your publishers have rewarded you well.

B000R7I3LY|4.0|Known to most of the civilized world for her worldwide smash \\"Love Song\\", Little Voice reveals a talented pop songwriter with a lot of potential. While nothing here is as catchy as \\"Love Song\\", all of the songs here are very good. Also worth noting is that this is a tastefully produced album where the accompaniment works appropriately with the mood of each song. The tracks \\"Bottle It Up\\", \\"Morningside\\", and \\"Love on the Rocks\\" are solid pop songs with decent hooks. \\"Vegas\\" has a cool jazz feel while \\"Come Round Soon\\" starts out similar before it goes into its bouncy chorus. The strong tracks \\"One Sweet Love\\", \\"Between the Lines\\", and \\"Gravity\\" are emotional ballads highlighting Sara's soothing vocals.  My personal favorite tracks next to \\"Love Song\\", are \\"Many the Miles\\" and \\"Fairytale\\", which with their arrangements and choruses remind you of Carole King. Finally, \\"City\\" is another strong ballad in both its lyrics and execution. All told, Little Voice is a very good album that is worth picking up if you're a fan of piano based pop music.

031606792X|4.0|For a fun read, I think some of the reviews of Breaking Dawn are needlessly harsh, especially considering the genre and tenor of the other three books. It's too bad a few WTF moments in this story seemed to have cast a pall on the entire series for some readers. However, in all fairness, the implied 'romantic formula\\" promise made in the first book IS fulfilled in the conclusion.  <SPOILERS AHEAD>    Bella gets her guy, she's made immortal, and she and Edward get a shot at happily-ever-after.      What didn't work for me?  I could have accepted a pregnancy, but even in a fantasy novel I still have to buy the plot.  It wasn't the pregnancy itself that bugged me, but the fact that nobody knew Edward could get Bella pregnant that seemed ridiculous. I was thrown out of the story for nothing. Pregnancies of that nature could simply be described as rare and potentially fatal for the human - something to be avoided.  Wouldn't it have been just as easy for Bella and Edward to have been planning to be 'careful,' but get unexpectedly carried away in the heat of the moment?  Thus,  Bella ends up pregnant.  Isn't that what often happens in real life? The vampire code against creating vamp kids and a pervasive practice of societal self-regulation (read: universal termination of these pregnancies) would be  enough to allow the explanation above to fit into the rest of the relevant, and rather convoluted, story line.      For some odd reason, Edward didn't get much of his own story in Breaking Dawn. Go figure. Considering the series is a forbidden love story at its core, that was a wasted opportunity.  Jacob Black was fine in books two and three. But by book four Bella had made her choice, and so had I.  An entire section of the book in his POV, when we still hadn't seen Edward's, seemed out of place and unnecessary. BTW, SM, THIS is the book I'd like to see from Edward's POV. There is so much to work with here.    Jacob imprinting on the baby?  Man, I did not see that one coming.Kudos to SM for knowing how to throw a curveball!  Sadly, the yuck-factor overshadowed the surprise.      Finally,  the big bang final battle ended with a whimper.  While I understand the concept of avoiding a fight and engaging in a mental chess game instead, the story just wasn't set up that way.  Strategy is all well and good, but what's compelling about the vampires are their super abilities (one can only focus on their good looks for so long). Not their brains. I wanted to see the mother of all smack downs and the author led me to believe that I would. That  that didn't happen was my biggest disappointment with the book.      What worked well in the story?  The wedding was sweet and had a enough of a feel good quality to leave the reader, well.... feeling good!  It reminded me of that special moment when being in love seemed to be more important than anything else in the world.  Alice would have seemed less pushy (though maybe the author wanted pushy) if she'd made it clear she 'saw' Bella as loving the big production in the end, but.... I was still happy with the end result.    Bella's first moments as a vampire were riveting and some of the best written text in the series. Simply put, GOOD STUFF.    There was sporadic but effective humor.  Even in the dark center of the story, I had several laugh out loud moments.      Bella finally ended up being the hero instead of the victim. After her needing to be saved over and over in previous novels, I was glad that the shoe was finally on the other foot.  As the mom of a young teen reader, I wasn't thrilled with the idea in the second book that if your boyfriend leaves you, jumping off a cliff or recklessly riding a motorcycle might be how to deal with things.  Yes, getting over the loss of a true love would suck.  But life does go on.  At least it SHOULD when you're 17!  Having said that, it's my job as a parent to teach my kids perspective and self-worth, not an author's.  Still, this thread provided some much-needed balance and I found myself liking Bella more as I watched her finally come into her own. Her well-written characterization anchored the story and the series.    Edward finally 'hearing' Bella was a lovely, full-circle conclusion that was all of warm fuzzies and, dare i say, sigh-inducing.       The Twilight series is compelling, if lightweight, reading. It's pure fun.  And what's wrong with that?  War and Peace will always be waiting in the library, should I want to dig deeper. The ultimate result of Breaking Dawn is that true love conquers all.   I can happily live with that.

1416594884|2.0|Years ago, John le Carr&eacute; was the man who rescued English popular fiction from the dregs of Ian Fleming, Sax Rohmer and their ilk. He wrote tightly-plotted, realistic depictions of espionage and detective work, and his novels were met with instant acclaim and success.<br /><br />Then something horrible happened. It would seem that he began taking all the applause to heart, and he likewise began to believe that any words which issued from his fingertips were at least equal to the oeuvre of Thomas Hardy. It also dawned on him that the world was in dire need of his guidance in regard to politics and diplomacy.<br /><br />The result was that the substance of his novels became thinner and thinner. One could summarize the plot of each successive novel on the back of a postcard -- or on a microdot under the stamp. I suppose it could be argued that he abandoned storytelling in favor of character studies, but unlike George Smiley, his later characters were so shallow that they needed no study, and we were thus presented with piles and piles of (to use a polite term) padding.<br /><br />\\"A Most Wanted Man\\" is obviously le Carr&eacute;'s best novel since [[ASIN:0743464656 The Little Drummer Girl]], but its plot could easily be summarized in one or two sentences. A holy idiot (an Islamic Parsifal?) stumbles into Germany to give away his Russian father's ill-gotten gains, and from page one, you just *knowww* it ain't gonna happen. That's all there is to it.<br /><br />So in place of a story, we get tedious descriptions and each character's history (now known by the ghastly neologism \\"back-story\\"). It is revealed that Annabel, the love interest, had a pony when she was a girl (again with the pony!), and we are treated to her shopping list:<br />Soap.<br />Towels.<br />More food.<br />Sweet and savory.<br />Fresh milk.<br />Loo paper.<br />Russian medical journals: where to find?<br />My cassette player. Classical only, no trash.<br /><br />\\"Fresh milk\\"? Say, as opposed to stale milk? \\"More food\\"? One word is never enough for John le Carr&eacute; if he can jam in two or three, because to him, each of his words are gems, and the more the better. Early in the novel, Bachmann, the top German agent, gives a speech to his cohorts. Such speeches are always a bad idea for a novel, and it should never have been written. No speech at all would've been an improvement; a short speech would've been tolerable; but this speech goes on for 7 (seven!) agonizing and pointless pages.<br /><br />Elmore Leonard famously listed ten sapient rules for writing. John le Carr&eacute; seems to be the anti-Leonard, because he follows an opposite set of rules. For example. Leonard cautioned against using \\"a verb other than 'said' to carry dialogue.\\" Le Carr&eacute;'s characters never \\"say\\" anything; it's always \\"he jabbed\\" or \\"she snapped.\\"<br /><br />Elmore Leonard also warned writers never to go into great detail describing characters, places or objects. John le Carr&eacute; describes everything and everyone in excruciating detail -- not once, but often several times.<br /><br />And most famously Elmore Leonard suggested that writers leave out the parts that readers tend to skip. That would, I think, indicate that readers should skip this entire book.tale milk? \\"More food\\"?

Leonard cautioned against using \\"a verb other than 'said' to carry dialogue.\\" Le Carr&eacute;'s characters never \\"say\\" anything; it's always \\"he jabbed\\" or \\"she snapped.\\"<br /><br />Elmore Leonard also warned writers never to go into great detail describing characters, places or objects. John le Carr&eacute; describes everything and everyone in excruciating detail -- not once, but often several times.<br /><br />And most famously Elmore Leonard suggested that writers leave out the parts that readers tend to skip. That would, I think, indicate that readers should skip this entire book.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Metallica has always enjoyed being on the road kicking serious a** the only way they know how.  With this latest effort (Death Magnetic), they've captured the loud and intense brilliance that's made them one of the most popular metal bands of all time.  Futhermore, they can play this music live and give the fans what they paid for, (music close to CD quality).  For all that are discouraged in the sound of this latest production, I suggest hearing these songs live.  I'm willing to bet you'll come back to (DM) with profound acceptance.  Attaining \\"black Album\\" sound for (DM) would be an injustice to live performances.    Guitar riffs are reminiscent of Ride the Lighting and Master of Puppets and the musical content is somewhere between MOP and AJFA (aside from The Day that Never Comes and Unforgiven III).  Some surprises are the vocal pitch and grit of James, unleashed leads and effects from Kirk, and bass!  There's actually bass in this album and at times it's showcased - way to go Rob!    I am a little dissappointed in Lars though.  I feel he's losing his luster and instead of expanding his own craft, he's too involved in the production of everyone elses - throw Nick Menza or Dave Lombardo in there and i'd rate this album 5 stars.

0684803356|3.0|I began reading For Whom The Bell Tolls directly after finishing a particularly bad modern novel. At first, For Whom... was a breath of fresh air: no long, run-on sentences; no excessive adverbs in the dialog tags; not a whole lot of meaningless adjectives, etc. The dialog was crisp and terse and enjoyable, and the setting was captivating.<br /><br />But then... nothing happens. For a really long time. And all of the flashbacks via thought and story start to get confusing. At times, I wasn't sure if the story was in the present or past; in the thoughts of the protagonist or the speech of another character. And speaking of characters, four of them are strong and compelling: Robert Jordan (the protagonist), Maria (his love interest), Pilar (a tough old woman), and Pablo (a once-great but now tarnished soldier). A fifth character of note is the Gypsy, but the other characters in this ensemble cast are largely indistinguishable from one another.<br /><br />One more criticism: I was really hoping to get a better understanding of the Spanish Civil War and its politics. Maybe I did. But Robert Jordan and his cadre are not hardline Communists nor anarchists (they have special contempt for the latter) but \\"republicans\\" in their fight against the Fascists. Not a lot of background is given as to the roots of this conflict or the underlying motivations of each camp.<br /><br />Overall, I feel I have been enriched by reading this book, and I like Hemingway's writing style (this is my first Hemingway since reading [[ASIN:0743564367 The Old Man and the Sea]] in 9th grade), but all in all, I understand why this has been called one of the \\"10 Books Not to Read in your Lifetime.\\" Also: Did I have an edited version? What was with all of this \\"I 'obscenity' in your milk,\\" etc.?

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Time and time again the PIXAR people hit a home run with their fresh ideas. They have done it here with a story that 6-13 year olds will love as well as a sci-fi story line adults will find stimulating. WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter- Earth Class) is the last of his kind- one of the thousands of robots who were left behind to clean up the world we've trashed. It seems that humans, rather than attend to their own problems and clean-up their own mess, have split. The lovable robot is very diligent in his duties to clean up the earth. He goes about his daily tasks in a very workman like manner, occasionally taking a break to manipulate an object, ponder it's function. Since WALL-E and a friendly insect are the only ones left there is no dialog for the first 40 minutes or so. Even with that deficit the movie is utterly engaging, the animation superb. Eventually WALL-E falls for a female? robot named EVE (Extra Terrestial Vegetation Evaluator)who arrives on earth to look for life.<br /><br />The last part of the story revolves around the descendants of earth dwellers who now reside quite comfortably in space. Spurred on by the monolithic corporation known as 'Buy n Large' the space faring humans continue on with our materialistic and consumer driven lifestyle. When WALL-E shows up on this Faux-Utopia worldlet everything, as you can imagine, becomes chaotic. The movie is entertaining and fresh and addresses big picture issues that the kids won't fully understand. But that's OK they will still find WALL-E's personality to be funny & interesting. As for age suitability I saw this movie twice in the theatres and during both screenings pre-school kids became very antsy before the film ended- it definitely did not hold their attention. This movie is not 2001 but it is not Bambi either.

B0013FYTA8|3.0|Theory Of A Dead Man are a good rocking band. Their hits are catchy, but grow old fast. Too much airplay has killed my views on the singles, but overall not a bad album.

0307269752|4.0|I bought this book because I wanted to try a new author.  The reviews were good, so I took a chance and the book traveled with me to the beach on vacation.  It was a book that I couldn't put down.  I will not go into the plot since other reviews and the publisher do credible jobs of outlining that.  Woven into the mystery was excellent character development that spoke of the human condition -- a style that makes books in all genres much more interesting and allows the reader to feel part of the of the story instead of an outsider looking in.  All the characters have flaws and are living their lives the best they can.  This is what allows the reader to identify much more closely with the entire book.  When the last page came, I was disappointed and wanted more.  The plot closed up nicely, but I wanted the characters to continue.  For me, this is a sign of a great book and a great author who understands what literate people really want to see in a book.  Well worth the money and the read.

The last pages are good and it seems to me that Paolini concentrated all his ideas there.

015206396X|4.0|This one came with such glowing recommendations that I was delighted to see it sitting there on the shelf all shiny and mysterious and earlier than expected on my last trip to the bookstore. Seriously, it seemed to glow at me from within. It could have just been the flourescent light glancing off the cover but, either way, it was a pretty promising start to a great read by debut author Kristin Cashore.<br /><br />GRACELING is the story of a young woman named Katsa. Katsa's life is made difficult by the fact that she is a member of an unwelcome minority known as the Graced. The Graced possess certain enhanced natural abilites such as the ability to swim like a fish or sing like a bird and no two Gracelings have the same ability. These almost superhuman traits set them apart from the whole of society and they are viewed in a highly negative light. Unknown quantities. Not to be trusted. Too make it worse, Katsa has a killing Grace. She can dispatch bad guys like nobody's business. Trouble is she's in servitude to her uncle, a rather nasty bit of work who trots her out to do his dirty work anytime he feels one of his underlings isn't performing up to snuff. Katsa hates her Grace, despises her uncle, and lives in fear of losing her temper one day and unleashing an absolute massacre.<br /><br />Katsa is a steely young woman who has few friends and fewer joys in her life. Graceling follows her struggles to control her Grace, define its boundaries, and find purpose in a world that does not seem to want her in it. Kristin Cashore excels at the storytelling, wrapping her hardened heroine in a cloak of beautifully urgent language. She knows how to pace her plot and particularly how to end a chapter in just such a way so the reader is both satisfied and eager for more. No easy task, that. The climax of this book ran shivers down my spine and the choices the characters were forced to make both broke my heart and made me proud of them. If you are a fan of Tamora Pierce or Robin McKinley, this one is pretty much a guaranteed home run. GRACELING is also the first in a trilogy, although it sounds like the second installment, FIRE, is actually a prequel.ne is pretty much a guaranteed home run.

Also, because it takes place a rather shocking Four Years after [[ASIN:0061245089 Halfway to the Grave (Night Huntress, Book 1)]] and, I have to say, I like that Jeaniene Frost was willing to take that big a leap with just her second book. Most urban fantasy series books take place right on on each other's feverish heels, yet the readers have waited sometimes a year for the second installment, and occasionally I find myself wanting more time to have passed for the characters as well. Add a little more gravitas to the situation. Like we've all grown up a little in the interim.<br /><br />ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE starts out in the middle of Cat Crawfield's new life as a federal agent working for a little known department of Homeland Security specializing in vampire eradication. Having forced herself (for his safety) to leave Bones and her former life behind, Cat has become Cristine Russell and spent the last four years literally consumed by her work, training up a team of vampire slayers lean and mean enough to make Bones proud. Unfortunately, someone seems to have discovered her secret and is leaving clues around her old stomping grounds. Cat and her team follow the clues home to find someone old and powerful has put a price on her head and all the undead bounty hunters are coming to play.<br /><br />I definitely liked the premise of this story and the guys on Cat's team are fun, interesting characters who I hope will stick around throughout the series. The scene where Bones and Cat see each other for the first time in four years was just as delicious as I hoped it would be. And, who are we kidding? Any page with Bones on it is a good one. Make that, a great one. What I needed was more from Cat. She doesn't seem to have grown at all in the last four years. And while I understand she's sort of been hiding from a lot things she doesn't want to face, she's still got this great team of guys who will walk over hot coals for her, and (when he comes back) a protector and lover who will do anything to make her happy, and she still seems to spend most of her time drinking, fighting, swearing, and whining. All in slightly too extreme quantities for me to buy. That's not the Cat I remember.

031606792X|1.0|Better late than never, right? I've got good excuses, though. Had a baby. Was reading it aloud with DH. Snatching moments to read whenever and wherever we could...you get the picture. The problem is, what to say now that I finally finished it. Because the truth is the real reason it took me so long to reach the end is that it was....well....boring. Not just the ending, which was utterly lacking in anything resembling a climax, but the entire story. By the end of Book Two I had been sapped of the will to live. Let alone the will to care about the characters anymore.<br /><br />So, yeah. I'm sitting here feeling a bit betrayed and a bit disappointed. But mostly I'm mystified. I sat there shaking my head throughout the entire third book, my brow furrowed, one sentence on an endless loop in my head, \\"Wh-, wh-, what happened?\\" To Bella who was first and foremost an everygirl and not a superhero. To Edward who was vivid and dangerous and not a mere vehicle for exposition. To Jacob who was a protector and friend and not Edward's best bud, stripped of his will and happy about it. And to Alice who was lovely and awesome and present, not absent and useless for the majority of the 700+ pages. None of the characters I'd cared about for three books were themselves in this final volume. Not one.<br /><br />So set aside the fact that Bella would never name her child that. Set aside the fact that the only enjoyable section (Jacob's) ended in the most absurd (read: revolting) way imaginable. Set aside even the fact that nobody had to sacrifice anything to get their heart's desire (and thus the fact that they achieved that desire is rendered null and void in my mind). The important thing is the characters were not true to themselves. They, like the carefully laid out rules of their world, were summarily bent and reformed into unrecognizable shapes for the sake of providing the bewildered reader with a universal happy ending for every. single. character. It wasn't what this reader wanted and it wasn't what the story needed. But it's what we got.<br /><br />All of this said, I am glad this most unfortunate of endings hasn't tainted [[ASIN:0316038377 Twilight (The Twilight Saga)]] for me in the least.

B001CC7PP8|5.0|- This review pertains to the Psycho: Special Edition DVD-    WARNING: This review may contain spoilers!    Perhaps the greatest thriller of them all was released in June of 1960. Psycho, which was directed by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock, quickly became a cultural phenomenon. Hitchcock shot the film in exhilarating black and white, but he only did so because he wanted to make a horror film on a small budget. Using much of his crew from his television series, Hitchcock was able to hire competent and highly skilled people without having to spend a fortune. He re-teamed with Bernard Herrmann, the brilliant composer, who had done the scores on many of Hitchcock's films. This score, in particular, became so iconic, so famous that it's impossible to separate the music from the movie. Utilizing an all-strings orchestra, Bernard Herrmann's score heightened the suspense so much that many scenes of the film were unbearably tense for audiences at the time. But that was Hitchcock's goal, to unnerve audiences to the best of his ability. Aiding Hitchcock with this fiendish task was ingenious graphic designer Saul bass, who not only created the opening title sequence but also played an integral part in the planning of the notorious \\"shower scene\\".  The film's screenplay was written by Joseph Stefano and was loosely based upon the novel by Robert Bloch. However, the film's screenplay is far superior to the novel, which is not only contrived but also shallow and manipulative.  Starring a superb cast headed by Janet Leigh as Marion Crane and Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the film also featured Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, John McIntire, and Pat Hitchcock (Alfred's daughter). Perkins' performance as Bates is electrifying in its intensity and Leigh is wonderful as the desperate Marion Crane.  Anyone who's ever seen Psycho will find it damn-near impossible to forget the level of tension that's created by the combined talents of the director, cast, and crew.  Upon its release Psycho was a huge hit, in part because of Alfred Hitchcock's clever marketing gimmicks. He specifically told theatre managers not to allow audience members into the movie theatres once the film had begun and he insisted that audiences didn't reveal the plot twists of the film. By doing this Hitchcock intentionally created a media buzz about Psycho, which only brought audiences to theatres in droves. Although given mixed reviews by critics, Psycho was received very well by filmgoers who had never seen anything quite like it. Not only has Psycho become Hitchcock's most commercially successful film, it also ushered in the age of the modern thriller.    The story follows Marion Crane, a financially struggling secretary at a real estate firm, who steals $40,000 in cash in order to marry the man she's having an affair with. As Marion leaves town, her guilt and her paranoia take a tremendous toll on her nerves. She begins to act suspiciously and attracts the attention of a police officer and a used car salesman, but she continues her travels troubled by her conscience. She imagines the reactions of her boss, the firm's clients, her relatives, the police officer, and the car salesman. During an intense rainstorm she decides to top at a small motel. The Bates Motel seems pleasant enough. The manager, Norman bates, seems like a decent fellow, though he has an odd relationship with his demanding mother. He and Marion have a discussion about the trials and tribulations of life and the feeling of being trapped by your position in society. Norman's humility and honesty are disarming, and Marion is weighed down by the burden of her guilty conscience. She decides to return the stolen money and then takes a shower to cleanse herself, symbolically, of her sins. But then the silhouette of an old woman with a butcher's knife appears through the shower curtain. Marion is brutally murdered, and dutiful son Norman is forced to dispose of her body and her car. After Marion's bizarre disappearance her lover, Sam and her sister, Lila along with a private investigator named Arbogast, begin a search for her. But are they prepared for what they'll discover at... the Bates Motel?

B00005M989|4.0|Prince has had a long and varied career as a musician. Born in 1958 to John and Matti Nelson, his career started in 1977 with the release of his first album \\"For You\\". Going through groups like The Revolution and The New Power Generation, his musical style changed somewhat through the years ranging from Funk, R&B, Soul, to Pop, Hip Hop and even Jazz, Psychadelic & Hard Rock. This album, The Very Best of Prince, gives you seventeen of his very best tunes for you to listen to. Gems from his early career like \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\", \\"1999\\" & \\"Little Red Corvette\\" are there as well as tunes from his movies Purple Rain and Graffiti Bridge. Eve onto more recent tunes like \\"Gett Off\\", \\"Cream\\" \\"Diamonds and Pearls\\" & \\"Money Don't Matter 2 Night\\". While the album itself is a testament to his career, there are several gems missing from this album that were favorites among his fans (like \\"Controversy\\", \\"Delirious\\",  \\"Erotic City\\", \\"Pop Life\\", \\"I Could Never Take the Place Of Your Man\\", \\"Head\\", \\"If I was your Girlfirend\\", \\"Take Me With You\\", \\"Batdance\\", \\"Partyman\\" and my two all-time favorite \\"For the Tears in your Eyes\\" & \\"My name is Prince\\"). If you can get past those omissions(which some were his better tunes), this is an album worth getting to listen to for a taste of his greatest. They need to make a second volume of his very best. However, let me suggest this...if you enjoy Prince's music, get all the albums that he has put out and make up your own mind as to what is his very best and whatnot. You won't regret it.
B000002UTY|5.0|Along with the self-titled first album by [[ASIN:B00004U8DR The Doors]], this album represents the best of the psychedelic jam albums released during the late 60s (The best overall album of the time for me would have to be The Beatles' \\"[[ASIN:B000002UAX White Album)]]\\"). Quicksilver dared to do on vinyl what they did live, while most bands offered only short, radio-friendly songs of three or four minutes on their studio albums. This first album by the band is all you need (perhaps along with \\"[[ASIN:B000002TF4 The Best of Quicksilver Messenger Service]]\\") to understand why they are so representative of what was good about the music of that era. \\"Side one\\" on the record is one long jam on \\"Who Do You Love,\\" performed live at the Fillmore Auditorium. That song and \\"Mona\\" (another long jam) were written by Ellis McDaniels (aka Bo Diddly), of which \\"Mona\\" retains the strongest sense of the Bo Diddly spirit that influenced so many bands of the time, including the Rolling Stones and The Grateful Dead. \\"Calvary\\" is another jam gem, but given the cowboy imagery that the band and album art projected, one wonders if they simply misspelled \\"Cavalry\\" for the title, thus mistakenly suggesting a religious theme. Regardless, it's another great improvisation. If you even remotely like 60s psychedelic music, you need this CD.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|It's been interesting reading the early reviews of this album with so many people expressing disappointment because more of the songs weren't constructed more similarly to the debut single, MERCY.  My take is opposite in that I don't listen to the radio much anymore & the stations I DO listen to are either gospel or old school r&b so I never heard MERCY until I bought this disc!  I grew up listening to almost every genre of music which has made me more open to different styles offered today and I also enjoy it when young artists reach back for inspiration -especially when the collection is as good as this one!<br /><br />Although very short (I think it clocked in at less than 45 minutes), this is a very atmospheric, enjoyable collection of songs that does what debuts are supposed to - it introduces listeners to Duffy's voice.  Her scratchy/soulful vocals lend such a believability to the lyrics of the songs and is true to the 60's pop/soul sound. The test for this artist will most definitely be her sophomore album - can they produce something original that doesn't lean so heavily on this particular genre/sound & will people accept that sound & her?<br /><br />Of the 10 tracks, the only two I really felt indifferent about are ROCKFERRY & I'M SCARED.  Again, I like the \\"reaching back to the past\\" sound of the album & the fact that her vocals match the energy of the material.  I would recommend it to those who are enjoying the current offerings of Solange Knowles, Sharon & The Dap Kings, Adele and Amy Winehouse.
0743290119|5.0|I'm not sure I agree with many of the other 1,2, & 3 star reviews, but it might have something to do with this being my first novel read written by Lauren Weisberger.  No, I only saw the movie, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" - never read the book.  So, I had nothing to compare \\"Chasing Harry Winston\\" to as far as her previous efforts.  However, since I thoroughly enjoy mostly 'chick lit', I have to admit that I found this book completely enjoyable and addicting.  I just couldn't put it down!<br /><br />Great read if you like 'chick lit' and enjoy reading about sex, women, juicy gossip, and secrets, then this is the book for you.  It might not be Award-winning, but it is a very interesting and entertaining read.
B000Y1CWDS|4.0|In Spiderman 3 Toby Maguire wears his nerdy, simpy, goofy look. The New York Times (11/1/08) refers to him as \\"a bespectacled nebbish who has been bitten by a radioactive spider.\\" Along with that screwy appearance, he has an enormous ego which his girlfriend Kirsten Dunst finds extremely annoying. His Spiderman persona has made him insufferable because he's so stuck on himself. Kirsten is annoyed because she is trying to make it on Broadway, and she needs a boost. She gets the boot from her show, and he is unaware of it and continues to see himself as the publicly acclaimed super hero.<br /> Later in the movie he is taken over by some meteoric black sticky goo which makes his costume black, gives him extra strength, a lot of sex appeal, and an evil streak. For a time, he's a villain, but the movie already has three other villains to keep the audience busy. Nome of them are evil in the way that the Joker is in the new Batman (2008).<br /> Twice in the movie Spiderman villains seemed to have been dispatched forever, but to my dismay, the villains come back to haunt me, Spiderman and the audience for additional mayhem.<br /> There are three super-villains in this movie: the Sandman, Venom, and the new Goblin. All three of them seem to have good streaks in them as well. The Sandman didn't mean to kill Toby's uncle, and he loves his little daughter. William Dafoe makes a cameo appearance as the father of semi-villain Harry Osborne.<br /> Naturally there's a lot of action with vehicles being tossed around like toothpicks. No deaths of innocents are shown, but how scores escaped death is beyond me.<br /> There are a lot of yuks and campy spots in this movie. Toby Maguire seems ill-suited as the civilian component of a superhero because he's so gawky and dorky. Its comic book origins are kept intact.
0618918248|3.0|Mr. Dawkins is obviously an intelligent man and cites more references than I ever cared to read in one work, but I give him credit.  He is extremely convincing of his arguments, almost to the point of being condescending to anyone who doesnt think like his definition of an athiest.  His verbage is a bit like studying for the SAT again.  Is it really necessary to write that way to get your point across?  I know what those words mean, but if he was so convicted in his ideology, then he would have made it easier for people to understand as opposed to showing everyone how smart he is.  I also thought his \\"victimization\\" of athiests as social outcasts was interesting, and perhaps in some circles, true, but I think it was a bit of a weak point.  His complete rational destruction of religiong as an institution, is absolutely beautiful.  However, his points to disprove Gods existence are only as provable as the controls and variables of any experiment.  It has been proven time and time again, that the impossible has been proven possible, so I think Mr. Dawkins should not judge the impossible so harshly.

Lots of crap blows up, plenty of rah-rah guy patriotism, new oddball sidekick, oily villain, and plenty of corny wisecracks from the mouth of John McClane. It's amazingly fast paced and a few of the stunts were wildly inventive (although the main ones are in the trailer). There's even a scene stealing cameo from Kevin Smith, playing the King Warlock of All Hackers.<br /><br />The plot: Timothy Olyphant as a disgruntled ex-Fed out for revenge (and cash) against an inept Homeland Security that threw him out in disgrace after he kept insisting their computer system could be easily compromised. He secretly recruits a bunch of Uber-Nerds to crack - one by one - different security codes and then eliminates the hackers. Olyphant's Thomas Gabriel then sets about gleefully causing anarchy as the Government is exposed as inept and unprepared. It's up to McClane and Matt, the last surviving Super Nerd (Justin Long), to outwit, outlast and outhack Olyphant and his evil-doers.<br /><br />That's the good. The bad is the usual hokiness (Olyphant's villain is totally without depth) and the overall implausibility of things (a stealth fighter plane being repeatedly unable to hit its target?). After three movies of not having children, John McClane suddenly has a daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). She finds herself in the kind of ridiculous sub-plot peril that Elisha Cuthbert would stink up episodes of [[ASIN:B00008YGRU '24']] with. There are a few nit-picky factual errors (there are no Yellow Cabs in DC, for instance), but that is something you'd only know if you were from there.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Live Free Or Die Hard\\" runs its course with more flair than most, due primarily to Willis' memorable go at McClane. To the filmakers' credit, they didn't try to make him young again, which would have been a mistake. Other than the Lucy Subplot, everything stays on course, delivered with just enough suspense and humor to make it an enjoyable, better than average actioner.red with just enough suspense and humor to make it an enjoyable, better than average actioner.
1593083807|3.0|As a great Jane Austen fan, who has read and re-read favorite like Pride and Prejudice as well as Emma(!!!) I am sad to say this was definitly my least favorite.  It pains me to say this, because I almost willed myself to like it, but in the end I was disappointed with the rather odd storyline and the less-than-lovely characters I was used to from Ms. Austens other works.  Perhaps I'll attempt to change my mind about this novel again in a few years, but for now I'm afraid three stars is all I have to give.
1594489505|5.0|I believe it was Benjamin Franklin who said, \\"Why buy a book when you can go to the library?\\" Well, I agree with him in part. If I'm interested in a book, I first check it out at the library. If I really like it, I return it and then I buy a new copy for my own personal library at home. After reading this book, I had to have my own personal copy. It is such a beautiful story. The love and friendship that develops between the two main female characters reminds me so much of Christ and the church, even though the story is set in Afghanistan where Christianity is not widespread, to say the least. And the emotional strength that each of these women demonstrates is remarkable. I highly recommend this book to anyone, regardless of your spiritual beliefs.
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|I unfortunately did not check the reveiws here before buying this DVD for my neice and nephew.  The glasses are horrible, and the kids took them off a few minutes into the movie because they destroyed its watchability.  In addition to throwing off all color, they didn't even give the desired 3D effect.  Instead you see the same ghosting you would with the glasses off, but with the addition of the color loss.  If you're going to buy this movie, throw the glasses away and watch the 2D side.
0385333846|3.0|I found it to be an interesting story of a man mentally escaping to a fantasy world in order to deal with the unshakable hypocrisy, severity, and useless tragedy of war that he had to participate in at such a young age.  While I never served in Iraq or Afghanistan, being a military member at a young age, I could identify with being so young and naive, having to make some very mature and profound choices. I did not find Vonnegut very funny, however; if you are trying to make a profound anti-war statement, soldiers taking a crap in a latrine as comic relief seems a little sophmoric and out of place.  I did find the irony of Billy Pilgrim's appearance in the prisoner camp funny, however.  It is very suiting.  Overall, I found it a cool, modern look at the impact of the ethics (or lacktherof) of warfare, and the morality and mental fragility of its soldiers then and now.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|The movie was great and the picture quality of the Blu-ray was excellent. When viewing it I thought I was in the theatre.
0439023483|5.0|This book was so amazing; I loved it! The story line was so unique and after the first few chapters, I was hooked. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for the next two books to be released!
B001DDBCUK|5.0|I have watched this at least once a week since its release on dvd. I loved the television series. Even own all six seasons on disc. Great story line and majority of characters back. It never gets old watching the \\"girls\\" having fun and working through their problems together. I wish I had friends like the \\"girls\\" !!!
B000007T1M|5.0|ive had this album for years, and i never get sick of it. im not usually into this kind of stuff... harder stuff. but this... this is just plain GOOD! if you like System and youve never heard this, do yourself a HUGE favor and pick this up. NOW! imo, its their best...
045122499X|2.0|The last book of Ken Follet's I read was \\"Eye of the Needle\\" and it was wonderful.  World Without End and Pillars of the Earth were very long and very well researched and I did enjoy the description of cathedral building, but the characters lacked dimension and were not fully developed.  Just when you think you know them, they do something so totally \\"out of character\\" for the character they have been built up to be, that I found it frustrating.  Perhaps I am being to picky...all in all, it was a good read.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|You can always tell an artist who finds a \\"formula\\" and then works it to death.  That is NOT the case with John Legend's EVOLVER.  He is honoring true EVOLUTION as an artist as he tries out different styles on this album.  I love artists who are willing to follow their hearts and try new and different things.  That is TRUE art.      Greenlight:  I love this song.  I saw John perform this on David Letterman and it really looked like he was having fun!  This song is a blend of a nice dance tune mixed with smooth lyrics.      It's Over:  Kicked back.  Nice.  And we've all been there. :-)    Everybody Knows:  Beautiful.  I love the acoustic guitar mixed with the strings.  This is one of my favorites on the album.  \\"I wish you the best... I guess\\"  This what he would say to the girl he was with in \\"Ordinary People\\" if they broke up at the end of that song.      Quickly:  MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE ALBUM!  (Even John Legend said \\"Quickly\\" and \\"Satisfaction\\" were his favorite songs on the album on 106 & Park!)  The music is strong.  I love the 80's beat and the nice piano throughout.  The lyrics are so amazing... especially with the state of affairs in the world today.  \\"I know we just met but can you love me quickly, I want you to love me like the world is about to end baby\\".  Yowza!  And Brandy's voice with John's is like the dream duet!!!  I cannot wait to see this music video.  It'll be interesting to see how these two beautiful people are put together.  Will the video be serious and worldly or sexy and fun?    Cross the Line:  This song starts off sad but then John seduces his friend to \\"cross the line\\".  John, I'd cross the line for you.  Just sing this song to me and it's ON!      No Other Love:  MY SECOND FAVORITE SONG!  I love this reggae tune!  Estelle's voice is beautiful and works so well with John's voice.  A lot of times when non-reggae artists do reggae I don't like the mix because it sounds cliche but I love the way this song is mixed... the background vocalsare so smooth behind John's clear and soulful lyrics.      This Time:  omg, this song is so incredibly beautiful.  If you've ever messed up with someone in a relationship (who hasn't?) and you realize it after you break up... when it's too late... this song will touch your heart.   Listening to this song is like being inside of his heart and mind when he sees this girl that he messed up with and you can't help but to relate to his regret.  (And remember your own.)    Satisfaction:  This song is very different.  It took me a minute to get into it but now I love it.  I love that weird sound that goes through the entire song. (Keyboard sound?)  It's weird but I actually crave to hear this song.  I'm serious.    Take Me Away:  beautiful John Legend song. :-)    Good Morning:  beautiful and HOT.  I can barely listen to the entire song without wanting to call someone I'm hot for and have a sleepover immediately!    I Love, You Love:  This is nice.  This song reminds me of Bob Marley.  Very soulful and stripped down.      If You're Own There:  I saw John perform this at the piano on Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO) last night and it was INCREDIBLE!!  I keep seeing online reviewers saying that this song is \\"corny\\".  Whatever.  You're dead inside of this song is \\"corny\\".  This is a beautiful song about HOPE.  And we've all become so cynical it's hard to believe in good things anymore.  Personally, I believe in HOPE and I love this song.  It reminds me of the kind of hopeful music that came out in the 80s for Live Aid, Farm Aid, etc.  Why is conscious music considered a bad thing nowadays?  Geesh.  Whatever.  Go Obama!  And go John Legend! I'm out here!!  And I'm singing along with you!  Woop woop!  HOPE 08!

B000V86OKG|5.0|when dexter first came out it caught my interest right from the beginning. i mean the thought of a serial vigilante and an expert on blood splatter analysis for the miami pd is just unthought of. Each season is better than the last. this 3rd season is already better than 2nd. love this show
B0013NS6EU|5.0|This book is a quick study for those who want practical skills that can be applied either at work or school.  Roam skillfully uses examples from practical case studies to illustrate his techniques (which are scientifically based).  I found the application and retention of his tools very easy and useful.    I read the entire book in about a week, a few pages each night before going to bed (of course, with a napkin and pen on the nightstand to practice with).
091581112X|3.0|This is the third book in a series by Sanaya Roman. I tried to keep an open mind while reading this book. I am not a spiritual person but thought that this book had some pretty good ideas. The book is channeled through Sanaya Roman but the words written come from a higher being named Orin who exists on a higher plane than our own. Each chapter tackles a different life issues and ends in a meditation exercise that can be used as a tool to improve upon what the chapter addressed. Five pages into the book you are given a meditation exercise in which you get into a relaxed state and attempt to merge with your \\"higher self\\" and than ask him/her an important question. At first I took it quite literally and expected to be magically transported to some kind of plateau of enlightenment (silly of me I know, but remember, I was trying to keep my natural skepticism at bay, it wasn't easy). Than as I attempted the exercise over and over sometimes for up to an hour I realized that maybe you are just supposed to use your imagination to create the scenarios. Since all of the other meditation exercises rely on being able to perform the first one I could progress no further. The rest of the book is made up of reworded theory backed up through personal scenarios that are only convincing to those that experienced them and the assumption that this book is coming from an all knowing, all seeing source. It contains an exercise similar to what is taught in \\"The Secret\\". You can use light and vibrations to make things happen without actually doing anything physically. She says in the start of the book to abandon any assumptions you have going into the book and embrace it with all of your heart. Maybe for some people this is easy but I couldn't keep the red flags at bay. If this book helps you improve your life and makes you happy I think that's great, but it definitely isn't for everyone.
B00005JLD4|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  The courage and determenation of those 2 girls traveling all that way to get home to their family was amazing. It's one to watch 1000 times and not get tired of.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|I also saw the movie in 3D at the theater in a color version, So thats what I thought I was getting in the DVD version. On the cover of the DVD box, it clearly showed a picture of the glasses on a sticker attached to the box. They were not red and blue but CLEAR. Nowhere on the box does it say that the glasses inside were the red/\blue lenses. Based on the photo I thought they were similar to the theater glasses. When I opened the box, they were the standard Red/\Blue glasses. Needless to say I was disappointed... DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE PICTURED GLASSES ON THE COVER.
B00008RWRH|5.0|I should qualify my views by saying I don't find the early instrument approach to Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven or Berlioz to be more satisfying than great performances played by a modern orchestra.<br /><br />Because of my interest in Jochum I decided to purchase this set of \\"London Symphonies\\".  I listened to one of my very favorite Haydn works, \\"the Miracle\\" symphony, #96 in D.  I was struck by the first phrase of the allegro; here was a reading that surpassed Szell because Jochum wasn't taking himself quite so seriously.  He was a bit faster yet full of glee as the first and second violins rocked back and forth on an octave in the exposition. I had always thought precision to be the key to these pieces.  When I was in college to say otherwise would have been out of the question.  I discovered that I had been fooled for YEARS by this misconception.  They must be played with great ensemble - but the key is an unbridled, lustful enjoyment of the symphony at hand!<br /><br />Its easy to sum up this box set.  Via team work and simplicity of approach, Jochum achieves what Haydn must have - sunshine - both at the core of the music AND the music making; the players seem to be having the time of their lives.  What a lovely way to work.  When precision excludes humor in music all is lost.  I can say that another way.  Listen to Toscanini conduct Haydn.  It is dry and barren beyond any hope of saving.  Of course Toscanini made Rossini sound better than anyone else, but had Jochum done those overtures, I bet they would have been better than the 19th century Maestro. To be fair, too, Szell, in live performance comes to life in Haydn - he knows it must be allowed to live on its own and not held tight in a studio recording.<br /><br />When I wake up  in a less than happy mood, Jochum's Haydn always makes the coming day better; these performances, treasures all, (pardon this) are  a sonic tonic.<br /><br />This Review was written by me 8 years ago.  Nothing at all has changed.  Theflair and zip that exists in these performances along with a savoir faire blessed with tongue in cheek by the maestro (though always in excellent taste) has made these CDs all the more valuable to me over the years.<br />PS:  BUY THE CHEAPEST USED VERSION - 99.9% of the time that's what I do and I've almost never gone wrong. This set is supposed to be a bargain!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Unlike some of the negative reviews the trials and errors of life represented here made it much more realistic and enjoyable than sugarcoating everything with happy endings.  When i watch a scence about wolves i do not want them to walk around and just drink water and sleep.  People focused on the killing seemed to forget that if they did not \\"kill\\" their food they would die.  a nature show that does not show the food chain is just a bunch of animals standing around doing nothing.  I would change nothing about this series.  Perfect.
B000002J29|1.0|love the album/ cd always have. Of my cd collection the cd skips so often I lost count. The second disc runs fine but it is the most broken, disjointed listening I've ever had.
B0012EM5D8|3.0|why everyone loves this movie i will never know.  the human bee interaction in the movie is just strange.  the bee jokes got stale after awhile and the plot had potential then just got worse.    I did not hate this movie it just was not great.  Like a lot of modern day kid movies there are a lot of jokes made for the adults so I will not lie and say i did not laugh but maybe my expectations were a little too high.  the funniest thing about this movie was the trailer on Shrek 2 dvd.  If you own that movie look at the trailer.  I give that a higher score than the actual movie
0756404746|5.0|This is one of the better fantasy books that I have read in a long time. It was refreshing to read after spending the last couple of years reading the Sword of Truth series (I am glad that one is over). Mr. Rothfuss created deep and interesting characters. I enjoyed his explanation of magic and the use of sympathy. He created a new environment and new worlds with original ideas. As one reviewer stated there was no use of the word \\"Dark Lord\\" no mention of elves, dwarfs, or gnomes.  Completing refreshing.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I sometimes wonder what movie the critics see because it rarely if ever matched the movie I see. I paid to see this movie five times and took my daughter four of those times, we LOVE it. I makes you feel good, the music gives you energy, to me the movie made me feel young and hopeful. The loctaion it was shot in was breathtaking, the chemisty on screen was wonderful! When it first came out it was not a trailer that grabbed me and I really had no interest in seeing it, but a friend of mine invited me and my daughter to go with her one night, and I am so glad we did. I shudder to think I almost missed one of the best big screen experiences I've ever had.
0525478183|4.0|Paper Towns is set in Orlando, Florida, where Quentin and his friends are about to graduate high school. He's lived next door to Margo all his life: they were childhood friends, but drifted apart as they grew up. She became a cool kid -- he didn't. So it's a big surprise to Quentin when Margo appears at his window and takes him on an adventure, a semi-criminal romp through town that's almost as much fun to read about as it would be to experience.<br /><br />Then -- Margo disappears.<br /><br />Is she a runaway? Is she suicidal? Quentin, who felt a real connection with Margo on that one crazy night, thinks that Margo wants to be found... by him. And so his search for clues begins.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Paper Towns. Quentin is a believable and sympathetic protagonist, and suspense builds as his search intensifies. The narrative ranges from a wild party to literary interpretation, and it's engaging all the way.<br /><br />I'm dinging one star off my rating for the book, because I felt a little let down at the end. (Don't worry, no spoilers here.) I felt that the author somehow needed to spend another page or two inside Quentin's head during the revelations at the end of the book. As it is, I felt that somehow I got kicked out of Quentin's thoughts and feelings just when I wanted to explore them most. It was disappointing after building so much anticipation throughout the rest of the book.<br /><br />Still, I have a lot of affection for Paper Towns, and I'm looking forward to getting a hold of Green's first book, Looking for Alaska, which is supposed to be excellent!
B001G9FFIQ|1.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a great album, my one star review has to do with this particular pressing of the lp.  For a half speed master, this sounds absolutely horrible!  The signal of the recording is so low, I have to crank my phono preamp so much, that the surface noise of the vinyl is noticeable.  This should never happen, ESPECIALLY on a heavy metal record, where the music should be so loud it drowns out any lp noise.  Do yourself a favor, spend your money on an older original pressing, this one is horrible. I have a UK pressing of this album from vertigo from the early 90s that BLOWs this pressing out of the water, half speed mastered or not.

B001F2W4Y2|4.0|It's been 8 LONG years since AC/DC released a studio album. During the past 8 years, AC/DC's popularity has grown, in both young and old fans, and the anticipation for a new album from the 'thunder from down under' has never been so high.    In 2009 AC/DC finally put the rumors to rest that the album would be called \\"Strap It On\\" and killed the rumor of every other stupid internet piece of BS, and announced \\"Black Ice\\".    Believe me, I am one of AC/DC's biggest fans, and love just about every album and song, but there is something about Black Ice that left me feeling a little disappointed after hearing the whole thing, but bear with me while I explain why, 'cause i'm not saying this album is bad at all, so don't misinterpret me.    A few months back, the first single was unleashed, \\"Rock N Roll Train\\" - At first hearing it, the sound seemed to be that of Stiff Upper Lip and Ballbreaker combined, but more clearer, but also, more polished. After a few listens, the song does grow on you if it didn't grab you the first time, but I knew there would be better to come on the album itself.    Like many, about a month before it's official release, I had found a torrent and was extremely disappointed when i finished listening to all the songs. However, serve me right for downloading, as it was not CD quality, and did not give it's full sound of the album. I was ready to rate the album 2 stars, and say it's their worst album in years, but when I bought the CD on it's release, I was much more happier with clearer riffs, and heavier drum beats.    Skies On Fire - I hated this when I first heard it, I thought it sounded like a filler track, but then it grows on you, as many of AC/DCs tunes have over the years. At first listen, you think it's a remixed version of \\"Satellite Blues\\", then goes into this riff that as I said, I hated it at first, but then it grows on you, and I would love to hear them play this one live someday. I can see Angus doing a little side to side boogie during the riff, and Brian screaming out the chorus, arms raised.    Big Jack - Another one that takes time to grow on you, something about the song is familiar. It's weird, at first listen, I was like, \\"wtf is this about?\\" - \\"why would you write a song named this?\\" but AC/DC prove you don't need it to be a cool name with clever lyrics, you can slap any old thing together and make it rock.     Anything Goes - Even hearing this one in full quality, it doesn't seem like it's AC/DC to me. I could imagine Brian recording this with Geordie, but this one to me really sounds out of place. It's sounds something more like John Fogerty (CCWR) or as some said, Status Quo. It really shocked me that AC/DC are currently playing this one in the live set list! It sounds like classic rock alright, but it's not the kind of classic rock you expect to hear out of AC/DC. The songs ok, but it just doesn't seem like AC/DC. You definitely will not have heard something like this one from them before!    War Machine - This one was released after RNR Train and leaked over the net, a while before the official release, too. It kicks off with a deep bass line that sounds different in tone for what you expect from DC. Then goes into a riff that is pretty much \\"Givin' the Dog a Bone\\" played in a different key. It was another one that I hated at first listen, but it grows on you, and a recent bootleg I heard, this one sounds even better played live!    Smash N Grab - This one is kind of like what I said for \\"Anything Goes\\" there is this sound to Angus lead over the first few minutes that sounded too much like a 60's sounding guitar, but the riff sounds more like AC/DC then what A.G did. When the pre-chorus kicks in tho, I was expecting them to start singing \\"Come into the house of jazz\\" - Maybe this one needs more time to grow on me, but to me, it's a filler, and that's hard for me to say about AC/DC.    Spoilin For a Fight - Every time AC/DC release an album, there is at least one track that I like from hearing it the very first time, within just the first 10 seconds I loved this song already. This one just has AC/DC written all over it. To me, its the best track on the album.     Wheels - The intro reminds me of trying that in D riff they did for \\"Stand Up\\" and \\"The Furor\\" then kicks into what you would expect from AC/DC. The chorus if I had a choice, I would make them re-record it, but it's an OK song.    Decibel - After the first few times listening to this album. Something disappointing me was that there was no sexual lyrics, with that AC/DC smut written to it. Then I listened more carefully to this. And there they are, so they are still writing songs the typical way. This track reminds me of \\"Cover You In Oil\\" in some ways, with a chorus like I said before or, \\"WTF is that named that for?\\" But it turned out, this is one of the best tracks on the whole album. I'd take Cover You Oil over this one anyday, but I could see this one becoming an anthem for pole dancers all over the world.    Stormy May Day - WHAT THE HECK IS THIS????? ANGUS YOUNG ON SLIDE GUITAR???????? No one in a million years expected this one coming. This ones a dirty little blues/rock riff that is surprisingly good for the fact that AC/DC have never used anything to enhance there guitars but there fingers and a pick, and now here's Angus on a slide guitar! And whats even more surprising, the song is great! I would love to hear them do this one live!    She Likes Rock N Roll - It took a few listens, but this one grew on me fast after a first listen where I thought this was the worst on the album. This one also sounds like a riff like Satellite Blues sped up, and there is something about the backing vocals that sounds 60'sish, but it soon didn't matter after a few listens.    Money Made - Actually, I take back what I just said, this was the song I thought was the worst on the album at first. Then like 2 days later, I couldn't get the song out of my head. It grows on you pretty darn quick.    Rock N Roll Dream - I almost cried when I first heard this, holding my head screaming NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO - It was too soft sounding for AC/DC, and it was picked single notes, not a crunching slammed note. And I was just begging out loud, \\"Crank up the volume already, this sounds like a balled\\" - It was very unexpected to hear, especially after what Brian Johnson has said about ballads over the years. But the good news is, the volume does crank up, and the riff sounds more AC/DC. The band is notorious for trying something new on every album, and Black Ice has proven to be full of quite a few surprises. However, If I was producing this album, i'd never have put that 60's echoe to the vocals at the end of the song ... \\"round n round n round n round\\" - May be new, but does not belong on an AC/DC song.    Rockin All The Way - Kicks off like a dirty southern blues number, then cranks into typical AC/DC. No problem with this track!    Black Ice - Ever heard of that band called Jackyl? Their singer sounds pretty much like Brian and Brian even recorded a track called Locked N loaded with them. Well, Jackyl did a song called \\"China Town\\" and I could not help but think this one is some kind of version of it (musically) Something about this song makes me think, ya know, its a good song, it's ok... but why was the album named after this one? Least Stiff Upper Lip and Ballbreaker stood out as contenders for the best songs on those albums. This one ... well.... personally, I think it could have been better. Something about the rhythm seems out of place for AC/DCs style.    The overall album, there where some great songs, and some real unexpected things heard... but... I gotta admit, sadly, this album seems like one of AC/DC's worst albums yet. I know that sounds bad, but to me, even AC/DC's worst is better then most others greatest hits... but to be honest with you, when I reach for an AC/DC album in future, I know this one will not be a top choice.     I'd take Ballbreaker over this one, and then Razors Edge over that and so on, and so on... now, i repeat myself again, don't get me wrong and start thinking I hate this album, what I am saying is as for how AC/DC albums go, this is one I rank at the bottom of favorite albums by them. Some days I can't decided if I like Highway To Hell or Back In Black better, so I might just rank them an equal #1, some days I feel like the lesser known albums, and cant decide if Powerage, Flick Of The Switch or Fly On The Wall is the greater album, so I say there all #1... and that goes on all the time with me for a #1 decision... but Black Ice.... i'd crank out a few tracks, but there is some on here that sounded like they are far from AC/DC's best.     There are tracks on this album I really do love, but i'm just being honest here, it would not surprise me if after the Black Ice tour is over, you never hear them play any of these songs live ever again.    So again, don't slam me with bad review points 'cause you think i'm saying this album sucks. Understand what I am trying to say, it's a decent album, but comparing it to other AC/DC albums, this ones kinda near the bottom of the chart. For me anyway.    Another thing that has left me feeling a bit disappointed is the lack of memorable licks. To explain that more clearly, imagine in your head the first 5 seconds of BIB, YSMANL, H2H, Thudnerstruck, SUL, Hard as a Rock... just to name a few.... within the first few seconds, you know exactly what the song is, and there also guitar anthems, licks that not only sound great, but every guitar player out there wishes they came up with such a recognizable riff. And that seems to be what this album has a major lack of. Rock N Roll train might kick off and someone hearing it would go, \\"thats R N R Train\\" but there are so many riffs on this album that sounded like mid-card riffs, and not the main contenders for the heavy weight anthems.    The lyrics and backing vocals don't seem all that impressive either, RNR Trains isn't bad, but there are so many songs here that when it reaches the chorus, it just doesn't do much for me.     And the other thing I couldn't find, those hard driving riffs that get you pumped up by the time it's finished... those ones that make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, and your adrenalin rise... There are one or two tracks here that got close to it, but nothing on this album seemed to go off the scale, not to me anyway.     However, I won't end on all the negative things, I will say something I do respect about this album... there where tracks on Stiff Upper Lip that sounded good, but at the same time, needed to be sped up a bit. This album sounds like the tempo is spot on for AC/DC, there is nothing here that I thought needed to be sped up, or would sound better if it was played live.... tho, there are a few tracks on this I really do wanna hear live... but only time will tell if they do or not.    the other thing I can say, you won't be able to compare this album to previous AC/DC titles. It's sound is close to that of Ballbreaker and SUL combined, but there is a noticeable difference. It's not that old 70's raw sound, or even anything from the 80's or 90's... it is it's own sound. I would have loved them to use that 70's rough n raw sound, but I do like this new sound to the amps. It's still AC/DC, and when cranked up loud enough, the old songs played on the new tour sound pretty damn good... and RNR Train needs to be heard with the amps turned up to 11 to really appreciate it.
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|I still remember the day the first Harry Potter movie came out in the mall.  I was nearby the movie theater entrance when I heard a voice say \\"The Harry Potter movies first showing is starting now\\"  than I saw a mob of elementary school kids rampaging their way to the theater and I was in their way.  After the dvd came out I decided to buy it just to see what the excitement was all about and I was astonished at how much I enjoyed the movie.   After that I decided to but the first book and have since gotten the entire seven books of Harry Potter as well as the five movies that have so far been made.   The first blur-ray dvd video and audio isn't to much better than the standard version.  Some of the background is a little clearer and sharper but in all not to much of a difference and the same can be said for the audio as well.  The next four I can tell you are a lot better though as those have much better picture quality detail.  The audio choices are also amazing with the next four blu-ray dvds meaning the languages you can select are massive.  You also get a bit more with the extras but if you're like me you probably never really check them out.  So as the prices for these great blu-rays have gone down in price I say either get the entire collection set or just buy the first one and see if you like the movie.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed with your decision...
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This remastering of the Godfather trilogy was masterfully done, it really did do a lot better job in terms of the audio quality, the video is still a little bit rough in some places but is marginally better.<br /><br />It was worth every Penny
B000S0GYRU|5.0|I love horror movies, and this is probably one of my top three favorites. The story is ok, but the way the movie is shot and the technicolor are amazing. this movie is too good.
B001DU8T6S|5.0|As a lifelong Queen fan, I was eager to hear the new album. I have to admit that I did not love the previous Queen + Paul stuff -- it wasn't bad, but Paul's voice just isn't ideal (in my opinion) for material that Freddie sang. But on this album, Paul's voice sounds great. And because the songs are new, I'm not comparing his voice to Freddie's.    The sound is not totally vintage Queen, but I definitely recognize the style. It is part Queen, part solo Brian, part solo Roger, and part new. I am really enjoying it a lot and am thrilled that Brian and Roger are still making new music. A great new album!
1433502410|5.0|I picked up a book that had important Bible verses in various English translations. I have long had the ESV translation among my Bibles, but what surprised me--no shocked me--is that the ESV version in this book comparing various important quotations in the Bible had the most meaningful and clear translation--in that I best understood the meaning of the verse. I always thought the ESV was a great Bible translation, but I thought, or assumed, that the ESV translation was so careful in translating the meaning that it was one of the most difficult to read. I thought the ESV would be one of the more difficult to understand. But as I went through the many translations in this book I found that of critical Bible verses that the ESV had the most meaningful translation to me. This happened again and again as I looked through the various translations of the same Bible quotes. I was stunned that in the ESV the meaning of the verse was most clear to me. I am still in a state of wonder. Some other Bible translations are supposed to be easy to understand.Before reading this book of the various translations, I really did think the ESV would be one of the most difficult to understand because it is not a kid's version, so, of course, I must add that I am an adult, a college graduate, so for kids, I think the ESV adult version might not be the best choice.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I always read the reviews posted before I make a purchase.  So I am writing this to confirm the previous reviews stating what a fantastic movie this is.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Make the purchase!  You'll not regret it!
B0014I4KIK|1.0|Like a  lot of people, I bought this CD on the strength of one song -- Mercy. I've tried to let the other songs grow on me, but after repeated listenings, nope..hate them! Besides, with those pipes why is she singing so many juvenile ballads? I will copy Mercy to my iPod, sell the CD on Ebay, and hope her next one has songs better suited to her spectacular voice.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|I bought this DVD in response to all the princess references on TV and various books that were given to my Grand-Daughter.  This could be a very disturbing movie for children because of the dark theme and magic. Most kids appear to handle the story fine because, in the end, good triumphs over evil and there is a happy ending.  On the second disk, tucked away behind the tea kettle on the menu, is a fantastic music video by Celine Dione and Peabo Bryson, of the title song.
B000TWI7WM|5.0|The second and last issue from this band long since forgotten in the generations of time. If one is not huge in their own time, then anonimity is assured. Too bad, this one never really left the groud. For unascertained reasons these jazz-fusion rockers never achieved liftoff. For those of us from that era though, along with the Roger Dean cover, this is a gem, get it right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKHN|5.0|I bought this for my Grand-Daughter as a response to all the princess books and cartoons on TV.  This is an absolutly classic animated fantasy coupled with great music.  This Disney film is very dark and full of evil triumphing over good but is redeemed in the end.  This could be a very disturbing film for young children but as a result of the fairy tail ending, the kids appear to be unscathed by the evil portrayed.  In the end Good triumphs over evil and they all live happily ever after.

1400063515|5.0|Do you ever wonder if those people we call \\"intellectuals\\" actually exist? Have you ever stayed up late at night thinking about how everybody just seems to pull stuff out of their *ss? Maybe not. But if you have, Nassim Nicholas Taleb will give you a clear answer. These intellectual philosophy types do exist, you've just been looking in all the wrong places.    But The Black Swan is not about the existence of smart people. It is about our view of highly improbable events. Taleb discusses in depth the ineffective risk prediction models that are ingrained in our society. The scope of the book, however, is much wider than this. Taleb manages to pull in observations, studies, and biographies from our past to convey a simple and strong idea.    Imagine an assignment where you are asked to write one paragraph. The subject of your writing can include anything. You are allowed to edit the content and grammar of the paragraph once a week for ten years to make it as understandable and correct as possible. Taleb is so fluent and solid on each page you would think he used this technique throughout the book.    The Black Swan will cause you to think about everything around you from his perspective. If you are not comfortable judging people for being totally unaware of the world, do not read this book. A nice excerpt is Taleb's ranking of intelligent animals (paraphrased): Humans, Wall Street Bankers, Dolphins, Apes...and so on.    [...]
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was good, clean fun.  I'm not a prude and I enjoy some of the edgier action films, but sometimes it's nice to sit down to a good light-hearted family-type film.  This movie has lots of action and humor without being bloody or crude; in today's the cruder and grosser the better world, this movie is truly a welcome relief.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for a wholesome family evenings entertainment; and, as a respite from the myriad of films packed with graphic language and even more graphic violence.<br /><br />Great Fun!
B00003CXCQ|1.0|The dvd I received did not work. I wrote to the company who sent it and told them. They have yet to respond. I am not happy with this transaction.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|This is a great first album! These guys are amazing. After listening to this album it left me wanting more. Just saw these guys live in town a few weeks ago and of course it rocked. Some artists are great studio musicians and sound off live, but these guys are the complete package. You'll really enjoy this debut album!
B001AX9DT0|2.0|Not enough keyboards, horns, and electric guitar, too little of the edgy, brash sounds that lift Ray's voice to the heights of fun. Only the first track, \\"You Are the Best Thing\\" makes me smile. Give me more of the 'Joe Cocker' Ray and less of the 'Dan Fogleberg' Ray.  Gossip in the Grain sounds precious, and listening to it is like eating too much turkey- it makes me shleepy...
B000002B2T|5.0|When this album came out, more than well over a decade ago, I was not entirely unfamiliar with 'grunge' at that point of time (still weaning away from GunsN'R and Iron Maiden), my exposure on the same being restricted to Nevermind and Ten, I had heard about Alice in Chains, but did not give them any serious consideration. Then my friend (god bless him) gave me this album, telling me, it was a collaborative effort by a grunge super group called Mad Season, which had Layne Staley and the usual suspects in the crew.<br />I have worn out this album thrice, based on the number of times i have listened to it. I got the cassette tape first and then 3 times i had to buy cos i wore it out.<br />This album to me represents a phenomenal musical direction, both lyrically and musically, of the member who wanted to experiment. The results are tangible, but apart from that, it was the flow that was perfect. EVERY song is pure gold!<br />My only regret is that Layne Staley, such a talent that he was, (for those of who you do not know, in addition, the cover art also is done by him) was dumb enough to do drugs and passed on at such a young age, when his potential was limitless.<br />If at all my arm was being severely twisted and i was being 'water boarded', i'd have to say my favorite tracks would be:<br />1. Long Gone Day - hands down, THE best (probably reading on Kerouac when they wrote this)<br />2. River of Deceit<br />3. Wake up<br />I doubt that there are those who have not heard this, but if you have not, please do pick it up and give it a listen. Its unreal and a setlist of songs that will give you that thing to reflect and introspect.
0810993139|5.0|I teach 4th grade in an inner-city elementary school, and this book gets top marks from me for one primary reason:  the kids in my class love reading it!<br /><br />The fact that my diverse class can be so excited by one single book is a small miracle, but the simple illustrations and related storylines have captured the imaginations of my students, who are have been hard at work on their own journals since the school year began. I am going to start reading a similarly styled, but slightly more highbrow book, \\"The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole.\\"<br /><br />Believe the hype about this book!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Not a spoof.  The admitted goal of this movie was the be a comedy AND a zombie movie, and in that respect they nailed it.  They don't make fun of zombie movies, they make fun of life, love, and death.  One of the few horror movies that works as a date movie.  Simon Pegg knows funny, but the entire cast gets a turn to shine through as well.
055358894X|5.0|Imagine Fritz Lieber working with Glen Cook, and Harry Turtledove as a contributing consultant...   I'm very impressed.  This has massive amounts of imagination in a world-system that often surprises, as fantasy with SF overtones.  Certainly this follows Clarke's Law, stuff in here presented as 'magic' sure feels like 'sufficiently advanced technology' from a prior civilization :-)  Sure, as a first novel there is probably room for improvement, but I ripped through this in one reading, something I have not been able to do with lesser works of this length.      Tomorrow I'll start on the sequel.  And another reviewer mentioned this has been optioned for a movie, this has real potential in that direction as a very visual book with lots of dialog.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Christopher Nolan is a genius. He very well may be the most talented person in Hollywood.  His realistic vision of the Batman franchise is remarkable.    \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a gritty crime drama that doesn't disappoint. This is easily the best movie of 2008 and possibly the best movie of all-time.  The story, direction, and acting are all perfect.  Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is truly phenomenal, which leaves you in awe. It is truly sad to lose such a talented actor.    The blu-ray should look and sound fantastic.      A DEFINITE MUST-OWN!!!  10/10
B0012GMWCU|5.0|Frank John Hadley (the official reviewer)... What can I say - you're a very, very sick person. Healing yourself with the music won't do you any good now. What you need is a professional (medical) help - psychiatric treatments, deaf aid etc. Or at least consider the advantages of a suicide.<br />After so many versions that we heard from others, THE BOSS himself decided to show us what these songs should sound like. And that's it. Not to mention his part in song writing, producing and the powerful bass playing. What can I say regarding his voice? Pure energy... The guy clears his throat and it's as big as a house. The expression is one in a million.<br />Do I recommend this item? Absolutely. Just looking at the track list is a reason enough. Too bad nobody thought of doing the proper remastering to this day.
0061122416|1.0|Twenty Million copies sold worldwide? Laughable. This book is nothing more than ridiculous platitudes and cliches about having the courage to go for you dreams, and it's boring to boot. Go out and make your dreams come true; you don't need to waste one second of your life on this book as it won't help you in the least.
B0010X73ZG|1.0|If you're looking for an intelligent and interesting horror film... TURN AWAY NOW. The Mist is as cheesy as it gets. It's a poor attempt at horror filled with supersized bugs and a not-so-scary fog. This movie was so far-fetched and the reactions of characters were so stupid, my whole family was yelling at the tv as we painstakingly pushed our way through it.     The beginning was captivating and interesting: A huge storm that caused lots of property damage and an unexplainable fog coming from the Military base, prompting thoughts of chemical warfare. Cut to everyone trying to stock up on supplies in a grocery story post-storm. Next thing you know all hell breaks loose as bloody people are running towards the store screaming.     Then the story takes a sad turn as children cry for their mothers, and a mother insists she must leave to get home to her children. A   crazy religious women begins to get nutty and curse everyone in the store for begining God's wrath, and the story starts to turn into a super-sized bug \\"God's Wrath\\" version of \\"The Reaping.\\"     I'm not sure what turned me off more: the stupid hick men sitting around looking shocked not bothering to close the loading dock door as a teen gets pulled under and torn apart, the same stupid men turning on all the lights in the store inticing huge bugs to land on the window, keeping the lights on as larger bugs break in and kill people, a few of the stupidest men setting the store on fire by accident trying to kill said bugs, or these same stupid men leaving the store to get medicine next door, and then just stairing at the spiders as they multiply and attack them with acid webs. Or maybe it was the overly dramatic and completely idiotic religious psycho who somehow magically convinced everyone that it was the end of the world (where as previously everyone hated her). All that said, it didn't even compare to the pathetic and stupid ending that made me declaire I'm never watching another Stephen King movie again.
B001JQK0TA|5.0|I'm going to start with a caveat videor (\\"viewer beware\\", in my horrendous Latin. To quote Harry Dresden: \\"Darn correspondence course.\\"): the story deals with the somewhat gruesome origins of Hallowe'en, at least according to the Romans' account of Samhain (which may be biased or exaggerated to make the ancient Celts seem more brute-like), and the Big Bad of the week is a powerful demon named Samhain (pronounced \\"Sam-hain\\", not \\"sow-WHEN\\" like the Pagan/Celtic festival).<br /><br />Aside from that, another top-drawer episode in a season that has been taking this series to greater heights. A new angel has joined Castiel, one Uriel, who gives me a definite \\"bad cop\\" vibe to Castiel's \\"good cop\\". The atmosphere is terrific, and the conversation between Castiel and Dean gives us an insight into both characters as they continue to evolve, as well as how angels work in this universe. It's nice to see angels cast in a very different light than what we're used to. These are not Martha Williamson's kinder, gentler angels, these guys are closer to what angels are really like: powerful beings in the middle of a war with the powers of darkness.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|Enjoyed the pace of the movie.  Plenty of action. Lots of fun watching with a subwoofer system.
B00150B2SS|5.0|I spent 35 years in the intelligence business. Unlike the hero of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, I dealt with mostly technical issues. I had a couple of dealings with the British and I came away from both thinking that a Brit with his brain, a pencil, and pad of paper routinely made an American with all his technology look brutishly impoverished in comparison. Much the same as Einstein or Isaac Newton, similarly armed, makes your typical modern scientist awash in super computers and wonders of technology pale in comparison. I also thought to myself I better check my wallet and my brain to see what's missing after the Brit departs.     This book is perhaps the most superb description of British intelligence ever written. It's hero, George Smiley, true to form of the British \\"Circus\\", a term used to mean the British equivalent of the CIA during the Cold War, is the the very essence of a top level British civil servant. Smiley is uncannily smart, bookish, well educated, and gifted with an incredible memory. Because of his basic decency, he first appears an apparent puppet and fool whose strings are easily pulled by the cynical, brutish, and typically over-educated and socialistic leaning associates who work in the Circus. George Smiley will go down in spy novel history as the epitome of excellence in a cesspool of deception. Smiley's political heart is still entwined with the British empire, then rapidly falling apart. His colleagues remind me of the typical East coast Ivy league American liberal, only worse. They are all socialists, but it is obvious, that like the East coast Ivy league liberal, they see their role as the eventual caretakers of the proletariats whose existence they loftily propose to change for the better. And like most such people they are as deadly as kraits. Of course, a left-leaning East coast liberal pales as a threat to the American way of life and average American's financial status compared to a hedge fund executive, derivatives specialist, orWall Street crook, as we have recently learned.    The novel begins at glacial speed. Even the audiobook version tries your patience with the slow beginning which at first glance appears to have nothing to do with any spy story. This, turns out not to be the case, and Jim Prideaux is the very center of what is happening, and more important, why.     People in Smiley's world are superb \\"caricatures\\" of British intelligence agents. Their methods and cruelly pedantic administrative practices are most perfectly described by Le Carre, who knows the world of British intelligence first hand. The Circus seems to feed on documents with minutes, addenda, and distribution lists which are quintessentially the product of the well educated and bureaucratic English mind. Smiley, at the start of the novel, has been given the boot from the Circus. He is brought back because, an Australian agent who is street wise and \\"lower class\\" has learned what has escaped the brilliant minds of those who run the Circus, that they have been penetrated by a \\"mole\\", i.e. a Soviet agent who in real life is similar to Kim Philby in his ability to use British upper class pretensions and trust in the \\"old boy\\" network to pull off the major espionage coup of the early years of the Cold War.     In any event, the book, with exquisite precision, unveils this deadly battle of wits between Smiley and the nest of vipers who battle for power and glory at the upper levels of the Circus. Unlike the real life farce of Kim Philby who made at total fool not only of British intelligence, but also our own CIA's fly-fishing pal and idiot counter-intelligence chief and Anglophile, James Jesus Angleton. Philby, despite being uncovered for what he was, escaped to live out his life in the hell of the reality of the socialist world, Moscow. Fortunately, the mole in this book meets a more deserved end.    Due to my impatience and habit of skipping ahead, I have not read this book. The book is a prize for the patient and meticulous readers, who like Smiley, miss nothing.On the other hand, I have seen the DVD of this story twice, and am on my third listening of the audiobook. It just gets better each time as Le Carre weaves his masterful tale. Alas, we have no such genius as Le Carre to describe the vipers who existed in America's CIA, FBI, and US Navy such as Aldrich Ames, Robert Hannsen, the Walker family, and far too many others, probably many of whom remain unknown. It is unclear to me which group of traitors was the most dangerous.

B000068QY7|2.0|Oasis fans at Amazon and other forums must be drugged up when they claim Heathen Chemistry is a \\"return to form.\\" Personally, Standing on the Shoulder of Giants was by far their best produced album that might have been a let down in terms of lyrics (I can see a liar, standing by the fire; put yer money where mouth is), but it was their most emotionally charged work in tough times. Consequently, Oasis attempted to regain their lost swagger and not give a damn about the album's production by producing it themselves. The aim of making a 21st century \\"Definitely Maybe\\" fails pathetically with filler after filler. Even the singles (especially Little by Little and She is Love) plod along with little emotion that should of been released as B-sides. Gem and Andy's contributions are crap with the useless instrumental \\"a quick peep\\" and generic rocker \\"hung in a bad place.\\" Shockingly, its Liam's songs that provides a short spark for the band with the tender \\"songbird\\", the Lennon-esque Born on a Different Cloud(might sound too familiar with Happiness is a Warm Gun, at least in terms of structure), and the gritty closer \\"better man.\\" There's absolutely no doubt that Heathen Chemistry is a weak effort from Oasis to reclaim their brilliance found in DM and WTSMG, but Oasis fans should realize how vastly underrated SOTSOG was when comparing the two.
B0008ENICU|5.0|delivery was surprisingly fast and movie in good condition. this version is, undoubtedly, much more entertaining than the recent re-make of the movie.
0385340990|5.0|I LOVE this book! The story itself is wonderful but how it's written is the best! Written in a series of letters between several of the characters is a FABULOUS concept! It makes me long for a good old fashioned hand-written letter! Read this book!

B0002YJ29O|5.0|Having been a piano junkie for decades, this is probably the easiest and shortest review I will ever write. Anyone with the slightest interest or affinity for piano playing should not only find enormous pleasure in this DVD but also get a yearning appetite for more. To all you other piano junkies out there, beware this is heavy stuff, likely only to deepen your addiction; if not, you're probably in rather deep trouble. Okay, let me spell it out: shouldn't you get high as a house on the 8-piano Walk&uuml;renritt, you're in serious need of help.<br /><br />To quote the essence of the vast majority of Amazon reviews: 'Buy this now!' Oh, by the way--this one actually fits the bill. So, don't be ashamed--just start indulging yourself in the greatest pianistic feast of the decade.<br /><br />[The greatest of thanks to my fellow countryman, Martin T:son Engstr&ouml;m, for conceiving this unforgettable birthday party.]
B0016PM722|5.0|This is my first \\"Force FX\\" lightsaber, and I must say that I am completely satisfied. It lights up and shuts down realistically, with accurate sounds. It also makes noises when you move it around, and of course when you strike the blade on something. I don't know how good the Master Replicas were, but I'm sure this is just as good, if not better.
B001JYQEP6|5.0|Simply put, this reissue, while not boasting anything shockingly revelatory, is nevertheless an illuminating glimpse at how the album was made and is essential for any true fan of the Clash. This is particularly true because it has been so long since any unreleased material has surfaced, even on bootleg, so it would have been a delight to hear something, anything, new. Fortunately, The Vanilla Tapes are very good, at least when judged against the standards of rough rehearsal tapes. Keeping in mind that these are low-fidelity recordings mainly consisting of the band working out new songs, this is very enjoyable stuff. What's interesting about these rehearsals -- and, excluding a stab at \\"Remote Control,\\" all but five of the 21 tracks on The Vanilla Tapes are rehearsals of songs that wound up on the finished LP (some of these boast different titles: \\"Paul's Tune\\" is \\"The Guns of Brixton,\\" \\"Up-Toon\\" is \\"The Right Profile,\\" \\"Koka Kola\\" is expanded to \\"Koka Kola Advertising & Cocaine\\") -- is that the Clash began with arrangements that were quite similar to the finished versions; they were a little ragged, sometimes a little slower, sometimes with slightly different lyrics (as on \\"London Calling\\" itself), but their sinewy musicality is as apparent here as it is on the vinyl. While it may disappoint some listeners that there are no forgotten classics among these five previously unheard songs, that doesn't mean they're not enjoyable. \\"Lonesome Me\\" has an appealing country bounce; given time, \\"Where You Gonna Go (Soweto)\\" could have been worked into a fine piece of white reggae, as could their reinterpretation of Bob Dylan's \\"The Man in Me\\"; \\"Heart & Mind\\" is a pretty impassioned, catchy piece of punk-pop that's distinguished by Joe Strummer breaking into the One O Oners greatest hit \\"Keys to Your Heart\\" in the coda. None of these songs are better than what wound up on London Calling, but they're all excellent outtakes on a CD that does qualify as a major historic find for rock historians. The video on the DVD is nearly as noteworthy, particularly those 13 minutes of home movies of the Clash and Guy Stevens in the studio. The accompanying 30-minute documentary takes highlights from this video, threading them between interviews conducted for the long-form Westway to the World documentary, winding up as an effective look at the making of the album (as are the fine liner notes in the lengthy 36-page book). Still, there's nothing quite like eavesdropping on a great band working with a madman producer. Stevens steals the show, as he storms around the studio, throwing ladders, throwing plastic chairs, banging chairs against his head, motivating Strummer during a vocal session, and conducting the band during a rehearsal. Throughout it all, the Clash are cool and unflappable, never letting Stevens' shenanigans affect them. It's a rather amazing piece of archival footage, and it's just the icing on the cake on this splendid reissue. It's fitting that an album that truly deserves an expanded edition not only gets the deluxe edition it deserves, but one that makes a convincing argument that the sometimes ridiculous practice of expanded, multi-disc editions has a purpose after all.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Excellent. \\"State of Play,\\" is without question one of the best written television thriller, adult-oriented (and I don't mean sexual content) I've ever seen. (And it's certainly in the running for the top honors.) I haven't been this satisfied by a political suspense thriller since I saw \\"The Lives of Others\\" (Germany, 2006 - winner of the Oscar for Best Foriegn Language film, 2006). Yes, \\"State of Play\\" is that good!
B001D08SK0|5.0|I have many thousands of 78s, cassettes, CDs, open reel tapes, just name it, but I have never seen such a perfect reissue. The music, we know it, but the package, rare photos, unissued takes makes this one simply the best reissue I have ever seen (and I have seen many of them). Enjoy it, like I have done.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|I own this movie and it's one of those that I put on my dvd once a year.  I've never grown tired of this classic story.  Gwyneth is terrific in this.  It's about finding love in the oddest of places.  It's about judging people and making false character analysis.  It's about making things right with good friends.  And it's sweet and fun all wrapped up.  I loved this movie and anyone who loves Jane Austen will like it.
0375826726|2.0|When I found out that the Inheritance trilogy will have a 4th book, I thought to myself \\"Please god, let it not be another Wheel of Time series\\".  After reading Brisingr I can say - Wheel of Time it is not, as the descriptions and dialogues in the book are quite immaturish compared to the wonderful but unnecessary descriptions and dialogues in Wheel of Time.      First problem in this book, unlike the first two it seems to be a dialogue driven rather than plot/story driven.  Everybody seems to talk a lot, pages upon pages and sometimes going into ramblings.  Eragon and Saphira conversations are so childish, I snickered at times, and yes they are pages long.    Second problem, and this is a problem of many fantasy series, the plot branches out into totally unnecessary areas.  Dwarven king election drags on forever, although the result is quite obvious; Eragon debates should he eat meat or starve to death, and then the guilt he feels after eating the meat - is that really necessary?    Third problem is the new explanation who is Eragon's father.  Eragon now seems less interesting and more one-dimensional as a character.      I do not want to go into nitpicking but there are many patch works in the books.  So I was disappointed.  It is ok as it manages to move the plot forward but I really hope the forth book is the final one of the series.

B000LPS47U|5.0|Re-Animator is too creative and too well planned to really be a B-movie, but it goes to great lengths to cram every element of a cheesy exploitation film into one outrageous horror-comedy. Nudity, undead monstrosities, extreme gore, mad scientists and jump-scares creep around every scene, and the horrifying re-animated are perfectly presented with over-the-top blood effects and hilarious dialogue. It's one of the greatest of all B-movies, and a near perfect combination of humor and fright.<br /><br />\\"I gave him life!\\" exclaims Dr. Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) after bringing back to life the deceased body of esteemed Doctor Gruber. Like a cold and calculating Frankenstein, West has created a re-animating agent that can defeat brain death - but with startling consequences. After being kicked out of his independent research experimentation in Switzerland, West journeys to Arkham, Massachusetts where he moves in with brain surgeon hopeful Daniel Cain (Bruce Abbott). Daniel and his girlfriend Megan (Barbara Crampton) are uneasy with Cain's isolation in the basement, but make the best of it until they accidentally witness the re-animation of their very dead cat Rufus.<br /><br />After confronting Dean Halsey, Megan's father, Daniel is met with immediate skepticism. Demanding a rescinding of Cain's school loans and the expelling of West, Halsey intends to silence the two young rebellious scientists and their tall tales. But when a secret rejuvenation experiment ends in Halsey's death - and subsequent re-animation - the mischievous duo find themselves the target of the twisted Carl Hill (David Gale) who wants to steal the secret of everlasting life for himself.<br /><br />Opening beautifully with a hilarious bit of schlock scares and a twist on the theme music from Psycho, Re-Animator proceeds to do everything right in building a perfect exploitation B-movie. From the greatest scene transition ever (Megan cooing \\"no, no, no\\" when Dan tries to kiss her in the hospital hallway to a shot of her screaming \\"yes, yes, yes!\\" in bed), to awkward close-ups of West's scowling face, to delightfully bloody brain surgery (it's like peeling a large orange), each moment is brilliantly placed. No shot is wasted, and no scene goes without mustering uneasy laughs as ultra-gory bloodbaths frequently linger.<br /><br />Whether it's a shovel decapitation or unbelievably [..] sexual deviancy, Re-Animator knows when to toss in extra weird ingredients, unlimited gross-out gore, and the insanely creepy Dr. Hill. Director Stuart Gordon and his wonderful cast of oddball characters know how to get the right reactions out of audiences with suspense, cheesiness and hilarity. Everything manages to work for this low-budget bloodbath, even when the side effects for re-animation include telepathy and telekinesis, and characters are attacked by stuffed animals. It's creative and over-the-top like Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, with thrills and laughs in equal measure.<br /><br />One of the greatest of its genre, Re-Animator feels like it's trying to intentionally be more of an expected low grade exploitation schlock, and outdoes itself with creativity and first-rate makeup effects. Pioneering a cult franchise, this original landmark in horror-comedies is a refreshing take on a classic tale of science gone too far.<br /><br />- Mike Massiereaming \\"yes, yes, yes!\\" in bed), to awkward close-ups of West's scowling face, to delightfully bloody brain surgery (it's like peeling a large orange), each moment is brilliantly placed.

0060837551|5.0|Thorns Birds is a masterpiece.  One of my favorite all time books.  You will not be disappointed.  It's a beautiful story about love, loss, revenge, ambition.  I don't know if I can put it into words how magnificent this story is.  Meggie and Ralph are two very different people who are obsessed with each other.  Their love is so amazingly yet they cannot be together for so many different reason partly it is because for Ralph, a Catholic priest, is married to his first love which is the church.  His ambition drives a wedge in this relationship and forces Meggie to hide secrets that will ultimately shatter her lover, Ralph.  What can I say, this book has it all, death, tragedy, love, lust, obsession, melodrama, fights, struggles, etc.
B001F12J3Y|3.0|Haven't watched the entire movie yet in 3D, but from the few minutes that I have watched, the 3D quality is not what I had expected. One would think that after decades of motion picture improvements, that 3D technology would be included in all recent releases. For instance, I have viewed just a few minutes of Journey to the Center of the Earth in 3D and I also had the pleasure of seeing it also on the big screen in 3D. What a marvel. Two huge thumbs up for Journey in 3D. However, I cannot say any thumbs up for Polar Express. If you watch the extras from the standard featurettes, you could see there was an awful lot of hard work to put this motion picture together. However, when you see the actual 3D version of this movie, one's expectations is greatly reduced. So if you have a high quality set of 3D glasses that is configured for the distortion of the 3D affect of the picture, then I would suggest watching the 2D version. This way, you can still enjoy the movie and not be disappointed.<br /><br />Here's what I was able to see during the first few minutes of viewing the 3D version. First, the depth of the imagery wasn't as displaced with using the issued 3D glasses that also shipped with the package. During the movies, one could see the over shot of \\"Red\\" beamed off to the left of the objects centered. Meaning you STILL got a blur when viewing the movies using the \\"CHEAPLY\\" made 3D glasses that was shipped with the DVD. IF you must experiment with the 3D version, recommend buying a higher quality version of the 3D glasses. I plan to buy a higher quality 3D glasses that are configured for this DVD. BTW, the 3D glasses that come in the Journey to the Center of the Earth movies is not compatible with Polar Express 3D. And if you kept the 3D glasses that you watched JTCE from the big screen, they don't work either. So with this being said, I give the 3D version a big fat 3 stars. Only because there is a little bit of 3D affect and the quality of the story itself rates a star, but nothing more than that.<br /><br />A message to the film makers. If you are going to support the high expectations of your audiences, then spend a nickel to buy better quality 3D glasses that can better support your movies in 3D.<br /><br />A message to the general public. Anyone got a decent pair of 3D glasses they want to sell?<br /><br />Ya'll have a good one!ut nothing more than that.     A message to the film makers.

0783227434|4.0|While Evil Dead attempted to be a serious horror film, and the sequel merged over into sillier thrills, Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness (also known as Bruce Campbell vs. the Army of Darkness) capitalizes on pure schlock. It takes every element that was terrifying in the pokerfaced original and turns it into pure comedy. And what a brilliant decision, as Army of Darkness has since gained a cult classic status and an unbelievable following. Hilarious and unexpectedly adventurous, this horror/comedy is like Indiana Jones meets Sinbad in the three worlds of Gulliver.<br /><br />S-Mart department store clerk Ash (Bruce Campbell) is being dragged to his death after getting transported through time to 1300 A.D. with his car and a shotgun. He narrates the events that led up to his capture by Lord Arthur, which include the battling of possessed demons from the first two movies Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2. The Necronomicon, the book of the dead, is responsible for his arrival in medieval times, and he must seek it out once again to return him back to the present. Along the way he'll have to unite Arthur and his nemesis Henry the Red (\\"well, hello Mr. Fancypants\\") to defend a kingdom against an undead army of darkness.<br /><br />Considering that the second film in the Evil Dead trilogy is actually a remake of the first, the events that are recapped at the opening of Army of Darkness hardly matter. The entirety of this film is directed in a humorous manner and for the first time is completely intentionally cheesy. Spotlighting on Ash's signature bad one-line insults and quips, Army of Darkness never surrenders a chance to crack a joke.<br /><br />Having lopped off his hand previously, Ash wields a chainsaw mounted on his bloody stump and at one point builds a mechanical metal hand before journeying in search of the Necronomicon. He also makes use of his legendary \\"boomstick\\" shotgun to frighten the primitive screw-head natives in a clash of time-disorienting cultures. The slapstick and gags that arise from his hilarious confrontations with medieval warriors and various possessed creatures are constant - he fights an army of mini-Ash's like a sadistic Gulliver, duels an evil version of himself like an accelerated mutant version of Richard E. Grant in How to Get Ahead in Advertising, combats a pit witch like Luke Skywalker with Jabba's Rancor (and escapes via his belt like a tongue-in-cheek Indiana Jones), and melees all sorts of skeleton warriors like Sinbad on crack.<br /><br />Stop-motion animation, priceless makeup effects and dated CG account for much of the film's splendid nonsense, and equally striking prosthetics, gunpowder-making training montages, and epic medieval battles account for the rest of this unpredictably swashbuckling horror-adventure. In his own way he's still a king, as Ash recounts at the still-jesting conclusion, and in its own way Army of Darkness is the king of cult classic laugh-a-minute horror comedies.<br /><br />- Mike Massiefrom his hilarious confrontations with medieval warriors and various possessed creatures are constant - he fights an army of mini-Ash's like a sadistic Gulliver, duels an evil version of himself like an accelerated mutant version of Richard E.

0143038419|5.0|I don't think everyone will like this book.  There's lags in the book.  Some parts over dramatic, other parts overly detailed however, this is one book that I will never forget.  Elizabeth Gilbert has faced some incredible lows in life.  I find her ability to rise above the situation inspiring and for me, I take from it, the realization that life can continue when you've lost it all.  I love one of her tales on the power of prayer.  It's beautiful.  How can you not be uplifted by her journey.    It's flawed but so INSPIRING.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|As P!nk takes the listeners on a ride once again with her new release.  Aptly titled \\"Funhouse\\" this cd is just that from start to finish.  As she sings her way through her troubles as only she can.  With songs worthy of a few listens:<br /><br />\\"It's All Your Fault\\"<br />\\"So What\\" (the first single)<br />\\"Crystal Ball\\"<br />\\"Mean\\"<br />\\"I Don't Believe You\\"<br />\\"Ave Marie A\\" (kind of a funny song in a sense)<br /><br />But throughout \\"Funhouse\\" she isnt afraid to veer off the beaten path and try new things.  It's one of reasons i've liked P!nk as an artist since she first came out in 2000 with \\"Can't Take Me Home\\". Eight years later and five albums deep, P!nk is still doing things her way and taking it to the house..so to speak.

B001DU8T6S|5.0|I'm listening right now to this album and you know I enjoy every single song on it.  Now this is about my fourth time hearing it and I enjoy/appreciate it more each time.  I believe it would have been more aptly titled Paul Rodgers, Brian May and Roger Taylor, The Cosmos Rocks.  This is their album delightfully prepared for you.  This is where they are now - not Queen not Bad Company but Rodgers, May and Taylor. Appreciate it on its own merit for today.  It's a great listen.  Enjoy.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|For the most part that's what the cd and John Legend do.  I was really interested in this one for a couple reasons, one i'm a fan and two of the inclusion of a more upbeat style on a few songs this time around.<br /><br />I love his music and everything but sometimes all the slow songs tend to get mushed together and that's not to say.  I don't enjoy them because i do, but i like that he finally switches up the tempo and gets out and enjoys himself.<br /><br />With \\"Green Light\\" Feat Andre 3000, its something so far from the norm that some folks might be shocked.  Don't be he rocks the song and the beat is crazy of course we have Andre being himself with some crazy lyrics (minus the \\"giggling like a piglet\\" part) of course.  For me the songs that he has featured artists are the ones that i really find myself wanting to hear again.<br /><br />\\"No Other Love\\" with Estelle (who's a promising singer/rapper from the UK and with a hit or two of her own).  This is one is a straight slow jam that works well as John and Estelle trade off lines about wanting no other love but each other.<br /><br />\\"It's Over\\" with Kanye West, it wouldnt be a John Legend cd without him as they work well together and this song is no exception to that rule either.<br /><br />\\"Quickly\\" with Brandy.  Another of favorite female singers, Brandy fits in nicely on this slow down track as well.  Making it one of the ones i most enjoy hearing when i play this cd...welcome back girl.  John does his thing on the track with the lyrics and talented instrument playing as always.<br /><br />While \\"Evolver\\" is different than his previous effort \\"Once Again\\".  Its by no means a bad thing, because as we can tell.  Mr. Legend will continue evolving throughout his musical career. I for one plan on being their all the while enjoying it all.
B0018CWEYY|2.0|When will this long and tedious journey ever end? Like all good new ideas, Lost started off brightly and got us all hooked... great characters, bizarre happenings, inexplicable coincidences, amazing miracles, the lot.    But that was hundreds of years ago. And yet here we are, still watching little groups of two and three characters marching about in that now oh-so-familiar undergrowth, holding flaming torches above their heads on God knows what missions... find the hut, find Jake, watch out for The Others, now watch out for the Other-Others with machine guns blah blah blah blah blah.    And still the flashbacks continue. And, in yet another twist, flash forwards as well. We're leaping back and forth in time, with each character getting their 'turn' every week, in an ever-growing confusing tangle of plotlines and sub-plots until we feel like we're drowning in a giant bowl of spaghetti.    And even now it's not over! After four long long long series (this one is half the length of the other series, but seems twice as long because we've seen most of it before, over and over and over again), six of the main characters finally get OFF the island!     Hurrah! The Lord be praised! But hold on to your hats... no sooner have they returned to the real world, than we find out that they've all got to go BACK to the island! Oh God, please, no, make it stop!    Somebody in these great Amazon reviews says if you've never seen Lost, watch just the very first episode, and the very final episode when it gets shown... and you'll probably not miss a thing. How right he is!    This series gets 2 stars because it's shorter than the other series, plus I like the Hawaii beach location they've been using... even though by now, I'm beginning to recognise every tree, every clearing and every hillside.    Might go there for my holidays... bet nobody else has thought of that.

B001E75QGG|1.0|This is a bad film on every level. Its an exploitation film made to cash out anything left in the character and you can kind of tell that everyone involved hated what they were doing (with the exception of Shia Labeouf who seems clueless about how bad it all is).    The Indiana Jones character was a homiage to 1930s/1940s adventure films and serials. The first mistake made is that this sequal is taken out of that context and placed into a cardboard vision of the 1950s. Elvis (check). Nuclear weapons (check). UFOs (check). Eisenhower (check). Phony leather biker extras fresh from the wild one (check). Commie russians (check). Joe McCarthy (check). None of it works. Its like putting Dracula or Frankenstein in a 1960s beach movie.    And of course because of who owns the character, the film has to throw a large amount of cash at ILM in exchange for big cheesy CGI effects. The first problem is that the effects are fake looking. The second is that effects are often for their own sake rather than to serve the story of the film.    The filmmakers go out of their way to make Harrison Ford look old. And Ford sleepwalks through the film like it was the last thing he ever wanted to do.     Shia Labeouf is horrible. He can't really be called an actor because he shows no sign of being able to act. He plays \\"annoying\\" real well but thats about it. Speilberg gave his reasons for casting him as: \\"He's every mother's son, every father's spitting image, every young kid's best pal and every girl's possible dream.\\" Saying that is either a sign of being out of touch with reality or a cry for help.     Its a funny thing. You would think that people making a film with a large budget, low expectations and little chance of another sequel would just have fun with it. But they didn't. This film is the opposite in every sense of the original raiders.

I admired it, the writing is fabulous but the tale it tells is a real downer.The driver who tells the story over a week of writing letters to a visiting Chinese offical makes the poor of India sound even worse than a Westener can imagine.

B001DHXT2A|2.0|The first Hulk movie was better than this Hulk movie. Ed Norton just keeps getting skinnier and his acting abilities seem to need a boost of gamma radiation. I wanted to like this movie because I am a big Marvel Comics fan but this movie just wasn't that good. The casting was pretty poor. William Hurt did a good job as Thunderbolt Ross but Liv Tyler is just an awful actress and delivers every line like she is a 2 year old trapped in a womans body (with big pillowy lips). Tim Roth is a good actor but... why Tim Roth? He is suppose to be a great commando and then he takes his shirt off and he looks like a 3 pack a day horribly unfit homeless person who hasn't had a wash or a good meal in about 5 years. Then when he gets some of the super soldier formula they hilariously try to paint muscles on his horrible body. Also standing by William Hurt he looks to be about 4 feet tall which is ok considering that Ed Norton appears to be about 120 pounds of rippling skin and bones which is about 50 pounds less than his love interest Betty Ross.<br /><br />This movie just wasn't that good. I heard that Norton was not pleased and if you watch the deleted scenes you can see that a lot of the humanity of The Hulk (Banner) ended up on the cutting room floor. I have to disagree. There was nothing in the deleted scenes that shouldn't have been deleted except maybe the extended scene between Hurt and Roth.<br /><br />Watch the first one. It was better and it wasn't that good. But I liked the look of The Hulk in the first one better and I thought the fight scenes and special effects were better. Josh Lucas, Jennifer Conolley, Sam Elliot and Eric Bana were a much better cast too.

B000002KGT|5.0|A definite change from the group's blues past, Rumours is the second album released by the band featuring the classic line up which included, female singer-songwriters, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie.  The two girls contribute a number of songs here as does the band's front man, Lindsey Buckingham.  This line up is seriously different from that of the original group.  Originally a blues outfit, things almost got out of hand for the band when guitarist Peter Green left due to metal illness.  Instead of calling it a day, they continued on while changing their sound to reflect the growing California soft rock scene.  While Green was indeed a blues guitarist, Buckingham took on his role but as a more conventional pop-rock player.  This does not mean that Buckingham couldn't play well: just listen to his solo on \\"Go Your Own Way\\" for proof that he is still a master of the fret-board.    Even though they are presented as well-produced soft rock numbers, the songs often have deep-meanings.  The lyrical complexity of \\"Oh Daddy\\", and \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" rival that of a lot of progressive rock.  This was somewhat rare as alot of soft rock from the 70s had superficial lyrics to match the gloss of the production.  And when it comes to 70s soft-rock, Fleetwood Mac was the cream of the crop.  Many bands were very much inspired by Mac's sound and approach to songwriting but few, however, reached Mac's height.  Maybe it was because they were the best at what they did or maybe it was because of the reputation they had already built as a blues group but Fleetwood Mac quickly became one of the most popular groups of all time.  Rumours alone has sold countless copies and is on many \\"best of\\" lists.  Fleetwood Mac has rightfully taken its place amoung the giants of rock-n-roll even if it took them years and several line up changes to do it.  The fact that this band made it through such hardships is what really makes them rock greats.

B001FBSMW6|5.0|Four and a half stars to be precise. Keane return with their third cd, \\"Perfect Symmetry\\". This is the type of artistic risk I complain so many other artists do not dare. This is the type of cd that makes me sit up and listen. This is one of the best cds I have listened to all year. I would nominate it for several Grammy awards. This cd has songs that have soaring, and memorable, melodies, the lyrics are interesting and the feel of the cd is the feel of a band in transition. To draw a comparison, this is no different than U2 transitioning from \\"October\\" to \\"War\\". This is what bands need to do--they need to grow artistically and creatively.<br /><br />Keane have made their best cd yet. I have a soft spot for \\"Hopes & Fears\\", and \\"Under The Iron Sea\\" was good, but \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" shows the band trying out new things, and the new things work very well. Listen to the banjo on the chorus of \\"Better Than This\\", one of the cds best tracks. Listen to the funk of the cd opener \\"Spiralling\\". Keane can dance if they want to. The first single \\"The Lovers Are Losing\\" is classic Keane--it has all the Keane sounds and ingredients and could have easily fit on \\"Hopes & Fears\\". \\"You Haven't Told Me Anything\\" is about as rock and roll sounding as Keane has ever been. \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" has a bridge that includes a choir of voices, unheard on a Keane cd before. There are Keane ballads like \\"You Don't See Me\\" and \\"Love Is The End\\", but the whole of the cd works extremely well, and the individual tracks hold up by themselves.<br /><br />I was disappointed to see that Keane listeners did not share my opinion (three and a half stars overall???!!!) To each their own. I have the disc, and that's all that matters to me. I support this band. I think they still might turn out to be the next greatest band in rock and roll. Think about it, did people think U2 were going to turn out the way they did with their third album \\"War\\"? I think not. But they showed tremendous potential, and that's the very thing Keane display on \\"Perfect Symmetry\\".display on \\"Perfect Symmetry\\".
B001DU8T6S|4.0|Just buy this CD for the song \\"Small\\" alone - it's absolutely brilliant.  This is simply a new musical direction for May & Taylor, it's not intended to be QUEEN, it's simply a brilliant guitarist and exceptional drummer creating new music - that's their passion - it's what they do best.  Paul Rodgers is quite exceptional himself, he's the complete opposite of Freddie, but his OWN (deep/bluesy) voice is an awesome instrument in its own right.      The CD isn't groundbreaking or amazing, but it is scattered with trademark Brian May sound and style, along with some nice harmonies, and just an overall \\"enjoyable listen\\" from track to track.  Well worth the asking price.
B000UR9T8C|1.0|Me and wife haven't been renting or watching all that many movies lately, so while browsing on one Friday afternoon, we said.  \\"Let's give Spidey 3 a try\\".<br /><br />Boy am I sorry we did!<br /><br />Let me start with the ONLY good thing about this movie.  The special effects.  That should be a given, and is not enough to make this review rise above 1 star.<br /><br />Other than that, this is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />I urge you not to waste your time on this.<br /><br />The acting is so bad and seems so forced in almost every scene, I can't help but thinking that the big wig just had to give up, and release it the way it stood.<br />I can't imagine how this ever made it out...<br />That someone didn't have the guts to say...\\"We're not going to release this crap...are we?\\"<br />That's how bad this movie is.<br /><br />There is one section called \\"Bad Peter\\", where Peter Parker acts out, while wearing the \\"black suit\\" under his regular clothes.  Well they re-style his hair, and he walks down the street winking at the ladies, and doing Saturday night fever like dance moves.  I tried to reconcile with something in my limited \\"Comic book\\" background....but NO.  It's just bad.  It's so laughably bad, it not even funny.<br /><br />The title for my review came, after I watched the full movie, and then watched the bloopers.<br />In the movie there are one or two scenes with Harry's butler, where he vindicates Spider-man from Harry's father's death.  The acting is so bad, I sat their thinking that even if they used one of these bloopers, no one would even notice.  The marketing and the previews for this movie are slick, but do not be fooled.<br />If you are fan of this series, or movies in general, you will want to skip this one.

1416594884|3.0|John Le Carre is a good writer, no questions about that. He has beter than average skills at developing sympathetic characters wgo moan and groan about protecting their nation's interests, but do it anyway. Of course, Le Carre's concept of honorable nationhood does not extend to the United States of America.<br /><br />  Anyone who has read Le Carre's books, his op-ed pieces and interviews knows that Le Carre considers the United States to be evil and eminently hateable. Le Carre criticized Salman Rushdie for publishing his \\"Satanic Verses\\" and, according to Le Carre, putting people associated with him in danger.<br /><br />  With the Cold War ending, Le Carre hasn't seemed to be able to adapt to a changed world, though he has lost none of his skills as a writer.<br /><br />  \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" introduces us to Issa, who may or may or not be an Islamic terrorist with ties to Chechnya. Issa may or may not also be the sole beneficiary to a considerable fortune salted away in a now German bank run by the Britisher Tommy Brue. He is an illegal immigrant to Germany. A human rights agency has assigned Annabel Richter as his lawyer and she becomes the contact to Brue in order to secure Issa's fortune.<br /><br />  Complicating matters is the fact that Issa may or may not have been in Russian and Turkish prisons from which he may or may not have escaped. His exit route from Turkey in the hands of smugglers was circuitous and has resulted in his becoming as person of interest, if not wanted, by Swedish, Danish and German law enforcement.<br /><br />  Le Carre's handling of the preliminaries is typical Le Carre, Issa appears to be mentally unbalanced. Annabel Richter, his lawyer, is idealistic and convinced she is better than her lawyer parents. Brue is an aging man with  younger trophy wife and an estranged adult daughter from his first marriag. He is also haunted by the fact that his family bank is failing and that his father engaged in some shenanigans decades ago for the benefit of scoundrels from the Soviet Union, one of whom may have been Issa's father.<br /><br />  Enter Gunther Bachmann, German intelligence operative. For reasons that never become crystal clear, Bachmann wants to entrap Issa and he uses Annabel and Brue to do it. As this plot line emerges, so does the vintage Le Carre.<br /><br />  The intelligence units fight with each other over turf, individuals maneuver for their own personal advantage, the moral issues are reduced to grays, rather than black and white.<br /><br />  Ultimately British intelligence becomes involved and then the US, whom Le Carre clearly despises.<br /><br />  All of this is tolerable if you appreciate Le Carre's writing and plotting skills as I do.<br /><br />  Unfortunately, the story is not all that compelling and ultimately Le Carre has to bring it to an end.<br /><br />  And it is at that point that Le Carre turns to his anti-Americanism for a thoroughly unsatisfying conclusion. Unsatisfying, that is, if you find doctrinaire left-wing anti-Americanism tiresome.<br /><br />  So, \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" is typical Le Carre. Good writing. Good character development, with the usual bone-weary civil servants. A story that runs out of steam about half-way through and conludes with gratuitous anti-Americanism. Ultimately unsatisfying to me, but Le Carre undeniably writes well.<br /><br />Jerryt Union, one of whom may have been Issa's father.      Enter Gunther Bachmann, German intelligence operative.

B00188M5TM|5.0|Angelina Jolie stars as Christine Collins whose nine-year old son vanished from their Los Angeles home in 1928. She met with little cooperation from the police, and when they finally found the boy and brought him back home, she said, \\"That's not my son.\\"<br /><br />This movie was based on a true story and directed by Clint Eastwood in a gritty, no-frills style. There isn't a lot of action, but it definitely holds your interest until the very end. Jolie gives a strong performance as the mother who wouldn't stop looking for her son, even when she battled the corrupt police chief. Jolie is on-screen just about every minute and is a formidable screen presence. She and the rest of the cast, including John Malkovich, are all good in this very somber and intense piece.<br /><br />The costumes, sets, and locations are perfectly done in 1920s style and the photography uses a lot of natural light adding to the old-fashioned feel. The movie about a mother's love and police corruption is fascinating, but it's also relentlessly grim and left me feeling quite depressed. A well-made movie, though.
B0000CDLC8|2.0|I ended up getting a refund as this was not what I had hoped to get.  The shipment included two dvd AUDIO disks only.  I could only play them on my dvd player, and they displayed a still shot for each song.  NO VIDEO.

0060853972|5.0|It is in England, eleven years before the Apocalypse, when the demon Crowley's worst fear is realized. He receives a summons from Hell to pick up the Anti-Christ and deliver the infant to a human family. The only problem is, Crowley likes the world and doesn't want it destroyed. And so, he enlists the help of his long-time rival, the angel Aziraphale, and the two set off to save humankind. Pratchett and Gaiman deliver an exquisitely crafted novel, and a hilarious and poignant examination of the most complex character of all--human nature. Consider yourself warned--this book will have you laughing to yourself in the middle of the night and when you've turned the last page--leave you thinking.

B001F2W4Y2|3.0|I was never a big fan of Bon's replacement, Brian Johnson. Yes they have put out some very good cd's without Bon fronting them. Black In Black, For Those About To Rock, Flick of the switch, Ballbreaker are some of my favorite post Bon releases. However ever since his death, the band has been missing one key ingredient that made them a truly great band when Bon was around. They miss Bon's sense of humor which translated into groove oriented fun back in the day.<br /><br />This latest release although not bad, still hasn't come anywhere near the heights of those early releases. Albums like Let There Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Jailbreak, Highway To Hell etc are where AC/DC's heart still lies.<br /><br />Again nothing against the new release as it's not bad, but to me it's missing some catchy hooks overall and even the Brian Johnson fronted release I mentioned had some of those.<br /><br />I'd rate it as an average listen nothing more.

0060512806|5.0|I don't remember buying this book, but that is not uncommon for my large collection of books. Having read most of the books on my bookshelf, I decided to give this a shot, not knowing what to expect.    At first, the plot confused me. It likes to jump into flashbacks and to different times without telling you, and often is intentionally vague to force you to guess.     Then it gets really good. Between WW2 intrigue and modern day mundane chores (like 5 pages of the perfect bowl of Captain Crunch), this is literary exploration at its best.  I have not laughed out loud so many times in one book since reading the entire Hitchhikers Guide series.    Brilliant.

B00012QM8G|4.0|Schindler's List         Schindler's List was a very compelling film of how a man saved 1,100 Jews from being put to death in the gas chambers in Auschwitz Germany.  The three main characters are Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth and Ben Kingsley as the accountant for Oskar Schindler.         In 1939 the Germans defeated the Polish Army.  Jews were ordered out of their homes and told to register all family members.  Thousands of Jews arrived in Krakow daily.  The Germans treated the Jews as if they were animals.  They were shot, sexually abused, beaten, paraded around nude, laughed at and put to death in gas chambers.  Schindler came in wanting to make money, knowing that he would profit immensely, for he could work the Jews and not have to pay them a dime.  Throughout the movie you could tell that Schindler did not approve of what was happening and appeared to be growing fonder of his workers.  He fought for and stood up for the Jews many times.  In 1944 Amon Goeth was ordered to exhume and incinerate the bodies of more than ten thousand Jews.  Once Schindler became aware of this atrocious act, he then asked to buy all the factory workers.  Schindler made his list, fought for the lives of the women and children, and then he spent all the money he made to keep his factory running. At the end all the Jews had written a letter on his behalf telling what had happened and how Schindler saved their lives.  With the letter, they gave him a silver band with an inscription from the Hebrew Bible, \\"Whoever saves one life, save the world entire\\".  They told him, \\"There will be more generations because of what you did\\".  Schindler sobbed for he felt he didn't do enough.  There are more than six thousand descendants of the Schindler Jews.  In 1958 Schindler was declared a righteous person by the council of Yad Vashem in Jerusalem and invited to plant a tree in the Avenue of the Righteous.  It grows there still today. Schindler died September 10, 1974 and his grave is visited by the Schindler Jews and their descendants yearly.       During the Holocaust there were almost six million European Jews murdered by the Nazi leadership of Germany during the World War II.  In the culture of Greco-Roman, anti-Semitism has played a part in Europe since the Roman Empire adopted Christianity as its state religion in the fourth century CE (Fisher 264).  After the defeat of Germany in World War I, Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party blamed the Jews for all of their problems.  From 1939 to 1942 the Jews was deprived of all human rights.  By the end of the Holocaust they were being starved, worked to death as slaves, tortured, \\"experimented\\" on and shipped to extermination camps where they were placed in industrial size gas chambers (Fisher 265).  To the Jewish belief it poses the question, \\"Is God omnipotent and caring?\\"(Fisher 266).       *Fisher, Mary Pat.  \\"Living Religions\\".  New Jersey:  Pearson Education Inc, 2008.
B0015FML06|1.0|When the original EP Under a Blood Red Sky came out in 1983, it included a brief snippet of \\"Send in the Clowns\\" in the song \\"The Electric Co\\".  When the CD was released about 10 years later, \\"The Electric Co\\" included one of the most awkward edits I've ever heard in order to omit that brief snippet of \\"Send in the clowns\\".  Ever since then, I've hoped the original version would be restored.  This is not the case with this release.  Rather than restore the orginal EP version of \\"The Electric Co', they've cut another 20 seconds out of the CD version.  It sounds better than the previous version but is still not complete. If you want to hear this release in its entirety, you still need to find the EP from 1983, pitiful as that is.
B000683VI4|4.0|I realize that there is much that can be ridiculed about The Notebook. The movie practically begs you to find holes. It has the depth of a soap opera. And yet...when I watched it with someone who is so incredibly special to me - the both of us wrapped up in our own personal life miseries, but being great friends and pulling each other through each other's difficulties - and we sat there, quietly sniffing, gently laughing, and shifting in our place next to each other on the couch as the emotional impact of the movie ebbed and flowed, I let the critic go and embraced the moment. At the end, we simply collapsed against each other in tears and the hope that somewhere, sometime, we would find what Allie and Noah had. I loved the movie. I loved watching it, letting my romantic nature gush forward without apology, and I did not care how predictable it was, I did not care how believable it was, I did not care about anything but the fact that true love - the kind of poems, plays, movies, tv shows, novels, and songs from the dawn of man - is so vital and enriches our lives so much that little can compare. In choosing, as many of us will or have already, between practicality and our hearts, the path our heart wants is the best. To the dreamers, the lovers, and the hopeless romantics, enjoy this movie. Watch it with someone special and allow yourself to feel alive. I won't give up my beliefs and I hope you don't either.

B001CLG6RC|2.0|Enigma has dropped the ball on this one.  With monotonous and grating solo ethnic chants, slow hip-hop style beats and no decent vocalist to carry the album (where is Sandra??), the album falls flat.  You just don't get into it.  Perhaps this is a sign of an aging band.  While definitely a throwback to the first album, it is a weak version of it.     I own all of the Enigma albums, and this is by far the worst.  At best it will round out your collection.

0446579939|4.0|Only Nicholas Sparks could take a time-honored love triangle, have the hero and the maiden-in-distress meet under the most unlikely circumstances, and still turn out a terrific novel with a great love story.      Logan Thibault finds a picture of a lovely young woman lying in the dirt as he is serving in Iraq for the third time.  After fruitlessly trying to find out who dropped it, he takes it back to his home in the States and tracks down the young woman.  Her ex-husband is the villain in the piece but that's all I will say so that the story is not spoiled for the reader.  Needless to say, Nicholas Sparks shows his usual talent for developing wonderful dialogue and characters that the reader can really care about.  Enjoy!
B00005MM67|5.0|I'm motivated to write this review well after the fact of the movie's initial release [1991 in Europe and then May of 1992 in the USA] and subsequent DVD release in 2001 because K2 is again in the news with the most recent tragedy of 11 climbers being killed on K2 which occurred on August 1, 2008.<br /><br />My thrust however is to once again caution at least certain viewers that while K2 is in fact dedicated [superimposed on the screen in the closing scene] to real life K2 summiteers, Jim Wickwire and Dr. Louis Reichardt, and, of note, those movie 'fictional' characters 'Taylor Brooks' and 'Harold Jameson' who just happen to share the identical professions of the real-life Jim Wickwire and Lou Reichardt, viz., lawyer and biophysicist, well, far too often what is seen on the proverbial 'Silver Screen' is erroneously interpreted as take-it-to-the-bank 'fact' versus cinematic 'for the sake of the script and pure entertainment value' fiction!<br /><br />Put another way, readers are urged to research the actual 1978 K2 climb by, among further others by the way in the same expedition, Jim Wickwire and Lou Reichardt and see what the actual facts really were and are, versus, shall we say, Hollywood creativity. I 'have' actually run across folks who saw the movie and make the transposition, so to speak, of 'Taylor' suddenly becoming Jim Wickwire and 'Harold' or 'H' suddenly becoming Lou Reichardt in their minds and hence their post-movie \\"conclusion\\" is that their totally erroneous transposition sees Wickwire supposedly having 'saved Reichardt's life' [!] when Reichardt supposedly 'broke his leg' [!] on the vertical ice fall and Wickwire supposedly 'dragged Reichardt down the mountain as far as he could until the Pakistani helicopter suddenly showed up' [!] -- BIZZZZ! That is total cinematic fantasy! But 'because' of the film dedication and a few minor events that did happen in real life, it's all too easy for some folks to see the movie and feel that it's a sort of 'true event' documentary when in fact the movie is just that, a movie based on 'conjured' events!<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed the movie. As a fictional movie! Particularly the music! Although my first love is playing classical piano, I've never abandoned my secondary love of the guitar and those high E string lead tones [I don't know who the guitarist was and if anyone does, let me know!] are literally haunting!

Nor is it 'identical', as one poster suggested in another website, to what he termed a \\"Pink Floyd rip off\\" piece.

1400067936|5.0|I have been trading markets for long time and have been exposed to volatility and its devastating impact on portfolio. I have been trading professionally too (in a bank, different markets).  I read numerous books before on trading (technical analysis, strategies, etc..).  But trading is more than just fundamental and quantitative analysis. Good trading skills  have deep roots into psychology and philosophy.  I decided to buy the book and read it after noticing so many negative reviews and I became curious. I can say , that the book was above my expectations. The author confirmed and reinforced many interesting aspects I knew with very nice and interesting examples. This work also broadened my horizons into history, philosophical thinking and gave me new ideas how to improve my own trading.  Now, it is time to say to all who say negative things about the author: you are all wrong...Look at the financial crisis and blowouts by hedge funds and banks.  Thats because those idiots didnt even understand things covered in this book.  After long way of schooling (MBA at NYU) and long years of work, I met a lot of people Taleb talking about (traders, strategists, analysts,and professors), and many of them have wrong way of thinking. Taleb exposes all of this in his book.  It is an excellent book for experienced traders (not so experienced ones are unlikely to appreciate the book to its full extent or even understand the concepts covered). Great book to complement someone's quantitative training. To make the long story short, the book is going to benefit everyone and make everyone smarter.
B001F12J3Y|1.0|This rating is for the 3-D version that at best is 1/2 3D.   Using the red blue glasses also erase most of the color content and the cheap cardboard glasses are uncomfortable.  Too bad they couldn't have duplicated the great 3 D that was shown in theatres. Warner Brothers should learn to perfect this system.  I have been anxiously awaiting a good 3 D quality movie for years and have wondered why they think a red/blue pair of glasses is going to provide the effects.  Also...the 3D effect is so much better with JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF EARTH (this time going red/green glasses why can't they at least give a better 3D effect with this great holiday movie.

B001F1YBPI|5.0|Claudio Abbado, surely one of the great conductors working today, formed a small orchestra, called Orchestra Mozart, in 2004. This group consists of several world-renowned instrumentalists and a number of exceedingly fine young players, mostly from Italy. Among the 'names' in the orchestra are Michala Petri, recorder; Giuliano Carmignola, principal violin; Reinhold Friedrich, trumpet; Jacques Zoon, flute; Alois Posch, bass; Alessio Allegrini, horn; and Ottavio Dantone, harpsichord. In their early seasons they concentrated on music by Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven and Schubert. But in 2007 they prepared all six of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos and toured them throughout Italy, with concerts in Bologna, Ferrara, Pisa, Prato, Reggio Emilia, Venice, Modena, Verona and Bolzano. This DVD is a live recording of the April 21, 2007 concert they played in the visually gorgeous and acoustically excellent Teatro Municipale Romolo Valli in Reggio Emilia.<br /><br />The players (except for cellos and harpsichord) stand for the performances. Consequently there is considerable swaying of bodies and generally greater animation of the instrumentalists. I mention this because in a visual medium like a DVD this makes for more engaging viewing. The video of this concert focuses almost entirely on the instrumentalists; we rarely see Abbado. I like this approach as I'm much more interested in what the players are doing. One does notice, though, that Abbado is conducting without score. And indeed he's not even conducting at all in the Sixth Concerto -- that's the one without violins; its group of seven players are truly a chamber ensemble.<br /><br />The principals couldn't be better. I was immensely impressed, as I have been in other recordings, by Allegrini, who has to one of the finest horn players around. As well, I loved the blending of Petri's and Nikolaj Tarasov's recorders in the Second. That concerto was played last on the program -- the sequence was Concertos 1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2 -- and in response to the enthusiastic applause of the audience, the group played the final Allegro assai of the No. 2 and this time Petri substituted a sopranino recorder for her usual instrument, a piquant touch. Carmignola's lickety-split violin obbligato in the opening Allegro of that concerto has to be seen and heard to be believed.<br /><br />Dantone was superb in the supremely virtuosic harpsichord part in the Fifth Concerto. The audio didn't bring out the sound of his instrument as much as I would have liked, but I rather suspect it was true to the actual sound in the hall. And I did lean forward to hear it better, which one often actually does in live performances in my experience.<br /><br />Abbado's approach with the concertos is to take them fairly briskly. He does fairly often slow down slightly for cadences but there is not much else in the way of tempo variation. Usually, frankly, I felt he set the opening tempo and then these excellent musicians played as chamber musicians would, making subtle adjustments to the playing of their colleagues. This is not a criticism of Abbado; rather it is a commendation of his lack of ego and his willingness to let his musicians play together in their own way.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough. Often, when I've listened to or attended concerts featuring all six of these works I've lost attention somewhere along the way. This time I was energized for the entire 100 minutes of the concert.

Carmignola's lickety-split violin obbligato in the opening Allegro of that concerto has to be seen and heard to be believed.<br /><br />Dantone was superb in the supremely virtuosic harpsichord part in the Fifth Concerto. The audio didn't bring out the sound of his instrument as much as I would have liked, but I rather suspect it was true to the actual sound in the hall. And I did lean forward to hear it better, which one often actually does in live performances in my experience.<br /><br />Abbado's approach with the concertos is to take them fairly briskly. He does fairly often slow down slightly for cadences but there is not much else in the way of tempo variation. Usually, frankly, I felt he set the opening tempo and then these excellent musicians played as chamber musicians would, making subtle adjustments to the playing of their colleagues. This is not a criticism of Abbado; rather it is a commendation of his lack of ego and his willingness to let his musicians play together in their own way.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough. Often, when I've listened to or attended concerts featuring all six of these works I've lost attention somewhere along the way. This time I was energized for the entire 100 minutes of the concert.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I actually saw this movie 3 times at the theater and enjoyed it just as much the 3rd time as the 1st. You smile the whole way thru. You just know that the cast had a terrific time making the movie. Looking around the theater I could see the majority of the people's heads bobbing with the music and as I sat there at the end and people were leaving they were actually singing along with the music at the credits. This is just a flat out FUN movie that left you feeling GREAT.

B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Brendan Fraser stars in the latest adaptation of Jules Verne's \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth,\\" but the real star of the film is, of course, its special effects including 3-D images. Unfortunately I couldn't see the film in 3-D (the theater I went to showed only 2-D version), so please read my review as such, in which \\"effects\\" means only traditional 2-D special effects.    Probably you already know the film's story as you have read the original book or seen the 1959 version starring James Mason as Sir Oliver S. Lindenbrook. For the new adaptation the Hollywood studio decided on a story that they think is fit for effects. The new adventure story is much simplified: Brendan Fraser's hero Prof. Trevor Anderson is looking for his missing brother; Josh Hutcherson is his nephew Sean who follows his uncle's (and father's) quest; and Anita Briem is a mountain guide Hannah Ásgeirsson (a nod to \\"Hans\\" of the 1959 version?) whose father is one of the \\"Verneians.\\" Actually the film is slightly self-referential as our hero finds a clue about his brother in the titular Jules Verne book.    And ... that is all. No \\"villains\\" appear (except, perhaps, a mean-spirited boss of Fraser's character, a very small role you may forget soon) as this is a family-friendly picture and each scene is obviously borrowed from other films like \\"Indiana Jones.\\" The Jules Verne fans would lament, or even is angry with, the changes done to the source material.     Still as the film is fun. Yes, it may be silly kind of fun, but fun nonetheless as first-time feature film director Eric Brevig (also, visual effect veteran) has provided enough actions to keep the ball rolling. Even seen in 2-D the images are not bad if not great. Yes, I know, the characters are flat and its romance is uninteresting, but still I like the film for what it is, a 90-miinute roller-coaster ride.

B00005JPO1|3.0|When I saw this in the theaters, I remember thinking about halfway through that I was surprised to have let my concentration kind of dwindle away. The first hour of the film was entertaining (I thought the nuclear fridge escape was pretty awesome in a cheeseball sort of way) but halfway through it just gets kinda boring. There's a great fight scene with Indy and a Commie (forgive me) stooge going at it while surrounded by an army of vicious, fist sized ants. Any fight scene where the punches sound like gunshots is always entertaining to me. And let's give credit where credit is due, Harrison Ford is the man. Even though no other guy his age could take the drubbing that he does in this film, its still enough to bring a tear to your eye and a whip to your heart to see Indy back again doing what he does best, even if its in a movie that almost yawns itself to sleep.<br /><br />While watching the extras, I noticed something interesting. Spielberg kept talking about how he didn't want to make the movie. Or at least going in that direction without actually admitting it. And I think that's the secret. Personally, I think Spielberg made a half-hearted Indy film. The prospect of casting new wunderkind Shia LeBouf probably piqued his interest a little and reuniting Karen Allen with Harrison Ford again probably did it for him just as much, if not more so. But in the end, the movie felt a little lazy to me. And even though all of the Indy movies require some serious suspension of disbelief, this one requires you to basically check your brain in at the door because some of the things that happen are just flat out ridiculous. The whole vine swinging thing? Awful.<br /><br />The DVD is just what you'd expect. The picture and sound are pretty decent and the extras are a good amount and well put together but for me, not particularly interesting. I normally eat this stuff up but I think the fight was taken out of me at some point. If you loved the movie, you'll appreciate the extras but for me, I can do without watching them ever again. As for the movie itself, let's just say Temple of Doom is NOT the worst of the series.n do without watching them ever again.

Her voice is bright and crystal clear - and she employs it with complete control, no \\"Mariah Carey\\"ing on here! The melodies are infectious and the arrangements are sparse enough to allow the vocals and piano shine through. This is an impressive first effort from a fresh young talent.

B00188M5TM|4.0|In his 2008 film \\"Changeling\\", director Clint Eastwood presents a ghoulishly and somberly hued portrait of a flapper-era City of Angels that keeps his audience white-knuckled and frequently aghast at yet another chronicled onslaught against basic human decency.  Revisiting themes of corrupt misused power, an overall erosion of values and the resulting injustice against the innocent that he has explored in films like `[[ASIN:B0001ZX0OW Mystic River (Widescreen Edition)]]' and \\"[[ASIN:0790729644 Unforgiven]],\\" Eastwood creates a microcosm of a larger failed system by focusing on a sad chapter in LA history that revolves around the kidnapping of a young boy.  Eastwood interjects a more brutal reality to the already horrendous events that transpired when single mother Christine Collins, a telephone operator supervisor, (a bruised-eyed and ruby-red-rouged lipped Angelina Jolie) discovers that her son, Walter, is missing.  The already press-beleaguered police become involved albeit condescendingly,--Jefferey Donovan's performance as the snaky police captain in charge ruthlessly epitomizes how heady a cocktail of pressure from above mixed with the brain swell of power can be--producing another boy in lieu of the missing Walter just to give press closure to the case.  When Christine repeatedly insists that the found boy is not her son, she is instantly dismissed as an incompetent, irresponsible mother who during the months the child was missing supposedly became too accustomed to her newfound freedom.  The police captain rounds up a group of expert doctors to further his cause and to add insult to injury to this all too true bureaucratic straight-jacket in which Christine finds herself bound.<br /><br />Eastwood drives the film with all the lead-footed ferocity of a Mack Truck crazy with speed.  Christine's role as single working mother transmutes to that of emerging female individualist who by reason of her gender is either considered as a trespasser on male employment territory or a hysterical troublemaker requiring sedation to be kept under authority respecting control. As one of the little people who takes responsibility seriously, paying her civic and societal dues with a happy sense of regularity and accomplishment, she discovers that instead of the steadfastness and support she expects from a system for which she has bolstered and paid she receives more than just a negative dividend along with the remnants of her middle class ideals.  Her understanding of this reaches a grizzly climax in a bleak cruelly run hospital for the insane and for women that have been incarcerated by the police under the insidious no-questions-asked Code 12.<br /><br />Barring lobotomy, Eastwood pushes all this white-coated terror to the limit--masochistic hospital staff wielding water hoses and administering humiliation-inducing syphilis tests leads to no-win double-talking analysis sessions with sadistic doctors, unnecessary sedatives and the ultimate [[ASIN:0141181222 One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Penguin Classics)]] depravity, electric shock treatment.  Phew! I had to shut my eyes more than once--all that white Gothic starchiness induced a snow-blindness I felt like a kick in the gut.<br /><br />Meanwhile back at the ranch--and what a ranch--in what was once called Wineville in Riverside County--the only ethical representative of the Los Angeles police department investigates a tip regarding the deportation of a minor to Canada and discovers the horrific murder factory of child-killer Gordon Northcott.  Here Eastwood steps heavily on the brakes of what up until then had been a fast-moving almost out of control vehicle depicting every depraved manner of humiliation conceivable directed at controlling the drones of the middle class.  This break in the action at first seems like the eye of a hurricane, however the film although brutal in its scenes of child killing and capital punishment never hits the mark again as it does in the first ninety minutes.<br /><br />Angelina does the role of Christine justice.  Visually beautiful she relentlessly acts up a storm with just a residual hint of some of her former revenge minded characters (think the scary cold-hearted assassin Fox in \\"[[ASIN:B001GKJ2F2 Wanted (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]\\") to remind the audience that this is still Jolie that it is watching.  John Malkovich plays the helpful radio-minister, Gustav Briegleb, with his usual adept precision while most of the other characters formulate a body of different archetypical stereotypes that are frightening in their bleak presentation.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Clint Eastwood's Changeling is fraught with a disturbing energy that bombards the viewer with a stereoscope of images from another era that suggests being back in the day is no better than being around now.  Depicting institutions that supposedly are designed to support and enrich the public as greedy citadels of misused power sadly reminds us of our faith in financial institutions that betray rather than pave the way for responsibly planned middle class futures.  Recommended with the warning of many brutally depicted scenes of inhumanity towards the insane, child abduction and killing, and capital punishment.

B00008973A|5.0|A Chorus Line allows us to watch as a director (Michael Douglas) selects the men and women he wants in the chorus of a play he will direct.  He asks the people who have come to try out to tell him something about themselves, since members of the chorus will have bit parts in the play.  Among those trying out are a married couple, a woman who has acted for the Douglas character before, a young man involved in gay theater without his family's knowledge, and one of the great loves of the director's life.      While it's difficult to imagine an actual try-out being conducted along these lines, it does offer an opportunity for the audience to get to know the often-anonymous chorus and for each of the chorus members to have a moment (or more) to shine.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|I can't fault the acting in this movie one bit.  Brosnan was damned if he sang the part & damned if he didn't, so having the courage to do so with a less than trained voice shows character, in my opinion.  I will agree with the critics that the cinematography was, in places (The Winner Takes it All & the courtyard scene with Streep & Brosnan) just awful, but I love the film all the same.  A movie is more than the sum of it's parts & this movie makes me smile.  At the end of the day, entertainment is still supposed to entertain, yes?
B00004XMTJ|5.0|This musical is based on T. S. Eliot's poetic \\"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats.\\"    The plot, which is basically an excuse for fabulously singing and dancing cats to show their stuff, is that once every year one of the Jellicle cats can ascend to the Heaviside layer and from there be reborn into another cat life--and this year's choice will be made tonight.  This leads the Jellicles to perform (singly, in duos, in trios, and en masse) in order to prove their worthiness.      Among the best numbers is \\"Rum Tum Tigger,\\" \\"Mister Mistofelees,\\" \\"Gus the Theater Cat,\\" and, of course, \\"Memory.\\"  The agile dancing is wonderful and the songs don't disappoint.  It's almost hard to believe that the cast is NOT cats.      And my cat loved it.
0446579939|3.0|I have read all of Nicholas Sparks' novels (except The Rescue and Three Days...), and his latest, The Lucky One, fails to stand out as being one of his better works.  The story started off slow, and ended in a hurry.  Sparks did succeed in writing a good background story, and the characters in this book were well portrayed.  As I read this book, I realized that the characters and plots were very similar to Sparks' earlier novels (such as the dog-human relationship and the love obsession of The Guardian, the war background of Dear John, the storm sequence of Message in a Bottle / Notebook), therefore ruining the originality aspect of the novel.  Also, as I was reading the last 20 pages, I felt the story was a bit rush and it gave me the perception that the story ended right after Sparks got the story rolling.  I also felt that the epilogue was a little bit forced and it was only there to make a final unnecessary twist to the story.  Overall, The Lucky One is not a poorly written novel, but I expected a lot more from Nicholas Sparks than this since he is a veteran romantic genre author.  I will still look forward to his next novel, and I hope that will turn out to be an epic love story.
B000002UDB|4.0|The Fab Four lost their manager, Brian Epstein, in late August, 1967.  Somewhat rudderless, and with time on their hands because they were no longer performing live, the group needed a new project after their groundbreaking \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" release earlier that summer.  They decided to make a TV movie, and, unfortunately, decided to handle it themselves.  \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" was filmed hastily in September 1967, and demonstrates, conclusively, that, for all their musical brilliance, the Beatles themselves were no filmmakers.  \\"Tour\\" is basically a nonsensical mishmash lacking \\"Pepper\\"'s unifying structure of an alter-ego to the band, and the music, despite major works such as Paul McCartney's poignant \\"Fool On The Hill\\" and John Lennon's \\"I Am The Walrus\\" (a signature song of the psychedelic era), is, on the whole, a notch below the great mid-period efforts \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\", and below \\"Pepper\\" as well--the preceding three studio albums.  \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" aired on the BBC over the Christmas 1967 holidays, in glorious black-and-white, and was not shown at all on a major network in the US for years.  The soundtrack was originally released as a double-EP in the UK.  The U.S. release (which actually preceded the EPs) was a full-length LP which collected the rest of the Beatles' non-Pepper 1967 output on the second side, and included a rather-sappy cartoon booklet illustrating the movie.  This full-length LP eventually replaced the double-EP as the official \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" release, and is crucial to any Beatles collection because of that second side, which collects major singles like \\"Penny Lane\\" (Paul's sunny, fanciful depiction of an actual Liverpool roundabout) and its flip side, marketed as another A-side, John's druggy, dreamy \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", another real location from the Fab Four's native city--in this case, an orphanage.  \\"Fields\\" is an important song for its use of recording studio technique--two different versions of the song are clipped together.  As with \\"Walrus\\", it remains a benchmark of psychedelia, as created by the flagship group of the era.  This music, dating from the same time period as the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" sessions, is part and parcel of that period in the Fab Four's musical development.

B00188M5TM|4.0|This movie was very sad and disturbing, but also very good. The story is about a mother whose son goes missing. After five months, the police department says they found her son but she immediately realizes that they gave her the wrong boy. What goes on after that is pretty frustrating, because the police department will not admit their mistake and do everything in their power to discredit the mother of the missing boy.<br /><br />The movie loses a star because it had a slow start (it picked up and it was worth it in the end) and because there's a judge in the movie who looks exactly like John McCain. I thought that was very suspicious and unprofessional if it was intentional.<br /><br />Either way, Angelina Jolie gave an amazing performance (like always), and I thought Jason Butler Harner did an amazing job as well...very disturbing performance from him.<br /><br />I don't know why this movie came out on Halloween. It's a story about real life horror, and I don't think many people want to see that at this time of year.<br /><br />Overall, very well-made movie with some minor annoyances that can be overlooked. Recommended.

B000ZLFALS|4.0|I grew up with the Beatles, and though these folks obviously aren't them, they do a creditable job with the music.  Some off notes are expected.  Didn't know Evan Rachel Wood had a decent voice, but without more training, she should stick to acting.  Plot is thin and predictable, but the music makes it tolerable.  Sad that it continues the tradition in movies of depicting the drug culture/hippies as the pre-eminent experience of the times, even with the brief acknowledgement of middle-class America.  But for the songs (memories!) and cleverly weaving them mostly appropriately into this story (better than \\"1969\\" and others), I would have passed on this as just another rock-based musical bit of pap to promote a drug culture that was only a small sideshow of the 1960s experience for most of us.  The acting is good, not great, the mild and brief nudity not shocking, and no steamy sex or lurid violence.  A good blend of quick shots tempers what could have been just another teen exploitation, and the story actually flows.  Good color and some reasonably accurate history shoved into the story line.  Some too brief and obviously contrived references to other Beatles' memorabilia are small bumps on its road.  I like it for the music and a pleasant afternoon's movie entertainment.  Drugs are for those who aspire to be losers in life, don't care about those who really care for them, or are too lazy to use what nature gave them already.

B00005JKNC|1.0|A good movie is one that captures my attention from the beginning scene, irrespective of my mood, ambience/lighting/noise level of the room, or whether I am multitasking or trying to stay focused.  Nothing, nothing in this movie from the start captured my interest--and I was completely focused on the screen and had an open mind.  The beginning was trite, to say the least.  The movie dragged on and on, and the music was unbearable.  Even the scene of the accident on the bridge was too contrived.  The director was trying hard to draw the viewer's sympathy toward each character long before that was ever any chance for developing this character.  Sappy music prevailed over every scene.  Jim Carrey's character did not have the same  level of intrigue as Truman in \\"The Truman Show\\" or the other mellow/somber character in \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\".  I don't blame it on Carrey's acting.  It was all because the director lacked creativity or vision in making the character interesting from the beginning.<br /><br />When I decided to give up on the movie (after the father brings Luke home), I fast-forwarded to subsequent chapters.  I found the scenes extremely contrived.  Somehow the director was trying very hard to make this another \\"Pleasantville\\" (which, by the way, was an outstanding movie).  I thought I was watching the worst of Barry Levinson or Rob Reiner or Penny Marshall!  Clint Eastwood could have pulled this movie off much better!<br /><br />If you are looking for portrayals of a highly sanitized, glossed over, extremely idealistic, and completely UNrealistic 50s life, and if you want a movie that tries hard to touch every sentimental neuron and synapse in your brain, then look no further.  But, if you don't like exceedingly sappy movies, then, by all means, stay away from this one!
B000JVT1U0|5.0|An uptight, deeply devoted Christian police officer arrives to investigate the disapperance of a young girl, and get's caught up in a world of pagan ritual.  That more or less sums up the plot, but to call this movie horror is a little off base. I think it's better described as a dark fantasy, though it certainly draws upon the horror genre, as well as a great deal of very primal imagery from pagan history.  The end product is a bit surreal and a little creepy, though I find on repeated viewings it really starts to be more fun.  Once you're in on the joke, so to speak, you gladly follow the fool on his journey.<br />Christopher Lee is darkly charming in the lead role, Brit Eckland is certainly not harsh on the eyes, (Sorry if I got the spelling wrong on her name), and Edward Woodward is wonderfully strict and pig-headed (no that's not a cop crack) in his attempts to solve the mystery.<br />This movie has become a must-see for me every Halloween.  There's something quite unique about it that's very difficult to describe and it really doesn't compare to any other film that comes to mind.  It sort of feels like Alice in Wonderland with pagan orgies, ritual sacrifices, and folk music.

I hope many people watch this film.

079074404X|5.0|When FORBIDDEN PLANET was released in 1956, science fiction films tended to be low budget black and white affairs that called to mind aliens attacking earth when Americans still recalled vividly GIs storming the beaches at Iwo Jima.  Director Fred Wilcox wanted to continue the very recent trend blazed by the slightly earlier THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD which similarly suggested that science fiction could reflect some serious subtexts.  Here, Wilcox took the essentials of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST and incorporated Walter Pidgeon in the Prospero role as Dr. Morbius, Anne Francis as Altaira (Miranda in THE TEMPEST), and the invisible monster from the ID as Caliban.  Moviegoers were immediately entranced for all the right reasons. Leslie Nielsen as the captain was properly heroic as the one who emerged as the most insightful of his crew despite his failing to register high on the Krell brain booster. It was he who directed his crew to defend their ship against the ID beast.  It was he who wound up with the lovely Altaira.  And it was he who determined how to defeat a creature that was deemed too impossible to exist.  Part of the allure of FORBIDDEN PLANET was the seamless melding of drama with comedy and ultimately with tragedy.  The drama lay in how the crew from earth could avoid being picked off one by one as the crew of the Bellerephon had been twenty years earlier. As did Shakespeare in many of his tragedies, FORBIDDEN PLANET has several moments of low comedy (mostly in the intonations of Robby the Robot interacting with the goofy Earl Holliman).  And the tragedy came not from the deaths of the crew but from the conversations of Dr. Morbius who sadly bemoaned the deaths of the technologically advanced Krell who in Morbius' words: \\"Could hardly have known what was killing them.\\" Tying these three disparate elements into a cohesive whole was the Freudian subtext of the monsters from the ID.  Morbius refused to grant until the very end that even his beloved Krell could yet retain a semblance of human emotion that might damn them just as thoroughly as it did for Freud's patients. There is a telling scene at the end when Morbius finally realizes the ghastly truth that it was he who was responsible for reviving the ID beast.  He faces the beast and denounces it, all the while knowing that he can no more disavow it than he could disavow his own inner demons.

B000VDDWDS|5.0|Having read 14 of the 20 or so novels in Patrick O'Brien's series on the British navy during the Napoleonic wars, this film captures the heart of the stories, ie, the relationship between \\"lucky\\" Jack Aubrey and Dr Stephen Maturin.  I've seen the original DVD (sans blu-ray) and loved it, both for picture and sound.  But, the blu-ray version is beyond description. Intense color contrasts and crushing, almost overwhelming sound makes this one of the best adventure films you'll ever see.  While the majority of the story follows the \\"Far Side of the World\\" book, it also is interspliced with scenes that are found in earlier series books.  This doesn't interfere with the screenplay, but only enhances the opportunity to get to know the characters better.  One can only hope that another movie based on these books is being considered.  The casting is superb and contains an eye for detail that the screenwriter caught perfectly.  Hundreds of reviews by top reviewers in every major newspaper and magazine have called these books the best historical novels ever written.  This film, and especially the blu-ray enhancement, certainly does them justice.
B00139XZF4|1.0|I read the first two books with great enthusiasm, and slowed a bit with the third as it petered out and became preachy.<br /><br />But I was excited about Golden Compass because it was a well written book and I was interested to see how it was ported to the big screen.<br /><br />Sadly, it was dumbed-down so much that most of the plot of the book - which was unraveled skillfully in the book - is revealed in the first 5 minutes of the movie through exposition.<br /><br />You are flat out told that people in this world wear their souls on the outside of their body in the form of familiar animals.  In the book you figure it out on your own and feel clever about it when you do so.<br /><br />This is the case for half the plot of the book. It is just told to you in synopsis form by a narrator and all of the joy of DISCOVERING things is taken from you.<br /><br />I don't know who the director is, but I intend to find out and avoid his future movies. Hopefully they hire him to finish out the series (doubtful, since this one was dismal at the box office) so he won't ruin any other movies for a while.<br /><br />In short, if you liked the book - and Golden Compass was a good book, even if you are an intolerant right wing person this book shouldn't have offended you, they don't start really offending the Catholics until book three in my opinion - then you will be disappointed by the movie.  It was just poorly done.<br /><br />A final note, yes - the special effects and cinematography were good, but any idiot with some money can hire good computer graphic companies and do that these days.  It was the story that was ruined by this shoddy directing.
0316042994|5.0|Evelyn Waugh's complex 1944 novel \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" defies easy description.  On one level, it is the bittersweet recollections of middle-aged British Army Captain Charles Ryder, whose unit is to be garrisoned at the vacant estate of Brideshead during the Second World War.  On another level, the bulk of the novel is Ryder's narrative of his life before the war, and his involvement with the wealthy Catholic family that owned Brideshead.<br /><br />At university, the young Ryder is befriended by his fellow student Sebastian, who is flamboyant, hard-drinking, and infatuated with Ryder in a way that he does not quite recognize.  He is introduced to Sebastian's disfunctional family, the Marchmains.  Ryder's relationship with Sebastian, and his later and very different relationship with Sebastian's sister Julia, make him both observer and participant in the family's fortunes.<br /><br />The plot is a bit of a slow-roller.  The reader is likely to be carried along by Waugh's most excellent prose, alternately funny and sad.  The plot makes a significant jump half-way through, to a married Ryder returning from a stint in South America to a series of tragedies wrapped around the Marchmain's Catholic faith.  The principal characters are drawn as fully rounded humans with their distinct flaws, and their humanity.<br /><br />\\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is highly recommended as a classic novel of an England now gone but brought to life through Waugh's undoubted gifts as a writer.

0783231032|1.0|It's pretty much agreed that \\"1941\\" is Steven Spielberg's career low.  He himself called this movie his failed attempt to make a National Lampoon flick.  This film is full of gags and would be jokes that bomb (pun intended). As a matter of fact the only funny scene in this movie is the introduction which is a clever parody of Spielberg's own \\"Jaws\\".  It's a shame really, considering this movie starred such big names of the day such as John Belushi, John Candy, Dan Ackroyd, Tim Matheson, and others.<br />But enough of bashing a movie that's already been bashed to death.<br /><br />If there is anyone who wants to see this movie out of sheer curiosity, they might as well skip this disc.  The DVD is presented not in anamorphic widescreen but in letter box, which means if you have a high definition television the black bars at the top at bottom will take up about half the screen leaving a squat, yet wide picture.  Also, the picture sound quality are dismal and flat screen TV's will pick up all the flaws, making this movie look like a VHS movie recorded off a TV station on the EP mode.  This is a bad movie on even a work disc.<br /><br />The only redeeming feature on this DVD is the \\"making of\\" documentary which goes into details of how the movie was a failure.  The doc is actually more interesting than the movie itself which should never be the case.  This is one to avoid.
B000000ISU|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with the sound of the MoFi gold CD.  This CD suffers from over-mastering... too much top and bottom end EQ was applied during mastering.  The result is midrange suck out which takes away power from the instruments, especially the  vocals and guitars.  The Hollywood CD sounds harsh so I recommend finding an old EMI CD from the UK.  It wasn't overdone during mastering and has a more natural and powerful sound.  Just turn the volume up a little.
B00003CXA2|4.0|an awesome tour through some historical moments, with a Forrest twist. one you could watch many times over.
0143038419|3.0|I have such mixed feelings about this book. For starters, in order to even read it I had to put aside a pretty major reservation: To finance one's personal spiritual quest by getting an advance on a book one will write about said quest seems more than a bit exploitative.    But I put this reservation aside, and I actually enjoyed the first two thirds or so. I think the Italy section was the strongest. At this point in the book, the author is still feeling rather unsure of herself and the mess her life has become. In other words, she's humble, and her self-deprecating humor is enjoyable. This section alternates between travelogue--which, as an armchair traveler, I was very attracted to--and the beginnings of a search for the causes of the author's personal misery. At this point, she seems excited and open-minded, and so was I.    The second section, in India, kept my interest, largely owing to Richard from Texas, a colorful character whose own struggles in life have made him a refreshing, humorous wise man of sorts. I enjoyed the descriptions of the Ashram and some of the other seekers there, although I had some issues with the rather sudden breakthrough the author claims to have had, moving from complete meditation ineptitude to a kundalini experience with the mere change of mantra. As a yogini myself, I was disappointed that there was virtually no discussion at all of her hatha yoga practice; the meditation was all.    It was in the third section of the book that I started to develop a bad taste in my mouth. It is never clear, even from the outset of the book, what the point of the Indonesian segment is. She talks about finding \\"balance\\" there, but did she need to go to another country to find that? And she failed to convince me that the Balinese live a balanced lifestyle at all. In fact, this entire section was riddled with contradiction, not the least--or least concerning--of which is the fact that twice, she admits to lying outright to her friends. Is this the behavior of a woman who has been growing spiritually and finding a personal connection to God? The last lie she tells, to her friend Wayan, is nothing more than a way of manipulating the woman into doing what she wants. The author rationalizes her behavior by saying she made her friend do what was good for her and her children, as if it's her business in the first place. Let me back up. The entire situation that culminates in the lie originates in the author's decision to email her friends and ask them for money to buy her needy friend Wayan a house. However, she does so without even asking Wayan if this is what she wants, and then when she gives the money to Wayan, instead of using it to buy a house for her, she winds up manipulating her with lies in order to get her to use the money the way it was intended. Does this not seem a bit controlling and meddling? And is controlling and meddling a sign of spiritual growth?    What's more, it's one thing to do a good turn for someone and ask for nothing in return. Many people help others anonymously as a way of doing good in the world as a purely selfless, spiritual act. But the entire time Liz Gilbert is raising this money for her friend, she is TELLING US ABOUT IT IN GREAT DETAIL. In other words, she reaps the ego benefit of her act, which, in my own humble opinion, is not a spiritual approach to helping others. In fact, it keeps the author at the center of the story.Of course, simultaneously, she's making money off the story in the form of sales of the book, which to my understanding have been quite substantial, but I guess one could argue she didn't know it was going to be a best seller.     Meanwhile, the man she calls \\"my medicine man\\" (another thing that rubbed me the wrong way; what makes him hers?) keeps mentioning how badly he needs money, yet it appears Gilbert is spending day after day talking with the man and allegedly gleaning gems of wisdom from him without doing any more in return than photocopying his notes and putting them into binders. Does she even pay him for reading her palm and imparting his knowledge? If she does, she doesn't mention it, although she seems bemused enough by his repeated request  to bring her Western friends to him for palm readings because \\"I am very empty in my bank.\\"  It seems only fair to pay a working medicine man who primarily serves a poverty stricken clientele for his time. In fact, there is something too colonial about the entire expate scene Gilbert becomes a part of. A bunch of well-to-do Westerners who can afford to live it up in an impoverished country live among and befriend the poor locals. Excuse me if I sound cynical, but Gilbert seems always to have the upper hand; her telling shows the local people revering her like some sort of goddess. Can you say British in India? French in Vietnam?    Yes, as other reviewers have said, Liz Gilbert 's memoir is self-absorbed, but what else could I expect from the story of one person's spiritual growth? I guess I expected her \\"growth\\" to look more selfless and less narcissistic. You know, more \\"spiritual.\\"
B001C08RHA|5.0|It is very entertaining, above all. I manages to keep everyone's interest throughout the whole movie. Action, adventure, fun. It is a keeper.
0375826726|4.0|Brisingr had hardly any plot points resolved. Eragon and Saphira spent most of their time flying back and forth between dwarves, elves, and the Varden. Paolini claims that there was too much story for one book, but you could have skipped the first 300 pages without missing anything of great importance. I'm an avid reader of fantasy, so I feel safe saying that I have read a lot of other books that were much less thick than Brisingr, but had a lot more going on. Paolini had already spoiled that a main character was going to die before the book was released - and that would have been the story's big twist - but thanks to Paolini's warning, it was neither surprising nor satisfying. Oh, and the dialogue was overly stiff and formal. Sentences were laced with too much description and too many big words. The book wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. If you have read Eragon and Eldest, I would recommend reading this book in order to finish off the series, but check it out at the library. Cutting the Inheritance trilogy into a \\"cycle\\" was just a tool for making more money, and the series is suffering because of it.
B001FOR5XU|4.0|Notwithstanding comparisons with the movie, this is a very creative and classic horror/sci-fi novella.  The plot is essentially that a virus has been unleashed on the earth that has turned everyone in the world into vampires.  One man has the anecdote and was able to remain untouched by the virus; however he has as yet been unsuccessful in saving others from the virus.  Thus, by day the main character hunts the vampires and conducts his experiments against them.  And by night, the vampires attempt to break into his \\"stronghold\\" and destroy him.  The vampires seem to loath the fact that someone exists who is not like them and has seemingly remained untouched by the virus.<br /><br />The above is the premise but of course, something has got to give....<br /><br />The story \\"I am Legend\\" is actually closer to a short story than a novel -less than 200 pages.  The particular edition I read included several other Matheson short stories, which I did not get all the way through.  I struggled through a couple but felt they sub-par especially by comparison to \\"Legend.\\"<br /><br />I give it 4 out of 5 stars, and definitely recommend it.  I probably still consider Dracula the essential vampire classic, and also recommend \\"the penguin book of vampire stories;\\" but \\"Legend\\" is a very good and is probably one of the better examples of horror and sci-fi crossover out there.  Again, it is a rather quick read.  Another reason I recommend it if you have seen the movie is to learn why it is called \\"I am Legend,\\" which is not entirely evident in the Will Smith version in my opinion.<br /><br />I also recommended the book to a friend who thought it was one of the best things he has read, and considers it a lot better than the movie versions.<br /><br />(Note - In addition to Will Smith's \\"I am Legend\\" the book has also been made into 2 other movie variations - \\"The last man on earth\\" starring Vincent Price, and \\"The Omega Man.\\" Starring Charleton Heston.  \\"The Omega Man\\" is a nice interpretation of the book and one of my favorite sci-fi movies, though it deviates from the book.)and one of my favorite sci-fi movies, though it deviates from the book.)
031606792X|1.0|This book was a disgusting sham of a conclusion. Meyer's writting was as poor as ever, but this time around she included the worst plot imaginable. Meyer obviously doesn't know how to write decent literature. Though the plot of the Twilight saga has always been shallow, this time Meyer thought she could suck in more readers by including a whole lot of sex references. This is a young adult's book, and teenagers definitely do not need to read about such garbage. I'm a teenager AND I didn't like it. Meyer took a gamble, hoping that mindless romances would over shadow her lacking story, but now her fans are turning from her. Also, this book sends a bad message to teenage girls. It basically says that in order to be happy in life all you need to do is find a rich boyfriend, dump all your friends, get pregnant at age 18, and never go to college. The story is unrealistic to the extreme. Bella, the main character. has to make no sacrifices in the end. She becomes a vampire, but because she's sooooooooo special, she can still function around humans, and she gets a baby because her husband is also sooooooooo special. I don't think I need to mention the fact that Meyer's vampires have no blood flow, rendering her theories on how Bella got pregnant inadequate. Oh, and it gets better, Jacob, the werewolf, imprints (falls in love) with the baby. THE BABY! Meyer has no problem with pedophiles it seems. I laugh at myself for ever reading this series. Breaking Dawn was so bad it neutralized anything good in the other books for me. AND, where was the long awaited vampire battle that Meyer told everyone would occur? Nope. Bella's \\"shield\\" protects everyone. A shield... the dumbest and most cheesy idea of a power ever. All the other vampire powers actually related to their personalities and human abilities. But Bella's doesn't apply. She's not a loving person. She's shallow, selfish, lustful, and a two-timer. Her power is Meyer's way of copping out of writing any more than she has too.Bella is a weak character who has no growth as a person from the start of the series to the end. Actually, she might have been more mature at the BEGINNING of the series. This book deserves its awful reviews, and if I could, I would give it zero stars.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This is a great movie and something that you  really should see. I really thought that the   movie was enjoyable and totally fun to watch.
B00005214X|4.0|The amount of quality material that George Harrison had ready for an LP at the time of the Beatles break-up was enormous.  Combining impressive and comprehensive musical arrangements with his penchant for the sugar sweet, he was able to create a triple-LP worth of pious beauty.  Phil Spector's pattented wall of sound works wonders on the determined Harrison's unique brand of folk-rock.  This record is touching in a way that only a Beatles member could make it, and never feels for me like a footnote to their wonderous career.  George Harrison still stands next to Lennon/McCartney as the little guy, who liked to write a simple, pretty song.  And there will always be those who think of him as their favorite Beatle because of it.

0399534601|3.0|I bought this book without really looking inside of it.  The cover was colorful and it was in the journaling section of the bookstore.  That seemed like enough to me.      I could have saved myself some money if I'd taken a minute to skim through it.  The majority of the book is about picking up things you find on the ground and starting collections with it.  She goes on at length about how if you are bored with your surroundings you just aren't looking hard enough.  I have to disagree.  Sometimes a location is just boring and telling me I'm not trying hard enough isn't going to change that reality.    This book will probably be appreciated by fans of her other books, but for those who aren't familiar with her work, if you are looking for eye candy or deep thoughts, this isn't the place to find it.

B001GKJ2DO|4.0|So, it's another stupid chick-flick, and I left the movie theater disappointed -- as usual; it's always a happy ending. I can see how someone would give it a one-star.  But the good parts of it (for me) have raised it to a four-star. I LOVE the song Mamma Mia, the scenery was gorgeous, and parts of it were really funny/cute. If your taste is like mine, don't pay attention to the actual plot, but the little stuff that makes it better.
B00007BKVC|5.0|This movie was exellent. It was brand new so there was nothing wrong with it.
B001DHXT2A|4.0|After the major success of 'Iron Man' and of course the special surprise that was revield to us at the end of the film, we were all eager for the next big Marvel hero movie. So In between the summer kickoff with 'Iron Man' and the heavily anticipated blockbuster 'The Dark Knight', Marvel decided to revive a hero who was brought to shame a few years earlier.<br /><br />'The Incredible Hulk' was a complete make-over from Ang Lee's monstorsity with a talaented cast (Well....not much to say about Liv Tyler) much better special effects and a deeper more emotional story. The film also paid tribute to the fan favorite television show as well as the comic book geeks who pretty much went to see the movie against their will. This movie left me satisfied again it was not the greatest movie I had ever seen but like 'Iron Man' the movie was fun and enjoyable. Of course with Marvel's big project that will be heading to theaters in the next few years the end of this film will also leave you with a smile on your face.
B000007MVM|4.0|In hindsight, Syd Barrett's debut album, The Madcap Laughs, shows a talented artist slowly going off the deep end. In comparing his work with Pink Floyd, this album is divided between elements of the space rock of \\"Lucifer Sam\\" and \\"Astronomy Domine\\" and stoner folk music with simplistic rhymes like \\"The Gnome\\" and \\"Bike.\\" The lyrics here are very personal and speak of love and the loneliness and depression that come when love is lost. This is not the meticulously crafted music that Pink Floyd would perform in the `70s. This is the work of a songwriter struggling with his emotions.  At times, you can hear Syd nearly falling off the proverbial tracks, most notably on \\"If It's In You\\" and \\"Dark Globe.\\" Most of the songs are very good although the quality peters out near the end. \\"Love You\\", \\"Here I Go\\", and \\"She Took a Long Cold Look\\" are joyous folk tunes while the desperate lyrics of \\"No Good Trying\\", \\"No Man's Land\\", and \\"Long Gone\\" are matched by the noisy vibe provided by former bandmates David Gilmour and Rick Wright. \\"Octopus\\" is probably the best song here and most closely resembles Pink Floyd. Other strong tunes here include \\"Terrapin\\", \\"Golden Hair\\", and the aforementioned \\"Dark Globe.\\" How much you like this album depends on your tastes. I'm more partial to early Pink Floyd so I listen to this quite often. However, you may not dig it if you're into Pink Floyd's more popular work.
B000GLKLCK|5.0|I bought this boxed set about 3 months ago, and I keep going back to it....   In short,THIS IS THE ONE TO BUY. What Murray Perahia and the English Chamber Orchestra have accomplished with Mozart's work is astonishing.  This is what \\"they\\" mean when they say that the music has \\"come off the page.\\" Superlatives fail to convey the wonderous result. This is ensemble playing at it's best.

This cd+dvd is worth every cent you spend. I have put in straight away the dvd player as I hardly could wait to hear the 5.1 mix. Wow, this one is one of the best i've heard in 5.1 surround. It's really an experience to hear this after you have heard the \\"normal\\" version all these years. The end product is well done and the music conneseur will love it. I hope there will be more to come from Mr. Miller in 5.1!
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I just finished the entire series a few weeks ago and i gotta say its one of the best shows! It's quite expensive to buy but worth every penny in my opinion!

Never will this show fail to surprise or excite you to go and watch the next episode! I hope you choose to buy this intriguing and action-packed series. Enjoy it!

045122499X|5.0|I'll make this brief. There really isn't a need to read Follett's previously released volume to understand this follow-up. It stands well on its own. A World Without End  continues the saga of a Cathedral town in the Middle Ages. The story is beset with political and humanistic intrigue during dangerously dark times. War, famine, plague are all unleashed upon the main characters. The struggle to not only survive the latest onslaught, but to rise above it. The tenacity of the human spirit is set against the despicable destruction of ignorant beliefs. I really enjoyed this novel. Despite it's length, it's quite easy to fly right through it. Follett's sentence structure is anything but superfluous. This works well to plow through anything that may cause a reader to put such a hefty word count. I'm hoping that Ken Follett will write yet another novel to follow this great piece of illuminating historical fiction.
B001F0VHEM|2.0|I appreciate the fact that musicians like to change, grow, expand, and try new things from album to album, but Funhouse, Pink's latest CD, wasn't in line with what I was expecting.<br /><br />\\"So What?\\" the first single, was a very catchy, upbeat song, which made me think the entire album would be.  A reviewer below me already pointed this out, and I couldn't agree more.  The album is very mellow for the most part, and as much as I appreciate Pink's voice and a few of her slower songs, it's definitely not her strong suit.  With that said, this album left me wanting more.<br /><br />I'd honestly give this album 2.5 stars, other than the 2 I had to give it.  It's not a good album by any means.  I'm greatly disappointed with it, especially coming off the heels of \\"I'm Not Dead\\", which I thought was her best album to date.  The trend didn't continue, and I'm sorry to that say Funhouse is an utter and complete bust.
B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle is the album that transitions from the early Syd Barret days to the sound most people know from \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were here\\"    As A huge fan of Floyd, and only 26 years old, I can easily see that this is an amazing musical performance regardless of the \\"Pink Floyd\\" name.    Haunting the then future Dark Side of the Moon sound, but still exploring the experimental \\"psychedelic\\" ( a watery classification) sound that was early PF.  It doesn't hold the memorable, sale friendly tunes of latter albums, but it is undeniably Floyd, and a simply great musical composure.    It's (thankfully) far from what could have been at the time or currently \\"pop\\" music.  To label it pretentiously; it's a sound requiring a lot of head space and imagination.    Not something you could play while vacuuming the house, but better for exploration of your own mind, and imagination.  This is one of those albums that is NOT for casual listening, and I'll go far enough to say that this is one of those works that in distant time, could reasonably compared to music greats at Bach or Beethoven, given due time.    Simply, if you deny the artistic merit of this album publicly, people should question the depth of your musical ear.  The only reason that I NOW review this album is that I have realized I lost the CD copy of this album, much much to my extreme dismay.
1892005034|5.0|This book is based on a foundation of hope--the assumption that people want to be life-giving in their interactions with others.  When interactions are not life-giving there is something that is blocking this basic human desire.  Rosenburg describes in practical ways how to communicate so as to remove barriers that arise.  There are even practice lessons.  I have found this book to be one I go back to time and again.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is without question the absolute best Civil War movie ever made.  It is beautifully filmed, expertly directed, and features stellar performances by Berringer and Daniels.  If you are a Civil War buff, you must have this DVD in your collection.
B00005JPO1|5.0|This is as good as the first movie. Indiana Jones kept up with the excitement and surprise of all his previous movies. I hope he makes some more movies in the future.

B00110K62U|5.0|This is an inpiring and wonderful dream cast edition of the musical play. The finale is phenomional with stars from many different nations singing in their native language! Don't miss it!
B001CD6FKI|4.0|My family, especially my 5 year old, really enjoyed the movie.  It's a lot of fun. However, it is short of five stars for a family movie due to one scene that is violent for no real purpose.
B00005JPO1|5.0|This is such a great movie from start to finish! I loved every bit of it. I was very impressed!
B000WTNCYA|5.0|I purchased this album on recommendation from I-Tunes and it has become one of the all-time favorites in my massive record and CD collection. Great voice and great styling make this a great listening experience. I am eagerly awaiting a followup album.  -- Herb Dower
B00158K0S8|5.0|This is a good war movie with wide landscape view from one scene to another.  I have enjoyed this movies in wide screen in theaters since I was a child. High resolution version just brings back all the good memory and saw all details audience deserves to see at home.
B0002JP4L4|3.0|After hearing that \\"Footloose\\" was being remade (just in time for its 25th anniversary; god I feel old) with Zac Effron of \\"High School Musical\\" fame in the lead role made famous by Kevin Bacon, I couldn't resist revisiting a movie that was a huge a part of my own high school years. No doubt about it, \\"Footloose\\" is a film that screams EIGHTIES, defining its era in the same way that \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" defined the disco days of the Seventies (and perhaps the way that the HSM films will be seen to define this decade in the future.) It's all here: big hair, tight sweaters, tighter jeans, legwarmers (in a brief opening montage) and super-slick Eighties pop music...it was the golden age of MTV, and in many ways, \\"Footloose,\\" like \\"Flashdance\\" before it, is a glorified, movie-length music video, especially in it's tightly choreographed dance scenes. To the credit of the makers of \\"Footloose,\\" they tried to give the film some dramatic heft, rather than let it become just another of the fluffy, insubstantial teen exploitation flicks of the time. The problem with that is the juxtaposition of drama and dance is so jarring at times that the movie seems to suffer from a split personality, not sure whether it wants to be a hard-hitting message movie or little more than a live-action cartoon (kids who supposedly have never danced before suddenly cutting a rug with the best of them at the prom? Please. And the type of dancing that Bacon's character seems to favor is far more artistic than you would see on the dance floors of big-city clubs, despite what he says.)     In his star-making role, Bacon plays Ren McCormick, a Chicago kid who finds himself the proverbial fish out of water when he loses his father (Death? Divorce? We're never quite told) and his mother moves the family back to her hometown, a small, rural, red-state community somewhere in the midwest. (At least that's what we're supposed to believe but the Rocky Mountains in the distance say otherwise; the film was shot in Utah.) The pastor of the local church (an excellent John Lithgow in his pre-\\"3rd Rock\\" days) wields a disproportionate amount of influence in the community--he also serves on the town council--and at his direction, the town has banned dancing. There hasn't been a prom in six years. Not surprisingly this doesn't sit well with the new arrival, so Ren sets out to change the ordinance while teaching his classmates about the forbidden thrills of dancing, and romancing the pastor's daughter, the strong-willed Ariel, who feels stifled by her family and the town. (She's also in a relationship with a local boy that is disturbingly abusive; the movie is ahead if it's time in portraying the problem of dating violence and abuse in teen relationships.) Not surprisingly Ren is quickly labeled a troublemaker and will face a variety of obstacles before he makes an impassioned speech (complete with Bible quotes) to persuade the council to overturn the ban, allowing the Senior class to have a prom and even bringing a much-needed healing to the pastor's family.    In lesser hands the dramatic content of \\"Footloose\\" could fall into maudlin TV movie territory; thanks to a talented cast of actors (including Bacon, Lithgow, Lori Singer as Ariel and an almost unrecognizable Sarah Jessica Parker in an early role as Ariel's best friend) it rises above that level and the characters have some complexity. Ren is no saint; in the name of introducing his friends to dancing, he takes them over the county line, sneaks them into a bar and manages to get in a fight. Lithgow's character is revealed as not so much a rigid moralist than a father whose unresolved anger and grief over the death of his only son (after a night of music- and dance-inspired drunken revelry) prompted the infamous ban. Indeed it is the pastor who talks some of the townsfolk out of conducting a book burning at the local library. Diane Wiest portrays the pastor's wife as a woman who secretly sympathizes with the kids, and whose meek exterior hides a spine of steel.    It will be interesting to see how \\"Footloose\\" fares as a remake; will they keep it true to the original and maintain its gritty dramatic edge (the film drew a PG rating when it came out but would likely be PG-13 today), or, given Effron's popularity, will they be tempted to turn it into another \\"High School Musical\\" type production that's all sweetness and light? Hopefully not, because in the end what makes \\"Footloose\\" appealing is its reality and humanity, not just it's dance numbers.

B001H5X7JS|5.0|Best movie I have seen this year .....nuff said.....oh erm just behind The Dark Knight of course.  It is so funny without resorting to stupid slapstick and antics (heres looking at you Zohan).  It is definitely the thinking man's comedy.  Highly recommended.
B000Z66RSS|3.0|What is the song that's playing when the kid with the curly hair is dancing on the steps at school? The part where he's showing the main girl that he can dance? Anyone know which song I am talking about? Thanks.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|i had high hopes for this movie.   I just got a brand new 61\\" Samsung DLP and we tried to watch the movie in 3d.  The 3d process they use is the WORST 3d experience i've ever had.... It was like watching a black and white movie that was tinted purple and green. After 15 minutes the colors started giving us all headaches and we turned the movie off.    DO NOT BUY
B0015HOFZI|5.0|This is a great little unit. It's not \\"audiophile\\" quality, but it does the job and at a great price. My old vinyl was not the best quality either. Too many times my vinyl was not treated the way it should have been. But, when you can't get the music anywhere else, this unit works well for making the transfer to digital. The software does a good job of \\"cleaning\\" up the sound.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This is more about Blu-Ray than about the movie, which is super awesome, but in Blu-Ray format rocks!<br />I'm what people call an \\"early adopter.\\" This means over the years I've tossed Beta VCR's, Windows ME and now my HD-DVD player. HD-DVD was great, it had it all, stunning picture and phenomenal sound. But I have to hand it to Sony (who after dropping the Beta format, I haven't bought anything with the Sony brand since, and my Blu-Ray player is a Panasonic brand) got it right with the Blu-Ray format. Not only is the sound and picture crystal clear but somehow it is actually sharper that HD-DVD. My Blu-Ray player is connected to a Samsung 720 DLP, but I've seen both Blu-Ray and HD-DVD connected to the same a Samsung 46\\" 1080p LCD and Blu-Ray literally blows HD-DVD away.<br />Again, the movie is fantastic, but if you want the true theater experience, you have to watch it in Blu-Ray with at least 5.1 digital surround sound.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|Our family absolutely LOVED! the movie in the theater!  The 3d effects used (polarized) totally blew us away, and it was a fun movie because of those wonderful effects!  BUT DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THE DVD, cause the wonderful effects ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE 3d VERSION!!! AND, CONVENIENTLY, THE DVD PACKAGING DOESN'T TELL YOU THIS!!!  If you're a fan of the 1950's style red-green type of so-called \\"3d\\" films..you'll like it.  But it's unwatchable - as was the case in the 1950s, so is the case with this dvd - the colors are completely messed up in the \\"3d\\" version, and the only watchable version is the 2d version...a sad disappointment, considering we were waiting with money in hand for this DVD release.  Save yourself the disappointment...put your money elsewhere.
0440224764|4.0|I enjoyed reading The Partner by John Grisham.  Mr. Grisham is an addicting story teller and this book reminded me more of his earlier works.  The story is fast and furious but easy to follow.  It is hard to put down once you start and like other novels Mr Grisham has written it is disappointing when the story finally ends.  You want to know more and more.<br /><br />I would recommend the novel for those that enjoyed A Time to Kill and the Pelican Brief.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|this movie rocks its perfect 1080p is so cool whene lookin at hulks eyes get goosebumbs from this movie its worth buyin only problem i have is that the case holds 1 disk but it comes with a digital copy in a white sleeve why couldnt the guys who made this special green case make it for 2 disks its just a lil thing thats buggin me.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Two of the disks in this set were bad, Amazon replaced the entire set with no hassles.    This is great spin-off of Dr. Who, a little more adult than the kid friendly Dr.  All of the family, Mom, Dad and the Tenn Boys, enjoy it.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi Carlile has an awesome sound.  Some songs start out sounding soft and heartwarming but then tear into something guttural and more open than any artist I can think of.  Folk rock is definitely what comes to my mind.  I can't stand albums that repeat the same style over and over again.  Brandi's style is varied, refreshing, and something I listen over and over again at work without being worn out.
B000EQ5SRK|5.0|Which is more fun? Depends on you. Hard to decide? Check out both sides of the story.  Always carry a camera.
0765348276|5.0|I have just finished reading this after   Variable Star(Spder Robinson collab) and Stranger in A Strange Land, and this definitely felt at home, just from these reviews alone, we put authors like Mr. Scalzi in Heinlein's shadow, I'd like to think of it as in Heinlein's lineage, as he's affected sci-fi readers. All I can say is damn, this book was satisfying.     There is some of the darkest humor/irony in this book and just had to share:  One of the alien species in this book look like deer devastate a human colony and breed babies into Veal (gutwrenchingly disgusting to think of).    Another thing I couldn't stop thinking was the image of hot she-hulks (green superhuman women).    That's enough spoiler from me, read it!
B000CNESU8|4.0|This film is in a way an adventure film about a TV newscaster who becomes a political predicator for the good of the TV channel, though he had been fired before this transformation. But the ratings are evanescent and under pressure from one top executive he shifts from absolute anarchism to some kind of responsible anarchism and that tinge makes him lose all his audience. Since it had all started with his menacing to commit suicide on the air on the following day when he was first fired, they just set up his being assassinated on the air which is supposed to be very good for the ratings. Apart from that façade, the film explores slightly but with no real conviction about what they say the circles of Angela Davis and the black revolutionaries and terrorists of California, without great conviction because you can imagine these people would never be authorized to get close to a TV station and would have been put on the top list of the wanted people by the FBI. The second side kick is the love affair between an old \\"middle-aged\\" news programmer and his young ambitious but definitely delirious psychotic female successor that ends in bull of course. The film is interesting and entertaining but it hardly qualifies as a truthful or even believable version of reality. How can a black man be authorized to go into an auditorium with a machine gun... under his coat for sure, but.... Even under President Ford that sounds pretty iffy. The only thing that it reveals very well is the paranoia of all Americans who are afraid of being bought out by the Japanese, then the Arabs, then the Chinese. In fact they are not bought out, they are selling themselves out to the higher bidder because they have such a deficit that they are beggars on a roundabout if not the dancing monkey on a merry-go-round whose tail the children must catch to get a free trip.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID
031606792X|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Twilight saga, and I have to say that this book was a wonderful ending to a fabulous series.  I have been loking forward to Bella becoming a vampire since the 1st book, and was not disappointed - she's beautiful, and her shield gift fits her perfectly, since she always tries to protect the ones she loves.         I adored Reneseme and all she brought to the story, and the climax was thrilling and exciting.  And, of course, Edward was as hot as always (sigh)!        Over all, the 2nd best book of the series (Twilight being the best).  I highly recomend this book for anyone who is a fan of this great book saga!
B001E7OO2I|3.0|Wow...I mean, I really do love this man. He actually went to my alma mater (big up U Penn!) so I feel a lil connection with him. But I would be remiss if I was not honest about what is going on here. Mr. Legend has served up a mixed bag with this latest cd. I very strongly like about 5 or 6 songs..leaving me with about half the album that doesn't do much for me. At first, I thought that I wasn't a big fan of his last project, Once Again, especially when comparing it to his ground breaking first album. But sadly, I just realized that I actually like his 2nd album better, and I really hate when artists steadily begin to make poorer musical choices. Anyway, let me try and say something nice about this latest offering. I happen to LOVE Greenlight, along with the rest of all people with good hearing. It's Over is great and Everybody Knows is growing on me. Quickly, with Brandy, is GREAT! I love this song, and it's great to hear her coming back. Love the Estelle song, Satisfaction, and Take me Away. The rest, SNORE! My friend actually heard Legend perform This Time live with only a piano and he claims it was amazing. I think I believe him, and wish Legend had been inclined to keep it beautiful and sparse like that on the album, but alas, he did not. I REALLY hate the last song...super super cheesy and just...well take an listen for yourself and decide. All in all, I wish I could string together the songs that I like, cause I really do like them a great deal, and make a little mini album. Not Feeling the Filler John!!
B00001ODGR|5.0|One of the best concerts produced on dvd.  I bought the Caught in the Act dvd at the same time, and even though both dvds contain many of the same songs, Return to Paradise is by far the better concert.  The band is in full force playing almost all its hits.  It would have been nice if they had played one or two songs from Kilroy Was Here however.    All in all, a great dvd for any Styx fan or 80's music fan in fact.
031606792X|2.0|Let me first say I absolute the other books in this series.  I read them all in a matter of days.  I was so excited for to read Breaking Dawn....    SPOILERS- This book failed.  It did not feel like the other books.  The chemistry was gone BUT the worst thing that happened was with the character of Jacob- GROSS he imprints on Bella's daughter.  Bella, who he loved, who he kissed, who he wanted to marry, etc BUT then he is decicated to her daughter instead...yuck.  And he no longer felt the intense feelings for Bella anymore.  Jacob could have been imprinted on someone else not a baby- Bells's baby.  Mrs Meyer failed the character of Jacob and in my opinion ruined the series by this book.      Sorry I truly wanted to like this book- I loved the others so much!!!!  I am truly sad this book was written this way.
0316042994|5.0|A great American classic well worth re-reading.  Rich language, complex story line that stimulates good discussion.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Amazing movie, action packed, and exciting.  Robert Downey, Jr. has great comedic timing and sense of sarcasm, yet you also see him develop a sensitivity towards what is really being done with the weapons his character develops.  Jon Favreau has outdone himself, and Jeff Bridges is perfect for Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger.  You've never really seen him as a villain, so this is an interesting turn for him.  Gwyneth Paltrow is amazing- so great as Pepper Potts.  Terrence Howard (Rhodey) supports Downey, Jr. so well- he offers that \\"down to Earth\\" behavior that Tony Stark needs to stay grounded himself.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|This Bushnell is easier to use than the next size up.  While the optics aren't quite as crisp, they are very good. It is easy to focus and doesn't require real steady hands to find the pin and get a distance measurement.  Also, the small size and clip on case are easy to attach to my golf bag so it is always with me when I go to the course. We have both this one and the other one but this one is my preference.
B00000ING2|4.0|This product was delivered on time, I think it actually might have been a little early. It was also in very good condition when it got here. The disc had no problems.
B0015AARJI|3.0|This was a new Dualshock PS3 controller, which works fine.  Good price.  Even better if you buy the cable to charge up the controller from a dollar store instead of some high end cord.
B001AJVR5M|4.0|Okay, so A Little Bit Longer isn't The Wall or Thriller or Nevermind or Abbey Road, etc etc. But in the ever exploding genre of teen Disney pop, this record blows them all out of the water. Them, being stars like Miley Cyrus who have ushered in the latest round of pop music. These days, thankfully it's not all bubblegum. The Jonas Brothers seem to be the most focused and with the most potential of all these artists. Their second album is an extension of the debut: they're maturing, and it shows in song structure and in their writing. Songs drastically change course (\\"Lovebug\\"), their changing voices offer some really great rapsy vocals, depending on how you hear it of course (\\"Sorry\\") and let's face it the hooks are killer (\\"Burning Up\\"). Every song has its own appeal and nothing ever gets tiresome. There are power pop ballads, like \\"Can't Have You\\" and \\"Sorry\\", but the brothers are so convincing, nothing seems contrived or gimmicky. Sure they are part of a string of teen money-makers but its clear they are no one's puppets. One reviewer said they were manufactured by the guy who was over N'Sync and Backstreet Boys. Ummm..NO they weren't. Yes, they are part of the Disney pack, but with an album like A Little Bit Longer, it's very likely they're going to keep branching out. I'd like to see them reach audiences outside of tween girls. It's getting about time that other music fans discover them too. These guys are the real thing! I just feel like most of the bands that are out now take themselves way too seriously and they don't sound like they're having much fun. Sure, I like Coldplay and bands like that, but shouldn't there be a place for Jonas Brothers too? There is more to life then politics and self righteousness. I'd like to see them stick around for a long time.
B001G5IJVK|1.0|hey kiss \\"fans - get it through your head. As long as you keep buying these array of compilations, they'll keep puting them out. It's strictly about the money, not music. Let me make it simple for you. Stop buying = no more repackaging of old music. Then maybe they'll go away.
B0010X73ZG|3.0|**1/2 2007. Based on Stephen King's [[ASIN:0451223292 The Mist (Previously Published as a Novella in 'Skeleton Crew')]] and written and directed by Frank Darabont. Dozens of customers are being trapped in a supermarket when a strange fog covers up their town. They finally find out that alien animals are hidden in the mist. Stupid monster movie that uses all the genre clich&eacute;s and is, in the end, just a rip-off of George Romero's [[ASIN:B000UR9QIK Dawn of the Dead [Blu-ray]]]. If you're looking for a genuine monster movie, take a look at Joon-ho Bong's [[ASIN:B000PKG8TW The Host (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]. This one is already forgotten.
1596680199|5.0|This book is remarkably thorough - I would love it if all art resource books out there were structured like this one. There is a comprehensive section on materials and the instructional parts are for specific techniques, not projects that have a narrow focus. There are plenty of project ideas illustrated, but this book really gives you the tools to create a vast number of beads and then use them creatively from there. For those who have never beaded before, there is also a great section on the materials and basic techniques necessary to turn polymer clay beads into wearable jewelry.
0385340990|5.0|This is a sweet book; a so called \\"cozy\\" which underneath its charming surface tells a little known (at least by me) story of the Nazi occupation of Guernsey. An endearing cast of characters rebelling against the Nazi's via reading, literature and love for your neighbor. A strong message wrapped in a sweet candy wrapper. If you like cozys, you'll love this book.
0321525655|4.0|The book is its own best review. It is engaging, persuasive and memorable practicing what it preaches and giving a good presentation. The advice is a bit esoteric if you are looking for liniar, rational, step-by-step methodology and is obviously based much more on intuitive thought and art, but this is exactly what the author promised. The book does have sufficient building blocks and practical instructions to get started in the presentation process, but goes far beyond that in scope. The author does seem to capture the true intent of a presentation as being an opportunity to influence and persuade an audience rather than death by power point with data saturated slides. This is not a hold your hand, step-by-step guide to great presentaions. You can not be led to that level of performance. This book however does clearly point the way and encourage you to walk the path to giving great presentaions, but the reader still needs to do the walking.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|all i can say is do not buy anything from amazon. com because although this one came we ordered season 4 of two& a half men they shipped it twice or at least they said they did after waiting 3& a half months for the dvd to arrive it never did their customer service was very rude and were either unable & unwilling to help us with this matter we went to wal mart & picked it up with no problem & it only took them one week to get it for us amazons service stinks.
0061537934|5.0|One of the most memerable books I have ever read. Just finished it in one sitting, only had to pause when my eyes were too full of tears to see the text. This book is about life and death as seen through the eyes of one with perhaps more wisdom than we.   Brings back memories of all the animals that have shared my life and the hope that we will meet again.  I really hope and pray that there is a real \\" rainbow bridge\\" and we can all meet again forever.  Punch up \\"rainbow bridge\\" if you do not know about it. Bernie
0312427646|5.0|In this short hilarious novella, Bennett imagines a scenario where, following some errant Corgis, the Queen discovers the mobile library parked in the grounds of Buckingham Palace and feels obliged to borrow a book, out of courtesy. One book leads to another (as books will tend to do), and before long, Elizabeth has developed a serious reading habit. The consequences are far-reaching, and very funny.<br /><br />Within this framework, Bennett provides an incisive (and entertaining) exploration of the power of reading. Despite being one of the planet's most-traveled inhabitants, her majesty's horizons are broadened in ways she could not have imagined.<br /><br />A satisfying, highly entertaining, read.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I was totally over the moon with the set. The first I hear of this movie was an internet promo with the very cleaned up audio from BLACK SABBATH's song the same title, and  some basic visuals. And so, I waited until the film came along, but due to circumstances beyond my control I could not get to the theatre to see it, and wow did I want to see it in the Cinema.  Anyways, the film is just totally fiery from start to surprise finish. After reading Ironman in the 70s, he has appeared as everything I wanted. The re-writes in recent years will no doubt try to cheat me of that from what I can gather, but this is something that a long term fan can really get into.  The DVD even has some really cool, IPOD style interfaces. The Computers that Stark uses are just ultra cool, and the virtual generation gear is amazing.  For the first time ever, I totally agree with all the deletes they made on the movie. This one has no commentary, unfortunately, and I think that they could have done one quite easily for total entertainment value.The Ironman Suits from the basic, made from Necessity, to the ones done through Technology, all have the iconic Ironman Appeal.This is one DVD where only the double set will suffice. The extras tell the story that the commentary does not.John Favreau has crafted another piece together with a team of people who each do their own superb thing. It was also great to see a bit of video of Stan Winston, even though it was his studio and not him, himself who did the work. The Cover is very cool too, since the outer cardboard image comes off to reveal the man underneath, truly a well thought out package.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|A must have BD for sure.  Great movie if you like the comic book stuff.  Downey is great as this role.  Can't wait for Ironman II.
B000GPIPTW|5.0|Here's where it all began.  Brian Wilson's masterpiece shows you how it's done.  There's not a throughaway on the whole album which is wrought with feeling and harmonies.  Don't miss this one.
1416562605|4.0|Arawad Adiga's \\"The White Tiger\\" is a fascinating story about the underworld of modern India.  Unlike the India that is common in Bollywood films and the Western media, \\"The White Tiger\\" creates a portrait of a country that is brutal, corrupt, and cut throat.  The narrator Balram separates Indians into two groups--the rich and the rest--and describes how he realizes its worth sacrificing everything to escape poverty and become one of the wealthy.<br /><br />The novel is written as a series of seven long letters from Balram to the Premier of China.  This unconventional style took a little getting used to, but after I did the novel was very gripping.  Agida's style is sharp--he often uses the names of his characters or objects to ridicule them--but you also can really understand Balram's frustrations.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to someone who wants to get a different perspective on modern India--one that isn't exclusively focused on shiny new skyscrapers and outsourcing.  The hunger of the characters in this novel is alarming--you can see why India has quickly become a challenger on the global stage.

B000P46QTA|5.0|This movie is just fantastic.  And on blu ray it shines and delivers<br />it's timeless story with even more clarity.  The communist system with it's intolerance and inhumanity even in regards to the most minute aspect of peoples lives is depicted here with a knowing production.  Each actor protrays their character in a light of reality and highly perfected skill.<br />The story is about  a man whose whole life is based around violating others rights and hunting down enemies of the state with precision and robot like slavish duty. The secret police or stasi by 1984 was not the murder machine it was in previous decades yet it still killed the souls of it people and the robot like watcher only becomes a good man after he<br />spies on his intended targets.  This movie won awards and delivers solid<br />drama and an very important story for the ages. The details need to be seen by the viewer but over 200 people took the time to write about how much they loved this movie and if you love solid dramas then this is the one for you.

B0016K40KY|5.0|If any movie ever deserved to be on blu ray this is the one.  It is a cinematic masterpiece.  This two disc version has the best print around but it still needs a blu ray release.  This great picture has it all and you have 382 other reviews to tell you that.  The man the story is about proves that history is more fascinating than fiction and Lawrence was a great man indeed.  He had his troubles just like the great actor who protrays him in this  movie Peter O Toole , whose alcoholism robbed him of alot of his life by making it a giant haze.  Thankfully he's still around to provide us with great performances like he did in \\"venus\\".<br />Every scene in this movie is fantastic although they gloss over Lawrence of arabia's rape by the turkish troops.  In middle eastern lands it is quite common for many men guards or others to rape male prisoners and that incident drove Lawrence over the edge leading to him to slaughter the turks in large numbers.  Which marred the man's greatness to a degree, but in those days who could he talk to about it?  In spite of that watching this  movie is like watching perfection in cinematography and pacing. It just does everything right and the story is a important one
B0000E1ALR|5.0|thank you for sending a wonderful CD, a great collection of Bruce's music over the decades. Thanks
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This album is, musically, really good! But when the drums come in, the sound distorts annoyingly. Yes, I've checked every setting, volume and plugin! I was in shock the first time I heard it. I couldn't believe that the biggest metal band in THE WORLD could hire such a crappy sound engineer! After some attempts to ignore the poor sound quality I found myself pleased with the outcome. It's not their best, but after St. Anger, this is beyond my expectations. I can't compare it to any of their previous albums, but Garage Inc. comes to mind. It's got that Danzig/Misfits thing going on, which is really old old old school. Seems they haven't \\"edited\\" the songs. They're pretty long. There's only one song shorter than 6 1/2 minutes, and that's 5 minutes(!)     I give this album 4 stars because of the sound quality, otherwise it would definately have been 5 stars.
B00005LK94|5.0|Just like it's hard to remember that \\"Rudy\\" is based on a true story - what with the climactic scene being the sight of the ultimate long-shot being carried off the Notre Dame football field to resounding cheers, it's almost impossible to believe that \\"Fly Away Home\\" is based on a true story.    But it is.    The always-reliable Jeff Daniels plays Tom Alden, a Canadian inventor/tinkerer.  His ex-wife is killed in car crash, but his precocious daughter Amy (Anna Paquin, also excellent) survives.  Tom takes her in, and soon Amy becomes attached to a gaggle of orphaned Canadian Geese.  They adopt her as her mother, and soon she can't walk anywhere without an adorable caravan of stumbling, bumbling goslings.  Penguins may be the most adored birds, but these geese give them a run for their money.    Steadfastly refusing to clip their wings, the Aldens confront the fact that these are migratory birds.  What to do, when Amy can't teach them to fly?  The answer is simple - build two ultralights and guide them to a bucolic-yet-threatened bird sanctuary in North Carolina.      This is quite simply a wonderful family film where the heroes are straightforward, good-hearted people and the villains, if there are any, aren't all that bad either.  Adapted from Bill Lishman's autobiography, the movie strikes true note after true note.    This shouldn't be a surprise - the director is Carroll Ballard, who directed the delightful \\"Black Stallion\\" and \\"Never Cry Wolf.\\"  Chief cameraman Caleb Deschanel creates a magical visual storyboard, replete with the most wonderful shots of flying birds this side of \\"Winged Migration.\\"    Put \\"Fly Away Home\\" in the pantheon of Great Family Films - it will always have a home there.
0192853619|5.0|Gowers is a very good mathematician.  As a Field's Medalist (the equivalent of a Nobel Prize) he knows his stuff.  This book is about how mathematicians approach problems and think about their subject.  There is little \\"higher mathematics\\" in this book.  If you want to know how mathematicians think about problems, this book is for you.  Too often mathematics is seen as \\"formulas and rules.\\"  This book dispels these myths by showing mathematics is about ideas and problems.
B000XA5K48|1.0|I watched this movie the other day with my friends and it feels like some very bad video game where one guy is invincible. The plot makes no sense and the blood and gore is overdone. It is basically about some British Agent that kills around 500 people by the end of the movie mainly by a Magnum. Too much sexual stuff; definitely not for under 17. Don't waste your time.

The video and sound are so much better than the normal DVD, it is about the same quality as blue-ray, but much cheaper to buy if you can find one. However you need to have a HD-DVD player to play the disc.
0307455874|4.0|When I first heard Barack Obama speak, he made me cry.<br /><br />I'm not an American, nor am I prone to tears, but I was surprised to find myself responding so directly to, of all things, a US Presidential candidate, embroiled as he was at the time in a battle with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Where was the spin, the desperate promises, the trashing of opponents, the hardened cynicism?<br /><br />Obama was so clear in his thoughts, and espoused them with such gentle power that you couldn't help but be impressed by what at least appeared to be real integrity. But most of all, it was his unflinching belief in democracy as it should be; principled, transparent, empathetic, practical yet idealistic. Not the deceptive, cynical game that it has evolved into in more than a few democratic nations, including ours in Australia.<br /><br />Whatever side of the fence you're on, Obama is an impressive communicator. In person, he's electric. In other forms of media - edited footage, TV commercials, written word - he is still excellent, but there is just no substitute for looking this man in the eye.<br /><br />For that reason 'The Audacity of Hope', an extended dissertation on Obama's political principles and positions is an enjoyable, intelligent, sometimes moving read. The book literally makes you feel sane as you read it. But the written word places a necessary barrier between Obama and his reader. He writes well and argues his political positions, always with his greatest weapon by his side - the ability to not just see, but also feel the opposition's point of view. Most reassuringly, everything in this book, at least a year old is completely consistent with his current policies in pushing for the White House.<br /><br />Consistent with his belief that issues cannot be compounded into 'sound bites', Obama fleshes out his positions and indeed the cases for and against. One is left with the feeling that issues are indeed complex and legitimately fought over, but there is a sensible way through many of them, if we keep our expectations in check.<br /><br />Agree or disagree with his points of view, he argues them well, with empathy and passion and with practical solutions that are not pie in the sky (though cynics of course can always find an excuse for why reforms cannot be made). For Obama a bright future is not a dream, it's a very real goal.of them, if we keep our expectations in check.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|If you know nothing in particular about the life of Beatrix Potter, this movie may surprise you.  It is a different time, a different set of social rules.  Even though Beatrix tries to respect the social parameters her parents are intent upon, she is someone who has her own personal goals.  She is determined to advance her own goals all the while trying to please parents who will never be pleased.  The 23 books that Beatrix produced over her lifetime and which many of us take for granted as \\"always being there\\" were produced at great personal expense -- but in the end with great personal satisfaction.  A movie that makes you feel anything is possible.
0312370849|4.0|The Backstory<br />In the summer of 1942, the Vichy government of France rounded up over 12,000 Jewish Parisians and locked them in a local sports stadium called the V&eacute;lodrome d'Hiver. They were trapped for five days with only scraps of food, one working water tap and five restrooms. I'll pause here and let you consider that statement. Twelve thousand men, women, and children.<br /><br />After five days of this hell on earth, the survivors were shipped off to camps where children under the age of fourteen were physically - forcibly - wrenched from their parents, who were sent ahead to Auschwitz. 35 of these adults would survive.<br /><br />The 3,500 children who were left behind ranged in age from fifteen months to thirteen years of age. They were left to fend for themselves in a local camp called Drancy and then, under the ruse of being reunited with their parents, were shipped to Auschwitz as well. Not one of these of these children survived. 3,500 young Parisian children....every single last one of them killed.<br /><br />The Synopsis<br />This sordid, horrific moment in French history is the background for Tatiana de Rosnay's powerful novel, Sarah's Key. It is the story of two women: Julia, a modern-day journalist and Sarah, a young girl separated from her family during the Vel' d'Hiv roundup. Chapters alternate between 1942 and modern times and as the story progresses, the two characters accelerate down paths that will intersect in a most unusual way.<br /><br />The Warning<br />I feel compelled to warn readers that this is not a book for the faint-of-heart. Have a Kleenex box nearby. If you are a parent, prepare to have your gut and heart wrenched out of you. Tatiana de Rosnay will transport you into a place in history so ugly that most people would rather forget. It is not comfortable. In fact, the repercussions of the roundup for young Sarah's family are so horrific, I wondered whether the author was a parent at all (she is).<br /><br />The Literary Criticism<br />The format of alternating time periods and characters with chapters abruptly ends about midway through the story. I found this disappointing because there was so much more to Sarah's story that I wanted to hear from her perspective. I couldn't find a clear reason why the author chose to do this and it bothered me throughout the second half of the novel.<br /><br />By the end of the novel, loose ends were tied up a bit too tritely. It felt a tad forced and quite honestly, the story wasn't served by it. If anything, this is what kept the novel from a five-star review from me.<br /><br />The Recommendation<br />Regardless of these small criticisms, Sarah's Key is not to be missed. Do not (I repeat: do not) shy away from this novel because you are uncomfortable with the subject matter. The true horror of the Holocaust only has meaning when it becomes real to you. Dry words droning out statistics in a history textbook can never illuminate the monstrosity of this event. It takes a talented author to transport you so vividly back in time, for as the Holocaust retreats farther and farther into history, we lose the immensity of the event. And if we lose that, it loses meaning.<br /><br />Zakhor. Al Tichkah.<br />Remember. Never Forget.cters with chapters abruptly ends about midway through the story.

Freddie Mercury was a fantastic frontman and their Live Aid performance will always be remembered as the best 20 minutes of that show.

Here's what you will find as far as the 4 discs go:<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />* Extended cut of the movie with director commentary<br /><br />Disc 2:<br /><br />Special features & digital copy including:<br /><br />* A Conversation w/SJP & Michael Patrick King<br /><br />* The Fabulous Fashion of Sex and the City: A detailed look at Patricia Field's fantastic creations, from dresses to purses to shoes.<br /><br />* Additional Scenes with optional director commentary<br /><br />* Fergie in the Studio: watch Fergie record the title track for the movie soundtrack.<br /><br />* Putting Sex on Screen: Learn the challenges of putting the TV show onto the \\"big ' (pun intended) screen.<br /><br />* The Ladies of Sex & The City: exploring the lead characters, accessory by accessory.<br /><br />* The Making of Sex and the City: Experience an insider's view of the film shoot.<br /><br />Disc 3:<br /><br />Additional special features including:<br /><br />* SJP & MPK: The Complete Conversation - Feature-length commentary of the Theatrical version of the film exploring their experiences in making the movie. This is very cool; with a constantly changing frame-within-frame format that has both the movie and SJP/MPK talking, it adds the extra visual dimension to the standard commentary format. There is a menu for each scene so that you can go directly to your favorite scene to hear/see SJP/MPK's commentary.<br /><br />* The Party That Never Was: Exclusive converage of the DVD launch event at the NY Public Libary. Since Carrie's original vision of her wedding at the NY Public Library \\"never was,\\" the DVD launch party carried the theme through. This is really an incredible look at the planning of this media event. 3 out of 4 of the leads made it to the party; Kristin Davis was in the Carolinas launching her fashion line apparently. The classical NY landmark is transformed into a pink homage to the movie, complete with gigantic Carrie-brides on stilts (with the bluebird in their veils, of course!).<br /><br />* The Wedding Dress Photo Shoot: spend an entire day with SJP in preparation for the Vogue wedding dress shoot.

0060558121|5.0|The old gods walk through the pages of Neil Gaiman's \\"American Gods.\\" They also drink, curse, fight, scowl, gamble, and struggle to make a living as prostitutes, grifters, morticians, and taxi drivers. Life is hard for immortals when the masses who once worshipped them have forgotten them - or worse have embraced newer, shinier gods (like TV and technology).<br /><br />Gaiman's novel is like a Salvatore Dali painting - a wickedly warped distortion of America that crystallizes the essence of this strange, unique nation. It's a complicated blend of mythology, folktale, horror, mystery, and literature. Throw that into a blender and add one part road movie and you've got \\"American Gods.\\"<br /><br />Gaiman pokes jagged holes into the nature of American beliefs and the transitory nature of American convictions and culture. America is a patchwork of beliefs here - a giant, moldy quilt. But it's this mish-mash of beliefs that make the United States unique and a difficult place for ancient gods to make a living.<br /><br />Gaiman takes readers on a journey through the heartland. The story features hard-luck Shadow, a sharply intelligent, but quiet-tongued loner. He's sprung from prison where he spent the last few years paying off his debt for a crime commissioned by his wife (which went horribly sideways when his partners betrayed him).<br /><br />He's released a few days earlier so he can attended Laura's funeral. His wife has been killed in a car wreck with his best friend - while Laura was giving him oral sex before the crash. It's this betrayal of his true love that numbs Shadow into an emotionless shell through most of the book.<br /><br />An old con-man named Mr. Wednesday latches on to Shadow and offers him a job as a bodyguard. His prospects grim and his future bleak, Shadow reluctantly takes the offer. Here's where the book transforms from finely crafted crime novel - to the fantastic. Mr. Wednesday, you see, is the American avatar of the Norse god Odin, the All-Father.<br /><br />Mr. Wednesday represents the old gods who came to America with the early immigrants - people from Norway, Denmark, Russia, Ireland, North Africa, China, etc... These old gods have been cast aside by new gods for technology, TV, transportation (and, yes, even Jesus, although Christianity plays only a minor role in the book). Mr. Wednesday travels across the country recruiting gods to join him in a battle against the new gods. The metaphor of a storm approaching sets the tone for the story.<br /><br />Much of the joy in reading \\"American Gods\\" comes from identifying the old gods Mr. Wednesday and Shadow encounter on their journey. There's Anubis, the Egyptian god of death and embalming; Czernobog, the Slavic god of death and evil; and Wisakedjak, a trickster god of the Algonquians. Readers get to discover a mystic underbelly to America that's fascinating to explore.<br /><br />Since it was published in 2002, \\"American Gods\\" has picked up critical acclaim and won several major awards including the Hugo, Nebula and Bram Stoker awards for best novel. Gaiman, a former comic book writer of the \\"Sandman\\" series, has become the toast of the literary world - a new breed of celebrity writer (with geek overtones - as he's prolific blogger and tech head).<br /><br />Yet while \\"American Gods\\" is a beautifully scripted novel - and a compelling read (I'd be hard pressed not to recommend it), the novel does have its flaws. The build up to the epic battle among the gods is intense and yet the final battle happens off stage. Readers don't get to experience one blow of the fight. Gaiman is playing with our imaginations here, but it's still a disappointment.<br /><br />There's also a lot left unsaid and Gaiman expects a lot from his readers in the way of mythological education (I'm lucky that as a teen I practically memorized the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons book on deities). A bit more detail and information about the gods and their companions would have been helpful.<br/><br />But ultimately \\"American Gods\\" is a fantastical journey. There's an intricately woven sub-plot about children murders in a small town in Wisconsin where Shadow hides during his off-time with Mr. Wednesday that's particularly satisfying.<br /><br />\\"American Gods\\" delivers the goods -- and puts fantasy onto the shelf with high literature.

B00176X7X8|5.0|On a dark and stormy night in a Swiss castle by the lake, the m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois of Mary Godwin (played by the gorgeous Natasha Richardson), Percy Bysshe Shelley (Julian Sands), and Mary's clingy, childish step-sister Claire (Cyr), visit Lord Byron (Gabriel Byrne) their host, and his live-in doctor \\"friend\\" Polidori (Spall) for a night of ghost stories, creative exploration, and weird hallucinogenic experiences that range from the sexual to the horrific, out from which the stories Frankenstein and Vampyre were born, legend has it. These five come together this night to conjure up their true fears for fun by way of s&eacute;ance with a skull, but as it turns out, backfires considerably as the evening descends into a hell of bizarre and nightmarish images.<br /><br />Claire is stalking the manipulative, selfish and sadistic Byron who has previously rejected her; the free-loving Shelley, who lives his life like he writes \\"I'm too restrained by narrative prose\\" is simply trying to escape the responsibilities of his mundane every day life it seems; Mary mourns the loss of her dead child and we learn, her fear is that she would give anything to bring it back to life (sound familiar?), and as for Byron and Poli (Byron's pet name for him), it's hard to tell what, if anything, they are seeking, except maybe some entertainment and opportunities for new sexual conquests. It's clear that of the group of five, Poli is the outsider, having appeared for the first time at the top of a staircase behind a goat that is apparently allowed to roam free around the house. Byron fails to introduce Poli to any of the guests properly and is even ganged up on at one point by Byron and Shelley after attacking them in a drug-induced frenzy with an unloaded pistol.<br /><br />The beautiful and repulsive are married in some fascinating sequences, among the most impressive are Fuseli paintings come to life - Shelley stands naked on top of the castle in a thunderstorm and Mary becomes the dreaming woman in The Nightmare - the incubus clawing at her neck. Also captivating is what I believe to be one of the most erotic scenes ever to be caught on film: the sexual tension between Byrne and Richardson erupts when he attempts to seduce her by undermining the solidity of her relationship with Shelley is unlike anything I've ever seen. Byron receives a lukewarm slap across the cheek for his rude inference: but the slap she receives in return nearly takes her off her feet and he kisses her with a ferocity and hunger women have only fantasized about. Clearly she is aroused by this exchange and kisses him back, but when he insists on going a step further, she rejects him, conflicted by her feelings for Shelley. Why Byron lets her go, I'll never understand. She should have dumped Shelley - the chemistry between her and Byron is devastating. I wanted more! Great performances by these actors, intense sexual imagery, and the glorification of the grotesque make this movie an interesting jewel for fans of the British Romantic and Horror genres. And where else can you see Julian Sands and Gabriel Byrne share a passionate kiss? Nowhere I tell you! Nowhere!- the incubus clawing at her neck.

B000R7HY0K|5.0|Admittedly, Quentin Tarantino can be irritating. He's a weak-jawed geek who believes his own press clippings (and thinks he's tough guy because he makes action flicks). And he's also a screamer - an actor who can't stop shouting on screen.    But I've never met him, so maybe I'm being presumptive.    Because whether Tarantino is a jackass doesn't matter. The man makes dynamite movies - from \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" (1992) to \\"Pulp Fiction\\" (1994). He makes those guilty pleasure flicks filled with great lines, fast action, and superb acting. As a director he yanks the gusto out of his actors. John Travolta should send him Christmas cards for saving his career.    That brings us to \\"Grindhouse\\" (2007).    All the credit can't go to Tarantino, of course, as he co-directed \\"Grindhouse\\" with the talented Robert Rodriguez. But the movie is an achievement of writing, directing, and acting.    The concept is brilliant - a throwback to the 1970s drive-in B-movies (called grindhouses in the industry). The movie meshes two exploitation classics: a serial killer revenge flick and a zombie splatter fest. Sprinkle in some pop references and ironic dialog with a dash of dark humor and you've got a roller coaster ride of a movie.    The movie looks like a film pulled out of a rusty canister - complete with missing reels and burnt celluloid. There are fake trailers for movies with names like \\"Machete\\" and \\"Werewolf Women of the SS.\\"    But the movie flopped. It brought in a meager $25 million and cost more than double that to make. There was just too much going on in \\"Grindhouse.\\" For 191 minutes there were the two movies, the trailers, and an intermission. It was a glorious effort - but it was just asking too much of the viewer.    But all that's been fixed with the DVD release of Tarantino's \\"Death Proof\\" and Rodriguez's \\"Planet Terror.\\" Rather than sawed-off versions - we get full length features. Both movies are better off longer.    Death Proof    \\"Death Proof\\" is the best Kurt Russellmovie in long time - one where he gets his Snake Plisskin mojo back. He plays Stuntman Mike, a charming viper of a misogynist serial killer. Stuntman Mike - gored face and all - has a black \\"death proof\\" car with a cage inside it. He likes to put women in the cage and then drive really fast, braking, and cornering until he's basically turned his female passengers into hamburger.    This snippet of dialog sings:        Mike: Well, Pam, which way are you going, left or right?      Pam: Right.      Mike: Oh, that's too bad.      Pam: Why?      Mike: Because it was a 50-50 shot on whether you'd be going left or right. You see we're both going left. You could have just as easily been going left, too. And if that was the case, it would have been a while before you started getting scared. But since you're going the other way, I'm afraid you're going have to start getting scared - immediately.    Stuntman Mike then proceeds to give Pam a ride she'll never forget (or, in fact, survive). \\"Death Proof\\" is actually two movies. The first half is about how Stuntman Mike stalks, charms, and then murders a group of four female friends.    The next half he's up to his old tricks with another group of four women. But two of these women are Hollywood stunt drivers - and they know how to fight (and drive) back. The ending is worthy of any revenge flick in existence.    But what makes the film work? Character and dialog. Two things that were given short shift in the original version.    Planet Terror    \\"Planet Terror\\" is Rodriguez's homage to the gore-infused horror movie. The plot is secondary (it has something to do with a chemical being unleashed and turning the innocent into flesh-eating zombies). There're lots and lots of blood - and black humor (Jeff Fahey as a barbeque chef is outrageous).    Rodriguez shines with the small moments - the love scene between the protagonists (Freddie Rodriguez and Rose McGowan) is a high in low-brow. McGowan's character has had her leg severed and a broom handle shoved into her stump as a replacement. Ridiculous camp at it's best.    Then there's Bruce Willis in a self-parody. There's Freddy Rodriguez mounting a mini-motor scooter as he zips down the highway firing bullets into the heads of zombies. There's Tarantino himself (shouting per usual) playing to type as a rapist thug.    But most of all there's energy. The throttle is open wide and \\"Planet Terror\\" doesn't stop.    So while \\"Grindhouse\\" had its challenges as one movie - do yourself a favor and get both these DVDs for a true grindhouse double feature.    Like literate blather about books and movies?  Then get your butt over to the Dark Party Review.
B00005V1WO|5.0|On a dark and stormy night in a Swiss castle by the lake, the m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois of Mary Godwin (played by the gorgeous Natasha Richardson), Percy Bysshe Shelley (Julian Sands), and Mary's clingy, childish step-sister Claire (Cyr), visit Lord Byron (Gabriel Byrne) their host, and his live-in doctor \\"friend\\" Polidori (Spall) for a night of ghost stories, creative exploration, and weird hallucinogenic experiences that range from the sexual to the horrific, out from which the stories Frankenstein and Vampyre were born, legend has it. These five come together this night to conjure up their true fears for fun by way of s&eacute;ance with a skull, but as it turns out, backfires considerably as the evening descends into a hell of bizarre and nightmarish images.<br /><br />Claire is stalking the manipulative, selfish and sadistic Byron who has previously rejected her; the free-loving Shelley, who lives his life like he writes \\"I'm too restrained by narrative prose\\" is simply trying to escape the responsibilities of his mundane every day life it seems; Mary mourns the loss of her dead child and we learn, her fear is that she would give anything to bring it back to life (sound familiar?), and as for Byron and Poli (Byron's pet name for him), it's hard to tell what, if anything, they are seeking, except maybe some entertainment and opportunities for new sexual conquests. It's clear that of the group of five, Poli is the outsider, having appeared for the first time at the top of a staircase behind a goat that is apparently allowed to roam free around the house. Byron fails to introduce Poli to any of the guests properly and is even ganged up on at one point by Byron and Shelley after attacking them in a drug-induced frenzy with an unloaded pistol.<br /><br />The beautiful and repulsive are married in some fascinating sequences, among the most impressive are Fuseli paintings come to life - Shelley stands naked on top of the castle in a thunderstorm and Mary becomes the dreaming woman in The Nightmare - the incubus clawing at her neck. Also captivating is what I believe to be one of the most erotic scenes ever to be caught on film: the sexual tension between Byrne and Richardson erupts when he attempts to seduce her by undermining the solidity of her relationship with Shelley is unlike anything I've ever seen. Byron receives a lukewarm slap across the cheek for his rude inference: but the slap she receives in return nearly takes her off her feet and he kisses her with a ferocity and hunger women have only fantasized about. Clearly she is aroused by this exchange and kisses him back, but when he insists on going a step further, she rejects him, conflicted by her feelings for Shelley. Why Byron lets her go, I'll never understand. She should have dumped Shelley - the chemistry between her and Byron is devastating. I wanted more! Great performances by these actors, intense sexual imagery, and the glorification of the grotesque make this movie an interesting jewel for fans of the British Romantic and Horror genres. And where else can you see Julian Sands and Gabriel Byrne share a passionate kiss? Nowhere I tell you! Nowhere!- the incubus clawing at her neck.

B000UBMWG4|2.0|Back in December, we listed our \\"8 Coolest Sci-Fi Flicks\\" and got some heat for not including \\"Blade Runner\\" (1982) on the list. We remembered Ridley Scott's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's science fiction classic \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" as being a disappointment - as well as a bit heavy-handed.    We recently revisited \\"Blade Runner\\" to see if the sands of time had softened our opinion of the movie. But we also wanted to see if Scott's director's cut version of the film would improve it.    It did, but our opinion of \\"Blade Runner\\" remains mediocre.    We agree with film critic Roger Ebert: \\"Watching the director's cut (of \\"Blade Runner\\"), I am left with the same overall opinion of the movie: It looks fabulous, it uses special effects to create a new world of its own, but it is thin in its human story.\\"    Ebert gets this one right. \\"Blade Runner\\" is slick on production. The special effects are so impressive that Scott lets them take over parts of the movie as he pans the camera back to take in breathless shots of his futuristic version of Los Angeles. The movie, at times, is in awe of itself.    We'll give Scott credit here. He does a magnificent job in crafting his world. It's a bleak one, but it resonates as realistic: the driving, black rains, the pollution-scarred skies, the blinking, moving billboards, the strange fashions, and the crowds of vampire like citizens.    But this is all background.    The rest of the movie doesn't live up to the set. The plot is achingly mediocre and stolen from half-a-dozen film noir movies. It relies on characters hand-picked from central castings old stereotypes closet.    The usually dynamic Harrison Ford is wasted here. Ford sleepwalks through the role of a world-weary police officer who quits to crawl inside a whiskey bottle. But predictably his crusty, insensitive boss calls him back for one last job. Then there is Sean Young as the femme fatale - smoking cigarettes and looking both confused and earnest at thesame time.    Ford plays Deckard -- a blade runner (a police officer assigned to hunt down and kill \\"replicants\\" also known as cyborgs). The replicants are illegal on earth and only used on other planets for jobs too dangerous for real human beings. It's never explained why the replicants are not allowed on earth (can't we all just get along?).    The movie carefully avoids another major problem: if they are illegal on earth then why are the replicants designed to look exactly like human beings? They are also designed to look differently from each other - no two are alike. In fact, the only way to tell a replicant from a real human being is to take a complicated oral exam which takes about 45 minutes to an hour to administer.    Wouldn't it be easier to design the replicants with blue skin, for example? Or make them all look exactly alike? That way they couldn't escape and hide among the population of real humans. Seems like an easy fix especially since the replicants have become such a dangerous nuisance that it's necessary to create the job of blade runner to hunt down and kill them.    But then, of course, we wouldn't have a movie.    Another problem with the replicants is that they only last four years -but no one - not the replicants or their creators - seems to readily know the expiration dates. Given that the replicants are used for dangerous off-world work wouldn't it be prudent to know when they \\"die\\"? After all wouldn't it be a disaster to send replicants on a mission and have them start expiring halfway through?    Deckard is assigned to kill four replicants that murdered a shuttle full of people and now are hiding out in LA. His investigation is riddled with holes and convenient consequences that only happen in movie scripts (he finds a tiny snake scale in the bathroom tub of an old haunt which lead him, of course, to a stripper who uses a snake in her act. She happens to be one of the replicants). He even calls them at their secret hideout and... theyanswer the phone.    We were also amazed at how Deckard never ever calls for back-up - even when he finally locates the replicants' hide-out and knows he will be up against two super powerful androids that have already murdered more than 20 people.    \\"Blade Runner\\" wants to be a film about the definition of humanity - an action flick with a philosophy. But it fails in both aspects. It spends too little time exploring the idea of manufactured life being real life because the characters don't really care about the answer. And the action sequences aren't even as good as the average fare on TV.    Want more \\"Literate Blather?\\" Then visit the Dark Party Review at [...]
B000GKHM2S|1.0|Let me first start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of the music. Quadrophenia is one of my favorite 'albums' (that should be a hint as to how old I am). Having said that, I must say that I was vastly disappointed with the movie. I found the main character to be a whiney little turd who I was relieved to see drive himself over the cliff at the end of this abysmally boring 'movie'. I got my own Quadrophenia straight from Pete and the boys. It's much better in my head than on the screen.
0143038583|5.0|Journalist Michael Pollan has written what appears on the surface to be a boring book. He decides to eat four meals and explore the history and consequences of each. He chooses an industrial agricultural meal (fast food), a large-scale organic meal, locally raised farm meal and finally he hunts and gathers his last meal.    By capturing the social, economic, and ecological as well as the moral, and ethical consequences of each meal, Pollan has written a modern day masterpiece on a task most people take for granted - eating their lunch. It's an intricately woven narrative with a massive amount of pain-staking research. But one thing \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" is not is boring. Its captivating reading.    It should be required reading for anyone who as eaten a Big Mac or thinks that shopping at Whole Foods is going to save the planet. Every food item people purchase and consume is a political statement and has rippling effects on their health, the environment, and our society. Pollan has written a wake-up call to all of us.    And for those vegetarians out there? Pollan makes one of the best arguments I've ever read about why vegetarians are inherently hypocritical and why the vegetarian lifestyle may be more unnatural and nature defying than any other diet.    Here are some of the highlights from Pollan's fascinating book:        * Meat might not be that bad for people. The problem is the way we raise cattle. Cows evolved to eat grass. Their stomachs are complicated six chambered organs designed to break down and digest grasses. Industrial raised cattle are fed ground up corn, which is unhealthy for them. As a result, the cattle become ill and the corn has to be injected with antibiotics and other chemicals. It's the corn that marbles beef and causes it to be unhealthy. \\"In the same way ruminants are ill adapted to eating corn, humans in turn may be poorly adapted to eating ruminants that eat corn,\\" according to Pollan.        * Cattle are fed corn for about 150 days before they are slaughtered. It's a good thing because it is unlikely that cattle could survive the chemical-laced corn diet for much longer than that. Even at 150 days, most of the cattle we eat are sick.        * Food companies have an enormous challenge in order to grow and meet Wall Street expectations. The biggest problem: \\"fixed stomach.\\" People can only consume a limited amount of food each year - about 1,500 pounds. So food companies are forced to do one of two things: entice people to eat more or convince them to pay more for what they already eat. This has lead to the development of a new type of corn starch which has zero calories. In other words, the food companies are on the verge of developing food with no calories so you can eat as much as you like.        * A child in the U.S. born in 2000 has a one in three chance of being diabetic.        * Hunger is complicated in human beings due to our feast or famine digestive system. As a result of this evolutionary trait humans won't stop eating when they are full. In fact, when presented with an overabundance of food, human will eat up to 30 percent more. It's one of the reasons why \\"super-sizing\\" portions has worked so well at fast food chains.        * There is butane in chicken McNuggets. Why? Lighter fluid apparently adds freshness. The FDA allows 0.02 percent of the chemical TBHQ in food. That's kind of them because one gram of TBHQ causes: \\"nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, delirium, and a sense of suffocation and collapses.\\" Five grams of TBHQ kills human beings.        * People in the U.S. each more corn than any other food. Corn byproducts are in nearly everything we consume. A breakdown of corn in a typical McDonald's meal looks like this: Soda (100 percent corn), milk shake (78 percent), salad dressing (65 percent), chicken nuggets (56 percent), cheeseburger (52 percent), and French fries (23 percent).        * The organic food movement is starting to look a lot like big business. The grocerychain Whole Foods, for example, buys most of its food from two enormous organic food companies Earthbound Farms and Grimmway Farms - rarely buying food for local farms. For example, milk can be called organic and the only difference in treatment and conditions for the cows is that they are fed organic corn instead of regular corn. Cows, of course, don't naturally eat corn.        * Under pressure from big organic farms, the U.S. government allows synthetic additive including \\"guar and xanthan gum\\" and \\"carrageenan\\" to be called organic. That's why consumers can buy organic TV dinners, which, if you think about it, isn't really possible.        * Lots of organic farming operations uses fraudulent claims to entice people. A perfect example are chickens. Pollan visited a farm that claimed its birds were \\"range free.\\" This conjures images of uncaged birds roaming grassy lots. He found these chickens in a shed crammed with 20,000 birds - fed, of course, organic corn. They got to call the birds range free because there was a door on the side of the shed that lead to a small fenced in yard. But the door is only unlocked after the chickens were five to six weeks old. They are slaughtered two weeks later.        * Mushrooms are not plants - they are fungi and actually closer related to animals than plants. There is a fungi in Michigan that takes up more than 40 acres and may be centuries old.        * Pollan takes on the vegetarian mentality. He says the concept of \\"mourning\\" the death of an animal is a new modern emotion - a departure from the way nature is. Death - animals killing other animals for food - is the way nature was designed. It's the grand design.     Read more \\"Literate Blather\\" at the Dark Party Review [...]
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This is a great film, and certainly my favorite of all the recent comic book adaptations. The main character is great to watch because of his personality, him not being a typical clean super hero. There are some great funny moments and the effects are great. The quality of this is great for a Blu-ray and with loads of extra features unlike a lot of Blu-rays being put out. While the install to my Ps3 was a touch lengthy to access the BD Live content, it's definitely worth buying.
0930289234|4.0|Writer Alan Moore created \\"Watchmen\\" in 1986 because he wanted to push the comic book beyond adolescence into what he called \\"a superhero Moby Dick.\\" The 12 edition comic book series - and later the compilation graphic novel - went on to win the Hugo Award and to be named one of TIME magazine's 100 Best Novels since 1923.<br /><br />There is little doubt that \\"Watchmen\\" blazed a new path for comics - especially superhero comics. But did it really have the impact of Art Spiegelman's \\"Maus,\\" which was first published in 1973 or even Gil Kane and Archie Goodwin's \\"Blackmark\\" (1971), arguably the first \\"graphic novel\\" published in the U.S.?<br /><br />And did Moore succeed in creating a comic book \\"Moby Dick?\\"<br /><br />First let's explore the narrative. \\"Watchmen\\" is a dark story. It captures the pre-apocalyptic fears of modern American and Western Europe in the mid-to-late 1980s as the Cold War rhetoric between the Soviet Union and United States was at its highest since the Bay of Pigs. The novel is in its essence a questioning of authority - especially of government and traditional institutions. That's why the question: \\"Who watches the Watchmen?\\" appears throughout the novel.<br /><br />The story centers on a group of masked adventurers in an alternative universe to our own 1980s (one in which Nixon remains president). The \\"superheroes\\" are, in fact, regular human beings with no real powers - other than extraordinary physical conditioning and mental acumen. Doctor Manhattan is only character with superhuman skills as a result of a scientific experiment gone wrong.<br /><br />The novel opens with the murder of the Comedian (Edward Blake), one of the costumed avengers affiliated with the CIA and other secret government agencies. Rorschach, a second costumed hero, who refused to give up his vigilante lifestyle even after the U.S. government outlawed costumed heroes in 1977, investigates the murder.<br /><br />Through the investigation, the novel enters the lives of the various costumed heroes: Nite Owl (a first and a second version), Ozymandias, Captain Metropolis, Silk Spectre (first a mother, then her daughter), Doctor Manhattan, the Comedian, and Rorschach. The characters are all flawed - some of them grossly so. The Comedian, for example, is a misogynist and rapist and Rorschach is a sociopath.<br /><br />Rorschach thinks he has uncovered a plot to murder all of the costumed adventurers and enlists the help of his former partner, Nite Owl, to help him. Meanwhile, the super powerful Doctor Manhattan, who has the ability to restructure reality and to manipulate time and space, continues to struggle with relating to regular human beings. After rumors that being near him causes cancer, he banishes himself to Mars.<br /><br />The murders end up being the work of the genius Ozymandias, who has concocted an elaborate scheme to bring the world's nations together: a fake alien invasion that kills thousands of people. His costumed friend figure out his plot, but are unable to stop it. And, in the end, it turns out Ozymandias is right.<br /><br />The weakest part of \\"Watchmen\\" is the plot, especially the comic book ending. There are so many holes in the logic and execution of Ozymandias' scheme that it's difficult to follow or understand. But the plot isn't really the driver in \\"Watchmen\\" - it's the characters and Moore's success with deconstructing superhero mythos.<br /><br />Moore has taken stock superhero stereotypes and added depth and complexity. Rorschach, Doctor Manhattan, and the Comedian shine as the stand-outs - loners with a lot of psychological problems trying to cope in a world teeming with misery. Moore has less success with Ozymandias, Nite Owl, and Silk Spectre who don't have the depth or the conviction of the stand-out characters.<br /><br />The novel is heavy on symbolism (lots of watches and clocks, for example) and mood - but differs from comic books from the time period by providing a straight forward and objective point of view. It's up to the readers - not Moore as the author - to figure out how to react to the action on the page.<br /><br />Another interesting device is Moore's use of a \\"story within a story\\" by having a young boy read a comic book about pirates called \\"Tales of the Black Freighter.\\" The pirate story - about a man escaping from a pirate ship filled with dead, doomed souls - echoes the action of \\"Watchmen\\" and acts as juxtaposition to the main story.<br /><br />The artwork in \\"Watchmen\\" feels like a throwback to the Golden Age of comics in the 1950s and 1960s (in fact, primary artist Dave Gibbons credits Norman Rockwell as an inspiration for \\"Watchmen\\"). There's a cinematic feel to the artwork - especially of noir films with the shadows and darkness. But there's surprising little movement to the graphics and sometimes the panels feel a bit inert.<br /><br />So how influential was \\"Watchmen\\"? It is generally credited with taking superhero comics from low-brow kid's entertainment and catapulting into high-brow art. That's no minor achievement. \\"Watchmen\\" also ushered in an era of dark and bleak story lines around comic book superheroes (can we blame \\"Watchmen\\" for the death of Superman and Captain America?).<br /><br />But Moore certainly didn't attain his goal of creating the \\"Moby-Dick\\" of comic books. \\"Maus,\\" for example, is clearly a greater literary achievement than \\"Watchmen.\\"<br /><br />Influential?<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />But a hallmark of great literature?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />Read more \\"Literate Blather\\" at the Dark Party Review ([...]

Then I tried \\"Killing Floor\\", the first of the Reacher novels and was a little disappointed. I assume it was because the character was just being developed. The plot was very choppy.

I am very happy I read some of his latter works first, otherwise I might not have gone any further with Jack Reacher who I have come to enjoy.

0452289963|5.0|He's right. It's so nice to have some confirmation about things that I feel to be true. Especially things that cannot be explained (or explained away) by logic. Maybe this book is not for some others, but I can look back to when I was a little kid and know that I felt what he is saying to be the REAL TRUTH, even then. I started questioning my Catholic upbringing at a very young age and I started reading a lot of spiritual books, too.  They confirmed some things for me, but I am (lol I have thought of myself as?)a thinker through and through and it's been very hard to give myself permission to let go of that. Scary, actually, as any of you who find value in this book can attest. His advice definitely also has practical application. Will it be easy to follow? I'm not so sure.  I will try.

0810995212|3.0|Any new book about Leyendecker is a welcome event.  This volume is an ambitious effort with many excellent images.  Try to focus on the pictures and avert your eyes from the text, which is  hilariously inaccurate.    As just one example, the authors write: \\"After Leyendecker's precedent-setting career, Charles Livingston Bull, John Clymer,  Steven Dohanos, John Falter, Anton Otto Fisher, Harrison Fisher, James Montgomery Flagg, Charles Dana Gibson, J.F. Kernan, Frederic Remington, Robert Riggs, N.C. Wyeth, and other famous artists went on to make their names with the Post.\\" It's hard to imagine how a sentence could be more wrong. Several of the listed artists (Remington, Gibson, Fisher, Wyeth) \\"made their name\\" BEFORE Leyendecker made his, and were in fact dead before the end of Leyendecker's \\"precedent-setting career.\\"  Other artists on their list (Bull and Flagg) were Leyendecker's contemporaries, NOT his successors.  Flagg was far more famous in their lifetime than Leyendecker.  But most importantly, it's hard to think of more than two (or at most, three) from this list of illustrators who actually \\"made their names with the Post.\\"  Some did not work for the Post at all.     Such errors are common in this book-- apparently, the authors feel free to simply make such things up (although based on the number of rave reviews the book is receiving, most readers don't know enough about the subject to tell the difference.)    Putting factual errors aside, the authors would've had room for more (and larger) images if they had been willing to let go of a few pet fixations, such as Leyendecker's gay relationship with model Charles Beach.  It is certainly appropriate for the authors to note that the famed Arrow man \\"was not only a homosexual but a kept man, the live-in lover of the famed artist who thrust himself into such an exalted status,\\" but 200 pages later their focus on \\"thrusting\\" continues unabated.  We are still reading that \\"Charles Beach and Joe Leyendecker are held up as examples of monogamy among the gay community, so often criticized for promiscuity,\\" or that \\"Charles' Dorian Gray image never [ages] in Joe's eyes nor in ours either\\" or that \\"members of the gay community [remember Leyendecker] for icons of masculinity and sensitivity.\\" After a while, these musings become presumptuous and insulting to the gay community.    Finally, on a personal note, I believe that a biographer has an obligation to avoid using his or her subject as a platform for self-aggrandizement.  It is amazing how many of the \\"milestones\\" of Leyendecker's life took place long after his death, and coincidentally are centered around the authors' own gallery shows and sales of Leyendecker's work, or around their promotion of the term \\"imagist\\" to describe his work, or around public relations for their illustration museum.  The art of public relations is very different from the art of painting, and this would have been a better book if the authors had the restraint to keep the two separate.

It was the late '80 with many televised technical difficulties, and it was never Geldof's intention to record the event.  Even with that said 9 hours of one of the largest donational collaborations -- promoted by some of the most insane artists of all time -- was able to be salvaged. Some of the artist were past their prime (The Beatles), others hailed the time when MTV actually played music (Sting), and a few just looked downright insulting (Bono), but all made you remember when we rock n roll was just rock n roll.
B0000013G9|5.0|so, TLC, 2nd album, super marvelous R&B, the production is simply great, J.D., Dallas Austin, Babyface...although i already knew the singles i fell in love again with \\"Diggin' On You\\" and the favourite album track i think it would be \\"Let's do It Again\\", it's just a great sexy slow jam. The Prince rendition is pretty cool, and well they definetly make R&B crazy, sexy and super cool.
0316067601|1.0|If you think President Bush is the greatest president, insurgence are idiots, muslims are godless, the liberal elite control the military and decided military and foreign policy,  and the the Navy Seals are \\"gods\\" this is a book for you. If you disagree with any of the above statements or are sick of partisan politics this is not the book for you. A few things became very obvious to me after reading Lone Survivor, Lutrell is guilt ridden and needs someone other than himself to blame for the events in Afghanistan he has little understand about military and world military policy**case in point the Geneva convention**  That the Lutrell family needed money** read the book you will understand** and that Luttrell did his fellow Navy Seals and his lost friends a disservice by writing this book.  After reading this book I had such distain for the military that i started to question everything i once said about the very brave young men and women who risk their lives everyday to protect and defend us, and truly that is where this book does the greatest disservice.  Honestly the best part of this book is the back cover.

B001E95ZNI|4.0|I grew up in a generation of people who watched Westerns all the time. I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. This plodding, laconic entry falls somewhere between the good and the bad, but because of the quality of the people involved - and the overall good acting - it's closer to good.<br /><br />Virgil Cole (Ed Harris, here doing double duty as director) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) roll into the town of Appaloosa to deal justice to its local bad boy, Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), who reportedly has shot the former sheriff and two of his men. Nobody uses more language than is necessary; Virgil and Everett have been friends a long, long time, and know each other so well that little talk is needed. They're here to do a job, and they go about it pragmatically.<br /><br />Ah, but the flow of duty never does run smooth. Enter into the mix Allie (Renee Zellweger), who has come to town apparently on a manhunt of her own. She is so painfully transparent that only the unschooled-in-women's-wiles Virgil can't see through her. She's after the main man, whose identity can change from frame to frame.<br /><br />I found Allie's brazen discussions with Virgil and Everett a bit hard to take; even a hussy in those days, I think, would not be quite as direct as Allie when she has her heading and knows where she's going. Everett seems to have her pegged from the outset, and it's no surprise that she changes sides like underwear - and Virgil, whose concentration is mostly on the subject of Bragg, is only distracted, not enlightened, by her talk.<br /><br />In the course of time, Bragg is being transported to another locality by Virgil and Everett to answer for his crimes. Here things got a little improbable for me; I need a heavy dose of 'willing suspension of disbelief' and from the train ride on that got sorely tested. Rival bounty hunters get involved, anxious to take on the burden of Bragg, and they use Virgil's vulnerability where Allie is concerned to that effect. Allie, however, seemed a little too composed for me; the dullest observer could see that she wasn't in the least concerned to be caught up in this trouble, and in fact seemed to enjoy being the center of attention. Everett knows better, but poor Virgil lets his feelings take over, and instead of doing his duty with Bragg, he opts to rescue Allie.<br /><br />Nothing is said or done here that hasn't been before. This is, overall, a pretty standard Western, a little slower-moving than most, but I have to give it points because of the personnel involved. Jeremy Irons proves again that he can do a good bad guy, unprincipalled, evil, dastardly; and Viggo and Ed work together well. With others, the slow, measured speech might not work as well, but it fits these two like a glove. And Renee plays a good tart, who for some odd reason has decided that the Wild West is a great place for a man smorgasbord where she can pick and choose.<br /><br />I will watch any Western, and this one wasn't an all-out snore, but it was lacking in fast pacing. Very stylized, though, with excellent settings, shot in black and white to align it with the Westerns of the past. I always wonder how the West ever evolved into civilization after seeing the sort of people that area of the country attracted; those who didn't shoot each other are usually portrayed as ineffectual nobodys who can't manage their own little town. \\"Appaloosa\\" reserves its best scene for the last few minutes of the movie, and it was worth it for that. I needed a Western fix, and \\"Appaloosa\\" answered that.oo composed for me; the dullest observer could see that she wasn't in the least concerned to be caught up in this trouble, and in fact seemed to enjoy being the center of attention.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this game as a gift for my 20 yr old brother.  It's a big hit with the young, sci-fi crowd.  He and his friends have enjoyed getting together and playing interesting, out of the ordinary board games, and this game fits the bill.  You can purchase an expansion pack seperately so that more people can play, but the original game is good for 4 players.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|100 Snazzes on the 100 point Snazz-o-scale. Perfect!  -Return to Oz is a fantastic and phenomenal movie. It did flop at the time of its release, I'm sad to say. I recall one critic calling it grim and gloomy, saying they could have at least had a little \\"Over the Rainbow\\" in it. I also saw a Return to Oz float once at Walt Disney World, during the Main Street Electrical parade. It's a great parade but I think most people looked at the float and thought \\"What is THAT?\\"   -But it is a great movie nevertheless. The characters are wonderful; from Dorothy to her friends, Jack and Tic-Toc, to the villains, Mombi and the Wheelers. Mombi stealing lovely young maiden's heads for her own is a frightful prospect. And the Wheelers are very cool looking. They are men with wheels on their feet and hands, and they go tooling about on all fours. I wonder how long they had to practice to learn to wheel about like that?  -Dorothy is played by Fairuza Balk and she does an excellent job, especially noting she must have acted continuously with special effects men, puppeters, and just her imagination. All about her in Oz are wonderous creatures but very few humans at all.  -The character that steals the show though is the Nome King. I think he's one of the greatest villains ever put to film, right up there with Darth Vader. For much of the movie, you only hear him and don't see what he looks like, which builds his menace. You see his nomes. When you finally DO see the Nome King, he's a claymation character made of rock. This was way before computer graphics and he looks astonishing; a large, crowned, bearded face peering out of a wall or a side of a mountain. I do believe Will Vinton did his animation, and he and his company are experts at claymation.  -But the Nome King has more than looks going for him, he is arrogant, powerful, manipulative, short-tempered, selfish, and just plain mean. He has some superb lines.    \\"That's not fair!\\" Dorothy cries.  \\"No? Well it seems fair to me,\\" theNome King replies. \\"And MY opinion IS all that matters.\\"    When Mombi arrives at the Nome King's throne room with the news that Dorothy Gale is in Oz and approaching, she gasps and then says \\"You already know?\\"  \\"I know everything,\\" the Nome King replies confidently.    Some of have said it's not a child's movie, being too dark and scary. It may be for older children, but I think it's very enjoyable all the same, and you can't have really good good guys without really bad villains. In addition to the great characters and great special effects, there is also some wonderful humor. Dorothy discovers headless dancing maidens turned to stone in the ruins of the Emerald City.  -\\"That's just plain careless,\\" notes Belinda, her talking chicken.  -Give Return to Oz a try, you will fall in love with it.
0743289692|3.0|This book was interesting, and gave insigts into many areas; being a Muslim woman, being a wife of arrangewment, being a foreigner seeking asylum in another country, what a socialist country is like to live in.  I felt the book was too wordy, in other words, too much detail to lots of long days, but was a great discussion book for my bookclub.  Too bad she gave up any belief in God also.  Worth reading.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|First off, the disc is one of those two sided kinds and the 3D side which was on top was all scratched because they package the 3D glasses right on top of the disc with no extra paper in between. Secondly, the 3D isn't the polarized style like it was in the movie theater. They re did it to be a magenta and green style instead of the usual blue and red. Ten minutes into the movie I switched it back to the 2D version because while the 3D worked and effects were ok, the glasses seem to knock out all the color making it look almost black and white. Ohh and also the glasses gave me a headache too so it was all around disappointing.<br /><br />Overall the movie is good, fast paced and I enjoyed seeing it again but the 3D needs major improvement. Guess that's why Beowulf wasn't released it as 3d!
B001FBSMW6|5.0|I guess I'm a little behind the times, but I had never heard of Keane before my fiancee caught an article about Perfect Symmetry on NPR.  She came back excited, thinking that I'd like their music.  We checked out the samples on Amazon and promptly purchased the album.    It's amazing!  I'm not hampered by having a previous conception of what Keane is supposed to sound like. This seems to be the overwhelming reason that this album has a number of three star reviews - I guess this album is a departure from their earlier sound.  As someone who doesn't know what their earlier sound is, I could care less about that!    This is a really fun album, with a full, complex sound. It's quirky and poppy, with overtones of Radiohead, The Darkness, The Killers, and I dunno... Duran Duran or something.  The 80s synth influence is pretty strong in this one.  It's light, upbeat and makes you feel good - what more could you want?  Five stars!
B0013FYTA8|2.0|I'm gonna have that \\"bad girlfriend\\" song stuck in my head for weeks....    In case your not sure which song it was, it's the 8th one that goes \\"fire woman... you're to blame....yeah fire.... smoke on the horizon...\\"    seriously! when i heard it on the radio i thought it was a cover of \\"Fire Woman\\" by \\"the Cult\\" then the guy started to sing... then I really got angry at Nickleback    It actually took me about a week to realise it wasnt the new Nickleback song... all the while I was badmouthing Nickleback for ripping off the Cult... but i dont feel bad about it because nickleback has been gradually progressing into a country music band and hasnt put anything out worth hearing since the first album where they still had some energy and passion for music, and not this \\"sensitive moan and groan so i can get groupies\\" crap that staind started (another band that rocked out loud till the second album came out... Aaron Lewis if you're reading this... think \\"Mudshovel\\" and start writing better music)    In my opinion \\"bad girlfriend\\" is the result of theory of a deadman hanging out backstage while listening to Fire Woman..when all of a sudden Chad Kroeger... oops!...i mean Tyler Connolly... jumped up all excited with a 12 watt lightbulb over his head and said \\"I have a great idea for a song!\\"
630542828X|5.0|I copy and paste >> snalen \\"snalen\\" - (another reviewer's commentary here) who expressed it perfectly. \\"snalen\\" said:<br /><br />Jan Schlichtmann (Travolta) is a Boston tort lawyer and something of an ambulance chaser who is initially reluctant to take on an industrial pollution case involving some children dead of leukemia in rural New England. He changes his mind when he realizes the likely defendants are a couple of big companies with particularly deep pockets and smells the possibility of serious money. Over time, however his interest in the case becomes a moral obsession. The cynical becomes a crusader, refusing offers to settle as his company's finances spiral downwards towards bankruptcy.<br />If you like courtroom dramas, this is highly recommended. It's one of the best specimens of the genre to come out of America since `The Verdict'. It's interesting to compare it to `Erin Brockovich' released a couple of years later. EB is about how a heroic small timer takes on the big boys of corporate America and how her pluck and determination triumphs over all obstacles, something of a legal feelgood movie in other words. Which this, to its great credit, is not. Its central character, for starters, is far more amibivalently likeable: initially just out for a fast buck, moral seriousness has to creep up on him and take him by surprise (perhaps reminding writer/director Zaillian of Oskar Schindler whose story he scripted for Spielberg a few years earlier) and the story's development paints a significantly more ambivalent picture of what pluck and determination can accomplish. It's a highpoint of Travolta's acting career even if he is comprehensively upstaged by Robert Duvall, on brilliant form as his quietly cynical adversary, bigshot lawyer Jerome Facher who knows far better than to look for the truth in a courtroom...<br /><br />And I add, a VERY entertaining and interesting movie with some redeeming social value, a very provacative movie that should inspire many 'thoughtful' viewers to an enlightened perspective ... that may not have ever been considered before!to an enlightened perspective ... that may not have ever been considered before!

0765316897|4.0|(Note: Spoilers for the first two books in the series).     The \\"Mistborn\\" trilogy comes to a close in \\"The Hero Of Ages\\".  While Sanderson does tend to resolve his plots more than many series fantasy authors, there's still a lot of payoff here.  It's well-planned payoff - it answers questions and points out connections you missed; there's no sense of retconning or hurried rewriting.  That said, he doesn't really have enough characters to hang his plot on.      Spook and Tensoon get a lot of welcome page time; they're good characters (particularly Tensoon) as well as good drivers for the plot, although Spook seems slightly superfluous in some ways.  But the rest of the time the book's focus is on Elend, Vin, and Sazed again; with the amount of exploration these characters have already had, this isn't 100% a good thing.  Vin has rather a lot to do, and Elend has an Empire to run.  But we linger with Sazed a little more than his character, my favorite in the first book, supports.  The challenges to his faith are understandable, but Sanderson drags them out too long.      Sanderson continues with his organized and systematic magic systems playing important roles.  Hemalurgy - the magic of the Inquisitors - plays a key role in a number of respects, and is used in a nicely subtle manner at points.  And there's a few surprises left in Allomancy, without feeling gratuitous.     The main thrust of the plot is the world slowly dying in the aftermath of the events of \\"Well of Ascension\\", where the malign force of Ruin was let loose.  Vin and Elend chase the hints left behind by the Lord Ruler, securing buried storage caches.  Spook is sent alone to spy on a city sitting on one of these caches, where rule-by-Skaa has descended into Soviet-style thuggery; it runs mostly as a side story, though it ties together in the end.     Indeed, though the book has some pacing problems the payoff is remarkably good in general.  Sanderson is excellent as ever with his foreshadowing and reveals; things make perfect sense even if you don't see them coming.  The ultimate fates of a couple key characters are oddly left out of the book, but apart from that Sanderson pulls it off.  By the end, \\"The Hero of Ages\\" is a fitting capstone to the Mistborn trilogy.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|This interpretation of the ever popular S. King short story is brilliant! There is nothing for a true fan of Horror not to like here. The characters, acting , and direction are fantastic. The hand held camera work via the Shield keeps everything unsettled and askew. The creatures are reminiscent of 50's era paranoia films, and enrich the 2nd version of the film in B&W. Yes, there are 2 versions of this film, each equally great. The color version works well and has a great post 9-11 feel. The B&W version , other than a quick shot of a cell phone, fits right into the McCarthy-ism Paranoia of the past. Absolutely magnificent! I have watched these both numerous times and find myself loving it more each time. A true masterpiece! As to the extras, they are numerous and informative. Not too much back patting, but insightful info into the process of the film making experience. I recommend this film strongly to any Horror fan and all fans of King. The ending, love it or hate it, will truly make you pause and reflect upon all that has come before it. I always sit there, stunned in silence, while the credits roll and the music fades....

0142412023|4.0|This audio book was recommended by a cyber-buddy. It was really a fun read.<br /><br />About the book: Green's eccentric narrative follows the exploits of Colin Singleton, a fading prodigy whose hobbies include making anagrams, dating girls whose names are Katherine, and coming up with mathematical equations that explain why said Katherines have dumped him. After \\"Katherine the Nineteenth\\" breaks his heart, Colin and his best friend go on a road trip that lands them in Gutshot, Tennessee. Jeff Woodman delivers a solid narrative voice brimming with enthusiasm and energy. He embodies Colin by vocalizing his frustration and aimlessness while also executing great personalities and accents for the various characters Colin encounters. Woodman's smooth, animated tone produces an engaging atmosphere for this amusing novel.<br /><br />This book, although a fun read, would be far more enjoyable to teens I am sure. Great narrative, memorable characters, but just not much of a story. It did make walking fun though, and any book that does that for me, can't be a bad book.

Another concert disc with basically the same set list? Why?     Of course, as the desperate fan of anything that resembles the Floyd, I bought it. The 4 disc version none the less! Let me tell you. I am glad I did! This set blows away the performance of Remember. I don't know if it is the open air staging, the energetic crowd, the giant screens, the orchestra, the sound...but it all works great! I love this set! I have listened to the cds ,which are beautifully recorded and produced, endlessly. I have watched the DVD numerous times and the bonus DVD content is also great, but not essential. The true treat here is a 5.1 presentation of On an Island! This will blow you away!     I don't think I will ever watch Remember again, just pop this one in and be taken on a journey back to great music and production....

T_______________T     I am a total fan of Edward and Bella couple   however, throughout this book, I was unable to sense  the love between them....it seemed like the love was drifting away....  am i the only one?? It seemed like the book was focusing on bella and jake, boths' perspectives too much and less on Edward....It seemed like Bella was becoming another bella, which I didn't like overall.   and to tell the truth it was way too creepy about the description of Bella's pregnancy and the process of how Renesme was born...  it somehow reminded me of how the zombie/alien was born....  as i am a fan of horror movies.....T_T (it was like the bit  when the alien queen was giving birth to her baby alien, which was   half alien and half human)it sounded horrible.  I especially didn't like how Renesme was growin soo fast...The book seemed to explain that the process of creating a child and take caring the child is soo simple. BUT its so not.  And about the possible love between Jake and Renesme, why?  In someway, the book sounded like it was supporting big age gap   marriage.  and its scary how Jake is falling for a child.   especially a child of his first love? its soo not right.....    overall, I didn't like the concept of the book.   It is depressing to actually feel an enormous regret of getting a book of my favourite author....

B001CLG6RC|5.0|I have been a fan of Enigma since the very first album so many years ago.  Enigma has a sound unlike any other.  And while I miss the trademark flutes of the first couple of albums, this new release will leave you breathless.  Enigma has again captured a new sound that renders the sound unique and inspiring.  Great music.  Great price.      If you are contemplating the 1 CD version over the 2 CD, don't hesitate - grab the 2 CD version.  The 2nd CD contains additional music that is a bit more raw than the first but still excellent.
B00065F86U|5.0|Deciding to go with the EN-EL4 battery for in the MB-D10 battery case on my Nikon D300 this little handler plus the charger made the choice pretty tough on my budget.  I am happy with the quality of the chamber cover (really it's the electrical connection between the battery and the camera).<br /><br />Connecting the battery to the cover isn't intuitive but if you keep the instructions it's not too bad.  Practise a few times to teach your brain the process because in low light it can be a challenge.  It's just a slide switch but it feels like you are putting it on the wrong end of the battery.<br /><br />As with the other chamber covers for the MB-D10 it looks nice and works well.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|FINALLY!!! Metallica is back! After St. Anger i had just about given up on them, but i heard their new single from this album on the radio so i bought the cd anyways. Needless to say i was so glad i did. In this cd Metallica goes back to their old ways, you know, before the Black Album. A lot of people thought them sellouts with their load and re-load albums but i liked them anyways. they weren't as good as the original metal sound and they had converted to rock pretty much but it was still good. But with this new album of theirs out they are finally metal again!!! I don't know if I'd call it their best album EVER, i mean it's kinda hard to compare to Master of Puppets but it's their best one since And Justice for All. If anyone is an old-school metallica fan, or a metal fan, i'd say you HAVE TO get this album!!!

B000E0WJIC|4.0|Bullet For My Valentine-The Poison ****<br /><br />What is so great about Bullet For My Valentine is how refreshing their sound is. Combining Thrash with screamo, with hardcore, and punk feel, with classic metal to create a sound just this side of Slayer. But Bullet For My Valentine is different than their contemporaries like Atreyu and say Avenged Sevenfold because they are not altering their sound for the radio this just comes natural for them and they make their metal melodic enough to get air play with out compromise.<br /><br />Where we have heard a resurgence of the guitar solo as of late, Bullet is the only band doing it any justice. Combing both speed with technique, and style and feel with melodic lines to build a structure rather than a bunch of fast notes played in a few short seconds.<br /><br />Tracks like the angry '4 Words' and the radio friendly 'Tears Don't Fall' create contrast while 'Suffocating Under Words Of Sorrow' and 'All These Things I Hate' take on a life of their own. 'Cries In Vain' show that their are still great lyrics in metal.<br /><br />Bullet For My Valentine is doing it right, and The Poison is their strongest testament to that.

B000UG4LYU|4.0|David Bowie-The Buddha Of Suburbia ****<br /><br />A long lost classic is a stretch, but a lost classic sounds about right. The Buddha Of Suburbia was written for a BBC mini-series as the soundtrack though only the title cut from the record appeared during the show. Released in 1993 to obscurity and re-released in 2007 (finally).<br /><br />Comprised of mostly instrumental the album surprisingly never gets dull. Not that instrumentals are boring anyway but a Bowie album with little to no lyrics is like a Hendrix record with no guitar. But I am biased as I have always love Bowies' instrumental work.<br /><br />The Title Track, 'Bleed Like A Craze, 'Sex And The Church,' 'Strangers When We Meet' which is it's best here' are the only real lyrical songs. They are all excellent.<br /><br />But lets not for get the instrumentals. 'The Mysteries' was especially wonderful with the whole Miles Davis feel circa the Kind Of Blue era. 'South Horizon' is nothing short of epic.<br /><br />The Buddha Of Suburbia isn't going to be for everyone, but if you liked his 1990's work than chances are you will like this. It is hist most personal record to date, as well as his most sincere.
0375826726|5.0|In this book, the third in the series, the characters become more complex and the book feels like an alternate reality...it feels much like the Tolkien books felt, when I read them years ago.  The first two books of the series (Eragon and Eldest) were enjoyable, but I could put them aside and resume reading later, without having felt a craving to get back to them.  This one is more compelling.  I have not finished it yet, but will be sorry to see the end come.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|Good action, fair story line, great animation and special effects. Viewed blu-ray, high-def, 65 inch plasma. Awesome!!! I had doubts about Robert Downy, Jr. in the lead role, but his performance was very good. An interesting update from the original Marvel story where Stark was injured in Viet Nam. Definitely worth the investment!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|It's a movie on faith in action.  William Wilberforce was having trouble choosing whether to do the work of God or to be a political activist.  \\"We humbly suggest that you could do both,\\" was the recommendation from a lady who brought him a slave.<br /><br />I hardly buy videos lately because I tend to lose them after awhile. However, I decided to buy this one after watching it from a rental.  This film needs to be watched over and over again to inspire myself, my wife, my children, even my friends to put faith in action in our time.<br /><br />Others have written great reviews about how well this movie was made; so I won't repeat.<br /><br />I just want to highlight the life changing message of a real life story of William Wilberforce and his mentor John Newton.  It is a story of someone who took on something impossible and without personal reward. A true story like this is more powerful than fictional stories, like the Batman movies, no matter how powerfully they are made.<br /><br />This movie should not be watched just for entertainment, but an inspiration to take on the evil forces of our time.  Slavery still exists in many parts of the world.  Check out [...]<br /><br />Pitt, Wilberforce's friend who decided to run for Prime Minister, said it well, \\"We are too young to realize that certain things are impossible so we will do them anyway.\\"  If you are an old man (or woman) with wisdom and life experience, be like Newton in inspiring young people around you to change the world.  If you are a young man (or woman), find a mentor to guide you to accomplish something for humanity that he (or she) didn't have the chance to accomplish.<br /><br />Like Wilberforce who tried to chose either faith or work, God or social action, too many Christians today compartmentalize their lives between the two.  We should not!  I hope this movie encourages people to fulfill God's purpose for their lives.

0670020745|5.0|25 years ago, my grandmother suffered a massive left hemisphere stroke that left her half paralyzed and unable to speak.  That was a traumatic experience for me and all my family.  My beloved grandma died 5 days later, probably of pneumonia.  But I always feared to enter her mind during those 5 days in ICU, wondering what it would be like to be buried alive, figuratively, after a massive stroke.  So I read this book with trepidation but I am glad I did because it is an enormously positive book, partly because Jill Taylor's outcome was positive.  If it hadn't have been, the book would probably not have been written, naturally.  The advice towards the end sounds a lot like what Zen masters and other spiritual teachers say, so that tantalizing link makes it more believable and also makes us wonder about spiritual experiences.  The only disappointment I must voice is that there is no real practical advice for those of us who haven't had strokes (and don't want to have one in order to become spiritually advanced!)  I know, I know... meditation.  This merely proves that there is a link between brain function and spiritual states, and also proves that we as a culture are not there yet, with regards to advancing spiritually en masse.  We have a long ways to go and the vehicles that can take us there are not easy to drive!
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|Wow!  AC/DC has been my favorite band for over 27 years and I like all of their music.  That being said, I've been a bit disappointed with all of their releases since For Those About To Rock.  Some have been better than others but I always felt that there was something missing.  Black Ice is my favorite release since the early eighties.  As other reviewers have stated Brian Johnson sounds fantastic on this album.  He actually SINGS, which I didn't think he could do anymore.  I've always thought his voice sounded good for the band, even when it started to go downhill, but he really picks it up here.    Rock N Roll Train is their best riff in over 25 years.  It has a very Highway to Hell feel to it.  As many others have mentioned the lyrics are a bit on the cheesy side but I don't care.  What are people looking for, insightful political comments?  It's AC/DC.  You still get gems like \\"Santas not the only one who's got a full sack\\" on the song Big Jack.  There are some very good songs on this album that stand up to anything they've recorded in the past with Brian or Bon.  I feel like my favorite band is back.    As far as the Walmart distribution is concerned I'm fine with it.  I like Walmart and if you're so above going there then just order it from the band's website.  That way you won't be contaminated by people like me who shop there.    Hail the return of AC/DC!  This is a great album.
B001GAOY5U|4.0|This was a very good 3D movie.  This movie is okay, but the 3D effects are what make the movie.

B00000AOUD|5.0|I can't add much to the accolades here so I'm adding something of conceptual interest. Many may wonder where the title came from. i haven't heard where Anderson has ever addressed the question but my theory may shed some light. All English boys are aware of, and many may even have succumbed to, Lord Baden-Powell's tenets for good boyhood. As the inventor of the Boy Scouts he admonished young englishmen to \\"be a brick\\" in all aspects of their lives. In other words, to fit in, to not rock the boat, but to be a solid citizen. The original Boy Scouts were also an organization designed to prepare young men for the military, being as England was still master of the world then, with holdings and wars upon which \\"the sun never set\\". Some samples from the songs lyrics:    And where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you though?  They're all resting down in Cornwall --  writing up their memoirs for a paper-back edition  of the Boy Scout Manual.    See there!  A son is born -- and we pronounce him fit to fight.    We'll  make a man of him  put him to trade  teach him  to play Monopoly and  to sing in the rain.    The young men of the household have  all gone into service and  are not to be expected for a year.    We'll  take the child from him  put it to the test    The late 60's being what they were, we find many, many english rock songs slyly, or openly, bucking the system.
B00005JPS8|5.0|This production was produced and directed very well.  It was well balanced between technology within reach, morality and the never ending struggle between good&evil, power verses compassion.

B000FA57US|1.0|*Some Spoilers!!*  When I began watching Halloween 5, I was convinced that it was going to save the world from part 4 and help to redeem the series...and I wasen't very displeased...until the closing act...    Who the hell was the partially invisible trench coat man with the brief case, the Man in Black? Without sitting threw the equally terrible, \\"Curse of Michael Myers\\", no one would ever have any idea who or what he is...    I mean, did the world of film go stupid for a second and just forget about explaining that piece of the plot? Or were they just so desperate to figure out a new way to get Micheal \\"out of jail\\" (like he could have been \\"jailed\\") that they created this random character for that part alone...    This was a piece of trash just like its predecessor, 4.    and after watching 6...it seems like they were trying to be \\"deep\\" with the stories...well...honestly that failed terribly...      For those who enjoy the good Myers movies, stick to 1, 2, h20, and Resurrection...    For those who want something deep, search \\"David Lynch\\", and thank me later...
B00005JPO1|4.0|I have been a huge fan of Indiana Jones since day 1 of raiders. This final chapter is a welcome addition. A good deal of the movie is done tounge-in-cheek and the humor is great! As where the action is not quite up to the first three movies, it is still a good story, even though the 'alien' thing is a bit far fetched. The chase scene through the jungle is cool and has some great shots of a Ford GPA Jeep that was used in WWII. One of the funniest points is Dr. Jones' ride in a refridgerator caused by a nuclear detonation test. A good movie for any Indiana Jones fan!
B000X9PNOG|3.0|I'm okay with the fact that Meat can't sing like he used to, no points deducted for that. But, I'll agree with many reviews here that say the legendary singer is \\"off\\" at times during the concert. Credit due though, he NAILS it more than he misses.    The video is awesome, shot in HD (featured/promoted recently for free on DirectTV HD) and excellently edited, by far the highpoint of this DVD. Five stars for video, all the way.    Although the audio is also five stars (great bass, crisp cymbols, everthing in between), it's the AUDIO MIX that takes all the bang out of this concert for me. The guitars are too far back in the mix, making this sound more like an 80s contemporary rock concert than classic hard-rockin' Meatloaf.     I already own the concert with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, and I think it's much better (performance and audio mix) than 3 Bats Live, even though audio and video quality can't compare to this release.

The writers for instance? Or Stan Lee? We just had David vs. Goliath in Ironman with little Ironman against big copy iron man. Why did we need to see it again with puny Hulk against bigger hulking thing? Seems repetitive to the extreme. I can only hope that the Next Avengers introduction movie (THOR maybe?) isn't small hero against large copy look alike villain with all the same powers. Let's see something new that I can't think up.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I loved Pride and Prejudice,with Matthew McFayden as Mr. Darcy,but Richard Armitage is outstanding as Thornton and I have to rate this movie over Pride and Prejudice. It was so realistic,I actually felt I was transported back in time. It is truely a classic love story,of two people who are both stubborn,but love each other and wont give in until it is almost too late. Margaret does not understand the ways of the north in manufacturing and Thornton does not understand the ways of the south, which is more of a carefree lifestyle and not so harsh.The acting was superb and the location was at a old cotton mill in England which made it very factual. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys period drama stories. It is a masterpiece for all to see......

Plus I love the feature where you can turn the PS3 on or off with your controller plus ejecting the disk. Great Buy.
0307269752|5.0|Dysfunctional families often provide great fodder for mystery. Stieg Larsson uses the formulaic \\"locked room mystery\\" and instead of ten little Indians populates the crime scene with members of a vast family enterprise who comprise an important  part of Sweden's industrial elite.<br /><br />What happened to Harriet Vanger, beloved niece of the family's patriarch, who disappeared from the face of the earth in 1966? The question has haunted Henrik Vanger for thirty -six years. He hires Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced journalist. Blomkqvist  facing a short stint in the pen after a conviction for the criminal libel of another Swedish industrialist, has not many other job prospects. He agrees to spend a year writing a family history while looking into the details of the unsolved crime. In his work. Blomkqvist is  eventually joined by Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant,  tattooed and pierced freelance researcher,whose computer skills give her access to information not generally available to the public, or even the police.<br /><br />The amateur inquiry into this extended clan quickly focuses on several of the family's black sheep, members with strong political sentiments before and during the Second World War. Could these sentiments have  may have triggered an apparent murder a generation later? Perhaps, the journalist wonders,  the clusters of insanity with certain branches of the family tree contain  homicidal tendencies not previously detected. Or maybe the motive was greed, was young Harriet the natural successor to her uncle Henrik.<br /><br />The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is the first part of a trilogy delivered by Larsson prior to his untimely death in 2004. It quickly became a huge bestseller, not just in Sweden, but throughout Europe.  Originally entitled Men Who Hate Women this part delves deeply into the evils of misogyny.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Larsson pays tribute to female mystery writers, among them Enid Blyton, Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers,  Sue Grafton, Val McDermid, and Sara Paretsky.

031606792X|3.0|As always you should be aware that reviews contain spoilers. I suggest that if you don't want the book ruined you shouldn't read this.      In this fourth and final installment of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series Bella and Edward's romance continues. The long awaited wedding of the destined couple is about to happen. Lets not forget about the unpredictable honeymoon, and of course the inevitable event of Bella becoming a vampire. Although this book contained all these events which I'd been anticipating to happen, it still didn't satisfy me.                                                                                    To begin with, Breaking Dawn seemed rushed. Perhaps Stephanie Meyer didn't have enough time or that was just how she meant it to be. Whether it was one of those reasons or maybe a completely different one, Breaking Dawn just made me feel like Stephanie didn't put as much into it as she did with her other three books. For instance, when Bella became pregnant everyone was worried, but then after she had her half vampire half human baby it was almost as if everything was back to normal. Not to mention the fact that Bella was a vampire didn't seem to have that much affect on anybody.      Sure, the book had the happy ending that I'd wanted, it just felt like a 3 star rating instead of the 5 I was expecting. I was extremely happy Bella ended up with Edward and that she got to be a vampire too. The fact that Jacob got his happily ever after made me ecstatic also. But the book was just like, \\"So hey, I'm Bella I'm a vampire and I had a half vampire baby. The End.\\" Breaking Dawn didn't seem to have the romance, passion and suspense that got me hooked to the series in the first place. I liked the book, but I didn't love it; in my opinion I think the book deserves a 3 out of 5 stars.
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|I saw the play in London several years ago and even though it didn't strike me back then as a work of art, compared to this movie it sure felt like it. While I appreciate Streep's charisma in a part which really doesn't play to her incredible dramatic skills, everybody else in the cast gave me the feeling I was watching an improvised high school play done by people with very little talent. I was always a fan of Brosnan's James Bond but his musical talents are no more than mediocre, specially while singing (that may be too strong a word) SOS and just standing there with not much to do but stare at Meryl, during her interpretation of THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL. I also found odd they would choose such an weird looking girl in the lead (with eyes just like a frog). I guess it didn't feel to surprising that with so many people dancing near the water, a bunch of them would \\"accidentaly\\" fall in it and it's not like I was expecting CASABLANCA but the only fun I had in watching MAMMA MIA was laughing at its awfulness.  Strictly for people who love to make hores-cabooses of themeselves on dance floors.

It also has some interesting content concerning the relationship between governments, corporations, economics, and a little bit on ecosystems.

B001DTPZNY|4.0|This movie was a good ending to the series. Sure it was unbelievable and many of the situations Indy found himself he would not have survived in real life, but I believe that was the point of the movie. This movie is adventure/B-movie style that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were looking for and the 1950's era was demonstrated well. (Nuclear testing, communism scare, protests on campus, the Russians and the popularity with the possibility of existence of aliens) was there and clear. This is not suppose to be a movie where you are supposed to learn a life lesson or gain insight (although I do agree with the idea that lots of human life is lost or wasted in waiting). I would definitely watch  \\"The Return of a Legend\\" featurette under the special features for more information about these ideas.    There were cheesy lines but again, that is part of a B-movie genre:  Indy: \\"Sure there were a few [women] but they all had the same problem ... \\"   Marian: \\"Yeah what was that?\\"   Indy: \\"They weren't you honey ... \\"    I am a huge Indiana Jones fan and I loved how Marian came back for a cameo in the Crystal Skull. She was the best heroine of the movie series and it would have been a crime to ignore her character again. The only actor I was not too pleased with was Shia LaBeouf as Indiana's son. He just did not seem as believable as the others.     Overall, if you want to be swept away with high adventure, old fashion heros, some historical reference and taken away from real life for two hours or less, the Indiana Jones series (and the final one: Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) is your ticket. Indiana Jones is not supposed to be real and make you think but that is ok and still makes this worth watching.

0439023483|5.0|This is an awesome book. Very well written and easy to follow. I read it, then my 13 year old son read it and he enjoyed it alot. I have since passed it along to someone else, and they can't stop reading either. This is the type of book that keeps you up late at night because you HAVE to know what is going to happen!
0345501292|5.0|[[VIDEOID:28368951]]This is probably the best making-of-the-movie book I've read so far this year.<br /><br />A lot of effort must have been put into research. Considering when the first Indiana Jones movie was shot, I'm very impressed by how they manage to document all this information.<br /><br />The book is about the production process of the 4 Indy movies, up to the Crystal Skull. The narration explains in great detail all the events that happen behind the scenes. It's filled with lots of interviews. Read from how Spielberg came up with Indy's name to the last day of shooting Crystal Skull where Harrison Ford gave Shia LaBeouf a signed hat.<br /><br />Reading the book is like working on the set itself. For that, it's worth the price alone.<br /><br />There are hundreds of high resolution production photos. Several art illustrations were put in also, such as posters, storyboards and set designs. There are 300 pages in this 15-inch (screen measurement) book.<br /><br />For fans of Indiana Jones, this will be an immensely satisfying book. For non-fans, this book will still impress. This book is that good.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
1559409010|5.0|A lot has been said and do not wish to repeat it. In my mind this is by far the most complete and timeless of the Monty Python classics ... I personally love The Meaning of Life but it resonates mostly with those coming of age in the 70s and early 80s as many of the topics were current then (sex education, antiwar sentiment etc).<br /><br />Life of Brian will never lose its appeal but it requires a copy with English subtitles even for native English speakers to catch all the brilliance.<br /><br />It is moreover an essential piece of work in bringing about religious understanding and tolerance. Whether you are a believer or not it is healthy in a free society to challenge the very institutions they are built on and remind us all not to take anything too seriously. Those who find it offensive are most likely also in favor of challenging the separation of church and state and return to non-secular societies. Look to the 'success stories' we have mostly in the Arab world today for inspiration.<br /><br />If your movie collection holds more than 5 titles this must be one of them.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|[[ASIN:B0016Q2D5M Journey to the Center of the Earth (Limited-Edition 2-D and 3-D with Glasses)]]The 3D on this disc is really lacking. I've seen better in some of the old BW sci fi films. Many scenes are blurry and double vision and often the color just looks yellow. Save the money and just rent the 2D.
B001CLG6RC|5.0|I eagerly anticipate every new Enigma album. Artists, (like the rest of us), get bored with repetition. I believe Michael Cretu adds those etherial trumpets not only as a signature, but to reassure those looking for the same old thing, this is still Enigma.<br />Each release has been different enough from the previous, to spawn negative reviews that always sound the same.  \\"This album sucks.  This one doesn't have the xxx..., I loved so much on the last one.\\"  They want more of the same.  Grace Slick sang \\"Life is change.  How it differs from the rocks.\\"<br />I'm not a music critic, but I thought knew what I liked. My initial response to each new release has been cool, to disappointed.  Then certain songs start growing on me.  Soon phrases or refrains start haunting me.  Seven Lives... has done this to me, again.<br />Another distinct aspect of Enigma I truly appreciate is the ability to return to any of the earlier songs or albums and say \\"I really like this music.\\"  There are very few popular or Top 40 songs do I ever want to hear again.<br />Enigma & B-Tribe are the only artists I have purchased multiple copies of their CDs, for home, car & work.<br />My only disappointment with this release is both CDs were not filled to capacity.  The more to grow on me.
B00188KD1Y|4.0|The plot of \\"Death Race\\" goes something like this: former NASCAR champion Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is wrongfully convicted of the murder of his wife and sent to Terminal Island prison, where he is given the opportunity to compete in the Death Race, a car race to the death, with the prize being his freedom. Not that the plot really matters, because this isn't the sort of film that you would go to in the hope of finding a movie with a complex plot, sparkling dialogue and brilliant acting. If you are contemplating seeing this film, it's because you want to see the cars and the carnage (either than or because you have the perverse desire to hear Joan Allen swear) and this film does not disappoint on any count.     The set-up on the film is a little bit slow, but once the Death Race begins, the film is basically just solid car races from them until the end and the car races are really great. I am not a petrol-head and would not watch a regular car racing movie, but even I felt excited by these scenes. They are an intense blend of high speed racing, ultra-violence and black humour, with enough variety so that you don't feel as though you're watching the same thing again and again.     The film is written and directed by \\"that notorious action-hack\\" Paul W.S. Anderson, director of \\"Alien vs Predator\\", whom, in the past, I have heard referred to as the high budget equivalent to Uwe Boll. However, he does a surprisingly good job of the film. Much better than with \\"AvP\\". Sure it's derivative (think \\"The Running Man\\" or \\"The Condemned\\", but with cars), and I'm not certain as to whether this film would hold up too well to a second viewing, but Anderson brings enough new material to the project to make it worthwhile.     As for the acting, Jason Statham, who seems to be shaping up to be the next Arnold Schwarzenegger, plays exactly the same character that he has played in every other film he has appeared in, but hey, I like Jason Statham films so I'm not complaining. His performance, however, is bolstered by those of Ian McShane as the leader of Statham's pit crew, and Joan Allen as the prison's warden. Allen, in particular, is really great in a role that is delightfully out of character, and yeah, the scene in which she lets lose and swears is worth the price of admission. And if you stay until the end of the credits, you can hear her swear again, just in case you missed it the first time.

Remote control, runs smoothly and the baby loves it!!!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|From the interactive menus, to the crisp quality of the picture and sound, Iron Man on Blu-ray delivers. Everything about this movie is of the highest quality. The menus are based on the computer system of the movie, so you \\"feel\\" like your are part of the fun. I highly recommend if you can play blu-rays, get this movie. It would be a key piece - not just to the super hero genre - but for any collector.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didnt expect much, but this show is one of the best.  There is no good or acceptable reason for Firefly not to have continued.
0765348276|4.0|I gave the story four stars - but only because they don't give you a choice of 3.5 stars, which is where I feel the story is.    The basic story? (no spoilers)  Earth recruits senior citizens to fight in its colonial wars.  No one on Earth knows what happens when you enlist, because when you do no one ever sees you again.  At age 75 the protagonist, Perry, joins and is thrust into the gallactic wars.  The book chronicles his tour of duty (part of it, at least).    There are some places where the story is very good and moves along nicely.  But in other places it lapses into schmaltz.  In general though the story line holds together just fine - and in some places is very funny and - perhaps even thought provoking.  However, it's an uneven ride and you often have to deal with dialogue that runs too long, some cheesy melodrama and pasteboard characters (of which there are WAY too many to remember).  All in all though it's worth reading.  As others point out, it ain't Dune -- but then again, not much is.
B00005OAIE|4.0|It is amazing that more than 1,000 people took the time to write their feelings and opinions about John Mayer's CD.  It almost doesn't matter that some of the reviews are negative.

B001CD6FKI|5.0|This movie was a gift and arrived even before I expected it.  Great service and terrific movie.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Ok so I finally rented this movie last night and watched the whole thing.  I give it three stars for the mere fact that it kept me in my seat interested to see it through to the end. However that is the ONLY reason why I give it 3 stars..  I grew up with Indiana Jones and have loved Spielburg and Ford movies since I was in diapers.<br /><br />This one is proof however that Hollywood has been seriously lacking in the essense of what makes a movie entertaining, and worth watching.  The begining of the movie was somewhat enigmatic as I have no idea yet what happened.  It moves through some slow confusing explanations making the plot less interesting, by the time any action happens, you're already bored.  I will say that Indy has some fight left in him yet, still it was a little sad watching one of my childhood favorites really just make a fool of himself... where as Ford was dashing, witty and funny in the last Indy Jones movies, he seemed old, and tired in this one.<br /><br />By the end of the movie you are left feeling a little empty, there was no chemistry with any of the charachters, and even Indy seemed a little \\"plastic\\".  This clearly seemed like an attemt to squeeze one more dollar out of what was an amazing franchise in the 80's.

B001CD6FKS|4.0|I loved the movie, The video and sound quality of the Blu-Ray is top notch but the extras are very poor. The interactive game  is pointless and the short documentaries  (Completely Washovski free) not necessary.<br /><br />Anyway a great disk to buy if you want to show your friends your brand new HD TV.

B00008S7V7|4.0|I had previously read two of the books in this series so I was familiar with most of the characters. One of those previous books was [[ASIN:B0018DUP0S The Messenger]] which was a real five star thriller.<br /><br />Silva does an outstanding job in painting his characters so that it is easy for the reader to feel like he/she knows them. This and his writing style makes for an easy read where you don't have to turn back to earlier pages to relate anything . . . you can just keep reading.<br /><br />Things really get suspenseful when both the Mossad agents and the terrorists are sure that they had outsmarted the other and both are ready for a far different bloody finish. This is when you have your finger under the edge of the page so that you can turn it as you are reading the last few words. This is no time for a coffee break or anything else except reading!<br /><br />I did not give this book five stars because there were a few places where a character acted different than he had been portrayed and the ending was not as complete as I would have liked!<br /><br />Author of [[ASIN:0741449102 al-Qaeda Strikes Again]]
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Fantastic movies, fantastic restoration. Obviously the image still looks like a +30 years old movie but at the same time it never looked this good.
0451528018|4.0|'The Hound of the Baskervilles' is truly a Holmes classic. It is testament to Arthur Conan Doyle's immense talent as a writer, that the desolation and solitude of the moors are every bit as entrancing a century after they were written about as they were in his day.<br /><br />It is in the full length novel format that the characters of Holmes and Watson come into their own. The briefer stories can be exciting but their length and pace doesn't allow the characters to get into their full stride. Here the writing style is as methodical and effective as the musings of the great detective himself.<br /><br />A great swathe of this book is the reports of Watson who has been left to his own devices by Holmes. However the main player's absence does nothing to diminish the novel's impacte. The bleak aspect of the Devon countryside allied to the intricate and bizarre relationships of its residents fuse to make this outing of Holmes a memorable one. Both the surroundings and the vivid descriptions of the hound itself, combine to draw the reader in, in a way that few novels can.<br /><br />'The Hound of the Baskervilles' is widely beleived to be one of the greatest of the Sherlock Holmes oeuvre, and indeed the intricacy of the plot development, along with an excellent climax put this novel up there with the best of them.
0446677450|1.0|This book is all cliche and lies.     1. The author recommends that people join MLM to become \\"better salespeople\\".     2. The author shows a strong distaste to basic education. (He was held back sophomore year in high school.)     3. The author shows a lack of respect for his real father (poor Dad)    4. The author shows a way too basic math to demonstrate his profits.    5. The author makes recommendations that are flat out illegal (such as writing off vacations on the corporation...aka, tax fraud.)     So, don't bother reading it. You want the basics of the book? Here....    1. People work for money because they are in fear.  2. Rich people horde their money because they are in fear of losing it.  3. Schools don't teach people about money.   4. People who don't know about money will always be poor.  5. He will not show you how to make money, nor will he show you how to make money work for you. He'll give a couple examples that have mathematical and legal errors with regards to taxes.  6. He preaches to use corporations to save on paying taxes....news flash: corporations have double taxation. That's the price of the legal protections.    Anyway, there's the gist of the book. The only money that Robert Kiyosaki has ever made is from this book...it's motivational, but financially irrelevant. This book started it's circulation through Amway...think about that. He is speaking about money and recommends MLM...was this book designed to make the Amway people feel better about their decision to join MLM?     Think before you buy. And hopefully you'll put your money away.
0756404746|5.0|I loved this book and can't wait for more! I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but this story was intelligent, fascinating and kept me completely enthralled the entire time.  Can't wait for more of this series!
B001GM28HO|4.0|The Fame from Lady GaGa is going to claim the crown for one of the best pop albums of 08. She mixes styles from synth pop, dance, disco, electronica to urban and rap with aplomb. And her versatility is wondrous. At some point, you may mistake her to sound like Gwen Stefani but given that Lady Gaga co-wrote every song on the album including the funky first single, Just Dance and the fantastical Starstruck (though Flo Rida should have been left out on the rap), she's hot on many artists' list. Beautiful, Dirty, Rich will be the ultimate ode to Nip/Tuck. If you like something that's straight out there and fun, Lady Gaga's The Fame will please you.
B000I2J2W2|1.0|I received the DVD.  It would not play on my DVD player.  Thinking that the HD DVD would not play on the older DVD player, I purchased an HD DVD player only to find out the DVD was actually BAD - NOT IN PLAY MODE.

B000002UAU|4.0|... but I only gave it 4 stars because Paul died before this album was finished. Had Paul (not Faul) been involved in the making of this classic album, it would've been even crazier.    Still... beautiful album by the 3 remaining Beatles. Highly recommended.
1594481717|5.0|An overwhelming wake up call for the \\"go to school, get good grades, get a good paying job\\" thinkers.

If you don't read this book, you are limiting yourself.
B001C4AFP8|3.0|Ridley Scott movies usually move along pretty well but this seemed to go on forever.  The performances are good; the story is almost plausible but at the end I was left feeling that the Middle East and its problems are like a skin condition.  Never gets better, never gets worse, never goes away.<br /><br />For fans of this type of story there are the usual high speed drives in the desert in big black SUVs, remotely guided missile strikes and of course, torture with broken fingers.  If there is anything new, it would be the more or less happy ending which is a real, real stretch.<br /><br />The one thing that puzzled me was Russell Crowe's fake southern accent.  Whereas DiCaprio does seem to have an ear for authentic accents, Russell doesn't and why have an Australian actor attempt a southern accent if it adds nothing to the story?
B00192KCQ0|3.0|I'm not sure how to describe this album.  It's not that it's BAD, but Death Magnetic is not quite what was being hyped (\\"a return to the 80's Metallica, in the vein of RTL, MOP and AJFA\\").    Death Magnetic is more like a pre-release studio album (think the original Garage Days Re-Revisited) than a full-bore classic Metallica effort.  The production is a little lame (no guitar, drum or bass layering) and there are no effects.  The solos are mostly half-hearted efforts and forgettable.    Two songs in particular stand out - \\"All Nightmare Long\\" and \\"Broken, Beaten and Scarred\\" - great rhythm and a decent solo mark both.  \\"Suicide\\" has some solid grooves, but it never quite jumps from my speakers.  The lyrics on this album are so bad, I blush from embarrasment.  I'd figure that after 25 years of banging out metal albums, Hetfield's voice would be gravelly and gruff, but he sounds like he's not even trying.  It's too bad.  This album was released 20 years to the week after AJFA - I was hoping for something much better to mark the anniversary.

B0016Q2D5M|1.0|I was watching for this at the stores, wondering why I was only finding the 2D version before now, so when buying milk at Wal-Mart there was the 3D/2D DVD together with a glow-in-the-dark yo yo at the checkout counter. I looked at the thing briefly just to make sure it was widescreen and I didn't see the awful red/blue (or magenta/green) eyeglasses I wanted to avoid either.    I saw this at the theater in 3D using polarized eyeglasses and wanted the same thing on DVD. I didn't realize polarized 3D couldn't be done for home TV until I read reviews here at amazon.com, wish I had known. Actually if I had given it more thought I could have figured it out eventually. Like someone else said, the DVD package shows colorless 3D eyeglasses. Very misleading if you had seen the movie at a theater and knew the differences in the eyeglasses, this means you can't avoid buying and opening the DVD box to discover what's really inside. I knew anaglyph two color ones were not good for long movie-watching. In fact, I was going to use the polarized ones I got at the theater anyway since those were like regular sunglasses (all plastic) and not paper and cellophane.    What's even worse about this... they put the 3D glasses in with the DVD itself so I found the DVD was scuffed from them rubbing against each other. My first thought was hopefully the 3D side was untouched, and it was, but now I know the 3D side is not the most important thing. I only got around to watching it tonight and the movie was almost unwatchable. Double-images most of the time-- and always when not the focal point of the picture (sometimes I couldn't decide where that was at)-- and colors messed up (as I expected from color glasses).    I enjoyed the 3D experience of JTTCOTE at the theater but this TV version is a poor attempt at keeping the 3D effect. I must admit it did manage to capture some good moments that would otherwise be missed in 2D alone. It was nice that the sepia coloration late in the movie made the3D effect more pleasant to watch. The beginning of the movie was ridiculous by comparison due to the normal colors being fouled.    As to the movie itself, I think it was fun if not taken seriously. Obviously that was the intent, to be a fun movie. So when they are in danger it never seems like it really. Well, maybe a few different moments at most.    Terrible to know now that I can't ever watch any 3D movies the way I wanted to, in clear full color. I was going to start getting more of them if this had gone right.    If any of you would-be buyers of this DVD see the plastic 3D image on the DVD box first, well, you can probably judge the quality from that... and worse. IMHO buying a good 2D version cheap might be wise if you've been spoiled by the theater version, otherwise it can be a fun watch if your visual pain tolerence is high enough. The movie was plenty good at the theater so this DVD will disappoint many people, so I must say only get it for the adventure and laughs and such but not for the 3D novelty feature unless you never saw it before and can't resist the temptation.

I am absolutely ecstatic that Mr. Paolini is giving us more of this great story. If you love dragons, if you love heroes, especially the human kind ,emotionally and mentally, that is, you will love this book. The twists and turns, questions from the two previous novels being answered, AND, unanswered questions that lead us to the next book; I couldn't put it down until I was cross-eyed! If you can, you're not as smart as me!!! If any movies are made of the rest of this story, please do it LOTR style, a La Peter Jackson, because ERAGON, the movie did NOT do the book justice.

0312427999|5.0|This book simply is the best summary of U.S. history since the Cold War that  I have read, and it updates that history into today's economies of information, disaster relief, and defense-reconstuction.  Readers of Noam Chomsky will be familiar with many of the details here, but not with Klein's commanding, exhaustive and overarching synthesis.  Libertarians, humanists, and liberals all should read this book and be alarmed.  Klein has given U.S. and world citizens a wake-up call in 500 pages of reporting and analysis.
B001CLG6RC|3.0|Antes pensaba que \\"Voyageur\\" era el peor disco de Enigma, pero poco a poco le he ido cogiendo el gusto, y veo que tiene canciones muy buenas dignas de convertirse en clásicos como \\"Total eclipse of the moon\\", \\"The piano\\", \\"Voyageur\\", y \\"Following the sun\\". El resto es muy bueno si se percibe como un disco de pop. Aquel es un disco de cuatro estrellas. A este le doy tres gracias a \\"Seven lives\\", \\"La puerta del cielo\\" y algunos momentos de \\"Distorted love\\", \\"Je'taime 'till my dying day\\", y por \\"Touchness\\". Así y todo, pocas de estas canciones llegan a la calidad de los anteriores trabajos de Enigma. De hecho, por momentos me parecen imitaciones de su viejo estilo, haciendo cruce con un sonido más a lo \\"Voyageur\\", pero en serio me parece que este es el más débil de los lanzamientos bajo el sello Enigma. Ni siquiera veo nada enigmático en sus sonidos, salvo un poco en los vocales de \\"La puerta del cielo\\". Me ilusioné mucho y me defraudó en total este álbum casi por completo!!!   Les recomiendo mil veces más \\"A posteriori\\"   El segundo CD no es gran cosa. Sólo me llama la atención \\"We are nature\\"
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|Before I started to watch this show, I had never seen a single episode. Being a fan of Alyson Hannigan, I had to give it a chance. As soon as I got the first season, I had to watch the second and the third. The show's charm has endeared itself to me, and it has that special something that makes a sitcom really special. It can be funny and have moments of silent curiosity... And what I mean by that is when they talk about the never seen but always talked about 'mother', you can't help but wonder who she is. And like the ending to a good movie, you have to know who she is, and how she factors into the wonderful group of characters that has been developed on the series. Fitting together like puzzle pieces, this is a group of friends I could follow around for a long time to come.
B0000C7PQK|4.0|Si cierras los ojos y te olvidas de que está firmado bajo el nombre de ENIGMA, lo podrás disfrutar como lo he disfrutado yo. \\"Total eclipse of the moon\\", \\"Following the sun\\", \\"The piano\\" y \\"Voyageur\\" son excelentes. Las demás son muy buenas si tienes en cuenta de que es ambient pop
B00005NOOH|5.0|Just as I expected. I am familiar with this program as it was presented in serial form on TV some years ago, and I always wanted my copy. This compilation may have been edited, updated and expanded from the TV version, but I am very satisified with the final result. Program uses World War II film footage which obviously varies in initial picture quality; this is understandable. Video presentation of the end result is excellent. All DVDs play on my equipment with no problems.

192076920X|4.0|I have lived a pretty interesting life so far, but when I read this book I felt like a couch potato. Although it starts slow, it does create a great platform on which this story launches from. Wonderful descriptions of the cities and people of Bombay (Mumbai) without overdoing it and boring you to tears like so many over-cerebral writers. However there are a lot of poignant, philosophical moments that I could imagine frustrating the kind of readers who are only searching for action and simplicity. However if you do wish to have something a little more deep, then this book will satisfy. The main character in the story is tough to love due to his roots as a criminal, but it does not take out the fascination he creates in what life can present. A great read and insight to a life so many of us will not even touch.

0375826726|5.0|No Spoilers    This book is by far the best book Paolini has written by far. In the year he took off and the time it has taken him to write this book he has grown so much as a writer. The evidence is plastered all over the pages which are now loaded with more detail.    Brisinger was excellent and left me wanting more. The story begins with Eragon going off with his cousin Roran: to help rescue Roran's beloved, Katrina, from King Galbatorix's clutches. The story has many twists and turns when Eragon and Saphira are once again faced with opponents more powerful then themselves. The reader finally gets to know about Aya's friend/lover and the events that occurred just before Eragon found her.    There will be a Major death, A BIG secret, the rise of a new dwarf King, the secret about a dragons power and the reader will get to know Eragon character and struggles like never before. With the Varden taking over city by city Galbatorix is not taking a blind eye to their presence anymore.    This book is a MUST read for anyone who has read the previous Eragon books.

The left hemisphere controls the right side,<br />recognizes serial events (sequentially), manages text,<br />siphons details and performs logistics.

B001DHXT2A|4.0|I skipped The Incredible Hulk in theaters because I was fully expecting to be disappointed, but my son really wanted to see it and Iron Man was unexpectedly good, so we picked up the DVD and I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Ed Norton isn't as dynamic an actor as Robert Downey, Jr., unlikely to carry a blockbuster superhero movie on his own shoulders, but he brings the right level of intensity to the Hulk's conflicted alter ego, Bruce Banner, that combined with some precision casting -- and, according to several rumors seemingly backed up by many of the DVD's extras*, exerting influence far beyond his own character -- makes for a movie that is greater than the sum of its parts.  Tim Roth and William Hurt shine in their roles, and Liv Tyler manages to escape the confines of the cliche \\"female interest\\" as she and writer Zak Penn (who takes an impressive step forward from Fantastic Four and X-Men: The Last Stand) make her character work as the emotional centerpiece of the story.<br /><br />It's a well-paced action movie with just the right dash of drama -- many of the deleted scenes featuring psychiatrist Dr. Samson are deservedly so -- and the CGI Hulk and Abomination are even more impressive than last year's Transformers triumph, especially their final battle which is arguably the best balls-to-the-wall fight scene put to film in recent years.<br /><br />There are a couple of nods to Iron Man and the new shared universe Marvel Studios is creating with their most recent films, and while Hulk is unlikely to get another solo outing any time soon, the prospects for the upcoming Avengers movie suddenly look pretty good.<br /><br />NOTE: The extras are a bit light, and barely meet the minimum expectations for a two disc set, but watching them leaves no doubt about the rumors of Norton's being heavily involved in the creative direction of the movie. There are several references to \\"Louis and Ed\\" throughout that make it pretty clear that he could have legitimately been credited as co-Director, if not co-Writer.co-Writer.

I love TV shows and movies that take place in the 50s and 60s, and I love shows with sexy leading men.<br /><br />I was pleased to see this show is featured on AMC because I love that channel. And I was hooked with this first episode, and I am definitely buying the series now. The characters are attractive and mysterious, and it's interesting how things have changed. I like the way this show serves as a reminder of how America has evolved in terms of women's rights and office politics. I also love the clothes, the setting and the dialogue...it all adds to the realness and charm of the show. I only gave it four stars because I've not seen all the episodes yet.

B001CU1RRW|3.0|Since 2001 when The Essential series was released with Billy Joel being the first artist to deliver on the double-album series, many artists have delivered definitive collections that've reintroduced many great songs and classic gems to the next generation. But, out of all of those artists that really have cashed in, Bruce Springsteen definitely has been probably the one who was ahead of its time. Back in 2003, when his essential collection was released, it delivered more to fans than meet the eye, by bringing in classic songs, and an extended disc for hard core fans to keep coming back. But, with a new makeover for the Essential collection series, does this actually deliver a new Bruce, or is that a waste through the Badlands?<br /><br />The Essential Bruce Sprinsteen 3.0, is actually a re-delivery of Bruce's 2003 Essential collection, which sadly doesn't do enough to appeal to anyone who bought the collection before. Still, it is a simple reintroduction to his legendary career that includes the same songs as before which includes classic staples from Springsteen library from Born To Run and Born In The U.S.A., and the Oscar-winning hit movie song Streets Of Philadelphia, to recent favorites from Bruce's 2002 landmark album The Rising, Lonesome Day and his live surprise song American Skin, which was in regards to a police shooting of a illegal immigrant named Ammado Diallo.<br /><br />While the album is all fine and dandy to appease in the New Essential Bruce Springsteen 3.0, unlike the other editions in the series which've added a disc of extras songs like Billy Joel, Heart and Michael Jackson, there really should've been a extra disc to add in even more for the hard core fans, which makes those who've bought the original edition feel back in 2003 feel like they've wasted their money. There were a lot of Springsteen staples that were missing from before like One Step Up, the somber Secret Garden from Jerry McGuire, I'm On Fire, and My Hometown. But not only that, with the album not including what should've been an actual 4th disc, there really was a missed opportunity to add on material from Bruce's recent albums including the haunting Devils & Dust, Magic, and We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions. So sadly, you won't find his recent hits like Radio Nowhere, and Girls In Their Summer Clothes on the collection.<br /><br />All in all, if you've bought The Essential Bruce Springsteen 3.0 really doesn't add in anything to deliver for die hard fans. You actually get the same collection as you did before from 2003 when the original collection was issued. Still, I was honestly hoping there was so much more for hard core fans to have on the album, but misses the marks that feel like The Ghost Of Tom Joad had came back to haunt the human touch.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C+<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Remastering: B-<br /><br />Overall: Cnot including what should've been an actual 4th disc, there really was a missed opportunity to add on material from Bruce's recent albums including the haunting Devils & Dust, Magic, and We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions.

B001G9LVGG|5.0|O Come O Come Emmanuel.  What an overwhelming tapestry of sound.  The lovely rich combination of Loreena's voice accompanied by Caroline Lavelle on cello and Hugh Marsh's violin has never been more powerful.  Over the years Loreena McKennitt has assembled an outstanding group of back-up musicians and they are at their best here.  For several years now the Abdelli version of God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen has been a Christmas favourite of mine.  Yes, it is repeated here, along with several others, all of them worthy, but there are also many gorgeous new recordings.  I just have to tear myself away from Emmanuel long enough to appreciate the others.  Believe me, it is not easy.

B0002Y4TTC|5.0|This DVD is of a fantastic concert.  There isn't a single song where the audience isn't singing along, and in fact for some parts of songs the band doesn't need to sing at all; the audience is so loud and enthusiastic.  It's also amazing how whenever there's a lull in between songs you can hear people singing Valhalla.  It's definitely a great video of some favorite Blind Gaurdian songs with that little extra bit of awesome.

B001H5X7JS|5.0|I love parodies, any kind, I take em in, hoping to get a few laughs, but lately, I've been a little dissapointed. After Scary Movie hit the scene with its 'So Obivious You'd Be Stupid Not To See Them' parodies, the flood gates opened, alowing any two bit throwback script to be green lighted if it poked fun at a well thought out movie (I'm looking at you Meet the Spartans). Stiller (director) takes a more subliminal spoof in Tropic Thunder, but this isen't full of just movie references, it's the whole industry of Hollywood. The outdated action hero, the chain blinging rapper, the totally funny-but-messed-up comidian, and shows what goes on behind closed doors, as well as taking pot-shots at Stallone, Murphy and Nelly.     The story is origonal, and extremly simple: put actors in a real time war zone. Simple? Yes. Funny? Extremly. This could've turned out into a campy war spoof, with over used catch-phrases and washed up actors, but  Ben Stiller injectes with 3x the laughter, with new takes on Steve-O and Vietnam vets that will have you doubled over on more than one occasion. Stiller, Downey Jr. and Black give killer renditions of celebs, (and even have Tom Cruise hidden in the cast dosen't hurt) and as you could imagine, they act out great. The one who really stood out to me though has Danny McBride, fresh off the set of Pineapple Express, Danny comes to play the role of a demolition man, with his preformance, I was wondering why he didn't headline the movie.      Tropic Thunder is THE summer comidy. It is, I'm not exaggerating either, the best comidy of the year, maybe even the last 5.
0321200683|5.0|Deciding on the best solution for an integration problem often involves difficult discussions between architects and implementors each of whom may hold a widely differing point of view.  Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf have provided a marvelous reference that clearly depicts and explains the messaging pattern choices to be considered along with their respective merits.  Being able to match the problem with these patterns and authoritatively illuminate and quickly settle design team discussions fully justifies having this reference near at hand.    When viewing all the forces on a pattern over the longer term,  the right solution will often require a bit of additional design and implementation effort vis-a-vis the quickest (or entrenched) solution.  By communicating, discussing, and applying widely-understood patterns the overall construction and maintenance costs for integration can certainly be reduced.    One real example of a much better implementation that resulted from this book was the application of the Claim Check pattern to pass a token representing a large PDF document in the message, rather than encode and embed the document itself.  The book explains the pattern clearly, and the implementation was not only easier to work with (because the message payload was much smaller), but the solution has subsequently become a better fit with Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) middleware since the XML for the transaction and its metadata can be rapidly transformed without being burdened by passing the bulky PDF data within the message.    Another example was solved by using the book's detailed explanation of the Correlation Identifier pattern to facilitate the redesign of an legacy transaction message.  The existing application had embedded the correlation identifier in the business message which limited the implementation to a single asynchronous message exchange.  By following the book's recommendation to persist the correlation identifier outside of the business message,the application could be more readily integrated using standard messaging ESB middleware tools and became reusable in environments that required more than one messaging hop.      In both of these examples, the book served both to educate the participates on the relevant patterns and then served as a \\"referee\\" to move the discussion towards a standard and extendable solution. Without the benefit of this book as an authoritative reference, it would have been very difficult to introduce new flexible and agile messaging-based architectural solutions.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I love technology. Having a car to drive, constantly listening to my iPod, and Lord knows I would have serious heart faliure if my Wii or PS3 where broke. Have I became to reliant on technical luxaries? As much as I'd like to say no, the answer is yes. Has America? Yes. Does Pixar think so? Yes. Does Wall-E think so? Yes. Will it open some eyes to this concern? Hopefully.     Pixar has been getting out of their old version of movies, you know, 'The Secret Life of Things We See Everyday' ( Bug's Life, Toy Story, even Ratatoullie) and moving on to more modern images, such as cars and robots. Keeping with this swing of modernization, we are presented with the summer block-buster, Wall-E.     You can take Wall-E from face value and have a great time at the movies; a clumsy, bashful packaging droid wiith his life-scanning robot-lover relize Earth is life adoptable, and bring humans over to re-populate it. That's fine, no problems there. Pixar delights our eyes with the ever so fluid movements of humans and their robotic companiions, colored in with a surprisingly bland, but symboic, palate of whites, blacks, and oranges.     Wall-E gives some deeper reason to it's rhyme than the easy to digest plot. The folks at Pixar are giving a clear 'tech is bad' vibe, especially to cell phones (wake up and smell the flowers, or should I say pool). And I'm sure Disney would love for us to go back in time to the \\"Hello Dolly\\" era, heck, we might find true love there.     Wall-E can be lokked apon as a warm hearted family film, as all Pixar projects can be, or as a wake up slap on the face to our citizens. Either way, it will please all.

015206396X|4.0|I've read many, many books of fantasy fiction in my life, and since I count Tolkien, Jordan, LeGuin, and Brooks among my favorites, my standards are pretty high. It takes an exceptional book in this genre to grab my attention.    Enter Graceling.    I went in with no expectations--after all, this was a debut novel, geared more towards individuals much younger than me, so I had no familiarity with the author or any preconceptions based on prior works. So it was to my surprise that I found myself enraptured by this book and its clever, plucky, and engaging heroine.     Katsa is easily one of the best female characters I've ever encountered in this genre. Anyone who's been through their teens will be able to relate to her occasional awkwardness, her questioning of authority, her increasing awareness of her sexuality, and her difficulty in finding her place in the world and her path in life. She's an ideal heroine and a well-developed character. Cashore imbues her with plenty of personality, grit, and determination, along with a fierce--and sometimes violent--temperament as she learns to control and cope with the extraordinary abilities she was born with (her \\"Grace\\").     Katsa's interactions with a young man also gifted with an unusual Grace form the core of the story, and quickly turn to something that Katsa herself never thought she'd be able to experience: Love. The romantic portions are well-done, though some parents may object to the sexual nature of their relationship outside of marriage (Cashore keeps things discreet when it comes to sex). Her love of Prince Po keeps her grounded when some elements of her Grace--along with a sudden fight for survival--upend her life. There's a surprising twist near the end of the story that changes some things between them, but ultimately strengthens their relationship. Since sequel books seem likely, it will be interesting to see where they go from here.    The book is well-plotted overall, with a few minor stumbles here and there (one being an unbelievable coincidence that brings Katsa in contact with the execrable King Leck). Those can be attributed primarily to Cashore's relative inexperience and only slightly detract from the book as a whole. The elements of political intrigue woven throughout the story establish a solid groundwork for likely future novels. It would also be interesting to see more about the intriguing Princess Bitterblue, the ten-year-old girl that falls into Katsa's protection.    A note to parents: This book is geared towards young teens, and contains some elements of sexuality, a brief discussion of birth control, and some moments of descriptive violence. There's also frequent references to unsavory men leering at young women and teens. Recommended for 15 and up, or for mature early teens.    I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would also recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good fantasy yarn.

B0017V7GTY|4.0|I have never heard the Gaslight Anthem before but i was immediately enticed by their song The 59' Sound. The cd is a solid in the lyrics. It should really appeal to anyone who has listened to classic music like Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan, so if you like rock, alternative, punk, and folk this cd is definately worth listening to. Some of the songs are very catchy. The only reason i give it a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 is because i wish that there was a little more variety in the vocals and it sounded a bit repetitive at times.<br /><br />This band is something that everybody should be excited about!<br /><br />*4 out of 5 stars for a great record its worth the buy*<br /><br />Songs 1,2,8,9,12 are the strongest tracks on the cd! give them a listen!
B001E7OO2I|5.0|Good Morning (Intro) (5/5) - Starts the CD out nicely. It's just a slow melody with John singing/talking in it.    Green Light (5/5) - Definitely a big change from the usual John Legend. Especially since it has Andre 3000 in it. The beat is fas, the lyrics are catchy and easy to get stuck in your head. Andre 3000 is a nice change to be on a song, he doesn't just be on anyone's song. Although it's a fast-paced song, the lyrics are still JL material.    It's Over (5/5) - Again, lyrics that can easily get stuck in your head. It's a relaxed song with somewhat a faster beat.    Everybody Knows (5/5) - One of my favorite songs. As someone else said, one of the best lines in the song is, \\"I wish you the best... I guess.\\" The song is basically about no one really knows how to fix everything even if they think they do. It's a great song.    Quickly (5/5) - Definitely, definitely my favorite song on the CD. The mix of Brandy and John seems like it would be a random mix of voices. But I was shocked when I found out it was her. Their voices together are amazing. The beat and lyrics are amazing at the least. The song is relating to global warming, war and leaders lying to the people. So they're just saying love whoever you want before the world ends.    Cross The Line (5/5) - The song starts out sad and slower. But then beat starts to increase after a little. It's about him (or anyone else) being \\"just friends\\" with someone, not wanting to be anymore, and then taking it further.    No Other Love (5/5) - John is one of the only people that can change up his music, whether it being slow, reggae, or more of a hip-hop sounding song, but it still sounds like his own work. I love in the beginning the guitar playing, then starts to sound reggae.    This Time (5/5) - At first I felt like I had heard this song before, but I guess not. This song is beautiful. I'm not one to say that, but it really is. The music, lyrics and his voice are so powerful in this song. The song is simply about after breaking up, after you messed up, and wanting to start over and give that person everything you have to offer. And it just wouldn't be the same with someone else, like no matter what you do, it can't be fixed. Towards the end, it sounds like it tenses up a bit and that's when it gets really powerful. It's even made me cry haha.    Satisfaction (5/5) - I constantly sing this song. It's very addictive. The beat may be weird to people at first, but you get used to it.    Take Me Away (5/5) - This sounds more like an older JL song. Beautiful.    Good Morning (5/5) - This song can be looked at as sexual, or just romantic in a way. It's about wanting to just spend some extra time in the morning in bed together before she goes off to work or whatever. I constantly sing this song always. \\"Good morning, good morning love..\\" Simple lyrics, yet also addictive.    I Love, You Love (5/5) - The guitar reminds me of a John Mayer song. I have to agree it sounds like a Bob Marley song or something, there's something about it. It's a simple beat, and thoughtful lyrics.    If You're Out There (5/5) - A lot of people say this song is corny or clique. It may be clique, but it's the truth. At least it's not being ignored. Also a powerful song. It's hoping for a better day, a better world.    Bonus songs:    Can't Be My Lover (4/5) - I'm not sure who the other guy is in it, but I can't really understand him. It's another reggae sounding song. I like it.    It's Over (Teddy Riley Remix) (5/5) - There's not much difference between the regular version and the remix, but I still like it. I like Kanye's verse.    Floating Away (5/5) - Simple song. Sounds like it's about being sad about a previous relationship, but someone else came into his life and now he's better.    Set Me Free (5/5) - Also sounds like an older John Legend song. Slow song, about relationship.

It depicts the attitudes of the time toward women trying to be recognized for their talents in music, and the obsessive drive of all musicians to reproduce in music what they feel deep in their soul.  When \\"Beethoven\\" (Ed Harris), described to \\"Anna\\" what it is to be a musician, it brought a tear to my eye. Being a lifelong musician myself, it was the best description I have ever heard.

0240804236|5.0|A book [only]for the \\"wet\\", non-digital, darkroom enthusiast. I have collected photo processing formulas and \\"rolled my own\\" photo-chemistry for the last 30 years. I think this book and its related publication are the only modern, conprehensive collections of information covering the subject of DIY photo-chemistry. It has all of the modern formulas and techniques, and it omits most of the technical information common in older books, but which is no longer compatible with modern photo materials. This is not a book for a beginner, photo hobbist who is lookinbg for an introduction to darkroom techniques. [Do any such still exist?]  As with many books of highly technical information published in low volume, there were some errors in my copy which may or may not have been corrected in the current edition; errata can be downloaded from the author's website.

B00122FYGA|5.0|Lets see. I like Damien Rice. A lot. I would buy his cd if it sucked. Because, I've bought other cd's that sucked because I liked their previous work. And then I listened to it, and said. Man, this sucks, I wish I didn't buy this.<br />Well, I am fortunate. Because I downloaded this from amazon.mp3 for about 9 bucks. And, it doesn't suck. It's actually perfect. Of course I wish it had more of the guy talking in between songs like people tend to do at concerts. but, so what. It has a bunch of Lisa Hannigan songs that I'd never heard that are very very good. Personally I like \\"Then Go\\"<br /><br />So, if your a fan. Want to hear live versions. Then buy this.<br />If your not a fan, then this is a good start.

And they complain they are lost in life, and that school is so hard etc etc.<br />Then their are people with jobs they hate. Or jobs they are simply bored at. (I'm the latter)<br />Do you know anyone who complains, Gosh I hope you say yes or it's probably you that complains. Anyway, this is all important as you should read this book. Then, you'll never complain again. Of all the most humbling stories ever written this has to be one of them. I don't complain about not getting work or having to eat pancakes (lie, i eat very well) everyday. I don't complain about being lost in life.<br />This book is magnificent because it doesn't get into the horrid details that we all have heard before. But it gives you the mindset.<br />How can someone watch others, friends and family die. How does it feel. What pulls you through.<br /><br />Read the book.<br />It's a perfect account of a bad situation.

Though i'd want to be able to hang out with all the characters and I fear they wouldn't be there.  The only hard part of the book were the recounts of peoples experiences with the German invasion and even more hard to hear, the experiences of teh concentration camps.  They added depth and sadness to the book.  A neccessity.  Loved the book.  Loved the pictures painted by the authors words.  loved the characters

B0002KVUKM|3.0|I'll give director Stephen Sommers one thing - he's got style. His previous blockbuster hit The Mummy Returns was almost too much style and too little content, but Van Helsing - a rollercoaster of a tribute to the old-fashioned horror/monster flicks of the past century - manages to finely balance this. But then again, you're not gonna watch this movie for plot. You're gonna watch it 'cause it has lots of monsters and fights, and that it presents those with style. And it does.<br /><br />To get the plot out of the way, nonetheless, mysterious monster-mercenary Van Helsing is under 'employ' by a secret Vatican order to keep humanity safe from monsters. (Sommers seems to subtly poke fun at the Vatican, though, with a scene showing an Arab man being tortured for no apparent reason.) Dispatched to Transylvania to counter the threat of Count Dracula, Van Helsing meets up with a beautiful princess (Kate Beckinsale), the last in a run of family almost completely wiped out by Dracula, and the two reluctantly join forces. Yet how to stop Dracula, when all traditional methods have failed? That's for you to find out - and of course we have vampire brides (whom I personally find way more frightening than Dracula himself), the Frankenstein monster and wolfmen (3 in all) to spice things up a little.<br /><br />I scarcely need to say that Van Helsing's biggest quality is that it's absolutely BEAUTIFUL. The setting is almost deliberately greyish - comfortably set in early winter - as to subtly homage the black-&-white roots of the movie's substance. In particular the werewolves are its biggest visual triumph - nowhere else have I seen as aesthetically-pleasing werewolves. With a slight spoiler warning, my favourite scene in the movie is the final werewolf fight. In particular where the werewolf almost elongates his claws before our very eyes and scratches the wall to enlighten his menace is a truly stunning cinematic moment.<br /><br />Stephen Sommers's talent at going over-the-top is all to the benefit of this movie, a rollercoaster of a movie, a thrilling modern homage to monster movies. It's got a believable plot. It's got nonstop action from start to finish. It's got an awesome, well-executed werewolf fight. What more could you want? Take it. (I wouldn't watch before going to bed if I were you, though.)this movie, a rollercoaster of a movie, a thrilling modern homage to monster movies. It's got a believable plot.

0393061310|5.0|This is a truly profound book, and quite elegantly written. The central insight is how geography has been a main driving factor in the development of civilizations. Diamond comes at this thesis from several different angles, most importantly after looking at how development has differed between different regions.  Diamond builds a very compelling argument, and is helped by his intimate knowledge of many places - knowledge which comes from actually having spent quite a deal of traveling. He is also helped by his diverse background - as a scientist he has also written two brilliant books on biology ([[ASIN:0060845503 The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal (P.S.)]] & [[ASIN:0465031269 Why Is Sex Fun?: The Evolution Of Human Sexuality (Science Masters)]]).  This is popular science at its best, easily understandable, yet deep in insight.
B000WCDI64|5.0|Her reputation got my attention before I even knew of her music. One day I just got tired of hearing what a \\"bad\\" \\"girl\\" she was and set out to find out did she have  talent to go with the bad rep.    I was impressed.  I love her style.  She reminds me of a cross between Macy Gray, and Sade.  She has that different vocal style like Macy's, and her onstage performance reminds me of Sade, though she has a while to go before I would consider her to be \\"up there\\" with Sade.    And I must say, I've never seen a performer wet their throat as often as she did in this performance, but even so, I loved this concert and her version of \\"Love is Loosing Game\\" is the best that I've heard on her other recordings.  I bought the single with the different versions of that particular song, but the one from this concert was not on it and I was disappointed.  I really enjoyed the entire performance and I've watched and listened to it  many times.    I loved her band.  Each musician is highly talented.  Watching each of them was as pleasurable as watching Amy Winehouse.      If she can manage not to be derailed by alcohol and drugs, I look forward to hearing more from her.

B00188M5TM|5.0|I wouldn't hesitate to call this movie one of the best I've ever seen, and I know that when it comes out on DVD, I'll buy it, just to watch it again.<br /><br />The visual images are incredible, recreating Los Angeles as it must have looked back in 1928.  Christine Collins doesn't own a car, and she takes the street car everywhere.  This allows the director to provide glimpses of what L.A. looked like in those days.<br /><br />Her job as a telephone switchboard supervisor provides for more visual images - dozens of women are at work, making the calls go through, plugging wires into a call board, in a world that existed long before cell phones.  How does Christine manage her large floor of employees?  She uses rollerskates to get back and forth across the office.  These small details are essential to recreating the time and the place for those of us who weren't alive back in 1928.<br /><br />The story is based on real events.  Christine's nine-year-old son disappears one Saturday while she's at work, and her life changes forever.  The search for her missing son isn't helped at first by a police department that is in bed with the city's largest newspaper, The Los Angeles Times.<br /><br />This was a fantastic movie.  (Did I say that already?)  Without giving the details of the plot away, I recommend this movie as one that is well worth the cost of admission, $12 for a matinee ticket here in Los Angeles.

0739368044|5.0|Brisingr (Inheritance, Book 3) by Christopher Paolini was the best juvenile book I read this year.  I teach Science and also run the Literary Guild Reading Club for our school. So I like to read what the kids are reading.  I also like to be able to recommend books to them that I think they will like. I love the Inheritance series. His writing is the finest I have read in years. His uses of words are a pleasure to read.  In his last two books I had to look up a few words which was great! The characters in his series are magnificent. They are so real. I really enjoyed the chapters that were written from Saphira's point of view. Eragon's problems and how he handles them are true to form and he has matured very nicely. He revealed some history and filled in a few gaps in the story that really rounded the main characters even better.   I, for one, am glad the decided to make a forth book in the series. I can't wait for the next one!
0812548094|4.0|I read the first book of this series, \\"Wizard's First Rule\\", years ago when I had no idea that Goodkind was planning to make it a series.  That was a good book on its own.    He continues in good form with this second book in the series.  Richard Cypher (excuse me, Richard RAHL - he found out that the villain of the first book was his real father) now has to learn how to master the abilities he discovered he had in \\"Wizard's First Rule\\", and towards that end agrees (extremely reluctantly) to be taught by the Sisters of the Light.  But it seems that they have their own agenda, both for Richard and the world - and another group has their own agenda for the Sisters.    Goodkind continues to entertain in grand style.  This book is a well-done sequel, but it partially suffers from the so-called \\"sophomore jinx\\" - the ending of this tale contains several plot twists that can only be described as cop-outs.  I won't say any more about what they are but it'll be obvious when you get to them.    This is still a good book, however, and I'll keep on with the next book in the series.
B0015AARJI|4.0|I had the Sixaxis and after I got the dualshock 3, the way I felt about my games changed. Being able to feel explosions, falls, vibrations from driving, etc. is nothing short of a thrill.  I played most of my games again after I got the controller and instantly enjoyed them more.  Even after having it for a month, I'm still in amazement.  The only reason why i didn't give this item a 5 was simply due to the price.  I shouldn't have to decide between a new game or controller, it was $54.99 when I brought it.  Anything under $45 is certainly reasonable

When cultural treasures such as this can be gotten for pennies it gives one pause.<br /><br />So yes I highly recommend this set; listen to it, give it room to breathe and let it fill you with the immensity of Bruckner.

B00188M5TM|4.0|In 1980, when I was 12, I saw a horror film called \\"The Changeling\\". I don't remember why I was interested in seeing the film, a ghost story about a composer (George C. Scott) who moves into a haunted house after his wife and daughter die in a tragic accident, only to be haunted by a little boy, in a wheelchair, in the attic. But it freaked me out. I couldn't go near my closet for weeks. The fact that I still remember the film gives you evidence of how scared I was.<br /><br />You may be asking yourself \\"What, beyond the title, is the connection to the new Clint Eastwood film \\"Changeling\\"? I'll get to that. Bear with me.<br /><br />Eastwood is an accomplished director, a dependable actor and a pretty good musician. As he has aged, he has concentrated more time behind the camera, creating some great films for our enjoyment. He has even won Oscars for directing \\"Unforgiven\\" and \\"Million Dollar Baby\\", both extremely powerful films. Now, he turns his attention to the film \\"Changeling\\" starring Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich and written by J. Michael Stracyncski.<br /><br />Christine Collins (Jolie) is a single mom living with her son, Michael, in a small house in South Pasadena. As a supervisor of an exchange for the phone company, she keeps busy, but is able to get home early enough to provide a loving home for her child. One evening, work calls, ruining their plans for a fun Saturday. She reluctantly leaves Walter, her son, home alone, promising to take him to the movies the next day. As it is 1928, and most of the neighbors leave their doors unlocked, she isn't too concerned. But when she returns, Walter is nowhere to be found. She frantically calls the police and they cut her off. She is instructed to call back when Michael has been missing for more than 24 hours. The next day, she is able to file a report. A few weeks later, she receives a call from Captain JJ Jones (Jeffrey Donovan, TV's \\"Burn Notice\\") and he takes her to the train station for the return of her son. With reporters in tow, Jones and his boss, Chief Davis (Colm Feore) are eager for a positive press opportunity; the LAPD has been under attack for some time. As soon as Christine sees the boy, she knows he isn't her son and tells Jones this. But he insists he is the right boy and pressures her to smile for the cameras. Christine takes the boy in, but continues to deny he is her son. As the police department trots one ridiculous theory after another by her, Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), a powerful Presbyterian Minister with a radio show, intends to help Christine and help expose more corruption at the LAPD, something he has made his mission.<br /><br />John Malkovich is always at least interesting and in \\"Changeling\\" he is quite good. As the powerful preacher Reverend Briegleb, he recognizes an opportunity with Ms. Collins, preaching to his congregation about her plight, even though he has never met her and she isn't one of his parishioners. But in his eyes, anyone treated poorly by the LAPD is a parishioner and deserves his help and protection. When he learns of the new boy the LAPD is trying to push into her arms, and the actions they take to ensure she remain 'out of the press', he becomes more galvanized, more determined than ever to help the innocent, sweet young single mother.<br /><br />Malkovich could so easily portray this powerful figure as overtly power hungry, very sinister and as corrupt as the LAPD. But Malkovich paints the Presbyterian pastor's mission well, showing the zeal with which this man is determined to expose the corruption of the LAPD. There is a hint at the power this man has and seeks, but it only helps to flesh out the rest of the character. There is an underlying sense that the more helpful the person is to his mission, to his cause, the more powerfully he embraces them.<br /><br />I was also struck by how believable Anjelina Jolie is in this role. Early on, when she is at the police station, trying to convince CaptainJones she knows who her real son is, a man touches her on the shoulder, guiding her towards another room. In this moment, Collins is about as insignificant as she can be, and Jolie seems to shrink in on her self and become extremely vulnerable; her arms move in front of her chest and she looks down, unsure of where to go. This struck me as remarkable because Jolie's real life persona is that of a very strong woman. She has played \\"Lara Croft\\", she has been an UN Ambassador, she looks like she could kick Brad Pitt's butt. But in \\"Changleing\\", she portrays Collins' place in the world, in Los Angeles, circa 1928, very well, making the woman seem believable and insignificant, until pushed too far.<br /><br />As she realizes the LAPD will not be any help (they send a pediatrician to her house to convince her her son could have shrunk four inches and other physical changes are possible, much to her disbelief) she becomes more determined than ever to get her real son back and to make waves for the LAPD. But the LAPD has some tricks up their sleeves and they put Collins through the ringer. As Collins is subjected to all of this different abuse, she turns to the Reverend for help.<br /><br />The LAPD is run by Chief Davis (Colm Feore) and he is desperate for the department to get as much good publicity as possible. When Collins proves too persistent, he instructs Captain Jones (Jeffrey Donovan), the head of the department dealing with juvenile matters to make her go away. So Jones starts off by threatening Collins. When that doesn't work, he ratchets the persuasion up and makes Collins life hell.<br /><br />Donovan does a great job or portraying Jones swagger and arrogance. As a male, in the LAPD, he sees no wrong in coercing Ms. Collins into accepting a boy she knows is not her own. As Collins becomes more persistent, he feels the mounting pressure to make her disappear and goes to some pretty horrific and stupefying lengths to stop her.<br /><br />But the \\"Changeling\\" becomes too much of a procedural, robbing the story of some of its power. We spend a lot of time watching a suspicious character who may be responsible for the disappearance of Christine's son. He is an interesting character, and he becomes more interesting when he interacts with Christine, late in the film. But until that point, he seems like a distraction. We spend a lot of time watching police officers interrogate children who may be involved in the case. They tell stories that help to fill in blanks, but as they are telling stories, the narrative becomes compromised as we watch lengthy flashbacks. We spend a lot of time in court as two different cases are deliberated. We spend a lot of time away from Christine and the Reverend, a lot of time away from Captain Jones. A lot of time away from the three most interesting people in the film.<br /><br />The film is much better, much more powerful as we spend time with Christine, the Reverend and Captain Jones. These characters are each powerful and each unique and help to guide us through the story. When the focus shifts away from them, the film becomes more like \\"Law and Order: Historical Crimes Unit\\" showing us every detail of this exhaustive case. And many of these details don't add significantly to the overall story and the tapestry of these characters and their involvement in the crime.<br /><br />Eastwood seems determined to live up to the title card \\"A True Story\\" which appears at the beginning of the film. Most movies state, \\"Based on a True Story\\". Not Eastwood. If he says \\"A True Story\\", he is going to show us as much as possible relating to this terrible crime. And a lot of this shifts us away from Jolie and the emotion of her character's story.<br /><br />And the film is too long. As the film tries to tie up each individual string of the story, going so far as to introduce us to another couple that have lost a child and showing us the outcome of that story, it takes too long for us to feel any closure to Christine's story. If there can be any closure.<br /><br />Also, there seemed to be about sixteen too many shots of Jolie with a tear falling down her cheek, a tear addressed to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, a tear determined to get the actress another Oscar.<br /><br />\\"Changeling\\" is not one of Eastwood's best films. The story doesn't stay focused in the right place throughout. And because of this, it loses its power. When you look at Eastwood's work, there are many unforgettable, many powerful films that we will remember for years to come. I doubt \\"Changeling\\" will have the same longevity. If someone were to ask me about \\"Changeling\\" in say, a year, I would probably start telling them about a horror film I saw in 1980, a film that scared me, a film that had an effect on me, a film that I remember to this day.<br /><br />I don't think Clint Eastwood's \\"Changeling\\" will have the same fate.lot of time watching a suspicious character who may be responsible for the disappearance of Christine's son.

B001FB55TO|4.0|If you've never seen a film by British director Mike Leigh before, \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" might be the perfect choice for you.<br /><br />Leigh makes films in a fairly unique way. He gathers a group of unknown actors, provides them with an outline, and watches the group as they begin to improvise their lines and work out the situations. In this way, he is able to capture dialogue and situations, which seem real because the actors are interjecting their own personalities and backgrounds into the roles. Even though he tends to work with unknown actors, actors in his films have gone on to lengthy and prolific careers and he has also re-teamed with people after they have made a name for themselves. Jim Broadbent and Timothy Spall stand out as good examples of the Leigh School. His film \\"Vera Drake\\" introduced Imelda Staunton, a little known British actress to the world and she has since appeared in a number of films, including one of the \\"Harry Potter\\" films and \\"Freedom Writers\\". Generally, Leigh's films are about the British lower class, people struggling very hard to just scrape by. Because of this, his films tend to be depressing showing a group of people on the brink of emotional and financial collapse. They are well made, but the subject matter is usually a bit of a downer. So, when he makes films like \\"Topsy-Turvy\\", his biopic about Gilbert and Sullivan, and now \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\", they show the true breadth of his skill.<br /><br />Poppy (Sally Hawkins, \\"Cassandra's Dream\\", \\"Vera Drake\\", \\"All or Nothing\\") is a young woman living with her younger sister and a friend in a small flat. She has a good job (teaching kindergarten students), a good group of friends and co-workers and a very positive outlook on life. When she leaves a bookstore and realizes her bike has been stolen, rather than get depressed and mad, she decides to get some driving lessons, to make the fateful plunge. Her driving instructor, Scott (Eddie Marsan, \\"Mission Impossible III\\", \\"Vera Drake\\", \\"V for Vendetta\\", \\"Miami Vice\\") is a very angry man and this anger is so completely at odds with Poppy's outlook that she considers it more of a challenge than anything else. As their lessons continue, the duo gets more and more frustrated with each other taking their relationship to new places. At the same time, Poppy realizes one of her students may be acting out due to abuse and calls in a counselor. Tim (Samuel Roukin) arrives and begins to get to the heart of the matter. But he also wants to get to know Poppy better and they set up a date.<br /><br />Because Leigh lets his actors work out the dialogue and reactions through improvisation, capturing the best and most truthful bits of their exercises, his films have a real air of authenticity about them. Much of what the actors say appears to be coming from a place in their subconscious, or their history, allowing the actors to give their characters a large chunk of their own personal history.<br /><br />This style of filmmaking seems especially relevant in the interactions between Poppy and Scott, and this becomes the spine of the film. Scott seems to take an almost instant dislike to Poppy; she is so completely what he isn't. He is serious, angry and very, very professional. She is happy, ready and willing to joke and takes little seriously and seems only out to have a good time. As soon as she enters his car, he comments about the boots she is wearing, and how they can't provide her with the control she needs to operate an automobile. He insists she wear more sensible shoes for their next lesson. But Poppy jokes about how good they make her look and seems to barely hear him. As their lessons continue, and Scott becomes angrier and angrier, Poppy seems to view his attitude as a challenge and tries to get to the heart of the matter, to find out what happened in his life to make him so angry and bitter. Scott isn't stupid and although some of her questions clearly cut deep, causing him to pause for a moment, he just becomesangrier and more persistent.<br /><br />Sally Hawkins is very good as Poppy. There appears to be nothing that will get this woman into a bad mood. When she finds her bike is missing, she is merely sad because she wasn't able to say goodbye. A surly bookstore clerk fails to ruin her day. And when she becomes concerned about a pupil, she is naturally concerned, but also hopeful that she and her colleagues can help the young boy out. In fact, Poppy is so happy and upbeat, she almost becomes annoying. Hawkins walks a very fine line, very fine, between an interesting, unique character and the type of person who just seems annoying, making most normal people cringe with the first word.<br /><br />But as I watched the film, I got used to Poppy. I realized part of my annoyance with her character was that I am not used to people like her. Most people in my life, most people that I know of, have down times, moody times, and I know of very few people who are happy all the time. So, when Hawkins paints Poppy as such a positive, upbeat person, it is a little hard to bear at first. Poppy defends her life, stating she's got a good job, a great group of friends, nice family. Things could be better, things could be worse. She is just uncommonly upbeat and her friends seem to really enjoy being with her and around her.<br /><br />Eddie Marsan is also very good as Scott. Scott is complicated and it will take more than a little prodding for Poppy to be able to work her magic. But she thinks she is up for the challenge. His performance is so good because he proves to be more than Poppy's equal. If she is overly happy and overly upbeat, Scott wears all of the years of disappointment on his face, all of the trials appear every time his eyes swerve towards Poppy. He shows so much emotion, but also seems to change his feelings on the turn of a dime. Initially, he is all business, but as soon as Poppy gets in his car, he is annoyed at her lack of preparation and attention to detail. As Poppy tries to get him to loosen up, there seems to be a moment when he considers this, his facial features seem to lighten a little. Then he realizes this is a woman who is probably like all of the other women who have wronged him and he returns to his previous, stern persona. With each of their encounters, Scott seems more on the edge of letting go, which makes him all the more determined to remain steadfast and bitter. And this serves to make Poppy all the more determined to try to help Scott, to get to the heart of the matter.<br /><br />The dynamic between Poppy and Scott is what makes the film so interesting. We have very few examples of two characters meeting and interacting in such a unique and interesting way. As we watch them interact we feel like we are watching two real people as they deal with their own problems.<br /><br />There is a less successful attempt to introduce another such character into Poppy's life; she attends a Flamenco dance class with her school's head master and the teacher is suitably eccentric, suitably wild and emotional. But this character isn't as fleshed out as Scott and the relationship and the dance instructor seem more like caricatures.<br /><br />Towards the end of the film, Poppy meets Tim (Samuel Roukin) and their budding relationship adds a nice touch and proves that Poppy has many reasons to be so \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\".Sally Hawkins is very good as Poppy.

B0013FSL3E|3.0|Here's yet another fine, fine film from the Pixar geniuses.    It's whimsical.    It looks beautiful and perhaps even more, it sounds beautiful.    It's moving, even when there's no dialog, which is frequently the case. Lovely in its storytelling enough to make a viewer care about a cockroach.    And it has a noble message which is: The earth will be a bad place to live if we keep messing it up.     That's a highly worthwhile sentiments for a major motion picture to put forth and underline (um, somewhat repeatedly). But perhaps somewhere in the world's multiplexes was the child who, duly inspired, might grow up to save the planet and us along with it.    So, a good movie. But you don't need me to tell you that because it's got a 96-percent FRESH rating from Rottentomatoes, which means only 4-percent of all the registered critics in circulation didn't like it.    Salon's Stephanie Zacharek  said, \\"The picture feels weirdly and disappointingly disjointed ... something that starts out as poetry and ends as product,\\" and while I'm still positive on the subject of \\"Wall-E,\\" I think she's onto something there.    So I have to drop just a couple of notions, and they are ....    1) I am 96-percent positive on \\"Wall-E\\" ... while he's on Earth, when the movie is wry and wistful, cautionary yet happily optimistic. Once our little Woody Allen-esque load-lifter stows away to the starship Axiom ... it falls to more like 65-70-percent.    2) I would've found Wall-E's pining for Eve a lot more touching if the story had given us just a little more time between them, just a little more connection. They do start to form a bond before she's, er, called away, but they're not there yet. And he follows her to her workplace and causes trouble? As it is ... Wall-E could conceivably be seen as a kind-hearted interstellar ... stalker, sorta, albeit facetiously.    3) So we have the fictional retail behemoth Buy-N-Large, clearly patterned after Wal-Mart and big box stores like Best Buy. I findit charming that the good folks at a little mom-and-pop operation like Disney will warn us about the dangers of massive, omnipresent corporations and the wasteful folly of excessive consumerism.    I feel certain, too, that in about six or seven months time you will be well-notified of your ability to purchase the double disc \\"Wall-E\\" DVD at those very same retail chains....    4) Over-eating and obesity is a huge, active issue. But as I watched the movie have laughs at the lazy, bloated passengers of the Axiom, I found myself worrying about the big boys and girls in audience, too young to make their own nutritional decisions, who might think the movie was teasing or even bullying them. And I wondered if the movie's creators had considered that possibility and shrugged it off. And I worried that I might be navel gazing just a little too much. It's always possible.    5) The end was a cheat. It was lazy. Worst of all, it was dishonest. Those big guys ain't gonna grow no plants. As presented by the movie, they're not the right people and that ain't the right place. They are the hippies in \\"Easy Rider,\\" and they will try to grow corn in sand.    6) Lastly: The opening scene -- Wall-E happily buzzing around a wasted city to the tune of Michael Crawford singing, \\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\\" -- is one of my favorite scenes of the year. Absolutely.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|...Much more than you could say about the previous album, St. Anger which is now being called a \\"near death experience\\" by members of the band.    Death Magnetic is a really solid album with great riffs and good lyrics.It's great to hear the band getting back to their roots The only song that I didn't like initially was \\"The Unforgiven 3.\\" I still question the song title because musically, there is very little relation to the previous unforgivens, but the song has definitely grown on me. It may not be Ride, MOP, or AJFA but it is raw METALLICA and that is a great thing.    In regard to the sound quality, I've noticed that the clipping is not really a problem when the cd is played through higher quality audio systems.
B000OCZD5G|4.0|The title says it all here folks.  I've been a long time fan of this series (and by series, I mean 'Mad Max' and 'The Road Warrior', not that abortion of a movie 'Max Max beyond Thunderdome').  Anyway, this is the Australian release titled 'Mad Max 2', not 'The Road Warrior', so it has a slightly different intro, and they do refer to Mel's character as Max, not as the 'man with no name' like they did in the U.S. version.<br /><br />Not a lot in the way of extras here.  The picture is very grainy when viewed in hi-def.  Not anything you can do about it; it was a limitation of the time since it wasn't filmed in hi-def.  Still, the film looks good despite it's age and the sound is good.  If you don't have it on DVD, you can certainly pick it up in that format cheaper than this was ($13).<br /><br />BTW, if you haven't seen Mad Max, I'd recommend it as it schools you as to why he's mad (angry, not crazy).
1416575464|4.0|I first must say that I love Domino magazine and buy it religiously every month. Even if I can't afford the lovely items they feature, it is inspiring to look at all the same. If you have read Domino at all in the past few years since it debuted, you will probably recognize some of the rooms featured. What you get in the book that you don't in the magazine is a detailed how-to dive into design guide, beautiful pen and watercolor illustrations at the beginning of each chapter, an exhaustive little black book guide of where to shop, and also a very handy guide on styles of furniture, types of curtains, various fabric details, and more. While I was a little disappointed at the lack of new content that jumped out from the page and grabbed me, I still love the book.

B001JQK0TA|4.0|This episodes finds the Winchester brothers battling to keep another one of those pesky keys from opening and moving the world that much closer to becoming hell-on-earth.<br /><br />It's a good episode, but not as good as the first three of the season. Still, Castiel is back (yay), and we get some more references to what Dean went through during those 4-months-that-seemed-like-40-years in Hell. I'm hoping that gets developed a little more quickly, as it's a good source of tension and suspense.<br /><br />In this one, the tension rests there as well as with Castiel (this time accompanied by Uriel, a snarky and maybe-a-wee-bit-prejudiced angel that Castiel calls a \\"specialist,\\" which you should maybe read as \\"homicidal maniac\\") and his own doubts over the course of events. And let us not forget the tension between Dean and Sam when it comes to Sam using his \\"talents.\\"<br /><br />Good job with this one.<br /><br />Now, word to Mr. Kripke--Ackles and Padalecki have definitely hit their stride as actors, and now's the time to really blow the audience away with some heavy-duty plot and character development.
0767817478|1.0|Godzilla is just one more sad product of a film industry more interested in lining its pockets than creating quality entertainment. The film is unimaginative, predictable, and entirely forgettable. The fact that the name of a beloved classic was besmirched in the process only adds insult to injury.<br /><br />Stay away from this mess and check out Jurassic Park, or even Cloverfield, instead. If you see Mathew Broderick give him a nice kick in the groin for signing on to this vapid and derogatory piece of trash. You can try to do the same to Jean Reno, but I wouldn't recommend it.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Ray Lamontagne, is an enigma. His voice is breathy and rich and his trademark. His songwriting is brilliant at times. He is a genius at his craft. But, he is not reaching the masses.  I found him, oh, several years ago with his first CD, 'Trouble' and his voice and lyrics stirred my soul.<br /><br />\\"The Jesus-bearded troubadour is sort of a recluse. He doesn't enjoy doing interviews, refuses to make music videos, and hates reviews of his work--be they positive or negative. But for all the coffeehouse hacks trying to emulate Bob Dylan's verbosity and Van Morrison's impassioned croon, there's the soft-spoken Ray LaMontagne, singing his own wistful tunes without the weight of pretension and the hype of MTV.\\" Joe Tacopina<br /><br />This CD brings Ray Lamontagne to the fore. He is including a full orchestra. As he said in an interview,  \\"It was time to open up a little bit more, not be quite so reserved in my choice of songs that I wanted to record.\\"  His choices in these ten songs are somewhat similar to his first two CD's but tell a story of their own. These songs are richer and more complete.<br /><br />'You Are The Best Thing'-Best song of the ten and my favorite- backed-up by vocals and this is Ray at his best.<br /><br />'Let It Be Me'- A traditional Ray song-showcasing his beautiful voice.<br /><br />'Sarah'- One of the most beautifully written songs- many say he sounds like Nick Drake in this saga.<br /><br />'I Still Care For You'-The big band background with Ray barely speaking.<br /><br />'Winter Birds'- The poem like wording is exquisite. The best writing of his career.<br /><br />'Meg White'- Such a complete sidestepping of his usual fare. Feet stomping good- a tribute to Meg White of the 'Stripes'- you either love it or hate it.<br /><br />'Hey Me, Hey Mama'- Folksy singing- absolutely love this new Ray- 'Where ya been so long?'<br /><br />'Henry Nearly Killed Me'-Fast paced song with a story line to be followed.<br /><br />'A Falling Through'- A quiet, thoughtful song.<br /><br />'Gossip In The Grain'- Soft, listen carefully to the lyrics- beautiful musical background.<br /><br />Ray Lamontagne is a musician who has not reached his prime.

0142000655|5.0|Steinbeck's epic novel, `East of Eden' is a depiction of his family's history in the Salinas Valley in California.  Often the backdrop of many of his novels, `...Eden' is certainly more autobiographical than most of his works.  The story branches off just like a family tree, and organically the characters blossom into full life.<br /><br />Beginning with Cyrus Trask during the late 1800's, we develop a Jacob and Esau rivalry between his boys Charles and Adam.  Cyrus is a martinet, so overbearingly so, that Adam joins the army just to get out of his sight.  Later, when he returns, the boys have become men and continue their conflict, except Cyrus has died and left a small fortune to both of them.  Much of the novel focuses on the transition each one takes to acquire land and place their wealth in the right direction.<br /><br />From there Adam is the central focus of the story.  He falls in love with a woman named Catherine (also Cathy or Kate) who is a local prostitute.  Through him she bears a pair of twins, Caleb and Aron, who are destined to be as different as Adam and Charles were.  Adam truly adores Kate despite her livelihood, but the relationship turns tempestuous.  While he finds it easy to forgive her transgressions, he can't seem to tame her wily nature.<br /><br />The remainder of the novel follows the aspirations of Adam's family, including Kate, whose conniving ways provide a colorful backdrop as Adam attempts to keep their mother's identity a secret until they are old enough to process her place in their lives. Many subplots intertwine with Aron being an aspiring college bound preacher who falls in love with Abra, a preacher's daughter, while Caleb tries to win his father`s affection as an entrepreneur at home.  As a heartwarming touch, Lee, an Asian-American housekeeper, adds much to the drama as a second surrogate parent of sorts.<br /><br />Reading Steinbeck's classic is delightful.  I found the 601 pages to be a trademark page-turner from one of myfavorite American authors.  While I'll always revere '[[ASIN:0143039431 The Grapes of Wrath (Penguin Classics)]]' as his most powerful classic, I now understand why `East of Eden' is considered among the upper echelon of his great works.  '[[ASIN:B000FA31B0 The Winter of Our Discontent]]' and `[[ASIN:0553131001 Of Mice and Men]]' have an emotional immediacy that are his trademark, but his expertise is no less apparent in this novel with his ability to weave such an intricate and absorbing tale from beginning to end.<br /><br />As poetic prose, Steinbeck's timeless work has been reaffirmed by becoming one of Oprah's prized \\"Book of the Month\\" selections.<br /><br />(On a personal note, I'd like to add that 'The Red Pony' was the only Steinbeck novel I ever read in school.  Apparently my educators saw the wisdom of leaving his legacy to my free time when I could savor his novels because I wanted to--and not because I had to.  I read `Of Mice and Men' during summer break during college, but I read the bulk of his famous works during the early nineties.  Enjoy.)
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|I enter this movie with one question: Was Jack Black born to play the voice of Po, or was he merely groomed to play it? I wouldn't be surprised if the whole movie were centered with him in mind. `Kung Fu Panda' is another Dreamworks' production, one that employs or improves admirable animation tricks--giving the film the vitality of a free-flowing digital puppet show. A visual delight, the film has the innovation of `[[ASIN:B000UFIYP8 Surf's Up (Full Screen Special Edition)]]' combined with the entertainment value of `Ratatouille'. Sent mostly on the fast track, the film has a good ol' witty time matched with artful adventure.     Literally and figuratively, Po (Black) dreams of becoming a Kung Fu master. He's a chubby Panda bear who has more passion for eating than making the food at his family's noodle restaurant. As he's humoring his stork father, a crisis develops in the village: A prophecy states Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a dragon more aptly described as a snow leopard with pouncing Kung Fu proficiency will escape Chorgum Prison. The town converges on Jade Square, the center of The Valley of Peace where holy wise tortoise, Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), will announce the chosen Dragon Warrior. Clumsily, Po propels himself in the center where Oogway, pointing at Tigress has his finger on the panda instead.     All the voices are right on. Jack Black as already mentioned makes all the \\"That's cool,\\" aphorisms work through his own hapless character. Happily his lines lack the hyperactivity of Po's training or Black's own character past. (\\"I know you're being all mystical and Kung Fu-ooey,\\" he chortles.) Hardly discernible is Dustin Hoffman, perfectly cast as the quiet curmudgeon master trainer, Shifu (Chief-u). Some of the funniest scenes go along with Po's training. \\"There is now a level zero!\\" he proclaims after Po's first session. There's also an acupuncture scene that makes a point of Po's ridiculous novice status. Flanking him are the furious five, includinga viper (Lucy Liu), a preying mantis (Seth Rogen), a monkey (Jackie Chan), a crane (David Cross) and a tigress (Angelina Jolie), each bringing a certain perfection to their parts. They're all Shifu's prodigies, and each sport some superhero Kung Fu moves as well as resentful remarks for their new dragon slayer trainee.     Adding fortune cookie wisdom to the mix both illuminates and entertains. (\\"One takes one's destiny on the road to avoid it.\\" and \\"There's no such thing as an accident.\\" Now I may be all wrong, but I thought Freud said that one.) Everyone from director Jack Stevenson to editor Clare Knight deserve kudos for assembling such a fine feature. Containing a well done script, shaking up the animation formula, and mixing funny with fabulous action scenes, 'Kung Fu Panda' may duke it out with '[[ASIN:B0013FSL3E Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)]]' in the animation category when it comes to Oscar time.
B001DRF84W|4.0|Say what you want about this film.  I purchased this Blu-ray as a guilty pleasure, but the good news is its video and audio are great.  As one of Universal Studios' first Blu-ray discs this is excellent.  Again, the movie is not without its detractors, but as a show piece this disc shines thanks to the wonderful picture quality and exemplary DTS-MA audio track.  The extras, while modest, are entertaining and the only arguable thing about the disc is that its menu system mirrors those from the Mummy movies - same sounds and layout.  Hopefully, Universal will entertain the possibility of original and impressive departures from this menu template.  Not much else to say other than, \\"If you liked it in theaters, you'll love it on Blu-ray.\\"
B001F0VHEM|5.0|First, I can't really understand why many people are upset that pink is trying something slightly different this time. Her new work is really good and you need to listen to how mature Pink has become and its her right to try something new!  Secondly, many people are complaining that this is a break-up album, well hello aren't artists suppossed to express themselves in their own music?    Pink really delivers great stuff here  Songs like 'So What', 'Bad Influece' and 'Funhouse' are the songs that will remind you of the old pink that we all know and love.    But try to listen to other songs like 'Its all your fault', 'I dont believe you' and 'Glitter in the Air'. OMG i couldnt even believe that pink would sing such songs anytime in her life! Amazing, Mature and great Voice!      This Album is a must have. Thank you Pink ;*

A fun read (and if you see yourself occasionally, laugh it off.)
B0019T9FL6|4.0|Not bad for a first CD.  However, in some spots the songs are \\"overdriven\\" by the producer.  With the great voice that Jennifer has, the overdubbing and enhancements were not needed.<br /><br />I fell in the love with the gospel song on the CD but deeply saddened by her recent loss of family.  This song was fitting for tragedy.<br /><br />The CD overall is worth the purchase.  I think the next CD or reissue of this CD should be much better.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I'm not going to waste everyone's time going on and on about the 1st 4 Metallica albums; if you're reading this, you know they're legendary and represent what the majority believe to be the band's seminal period. I will say that \\"Death Magnetic\\" is as close as they're ever going to come to re-creating the glory years. I'd say about 90%, which is no small feat for a bunch of dudes 20 years past their supposed heyday.    I'll also break from the pack and say that it some ways, its a disappointment in the wake of \\"St. Anger.\\" I'm one of the 6 guys on the planet who thought that album was brilliant. I loved how raw it was, and how ruthlessly honest the songs were. I also loved that it pandered to neither the classic era Metallica fans, nor the \\"new\\" fans of the \\"Black/Load/Reload\\" 90s era. They effectively committed commercial suicide and alienated both camps to do what they felt they needed to. Not too many bands out there have the balls to do something like that in the face of massive audience expectations.    This is why I can't help but to say that \\"Death Magnetic,\\" for all its greatness, is also a retreat. The band is clearly intent on giving the old-schoolers what they want here. Don't get me wrong; I believe it to be sincere, but it is unfortunate to see them turn away from the ground-breaking roar that was \\"St. Anger.\\"    OK, I've contextualized my opinion on the album. On to the actual music. Pretty amazing, actually. The songs are long, complicated, yet nothing feels wasted or tedious. The album continues to open up on repeated listening, and with the exception of \\"Unforgiven III,\\" the songs flow together seamlessly, in large part due to the band's decision to ape the sequencing structure of the classic albums.     Hetfield's right hand is as liquid as ever, and while I would like to hear more of the gruffness of yore in his voice, I also realize its absurd to expect a person's voice NOT to change after 20+ years. Ulrich's drumming is brutal and tasty, and while it lacks some of the syncopated sophistication of the old days, I will say that Lars more than makes up for it in sheer ferocity of attack.     The most welcome change on the album: the return of Kirk Hammet. Having spent the 90s doing bland wah-drenched blues solos, and then being completely silenced as a soloist on \\"St. Anger,\\" he comes ripping out of the gate in top form on \\"Death Magnetic.\\" Some of his solos on this album (\\"End of the Line,\\" for example) are amongst the most adventurous he's ever done. Hammet's always been a pretty scalar player, but some of these solos have a chaotic fusion-fueled explosiveness to them that took me by complete, pleasant surprise.    The most unwelcome non-change: Metallica still hates bass. While the bass isn't as invisible as it was on \\"...And Justice For All,\\" new bassist Robert Trujillo is mixed down to a dull buzzing rumble. Which is a shame, given the man's level of musicianship. Go buy an old Infectious Grooves CD to hear what I'm talking about.     The other bummer: the production. How does a band as big as Metallica end up with distortion on its source tracks? From what I understand, remastering didn't even fix the problem, because the distortion happened in tracking. Chalk it up to a casualty of the digital \\"everything louder than everything else\\" mentality that has become the norm for big label production work. Rick Rubin's engineers simply pushed too hard on this one.    The production missteps don't ruin the album, though. Here's to hoping they fix it in a later release, although with the way its been selling, I don't imagine there's much impetus to do so at the moment.     In the end, we have a great album from a great band. Not a perfect album, but then these guys have already made a few of those, and only a tiny fraction of bands can even claim to have done that once. And for all the people out there who decided long ago to never give Metallica another shot, well, its their loss. I'm sure Napster and Newsteadthank them for their bitterness.     I believe that if Cliff Burton were able to hear the new album, he would approve. Which is good enough for me. In terms of subject matter, this album is a full-on rage-filled embrace of where Cliff has already gone. All I can say, ultimately, is that I'm glad Metallica found themselves again. We've been waiting a long time. And who knows? Maybe Cliff has too.
0061148512|5.0|Sylvia Plath has in many circles been something of the poster child for modern nihilism, almost to the point of a cultural in-joke (see Fight Club), but the first thing I was struck with was how witty and humorous The Bell Jar starts.  For example, this passage:    \\"I'd discovered, after a lot of extreme apprehension about what spoons to use, that if you do something incorrect at table with a certain arrogance, as if you knew perfectly well you were doing it properly, you can get away with it and nobody will think you are bad mannered or poorly brought up.  They will think you are original and very witty.\\"    Second, it didn't take long to figure out how much modern \\"chick lit\\" owes to Plath.  Before shopaholics and Prada-wearing Devils, Plath had already been there and done that, all the way down to the poor girl working in the NYC fashion magazine angle.      Third, I was touched by the humanity that Plath brings to some tricky subjects:  coming of age, sexuality, career-setting, societal pressure, care for the mentally ill, homosexuality, and social shallowness, just to name a few.  Her descriptions of Esther Greenwood's trip into madness isn't like watching a specimen under her famous bell jar; you get the feeling that you're watching a living, breathing human being who is trying to find a way out of the mental and emotional box canyons in which she feels trapped.      I felt myself connected to Esther in ways that I didn't feel in that other work of 60's young adult angst, The Catcher in the Rye.  Where Esther Greenwood is smart, creative, troubled, and desperate, Holden Caulfield is merely smug, whiny, spoiled, and self-obsessed.  It's not hard to see why Caulfield resonated with many 60's social elites, since they share some of the same characteristics.  In my opinion, Sallinger and Plath shouldn't even share shelf space--The Bell Jar is a deeper, more emotionally involved, and ultimately better written work.    Plath's first calling was as a poet; The Bell Jar was the only novel she ever published.  Her poet's background served her well, as her prose flows along the pages.  I think the book starts a bit better than it ends, but her writing style throughout is a wonder.    As for The Bell Jar being a scathing commentary on her personal acquaintances, I didn't get that vibe.  It's hard to know what those personal relationships were like, but I got these sense of a person writing about what she knew (Plath had her own mental breakdown in 1953).  I can see where some of those people would have been offended, but The Bell Jar was supposed to be the first half of a two volume work, the other half of which was never produced due to Plath's untimely death.    Lastly, it's good to remember that The Bell Jar was written in the early sixties and largely prefigures the feminist movement.  It's often waved around as a feminist novel, and it certainly takes up some of those themes, but The Bell Jar predates political feminism, and in one of the more poignant passages, foresees the arguments of feminism and their ultimate rejection.  Part of the passage is:    \\"Of course, the famous woman poet at my college lived with another woman--a stumpy old Classical scholar with a cropped Dutch cut.  And when I told the poet I might well get married and have a pack of children someday, she stared at me in horror.  `But what about your career?' she had cried.    My head ached.  Why did I attract these weird old women?  There was the famous poet, and Philomena Guinea, and Jay Cee, and the Christian Scientist lady and lord knows who, and they all wanted to adopt me in some way, and, for the price of their care and influence, have me resemble them.\\"    In the end, The Bell Jar is a remarkable work--not merely just important, but also a good read.  If you haven't read it yet, you should.  It's amazing to think what Plath might have written had she lived longer.
0446579939|5.0|After 2 dogs (At First Sight and True Believer) and 1 so-so book (The Choice), Sparks is back in fighting form. This book rocks! It has all the elements of a great story...the dastardly villain, the scruffy hero, and the beautiful princess. Throw in an ailing grandmother and a gangly,nerdy son and you've got yourself a bonified page-turner. I couldn't wait to go to bed each night so I could crack open The Lucky One. That's the ultimate in praise from me because I usually hate going to bed. I gave the book to my brother yesterday because I thought he would like it. He's read about 3 books in his life, and he said he, too, was glued to it. He especially liked reading about the war in Iraq and he appreciated all the military references. One thing that bugged me, however, was Sparks' use of the word \\"pull\\" whenever anyone took a drink of beer. He would say \\"Thibault took a long pull of beer.\\" For some reason I would cringe each time that term was used (6 times in this book.) I mean c'mon, who says that? Aside from that little issue I thought The Lucky One was one of the most enjoyable books I've read in several months. Highly recommended for men, women and teens. A great classic tale of good versus evil.
1582701709|1.0|This book is so hugely popular and I can't really figure out why.  I thought the book was very repetitive. I felt like I was reading the same things over and over. The book could probably have been cut in half!     OK, the book... Well I do believe in positive thinking. I do believe that positive thinking can help you in your life. I think that if you think neg. all the time you will actually stop good things from happening. I also think that when you are a negative person you attract other neg. people. If you are looking for a new job and you are always thinking \\"I will never find a good job, there are no jobs out there, whats the use?\\" etc. how hard are you actually going to try to get a new job? but if you are thinking \\"I know I can get a better job, I have lots of experience, someone will want to hire me.\\" you are going to be trying harder to find a job. So the way you think does directly affect you.    If you are a natural \\"neg. thinker\\" those neg. thoughts will bring you down. If you are a pos. thinker you will just naturally be a happier person because positive thought bring on other pos. thoughts. You will also be a more attractive person with a more pos. attitude and you ill attract better people.    I feel the same way about worrying, Worrying has no purpose in life! It doesn't solve anything, it does not get you anywhere, it does not make you feel better! It is a total waste of time! My husband and daughter are both worrisome people. I am always telling them, you are wasting your time and energy worrying, worrying does not change the outcome of the problem. The only thing worrying does is bring you down. I do NOT worry! I know this sounds impossible but I really try hard and put forth the effort not to worry. My husband is always telling me \\"I don't know how you can't worry about this!\\" He gets mad at me because I don't worry. LOL funny huh?    On the other hand... I do not believe that thinking can bring you material things! Maybe thinking pos. thoughtsmade you go out and try harder to get what you want, but pos. thinking does not just make things appear by themselves.
031606792X|4.0|I almost didn't read Breaking Dawn because I was so angry with the ending of Eclipse, but I read it anyway. The book was ok with your typical and they lived happily ever after ending. The author could have done better. The good news is that a lot of the events that were promised in the other books finally take place. There are also some other unforeseen complications. However, Edward and Bella fans will be happy -- if you are easy to please, that is.     I wasn't happy that the Jacob issue was never really addressed properly. In the middle of the book Bella casually calls what happened with Jacob a mistake. I wasn't buying it. The girl didn't accidently kiss the guy. She said she was IN LOVE with him. Yet, Edward lets her off scot-free. I think this is what ruined this book for me. The author assumed all would be forgiven since Bella was only human. Well, she assumed wrong. But, don't worry. The Jacob issue was put to rest, even if it was in a slightly creepy way. I won't ruin it for you by telling you why he gets over Bella.    This book was also a little slow. It's definitely not a page turner. It almost felt like the author didn't want it to end. A few chapters just drag on and on, and the characters keep having the same conversations over and over. It took me a few days to read this book because it didn't grab me in the way the other books did. I'm glad I read the Twilight series. The first two and half books were excellent. I consider myself a fan of the series because of them. Unfortunately, the events in Eclipse ruined the series for me. The author tried the redeem the Edward/Bella love story, but she failed miserably.
B001EN71DG|1.0|It bothers me how many Star Wars fans bash George Lucas and Lucasfilm for continually releasing the Star Wars movies in 'new' editions.  Star Wars is a franchise, and the films are a product.  If you are stupid enough to buy these films over and over again, then do not complain if they try to sell you the same films every 2 years.  You are creating demand for an old product.
0780624890|5.0|Actor & producer Wesley Snipes may have finally found himself an action movie franchise that he can sink his teeth into with British director Stephen Norrington's \\"Blade,\\" a well-made, imaginative, adrenaline-laced vampire chiller based on the Marvel Comics' super hero. Last seen in \\"U.S. Marshals,\\" Snipes heads up a first-rate cast that includes Kris Kristofferson, Stephen Dorff, N' Bushe Wright, Udo Kier, and Traci Lords. \\"Blade\\" synthesizes the exotic swordplay of the \\"Highlander\\" epics, the double-digit body count ballistics of a John Woo thriller, and the martial arts pandemonium of a Jackie Chan opus to spawn a horror movie several cuts above your ordinary vampire fare. If the sight of blood, especially torrents of bogus blood, turns your stomach, avoid \\"Blade.\\" \\"Blade\\" takes its cues from renegade vampire sags like Robert Rodriguez's \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" (1996) and Kathryn Bigelow's \\"Near Dark\\" (1987) rather than those venerable classics like Tod Browning's \\"Dracula\\" (1931) with Bela Lugosi and Neil Jordan's \\"Interview with a Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles\\" with Tom Cruise (1994). The Snipes hero must have chose the same guy who tailored \\"Mad Max\\" and \\"The Terminator\\" in what essentially constitutes an apocalyptic version of Fran Rubel Kuzui's \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" (1992). \\"Blade\\" qualifies as a tour-de-fang chiller with darker humor than \\"Buffy,\\" top drawer special effects, and an infectious techno-pop soundtrack. Lowbrow escapism that it ranks as, \\"Blade\\" benefits chiefly from scenarist David S. Goyer's solid, seasoned writing skills and atmospheric, innovative helming by sophomore director Stephen Norrington.<br /><br />Scenarist David S. Goyer provides an invigorating screenplay. \\"Blade\\" bristles not only with lively action and adventure, but also an intelligible plot that the characters go to extreme lengths of describe and discuss. When you consider that Goyer has penned scripts for such movies as \\"Dark City,\\" \\"The Crow 2: City of Angels,\\" \\"Robert Heinlein's The Puppet Masters, \\"Demonic Toys,\\" and \\"Kickboxer 2,\\" then you know he qualified as the ideal choice to pen the script. Goyer's revenge fantasy script never leaves you in the dark about a bloody new world where its embattled but immortal hero Blade wages a perennial war against vampires. Goyer shows impressive flexibility in co-opting vampire mythology. At one point, a half-blooded vampire smears on sun screen lotion to shield himself from the sun. Jealous vampires put one of their vampire enemies to death by gradually exposing him to sunlight at dawn. Meanwhile, our hero uses an ultra-violet light to singe unruly fangsters. About the only vampire trait left out by Goyer is the ability to shape-shift into a bat.<br /><br />A vampire infected our protagonist's pregnant mom with its venomous blood while she was carrying Blade in her womb. Delivered by Caesarean section from his dying mother, Blade emerges as neither totally a human nor truly a vampire. He can walk in sunlight without risk, and neither silver nor garlic an faze him. One villainous vampire admires Blade when he observes that Blade has \\"all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.\\" The filmmakers milk dramatic tension from Blade's growing tolerance to Whistler's (Kris Kristofferson of \\"Convoy\\") anti-venom serum. The chance that Blade may not revert to his vampire origins not only lurks in the background but also contributes to the suspense. This element of uncertainty generates anxiety and it endows the protagonist with an Achilles' heel that make shim more believable and charismatic.<br /><br />Legendary vampire hunter Abraham Whistler (a grouchy Kris Kristofferson with a gimpy leg) found Blade as a juvenile roaming the streets and living off the blood of derelicts. Transforming Blade into a super hero with injections of a blood substitute, he serves as Blade's stepfather and ordnance maker. Surprisingly, Whistler lasts longer than most sacrificial characters. Loosely modeled on the Roman god Vulcan who forged weapons for the gods, Whistler trains Blade to kill vampires with extreme prejudice. Blade approaches his crusade with the enthusiasm that Charles Bronson mustered for killing muggers in the quintet of \\"Death Wish\\" movies. Not surprisingly, more than enough vampires survive from other parts of the world for Blade to combat in the sequels. Wows, does \\"Blade\\" ever leave itself wide open in its wrap-up in Russia for a sequel! Anyhow, the vampires in \\"Blade\\" are not tooth fairies. Organized into a powerful, global underground syndicate, Dragonetti (Udo Kier) presides over them as a Corleonesque godfather of sorts. The scene in the shadowy conference room with vampires dressed in suits is effectively creepy. Kier's Dragonetti is a pure-blooded fangster in a world of full and half-blooded vampires. In \\"Blade,\\" the cities of the world have been practically undermined by vampires. Vampires have gained leverage in the business and politician arenas. These vampires own the police so they control the law. As the snotty, upstart Deacon Frost, actor Stephen Dorff plays the half-breed vampire who Dragonetti turned. Frost harbors greater ambitions than Dragonetti. The elder vampire prefers to co-exist with mortals and abide by their treaties. Frost demands that the vampires dominate humanity. Secretly, Frost has been translating an ancient vampire text which will enable him to resurrect a vampire blood god. Frost wants to revive this demon, but he needs the missing link: Blade's blood. Frost calls Blade \\"day-walker,\\" because the vampire bible has prophesied Blade's unique genetic make-up. If he can revive this blood god, Frost can control the House of Erebus that rules the undead, and vampires can emerge as the dominant force in the world. The splashy finale in a phantasmagoric vampire temple with skeletons bursting out of the mouths of vampires in a storm of jagged lightning bolts owes a little to \\"The Fifth Element\\" as well as \\"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\\" (1958), but this scene is fully and logically integrated in Goyer's script.<br /><br />Sure, \\"Blade\\" amounts to nothing more than bloody pulp fiction. Nevertheless, Goyer and Norrington have reinvented vampire thrillers. \\"Blade\\" is entertaining, somewhat cheesy, but technically proficient hokum done with considerable technical prowess.

B0016Q2D5M|4.0|My 10-year-old son was mesmerized from the time the movie began until it ended. I too thought that the story was lighthearted and entertaining as well. We both had the simple desire to be entertained, on a Sunday afternoon and \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" fit the bill.     Sean, a young teen who has lived most of his life without the benefit of a father (an adventurer gone missing), is being forced to spend time with his uncle Trevor (his father's brother, a professor).While going thru several items belonging to his missing, yet presumed dead father, they discover a book that yields clues to his possible whereabouts and could unlock the mystery to a magical world. Jumping on a plane to follow the clues, Trevor and Sean try to build a relationship that they both can benefit from, while deciphering clues. As they arrive in Iceland, the adventure begins with the addition of a beautiful mountain guide Hannah, whose father and Trevor's brother were ultimately connected because of similar beliefs. As all three struggle to believe in the impossible, we are dazzled by glowing birds, amazing, waterslides, angry dinosaurs, large attacking Venus fly traps, and other moments of wonderful special effects.     \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" is a wonderful family drama that had everything you could hope for. You had romance and comedy (uncle and nephew argued over who would get the girl), there were tender moments (when Trevor finds resolution to what happened to his brother 10 years earlier), and very entertaining special effects. So, if you want to watch an easy going, light adventure, this is the movie for you.
0061150142|4.0|This started out as a real page turner for me.  It sucked me in and I read about half the book in one evening.  Trying to go back to how teenagers in love view the world, I think Picoult really captured how kids this age see only the immediate and feel everything is more significant then it really is.  In some ways this is the classic teen love tragedy.  Parts of it just went too long and overall I think it would be a better book with fewer twists and turns.  I just didn't feel like they all added that much.  In fact, at points I got distracted and started feeling annoyed at characters that I initially was drawn into, but overall still worthwhile to read.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Young viewers might find plenty to like in this fast paced, decidedly family friendly affair, but older viewers who know the original films will find the latest installment is missing something essentially 'Indy'.<br /><br />The elements that made Indy so great, the snappy lines, the hunt for artifacts, the ceaseless chasing, are still intact but often seem forced, as if they were added just to make an otherwise stock action film fit the Indie brand. Ford still delivers the goods as Indiana Jones but the new additions to the marquee, including sidekick Labeuof and villain Blanchett, are relatively uninteresting, and the plot gets a tad too convoluted for its own good.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes hint at the possibility of greatness, but sadly the remaining hour or so is mostly mediocre. Perhaps the film was butchered in editing, or maybe Lucas tried to cram too much in from the start, but somewhere along the lines Crystal Skulls lost its charm.<br /><br />While it's good to see Indy dust off his hat for one last globe spanning adventure, I wish the film had been handled with more skill. It entertains for 2 hours but is ultimately forgettable and for the franchise, that's a shame. Somehow I doubt we'll see Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in the same sentence with 'classic' 15 years from now.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Just everything you wanted to see and know about this outstanding sci-fi masterpiece, guys, I'm telling you. Amazing box-set.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This movie is just plain fun. It's obvious the entire cast is having a blast, and their enthusiasm is infectious. Sure there are some points of bad camera work and Brosnan's voice isn't classically trained, but who cares? He sings well enough, and his singing really grows on you through the movie.     It's a fun movie with catchy songs, a fun story, and a happy ending. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I can't wait to own the DVD the second it comes out.     Not every movie has to be high art. Sometimes it's enough for it to be entertaining, and this movie is wonderful.
0060775858|5.0|My Mom and Dad used to read this to me every night growing up and I bought it for my God daughter because it is one of the most memorable books from my childhood.   Such a great children's book. Should be a part of every child's bedtime story time
B000OY8NII|3.0|I'm perfectly happy with the basic product.  The DVD set of Eureka Season One is what I expected.    Unfortunately, the cardboard case holding the DVDs was a little beat up - the handling and packaging process was apparently less than ideal.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|It's seems funny to me that all these negative reviews start with \\"I didn't finish the book\\" You can't critique what you haven't read. This book is soooo amazing, it gets better with each page. I hated to see it end. It's so real and endearing. I love this woman, this journey is so like my own. My husband also read it and loved it. I can't wait till the movie comes out!!!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|This is one alblum that I can play over and over.  It has been a long time since I have found such an artist. Her style is like the sixties. The song Distant Dreamer is one of my all time favorties you just got to hear it.  Great alblum , please make more.
B001IUBZAU|4.0|Black Ice is a solid, creative effort here from the boys from Oz, particularly when you consider they've been on the go since President Nixon. We get 15 tracks all in a compact 4 minute or less radio format, giving the CD a total running time of about 55 minutes. Having listened to the new material several times over, four favorites have emerged from the pack. The crunching opener, and single, Rock 'n Roll Train, really gets you in the AC/DC mood. You`ll want to headbang along to this one (if you still have hair) or do the Angus strut (if you don't). You might not agree, but BJ's vocals remind me a bit of Nutbush City Limits! Track no. 3, Big Jack, is another bruiser which had me turning the knob on my sound system up to 11. Track No. 4, Anything Goes, is another killer song, with a hint of Springsteen thrown in for good measure (again, that's my opinion). That leaves track 13,  \\"Rock 'n Roll Dream\\". Don't let the ponderous start fool you - this one will have you squeezing every amp out of your hifi - and its my co-favorite alongside the opening track. Such is the strength of ACDC's back catalogue, however, I doubt if any of the tracks here would quite make it onto a single-disc best-of. Having said that, it's way better than some of their post Back in Black material and definitely worth the blown valve on your stereo.
B00104JONO|5.0|I'm with the other reviewer, who didn't have high hopes for part 3 after the wretched excuse for a sequel Disney handed us in Part 2: The Country Club.  Oh, what a disappointing picture.  But this one catches at and grabs exactly the qualities the first one had that made it so great, and while it doesn't take us by surprise the way Part One did, it has something bigger that really works for it here, it has a bigger budget and you can see it on the screen this time.  I wonder how it will play on home video, but on the huge theater screen it was awesome.  In fact even on the big screen the energy and the action seemed like it was going to blow the screen into pieces--that's how feisty this one is.  It's like HSM on nitro; it's all glowing and fizzy like electric Kool Aid.<br /><br />Okay, the plot isn't much but it's better than the insult of Part Two.  It's not going to be about whether the Wildcats become champs or not, for that suspense is taken care of in the musical's opening number.  It's mostly about Troy Bolton trying to decide whether or not he deserves his own dream.  This philosophical question is examined under a microscope through a barrage of ethical interventions: by the end I was wondering what sort of person DOESN'T deserve his own dream, so the plot's climax was rather an anticlimax.  Was Xac up to the challenge?  I think so.  That song \\"Scream\\" had his climbing the walls and rolling around the floors and ceilings like Fred Astaire in Stanley Donen's ROYAL WEDDING--but picture an upset, frantic Fred Astaire, perhaps the Astaire from ON THE BEACH.  Anyhow he's very good, though too pumped up, or were those scary muscles Photoshopped in, for sometimes they disappeared and he was just a boy again and not the Terminator.<br /><br />But who cares about the plot, for really all it was is a throughline on which to hang a series of remarkable, even heroic musical numbers.  Warning, song number two (in the treehouse) is pretty bad -- almost Part Two bad -- but nothing else afterwards even comes close to that nadir.  And even that number is saved (or nearly so) by one of Kenny Ortega's brilliant storytelling ideas, when Zac pulls a cord and the treehouse roof lifts up to reveal the beautiful night sky gleaming with starlight.<br /><br />After that, it's sort of an unbroken series of showstoppers, and even Ryan and Sharpay get a good one for a change: \\"I Want It All\\" outdoes Busby Berkeley in its continuous invention, with Troy playing an adoring Sharpay fan, Gabriella sexy in a French maid's outfit, the Russian girl playing a NY cab driver, etc.  \\"Can I Have This Dance,\\" ther waltz number, is adorable, though one worries about Gabriella dancing backwards in those big high heels.  The big love duet, \\"Just Wanna Be with You,\\" is not as good as \\"Breaking Free\\" from Part One, but even Mozart's THE MAGIC FLUTE is not as good as \\"Breaking Free\\" from Part One, so cut it some slack.<br /><br />In \\"A Night to Remember,\\" the girls fantasize about prom night, while the boys complain about fitting into tuxes, it's all in good fun, and it will not quit, just gets bigger and bigger; other kids play the leads' parents in cute scenes involving the boys picking up the girls from identical clapboard houses, it's magic.  The junkyard duet isn't as good as it wants to be, but again Ortega works magic, first by substituting 8 year old look alikes for Corbin and Zac, then having the boys dance (or whatever you call it) on giant big rubber tires across the screen, it can't be real, and yet it looks real, doesn't it?<br /><br />I wonder if the producers were annoyed with Monique Coleman because she certainly doesn't have a thing to do here.  Can she even sing or dance?  Maybe not.  As for Ryan, I have heard that in real life he is straight.  Well, maybe so.<br /><br />The one I hate the most though, is Stanford.  Yes, Stanford University.  What kind of cruel college accepts 30 deserving high school seniors to a special honors program that forces them to miss their prom, their spring musical, AND their own graduation?  What kind of precedent is that to set, Stanford?  What comes next, enrolling the smart ones right out of junior high and forcing them to miss the magic of high school entirely?  Let me tell you, I felt for Gabriella Montez in this one, and I always will.  UNFAIR STANFORD!  JOY KILLING STANFORD!AND their own graduation?  What kind of precedent is that to set, Stanford?  What comes next, enrolling the smart ones right out of junior high and forcing them to miss the magic of high school entirely?

0679809015|5.0|My daughter (now 2 years old) has loved this book since she was 8 months old.  Its great for travel because it is small and because it has a lot of pages for a board book.  I had to open the flaps for her when she was little but now she loves to do it herself. We used this book to teach her the sounds the animals make and now she is learning to say the names of the animals. It has held up well considering the heavy use its had. At two, it is still a favorite book. I'm glad we bought it.
B001CLG6RC|5.0|I really loved every track on this CD and can't stop listening to it. It's a must have if you love Enigma.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|I don't think I can cover anything that hasn't already been covered in other reviews.  Is this the worst Indy film?  Yeah, probably.  However, it still fits okay into the franchise.  Four Stars For Nostalgias Sake.  This series really should have taken the \\"James Bond Route\\" and began casting new leads to lend viability to the franchise.  At this point it's too late.  Still, it was fun while it lasted and took me back to the truly great films of the 80s.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I won't waste time or space going into why and I don't want to give anything away by explaining anything.  It is a great, great film.  Five stars.  That is all.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|Dear Metallica,  You are no longer allowed to use the word \\"Unforgiven\\" in any form or fashion. It really seems desperate that you have the same title for at least 3 songs on 3 different albums, and it bodes ill that the first single is (TAA DAA) a stupid ballad. You should have packed it in when Cliff died, because your musical ability must have been on that bus too, you just forgot to bury it.
B00194V37K|5.0|This book is very eye-opening if you are willing to look into yourself and accept some basic concepts. Obviously if you choose to read this, you are seeking out answers that you haven't yet found and you will identify with different portions of this book, depending on where you are in your journey. I did find the pain-body concept extremely helpful in my own understanding and many of the issues related to how children grow from dysfunctional parents. So much of the book is written like a psychology text while other sections come off like a spiritual reading. Metaphorically, some images very much resonated with me and this is one of those books that I know I will re-read probably after I let it sink in a bit. I think the overall message is powerful, aside from the hype and if we all took the time to find out what is behind our anger, resentment and jealousy so that we can start living from our true Being, we would all be much happier as a society!
B0010YPTGU|3.0|The DVD was terrific. Unfortunately the CD was just a subset of the   concert selections on the DVD. Why?-- misleading.  One of the missing is the terrific duet w/ Heather Headley-- Vivo per Lei which  I would like to include in my music library but can't find anywhere
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|this blu-ray images beautifully, we have 7.1 surround, with Polk power driven towers, Polk center speaker and klipsch sub woofer.our receiver is an elite new in 08.  even my husband ( the audiophile ) who hates opera and organ music enjoyed the film due to the very good soundtrack.  the film was not as dark as the stage performance, this meant we could watch it with our daughters I am thoroughly pleased with the performance and the entertainment value of the film
B001GM28HO|4.0|After purchasing a series of disappointing dance records in recent months, not since Britney Spear's Blackout have I picked up an album I have enjoyed so immensely as Lady Gaga's The Fame. The long awaited album from the new artist who gave us \\"Let's Dance\\" this past summer, The Fame is a fun, catchy and electro-inspired record that blends the best of catchy pop and electro-dance, for a head spinning album full of hit singles.     Lead single \\"Just Dance\\" is a great tase of what this album contains, with other great tracks including \\"Poker Face\\", \\"Money Honey\\" and \\"Lovegame.\\" Lady Gaga's voice sounds eerily like Gwen Stefani through out the album, even against the heavy Euro-techno-pop beats of The Fame.     Hopefully the first of more hit records to come, The Fame is one of the best dance recordings of the year, and puts Lady Gaga alongside Britney and Madonna, as a genuine pop music queen.
1558908323|3.0|It has some suspenseful moments. It's worth watching once. However, there are a lot of familiar scenes I've already seen in other movies. It's worth watching once.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|On \\"Funhouse\\" - Pink delivers for the fifth time in a row, with an album full of catchy, memorable tracks perfect for that long drive or to sing along to.. The hook-laden songs stick in your mind, and provide listeners with 12 catchy pop rock songs, and an album you don't need to skip a single song on.     Lead single \\"So What\\" is Pink at her fiesty and spunky best, and the huge hit this song has become worldwide speaks to her ability to churn out hit after hit, ten years into her career. Otehr album standouts include the powetrful \\"Sober\\" and the catchy and fun title track \\"Funhouse.\\" Another great mid-tempo song is \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\" and the classic rock track \\"Mean.\\"    Though including more down-tempo songs than I personally prefer, \\"Funhouse\\" contain some of Pink's strongest music to date, with #1 hit written all over several tracks. The album's standout track by far is \\"Bad Influence\\" - one of the catchiest and most fun pop rock tracks I've heard since Kelly Clarkson's \\"Since You've Been Gone.\\" \\"Bad Influence\\" MUST be released as a single, and will only confirm Pink's place in the pop hall of fame, along side Madonna, Blondie and Joan Jett.     Pink's past few album's have been accompanied with some odd ledad single choices, with \\"Trouble\\" and \\"Stupid Girl\\" being awful options for first single on her last two albums..  But this was not the case with \\"Funhouse,\\" where \\"So What\\" is demonstrative in the catchy and powerful tracks that this record contains.     Here's to many more #1 singles and albums from Pink, to come..
6305090564|1.0|The movie is in DEEP TROUBLE. Its special effects are below par compared to today's movies. The acting is stiff and not engaging. There's no suspense or horror. The fighting scenes are typical of B movies. I menan they don't look real. It's worse than Anaconda.    It's one of the worst monster movies.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|The third season keeps the show rolling with the main story line of Dean's impending death on track with all their side stories as well. It sheds light into how this life takes a toll on them but keeps their witty banter instilled in each show as well.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This show has screwed up all other vampire shows/movies for me.  Seriously.  I don't care about any of the vampire movies that are coming out.  Half of my vampire movies are not so good now.  This show has set the bar.  Really.
078401213X|4.0|This extraordinary b&w (as in \\"black\\" & \\"white\\") film is called Pi because it represents geometric value. The term \\"geometry\\" was first known in the ancient world as \\"geomancy.\\" I noticed other reviewers felt \\"gypped\\" because the film was not in color. I can't imagine it any other way--it deals in numerals & figures--the b&w concept is totally appropriate and masterfully done.<br /><br />I have been interested in the metaphysical/alchemical concept of \\"The Great Work\\" for a long time. Recently I've re-focused on the subject after reviewing certain books & films (see links list below.) There are various interpretations of The Work, and there's no easy way to explain it, but I'll try: The Great Work is known as Jivanmukti in Hindu philosophy & refers to a complex system of Yoga (\\"yoke\\" or uniting) the devotee with Divinity; microcosm to Macrocosm; subject to the object; Cosmic Consciousness. In alchemical terms it is the search for the fabled Philosopher's Stone that can turn base metal into gold. Historically The Great Work has also played a role in magick ritual--both \\"white\\" & \\"black\\"--and has been described as a \\"dangerous path\\"--one that has reportedly driven Adepts mad.<br /><br />In modern terms The Great Woek can be seen as the quest for finding The Theory Of Everything (TOE) in astro-physics and advanced mathematical terms.<br /><br />Such is the background of \\"The Work\\" in a very capsulated overview.<br /><br />In Pi the dramatic focus is on the hero's obsession to figure out the perfect number to play the stock market. This is obviously a  materialistic interpretation of The Work. However, as the hero becomes increasingly strung out, deeper ramifications take hold of his mind.<br /><br />The film is remarkable in its stark, often grainy blend of black & white images, brought together in a surrealist/existentialist cauldron that borders on madness itself. There are very few actors in the movie, but their performances are deftly displayed by expert direction. Reportedly the movie was produced on a $60,000 budget.<br /><br />This is an extremely visceral film & brutal in its examination of the political & religious exploitation of The Work. Some people are bound to be offended by certain aspects of this movie. For example, the protagonist is a secular Jew who meets a wise cracking, supposedly religious Jew who gets him involved with a rabbinical group of Jews who are working with Kabbalah, The Zohar & a computerized \\"Old Testament Code.\\" Their goal is to enter the mind of god, to control the elemental power of creation.<br /><br />These are the antagonists who, along the anti-hero's deteriorating mental state, degenerate into downright sinister characters. This aspect of PI might be a problem for some people, because the scenario comes dangerously close to reinforcing the International Jewish Conspiracy garbage promoted in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (i.e. that an evil \\"Cabal\\" of Jews run the world.) Maybe I'm reading too much into the script; I tend to see everything as a Political Conspiracy these days. I'll have to assume director Aranofsky knew what he was doing in regards to this aspect or possible interpretation of his absolutely brilliant film.<br /><br />Throughout the movie the hero keeps gulping down handfuls of what I presume are amphetamine & he obviously has been up for a very, very long time.<br /><br />This reminded me of the strange, unsolved case of Philip Taylor Kramer who disappeared along with his van on 12. February 1996. Kramer was a bassist in the 60's band Iron Butterfly. He was also a brilliant mathematician, computer programmer & technological visionary who apparently had top level government clearance. Reportedly he had been working on a faster-than-light communications system.<br /><br />Before vanishing off the planet, Kramer called 911 from his van, claiming that he was going to commit suicide. His disappearance was almost immediately reported & extensive searches made; but neither Kramer nor his vehicle was ever found, not a single trace.<br /><br />The following quotes are from: [deleted because external hyperlinks aren't permitted on Amazon reviews--readers can go to a search of Kramer. This one is posted under \\"skeptictank\\"]:<br /><br />\\"I observed the growing rumors and the widening conspiracy yet I didn't think much of it -- until KTLA News here in Los Angeles ran a short five minute report on his disappearance and confirmed that Kramer had indeed been working on a faster-than-light communications system.

B001C08RHA|3.0|What I liked best about this movie was not everyone spoke English. And there were no subtitles! Here's the negative side: I could not believe a guy, who is almost dead, held prisoner in a cave, could possibly set up a foundry and a lab. He built himself a version of Robo-Cop. Meanwhile the Taliban's watching him on closed circuit TV. Needless to say, Downey escapes and gets back to the United States. But not before his robot character crashes and the Taliban pieces fragments back together again.<br /><br />Downey is so smart, he can build robotry control circuits from scratch like he's making pasta. In the film he is engaged by two jet fighters, but flies faster and smarter. I did not like Jeff Bridges, as he always plays himself in these films. This was poor casting.<br /><br />This plot is too much to believe. Kids will love it because kids believe anything. The movie technicians did a great job assembling parts; special effects people get an A+.<br /><br />I would take my kids to see the movie. I would not take my wife, because she would rather go shopping for shoes. Oh, one last point, the role of the Air Force colonel was miscast also. If you're going to be responsible for weapons systems, you need to be sharp and proactive. This colonel should have been assigned to a freshman ROTC unit.
0743277708|5.0|Richard Adam's Watership Down is an amazing story of epic proportions worthty of El-ahraiah himself. It deals with a tale of great bravery, courage, and loss of a group of friends struggling to survive and find their home. The story follows the journey of Hazels, Fiver, and their many companions. Even though the subjects of the book are animals (particularly rabbits) instead of people, this novel doesn't fall short in any grade, in fact, it surpasses all the marks.   The classic story begins with Fiver, one of the books main characters and a rabbit with what some would call psychic abilities, foresees a great danger heading to destroy his homeland. After warning all his neighbors and countrymen, only a few come with him on his journey to find a new warren, or home. Amongst those are Hazel, Bigwig and Blackberry. As the group journeys across the land, they encounter other rabbit countries and many elil, or enemies. They eventually find the fate of their old warren and go on many daring mission to help and protect their new home. Hazel and his friends even befriend a bird that helps them along the way.   Watership is nothing shot of a truly astonishing, heroic, awesome story that is l more than worth its weight. At nearly 500 pages, some may be turned away by its large size, but every page is more than worth reading. The imagery and detail that this book provides really makes you feel like you are there, alongside the rabbits in their everyday struggle for survival.   Read as the friends escape from crazy places where rabbits are much more like squirrels and dogs. Watch as they fight off cats and other elil in epic battles. Discover how they build up their new home, and if they can keep safe from enemy forces.    Watership Down is a true classic story that will be treasured for many generations to come and will become a huge part of English history. It is truly one of the best books ever written and one that we can all relate to. A statement about his book, by the St.Louis Post Dispatch, said that \\"Everyone who can read English should read it.\\" This is very true, for it is a truly astonishing book. I can grantee you that Watership Down will not disappoint you.
B001CTA1T8|5.0|Months before it's release, I saw the first trailer that was released. It knocked my socks off! This was a huge production number reminicent of the Busby Berkeley numbers from the Thirties films. The computer work on lip-sync and facial expressions were very natural and the music fell into place beautyfully. I waited for the films  release October 3rd. and was not dissapointed.  The big thing I did miss in the release was that they did not use the production that was used in the first trailer.  Now I wait for the DVD release,and pray they include that first trailer as a \\"bonus feature\\" in the DVD release. I have touted this film to many of my friends, and most agree as to how funny, cute, exciting,etc it is.  I would also be interested in seeing a \\"how it was made\\" feature.  I now wait for the DVD.
0316776963|5.0|I think I have now read or listened to all of David Sedaris' books or audiobooks.  I prefer the audiobooks as he tells it the way he writes it.  Just sit back and enjoy.  No one tells a story like David Sedaris.  You'll laugh til you cry.
B0019KWE6S|5.0|I am grateful that this album was rediscovered and re-released. This is easily the best CD I have purchased in 2008. Feiner and Anywhen have created a work of timeless beauty with the sensitive vocals, the lush orchestrations, the immaculate arrangements, and excellent songwriting. The CD is worth the price for \\"The Siren Song\\" alone, but other gems include \\"For Now\\", and \\"All That Numbs You\\". Treat yourself.
B0013ND30W|5.0|As a kid i loved the movie, but now remastered and recolored, it looks even better! I never thought that the movie would look so great in blu-ray, the color and line quality looks so much better.  I recommend this for the collector, especially with all the special features it has.  BD Live is also pretty amazing!
B00005JPS8|5.0|When I first saw Iron Man in the theaters, it was easily one of my favorite movies. It was definitely my favorite Super Hero movie. I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out so I could see if that feeling remained. Not only did it confirm my initial opinion, but the extras on this DVD gave me a better appreciation of what Jon Favreau did to keep the story of Iron Man as close to the comic book as possible. Robert Downey Jr. was awesome and to see what went behind his performance made me appreciate it more. Now, granted I am a visual effects guy so I am into seeing all of those types of extras. But I think the average Joe will enjoy them as well. I just can't believe how much extra content they were able to squeeze into this package.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to either see Iron Man for the first time or if you are trying to decide between the single disc edition or this one. Spend the few extra bucks for this one. You will be glad you did.
1401207928|5.0|Unlike the film (which I will leave up to you to judge), this piece is not dated, and does not include a criticism of any specific regime or time period. Instead, it is an excellent presentation of anarchy versus fascism, with no guide book or good guys to guide you. On one side, you have a revenge-bent but idealist terrorist. Opposite him is a man who is concerned for the people of his country, and is therefore willing to play the hated dictator to save them from what he is convinced is hell. In between are average people working for their own ends, trying to survive. While the story focuses on V, the anarchist, the novel hardly focuses on his positive traits. He is, after all, a murderer and a terrorist. However, this book does an excellent job of stepping away from the blanket labels of both \\"terrorist\\" and \\"fascist\\" and forcing--God forbid--actual thought about the constant debate over when security compromises what it is trying to protect. Brilliant, profound, and morally vague, I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
0060558121|1.0|I read this because a colleague loaned me her copy and asked me to. I have never read a more uninteresting book. I didn't like any of the characters, nor did I care what happened to them. Before you buy this one, please skim the beginning chapters at the library or online. The book is apparently free online (I can see why) and know that it doesn't get any better from there- one long, boring road trip...a random string of events LOOSELY tied together with a \\"plot.\\" Ug. What a waste of my valuable reading time.
0618164413|5.0|This volume gathers Curious George and the six original books in the series:    1) Curious George   2) ...Takes a Job  3) ...Rides a Bike  4) ...Gets a Medal  5) ...Flies a Kite  6) ...Learns the Alphabet  7) ...Goes to the Hospital    I was given this as a nostalgic birthday gift a few years ago and was greatly charmed. I don't even think I read all of those when I was little, so it was sweet to see them again after so many years. Curious George is the story of the \\"man in the yellow hat\\" who has brought back an inquisitive and mischievous monkey, Curious George. The stories usually involve a jungle-raised monkey getting into all kinds of trouble in the city, but all ends well and George comes home safely in the end - and no one really can stay mad at him.     This book is a handsome edition with a good binding and high quality printing. (The colors look good, etc.) I don't really like the glossy pages for book that will be loved to pieces by a child, but if you want this for a gift edition, it's perfect. I suggest having this as something you would read to a child, since it's kind of big and you wouldn't want to drop it on a grown-up foot.
B00008977N|5.0|What a package--great song selection, performances, and film production.  I had it on VHS and finally obtained the DVD.  I recall when this tour came through LA around 1995 or so and wished i could have seen it live.  A great combination of theater and music.  Tony Levin on bass and the gorgeous, sexy Paula Cole on vocals are more reasons to obtain this gem. I have this and Growing Up Live, and Secret world Live is superior.

B00006FM77|5.0|I was a huge Chicago fan back at the \\"Beginnings.\\" Saw them live at the Fillmore East some time before this performance. They had such an original (to me) sound. This recording captures it all. I highly recommend it.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Very much enjoyed this movie. Didn't get a chance to see it in the movies, but had friends over for the viewing and they commented how much it was like being at the movies.  I have HD and Surround which brought the movie to life.

B000S0YLQG|4.0|Quite a good album, traditional to Manu Chao music, with a slight escape into mainstream.   Some songs seem like reworks or versions of the same song done in different ways. Good for listening while riding in a car.  It is certainly worth listening to, but if you are not a real Manu Chao dedicated fan you might find it slighlty repetitive.  The real value of this album is that some of the widely played songs can bring Manu Chao closer to listeners who were not that familiar with his music and lead them to explore his other songs.

B001C08RHA|5.0|Great Movie.  I am a fan of Marvel Comics and this is just another enjoyable movie within the franchise.  Cant wait to see what else comes.
B000LF73ZE|3.0|The beginnning of the book seduces you with a love affair between an older, sensuous, street car conductor and a young student. This affair takes up most of the book, but it remains relatively shallow. Most of the scenes are sexual, and the older woman - Hannah - while provacative is not likeable.     The love affair is abruptly cut off, and the main character never recovers. His life is filled with empty romances and regret over his first love. His conflict over accepting and rejecting Hannah, is the most interesting part of the book. It is never resolved however, and as his life progresses and he runs into Hannah again, it becomes the central theme of the story.     I liked how the story makes you contemplate difficult questions. How it offered a different perspective of the Holocaust. But I found it hard to accept the ambiguous way the Holocaust is presented. It never answered central questions it posed, and it even refused to address others. Was Hannah cruel, or merely a victim of her secret shame of being illiterate? Was she just following orders, or did she really hate the people she killed? Was she responsible for any of the killings? Did she understand that killing innocent people is wrong? Or did the thought never occur to her?    There were too many important issues not addressed in this book, and not enough depth in the characters for me to like it. I mean the main character basically defines his life by Hannah but his most important memories of her are of them making love, laying next to her and smelling her, and the way her dress flapped in the wind when she rode a bycicle. Oh, yes, and the reading. And to make it worse, the story ends with an easy way out, a suicide. It was as if the writer came to the conclusion that he didn't really know what he was trying to stay, and that there wasn't enough meat in the love story for it to continue - so he killed of the object of the main character's affection.     The reviewer before me wrote that this book is amust read for educators. While I agree that this book offers something different, I don't think it offers enough. It addresses one of the greatest otrocities in modern history - the Holocaust. It asks the question - why did they do it? And the closest thing to an answer it provides is, ignorance. The guards were ignorant. They didn't know what to do. They didn't understand the rules. Couldn't see the system they were taking part in. We are all responsible for our actions. That is the message I try to convey as an educator. We cannot control everything, but we can control the decisions we make. This book tries to take away even that.
076535618X|5.0|Scalzi's third book, at least to start, moves at an easier pace than the ones before. The protagonists of the last books have retired from the military and cast off their olive drab (skin that is). They've settled down to farming, quieting petty feuds in their community, and raising a daughter. Then comes the offer: to lead colonization of a new world. Uprooting their family hurts a bit, but they agree. They and settlers from ten planets set out for their new home on Roanoke, named for a colony from American history.<br /><br />When they arrive at Roanoke, it isn't - it's a different planet, not the one they prepared for. The Union has sabotaged their starship, stranding them. The settlers haven't been told the real purpose of their colony, as an expendable chip in a high-stakes political gamble. That's when Scalzi's writing hits its stride, unwrapping layer after layer of plots, secrets, and alien motivations. Despite the threat of planetary annihilation, the biggest threat comes from their own kind - who they can't trust and can't bring themselves to betray.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0765348276 Old Man's War]], the first in this series, had much in common with Haldeman's [[ASIN:0312536631 Forever War]], but lacked Haldeman's bitter tone. Similarly, this volume echoes [[ASIN:1857989317 Forever Free]]. Instead of the benign neglect given to Haldeman's little colony, though, Scalzi drives deep into the territory where power corrupts, and where innocent civilians are expected to pay the price for that corruption. It's been a long time since I've read much SF, but Scalzi has me at it again.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B0000029DD|2.0|Got this cd based on the song Hallelujah and everyone giving it such great reviews.  Let me just say I am completely disappointed.  I listened to it twice to give it the benefit of the doubt and found there are are only 2 or 3 songs I would ever wanna hear on this album ever again.
B001E7OO2I|4.0|DISCLAIMER: This is more an initial assessment than a review, I have only listened to the album twice so it's a bit early for a full review<br /><br />There are a few of my favourite artists who are on their third go round and almost all of them have decided to do a 180 on their core fans. The 1st was Alicia Keys whose 3rd album was less soul and more pop/rock. Raphael Saadiq went Motown, Robin Thicke was all over the place and Ne-Yo toyed with the idea of going europop. It scares me to think what D'Angelo will do given that his sophomore effort was already way out there.<br /><br />John Legend takes a page straight out of Alicia Key's book by going the pop route and to be honest I am not pleased. I applauded Alicia's effort because it was an evolution of sorts from talented girl to woman. In John's case he scores no points and as far as I'm concerned this is a regression not an evolution.<br /><br />The world has enough artists doing the pop thing and we look to artists like John Legend, Raphael Saadiq and Robin Thicke to give us something else (pun intended). By including a Ne-Yo, Will.I.Am and a Pharell song (no offense to any of them) John has only thing in mind...and that is Radio (Trying not to be out done by his own artist, Estelle).<br /><br />The duet with Brandy is good but it does not belong on a John Legend album. The Michael Jackson esque rallying call that closes out the standard version of the disc is right on the edge of corny (perfect for radio). I can understand why he might choose that direction, given how his last album performed, the critics loved it but radio wouldn't play it. I would counter that argument by saying that he just needs to look at the album sales which were nothing to laugh at.<br /><br />With that said, I still have to admit that although I disagree with his direction, the album as a whole is quite well executed. You can still here that it has John's stamp all over it. He also sprinkled a few tracks that recall his previous album e.g. \\"Good Morning\\" and my current favourite \\"I Love, You Love\\". The reggae influenced tracks are also repeat worthy. I'm sure the rest of the album will grow on me as the other's have.t favourite \\"I Love, You Love\\". The reggae influenced tracks are also repeat worthy. I'm sure the rest of the album will grow on me as the other's have.
1416562605|4.0|Aravind Adiga's \\"The White Tiger\\" manages to hit just about every emotion possible within its 270+ pages.  The story is told in first person narrative in the form of a letter from Balram Halwai (The White Tiger) to the Chinese Premier, who is due to visit Halwai's India.  There is quite a bit at play in this novel, but in essence it's a story about Halwai's humble beginnings as a poor, but hardworking member of India's \\"Darkness\\" (lower caste), his transformation to driver for one of the most wealthy landlords, and ultimately his actions in response to the repression he is forced to deal with.    Halwai has a powerfully intelligent and amusing voice and despite the fact we know early in the novel (or from the back cover) he's committed murder it's hard not to like (or at least root for) him.  While some of the things Halwai says (or the way he says them) are humorous--and I did laugh out loud on several occasions--this is not a comedy.  Rather, this is a novel that really gets at the human condition and what things transform both the low and upper class of society.  Despite the setting--and the India of this tale is well rendered--the lessons brought out in Adiga's novel are universal.    This is a fairly quick read, but there's plenty to think about, lots to chuckle at (Halwai is often very amusing in his observations), and much to be amazed or disgusted at.  A terrific and thoughtful novel and one well worth reading.
B0019M06JS|5.0|A terrific album with some American standards in a Bossa Nova style and beautifuly performed by Eliane and her musicians.She also plays \\" Garota de Ipanema\\" and other Bossa Nova classics!

B000002L80|4.0|One of the better things to come out of the 80s.  Although I have heard that this is not considered the best work the Talking Heads has ever done, it is intelligent enough to remain timeless, enjoyable enough to listen to anywhere, and sensible enough to speak to the everyday listener.  Give it a listen!
B000P12LWY|5.0|changes my mind. Such is The Tudors, a wonderful period piece & so much more. Each episode is movie production quality. Everything we know & don't know is dramatically interpereted by an excellent cast. History? Yes. Good history? Well, it is sexy & profane drama based on historical facts. I am not so brillant as some of the reviewers here that seem to know what exactly happened over 500 years ago. It is the early years of Henry's reign & he is attempting to populate the kingdom single-handedly. He seems to copulate with every woman in court. Except, of course, his wife, Catherine, who vexes him & refuses to give him a divorce & Anne who will not sleep with him until she is queen. Political alliance with the continential powers are very fluid. Spain, France The Austrian Empire, the Pope are all players as allies enemies & allies once again. Personal intrique gives The Tudors a slightly soap opera odor as characters form alliances to settle scores. I'm a little late to this series but am really looking forward to the second season.
0307455378|4.0|This book is good but not great.     It is similar to \\"La Sombre del Viento\\" in many ways but different in others. I found the tone of this book to be darker than LSDV.     The build up is very good, if not just a bit dragged out at times. It keeps you turning the pages the same way that LSDV did and offers a compelling story, a great mix of likable characters, and plenty of laughs mixed with some occasional terror.     I feel however that Ruiz Zafón failed to effectively conclude the story. In these kinds of stories, it is difficult to find the delicate balence between how much to explain to the reader and how much to leave to the imagination. The character of the editor simply left too many questions.     It's worth the read but you might want to wait until it's out in paperback.
B0017HRCQU|3.0|While i've to admit, Batman Begins is hands-down the best Bat-movie ever (that was, until The Dark Knight surpassed it in every angle), the sad part was that i've received my Limited Edition Batman Begins Blu-ray edition that wasn't in mint condition.    The package looks a bit bloated, like it was exposed to water or something. This couldn't have happened because of the courier guys since the actual box itself wasn't bloated nor was there any trace of wetness to it. Luckily, the content wasn't damaged. But still, it loses its aesthetics and/or collector's value to it. Couldn't be bothered sending this back to Amazon for a replacement since i've to chug out some extra cash for it (mind you it's not cheap to send over to America from Malaysia).    I am no stranger to ordering DVDs and Blu-rays from Amazon (it's been 2 years already). Since this is the first time this has happened to me, it's fine. Just hope this wouldn't happen again. Amazon, beef up okay?
B000YXMMAE|5.0|...and there's nothing wrong with that!  IN RAINBOWS is probably the most consistant album Radiohead has put out since OK COMPUTER, and though it lacks the deeper theme of that one, so what.  This is just a great album of one of the best bands in the world doing what they do best.
B001CU1RRM|4.0|You could say whatever you wanna say about Michael but you can't deny the man's music is infectious. Yes, it has gone down the drain a bit lately with his last couple of releases. But you'd need a tight compilation like this to remind you of why the man was once historical and why there's still a chance for him to reconquer his throne. I'm one of the first to say that I'd love to see him evolve musically at this point in his career. I'm not sure that's a risk he's willing to take though. But I feel it's so urgently needed for his career to explode again. At this point it wouldn't hurt to try.  What prevents me from giving this compilation a 5 star rating is that it's missing some of his best tracks such as Earth Song and Scream. How were they not included?! And yes, it's great that some of the Jackson 5 songs were dropped in but how about I'll be there?! Otherwise this is a great compilation worth obtaining for your music collection!
B001F0VHEM|5.0|This is a very emotional side of Pink that we have not really seen before.  Each song seems to be a personal account of what's been happening in her life.  It still has the roughness though that Pink is known for.  Amazing album.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Pink's new CD, Funhouse...where to start? I'll refrain from a long, drawn out review of every song, but stick to album strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Funhouse is Pink's fifth album, and it sees Pink at her best, but also with a few of her repeat weaknesses. One of her weaknesses, especially on this album, is her constant switching from the serious to the dance. While this can be mixed effectively (see her second album, M!ssundaztood), on Funhouse it falls a little flat.<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"So What,\\" her most successful single to date. It is extremely catchy, a rocker that still expresses the emotion it needs to express, and is very effective to lead into the rest of the songs. \\"Bad Influence\\" is completely unnecessary and doesn't fit with the album at all, and \\"Funhouse\\" barely manages to escape that same category. \\"One Foot Wrong\\" seems to have trouble finding its style, caught between R&B and rock.<br /><br />That being said, Funhouse is perhaps Pink's most mature album to date, which I hadn't thought possible after listening to I'm Not Dead, her previous album. The songs began by being spawned from her recent divorce, but they show that through her life and through her divorce she has become a very assured, aware, and strong woman who isn't afraid to say what she thinks -- something not altogether smiled on in this world. Particular standouts in this vein are \\"Crystal Ball\\", \\"Glitter in the Air\\", and especially \\"Ave Mary A\\", which is the strongest song on this album, a critique of our world, a meditation on how the world became so insane and a scream for help to the divine presence that seems so absent.<br /><br />\\"Sober\\", \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\", and \\"Mean\\" are the other real standouts on this album, showcasing Pink's songwriting and vocal talents, as well as her impressive range of genres. \\"This Is How It Goes Down\\" is the bonus track for this collection, and although it is EXTREMELY catchy and liable to get stuck in your head for days on end, it doesn't really fit into the album.<br /><br />So, I say that again Pink has given us a very mature, broad ranged, and wonderful album. The only thing that I would say was wrong with Funhouse was the exact same problem with I'm Not Dead: cut the extraneous songs (\\"Cuz I Can\\", \\"U + Ur Hand\\", while fun, didn't fit I'm Not Dead, just as \\"Bad Influence\\" and \\"This Is How It Goes Down\\" can't seem to find their place here on Funhouse). In any case, I see this album becoming a fast hit, with more major singles than just \\"So What\\", which is still dominating hit lists everywhere.o the album.

1932100660|5.0|Excellent book!  This book will challenge modern day thinking on food and pharmaceuticals.  Campbell is an educated researcher who astonishingly comes to the realization that modern concepts of a healthy diet are actually not based on fact and research.

045122499X|3.0|I read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" at least ten years ago and remember enjoying it, though I recall it had a number of holes in the plot large enough to drive a truck through.  But that was of no import to me, since the same is true of many books and virtually all movies. I didn't read \\"Pillars\\" because I was looking for accurate history anymore than I enjoyed the movie \\"Gladiator\\" despite its complete rewrite of the reign of the Roman Emperor Commodus. Both were rip-roaring yarns, with interesting characters and plots that barreled along at 150 miles an hour.  Which is why the plot holes don't matter - you're just along for the ride.<br /><br />\\"World Without End\\" is equally enjoyable, and in fact more satisfying in the end because Follett has matured as a writer and at least to my eyes there were no groaners when it came to plot twists and resolutions.  The characters were interesting, many were sympathetic (although I never warmed up to the lead female character, Caris), and while Follett undoubtedly mixed up minor aspects of the history of the 14th century, none of it was so obvious that it became a distraction.  The book really can't be called a sequel: the action occurs two centuries after \\"Pillars,\\" and other than the town of Kingsbridge and the cathedral everything else is different. One could certainly pick this book up without having read \\"Pillars\\" and not miss a thing.<br /><br />Happily, Follett keeps his typically gratuitous and dopey sex scenes to no longer than a paragraph or so, which is a vast improvement over some of his earlier works where he felt obligated to subject the reader to pages of pointless smut. I'm no prude - but get on with the story already, okay?  Unfortunately, Follett instead provides us with a seemingly endless description of a man being flayed alive, which, in retrospect, was probably more useless to the story than three pages of sex, so maybe I shouldn't complain about the sex scenes...<br /><br />As far as underlying themes go - Follett seems to be exploring the question of how Europe managed to emerge from centuries of religious theocracy and grope its way from the Middle Ages toward the Enlightenment. The religious characters in the book are not presented sympathetically the way the Philip character was treated as a hero in \\"Pillars.\\" Instead, Follett presents innumerable examples of religious people insisting on idiotic medical procedures, engaging in sexual misconduct, and generally getting in the way of progress.  While there is no doubt that such people did, in fact, exist at the time, as they certainly continue to plague us today, Follett does nothing to present a balanced view.  I'm no fan of organized religion, but it is unfair to not present any intelligent, intellectually curious, and forward thinking clergy.<br /><br />That being said, the book moves along swiftly with little or no lags.  I found the subplots involving the Gwenda character the most interesting, and looked forward to seeing her cleverly extract herself from one predicament after another.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty good read.

0375826726|5.0|Brisingr, Paolini's third book, was eagerly snatched up by many who had been waiting to find out what adventures were waiting for Eragon. It is still wonderful writing, but is much bloodier with even more figting and battles. This might make it inappropriate for some younger readers who read Eragon. However, I am afraid we will have to wait again because this book did not end Eragon's story. There will be a fourth book to look forward to.
0060775858|4.0|I've only read this book a couple of times to my young son, but plan to read more once he gets older. The book is very simple and more of a short story. If you wanted to make it a litte longer for your child then you could point things out in the story like, \\"See the bunny\\" to make it longer. I really like the book though and I'm excited to use it as a bed time story. It is a recommended book after all.

After having  \\"Another Country\\" for over six months, I am far past the initial infatuation stage that sometimes comes with a good new release.

0783226837|5.0|A wonderful monster movie with more than a sense of humor.  Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward as Handymen Val and Earl. Rebba McIntyre and Michael Gross as survivalists -- \\"Broke into the wrong rec room, didn't ya!\\"  Spawning several sequels and a tv series, the first remains the best.  Perfection -- was there ever a town more misnamed -- falls prey to a new species of creature from beneath the earth.  This film harkens back to the scifi monster flicks of the 1950's. It's a load of fun.

0380713802|3.0|This was an enjoyable, undemanding read. At his best, Bryson is grouchily funny, though not as hilarious IMO as some other reviews would have you believe. He is better when describing the rough spots of travel than its pleasures. At times, an unattractive whining tone takes over - for instance, when he complains how a particular location, like Florence, is overrun by tourists. But I'd be lying if I didn't admit to finding his skewering of the Swiss and the Austrians pretty much on target.<br /><br />Three stars, because Bryson never approaches the level of a travel writer like Jan Morris, whose essays are infinitely superior.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|Sure, I'll concede that this film hit the target for the intended audience. It's a family action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and has much fast paced action, suspense and light humor.<br /><br />You really have to divorce yourself from reality and even harsh criticism while watching this, because it's very easy for an adult with high-expectations to feel let down. But the truth is, this about the same type of fare as you'll find with films such as [[ASIN:B000WC39ZE Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]], [[ASIN:B00009YXAV The Apple Dumpling Gang]], [[ASIN:B000065V42 Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]], and so on.<br /><br />My wife liked it and thought it was entertaining. However, I'm a fan of Jules Verne books and always have been. I guess I was hoping for more of an adult driven, Steampunk style (see comment below) drama than what I saw. I wish the CGI was better and the mood a little less cotton-candy-ish, but it really wasn't aimed at me and I can concede that. I'm not going to give the movie less than the four stars that it does deserve for the simple fact that with every scene, you can see that Brendan Frasier isn't overdoing the acting and delivers a family movie with a family movie level of acting. Kudos to him for being aware of what he was involved in.<br /><br />This review is about not going into this hoping for an epic telling of a Jules Verne Classic, but going into it with the perspective of seeing a family movie. Hopefully this will help someone.<br /><br />... ...

Pretty good for a so-called \\"shallow\\" movie.  It is not the traditional following of the Jules Verne epic book, however, and is refreshingly original, although it interprets areas of the book and follows those who are fans of the original story.  In an age of continual remakes, this one sets itself apart.  My husband and I saw it 6 times this past summer.<br /><br />That being said, I believe the bulk of the appeal during the summer season were the Disney 3D effects, which, unfortunately, do not translate over to the DVD version.  In the movie theater, for instance, one sees in the first scene a trilobite's antenna reaching out from the screen - at home, on my 60\\" media room screen, the effect was completely lost, with and without the 3D glasses provided with the DVD. I tried watching the movie in complete darkness, hoping that would help, but it did not. I even tried the glasses I bought when I saw the movie in the theater - it does bring out a bit of depth, but not at all the cool 3D effects I saw at the movie theater. The 3D glasses which come with the DVD are the typical Blue and Red lenses which (in my case) just make my eyes hurt and really don't do anything special to the movie.  I prefer the glasses which were provided at the movie theater, though they do nothing to enhance the color of the movie, they do add some depth of field, but hardly a 3D effect.  It is the overall entertainment value of this movie that garners four stars.<br /><br />The movie itself is very family oriented - no foul language, no overtly 'adult' banter; no excessive skin revelation (i.e. cleavage) and nothing the least bit gory.  Scary, perhaps, for small children is the scene with the dinosaur, but other than that, this movie is perfect for family entertainment.  We plan to show it on Thanksgiving to everyone after dinner, so confident are we that grandparents and grandchildren will enjoy it as much as the rest of us.<br /><br />To sum it up, it is a good movie - not a blockbuster, but certainly entertaining - however the 3D effects were left in the theater.han that, this movie is perfect for family entertainment.

B001CT877Q|4.0|I had this on laser disc and the blu-ray is way better for picture and sound quality. Pretty good action flick by \\"Ahnald\\". Robert Pastorelli just about steals the show with his performance. The \\"pay-back\\" is justice well done.
B000QXDED6|5.0|I actually I gave this film only 2 stars but I now see that Amazon has placed 5 stars over my review and, although I can edit the text, I can't reduce this film to its well-deserved 2 star rating.<br /><br />I totally disagree with the editorial review that claims that the \\"300\\" is more engaging than \\"Troy\\".  It may be more engaging to those who enjoy comic books but those who enjoy adult fare will like Troy far better.<br /><br />Those who know little of Spartan society and the Battle of Thermopolae may enjoy this cartoon.  Those more familiar with the austere Spartan way of life and the motives and conduct of the battle at the Gates of Fire, will be far less well served.  This movie takes incredible liberties with the battle against the Persians.  First...Leonidas never visited ancient and deformed seers who had been bought off by the Persians.  Leonidas, a very religious man, realizing that he was facing a life-and-death battle visited the Pythia who...as was her way...gave him an ambivalent answer.  \\"A King must die,\\"  she prophesied.  Leonidas, King of Sparta, reckoned the King was him and determined to go out in real style.<br /><br />Second...the Spartans were HEAVY infantry.  They would NOT have been fighting bare-chested.  Every man of them would have been wearing heavy breastplates and greaves for his thighs and shins.  Initially \\"the 300\\" got it right by showing a battle that was as more of a pushing match than a sword fight.  Then, in fine Hollywood fashion, the battle breaks up into individual antagonists.  It didn't happen that way.  If the Spartans had fought bare-chested and man-to-man, they would have been annihiliated in less than a half hour.  The fact that they last three days is a testimony to group cohesion and discipline.<br /><br />Third...Xerxes wasn't 7.5 feet tall...ridiculous.  Fourth...the Persians used no rhinos and elephants...Xerxes was no Hannibal.  Fifth...why do the ignorant [let me promise you, they are plenty ignorant of history and drama] Hollywood types have to mess with history?  Why couldn't they have followed Pressfield's excellent novel, \\"Gates of Fire\\", to perfection?  Read it yourself and find out how much better real history is to adolescent cartoons.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexicoto mess with history?

B000KQF6X0|5.0|I rented this on tape years ago, and boy what a difference the blu-ray disc makes. Good picture, pretty good sound, lots of action and the relationship between Micheal and the Japanese \\"detective\\"? stole the show, especially the last two scenes. It was great.

B00004VW35|3.0|I do like some of this album, but most of it feel forced and many of its cuts are way overproduced.  Neil has done material with a country tinge to it before, and has done it very well, but when he tries to do a \\"real\\" country album, he overdoes it.  It's a shame, because the idea of Neil  Young doing a country album sounds great on paper.<br /><br />The song The Wayward Wind, a country music classic covered by just about everyone, is butchered under one of the most overbearing string sections ever.  A more subtle approach would have worked so much better.  The song Are There Any More Real Cowboys? ventures into self parody, coming across as someone who understands nothing about cowboys.  Misfits has some of the silliest lyrics ever in any of Neil's work.  The only song that I absolutely adore is Once An Angel, an absolutely beautiful ballad with a sweet production and a moving, sincere vocal by Neil.  It's one of my favorite Neil Young songs.<br /><br />This album is actually one of the better albums from the 80's Neil's Geffen period.  As Neil fans know, Geffen sued Young during this time because he felt Neil was purposely doing subpar work to get out of his contract.  While that point is debatable, this is one of the few 80's albums that Neil is trying to do something good.  He just doesn't succeed fully.  It's worth a listen or two, but the only song worth hanging onto is Once An Angel.  Old Ways is a noble failure.
0140282564|5.0|First of all, I'm really happy I told myself to look for more Orwell books once I'd exhausted \\"1984\\" and \\"Animal Farm\\". Coming out of \\"1984\\" slightly disappointed (as compared to the superb \\"Animal Farm\\"), I picked this thin, tightly printed novel up. A few hours later, I set it down and leaned my head back to think.<br /><br />First off, a slight shake of my head at Mr. Orwell. It cannot possibly be that every single Jewish person in the world is a sneaky, cunning, manipulative crook. The book isn't anti-Semitic, exactly, but it certainly shows the culture-deep dislike of Jews. It got a bit frustrating, that the two or three Jews mentioned were all fairly... evil. So seriously.<br /><br />Other than that, basically, the book is pretty great. \\"Down and Out in Paris and London\\" reminded me a bit of Somerset Maugham's great \\"Of Human Bondage\\" (but with a better name) in that I felt like I was being told an honest, true story about the at times crappiness that a young poor man in these cities faces. There are clear differences between the two - very different styles, different time periods, different points, different messages - but I left both books with the similar feeling that I had just learned something very important about this world.<br /><br />Orwell describes in a manner that is impeccable and frighteningly honest what it meant to be poor - down and out - in the two great cities of Europe. One can imagine the wealthy all they want. Orwell gives us the lowest possible scenario, the starvation, the humiliation, the difficulties (mentally and physically), and does so clearly. Anyone else coming from \\"Animal Farm\\" will find a similarly readable style that makes this an easy book to read in one, albeit long, sitting. It's honestly two books and can even be read as such - the Paris part (totally awesome) and the completely different, slightly less interesting but still fascinating London part. Together, however, \\"Down and Out\\" paints a bleak picture of the working world. It's not pleasant to think of.<br /><br />Other than just making you reflect on your own life (how pleasant it is, that is), \\"Down and Out\\" will present you with a new way to look at things. I don't think I've ever quite thought of bums (tramps) the same way. I similarly gained a whole new level of respect for anyone forced to work in devastating conditions for minimal pay (Orwell's description of a Paris kitchen). Clearly portraying the difficulties and problems of the lowest social class in two large, great cities, Orwell once again created a novel (semi-autobiographical, perhaps, but novel-like nonetheless) that is at once enjoyable, engrossing, enlightening and thought-provoking.<br /><br />Statements such as these are not outdated even today, provide readers with perspective, relevant observations, and important ideas.

B0016Q2D5M|2.0|First off I will state that I am not a fan of 3-D movies - ever!! But my husband is so I bought this for his 3-D pleasure while I watched the old fashioned way. His complaints, like so many other reviewers, were that all the glasses did was to make the picture look like red and green. I, however, enjoyed it in all it's 2-D splendor.<br /><br />My ire was irked, however, when we opened the package. Therein we found a flyer with directions and a code for downloading the movie from our computer. This was accompanied by a blank, recordable DVD. NOTE: This is not good if the buyer is not computer savvy or doesn't own a computer - yes there are many folks who don't and I personally know at least 2 people who don't own home computers.<br /><br />The next thing to vex me was the fact that once I got to the movie web-site I had to give them my credit card for a $1.99 charge to use their movie manager software which I then had to install on my computer. I was very tempted to just repackage the entire thing and bring it back to the store. But my hubby prevailed. We installed the software and forked out the $1.99 on top of the price of the movie. NOTE: Not a good thing if you feel the movie makers already charge enough for the movie; also not a good thing if you are at all hesitant about installing software from a company you don't know or trust.  NOTE 2: No where, and I mean NO WHERE, on the external packaging was any mention made about having to download the movie.<br /><br />Once we got the thing into the DVD and on the screen we did enjoy all of the special effects but for me the entire thing was ruined by having to download and spend additional funds. The movie itself was a fun romp through some very futuristic special effects and definitely left itself open to a sequel for the actors since the teenage lead's next reading adventure, as given to him by Trevor, is Atlantis.<br /><br />Unless you see this in the movie theatre or do a pay-per-view thing, don't bother with buying the DVD.

031606792X|4.0|Although \\"thrilling conclusion\\" is a clich&eacute;, Stephenie Meyer wraps up the Twilight vampire series with panache.  The names of the books in the series are not helpful in telling the sequence (compared to \\"Sunrise\\", \\"Noon\\", and \\"Sunset\\", for example), but this is the fourth and concluding book, and readers should start at the beginning and read the series in order, saving this one for last.<br /><br />The story opens with Bella on her way to happily ever after: a wedding with Edward.  Fairy tales may end with a wedding, but the number of pages is an indication that nothing between Bella and Edward is ever that simple.  First comes their honeymoon - with Bella still human, and Edward a vampire.  The intimacy that the couple (and the author) avoided through three lengthy books is now timely.  Meyer describes it delicately but effectively.<br /><br />What follows is cataclysmic.  The werewolves, the Cullen family of vampires, every vampire group previously mentioned in the series plus a few more are thrown into conflict, and naturally Bella is in the middle of it.<br /><br />As in Eclipse (book 3), Jacob Black is the character who surprises.  The vampires don't seem prone to character development.  Being a vampire is all about immutability.  Jacob, the werewolf (all about changing), is the one who, with much inner conflict, is able to take a step forward and choose his path.  To an extent, it is chosen for him, but he makes way more hard choices than, for example, Bella does.  Bella falls in love with Edward, and then makes that her number one priority.  Jacob picks his way among actively competing loyalties to a place of peace.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn was my favorite of the series.  Truthfully, Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse could have been compressed into one book, and spliced with a trimmed down Breaking Dawn into one unforgettable book.  I know that will be sacrilege to some readers.  As a jaded adult reader, I've enjoyed the series, but felt like Meyer was marking time, especially in New Moon and Eclipse.  Perhaps Meyer will bring us more from the Twilight universe.nd Eclipse.  Perhaps Meyer will bring us more from the Twilight universe.

031237593X|5.0|Penman's books are all fairly lengthy, but by the time you get to the end, you don't want it to be over.  This one is no exception.  I actually preferred the character of Edward to Richard in this book.  Probably because he seemed more believable.  Penman let his flaws show brightly and therefore seem more relatable (I think that's probably why Anne was probably my least favorite character).  The almost saintly portrayal of Richard is pretty much my only complaint though.  I was thoroughly entertained by this book.  The relationship between Edward and Richard was touching and the shift in Edward's character throughout the book was very well done.    I think the reason why I'm such a huge fan of SKP is her ability to really make you sympathize with the characters.  She always makes their motives really clear and you almost can't dislike any of them, because you really feel like you understand them.  The best example of this was Richard's decision in the final battle.    The best part, for me, is that the history is amazingly well researched, as always.  There's only one fictional \\"main\\" character, and she's not a very important.  The story just sucks you in even if you don't have much background knowledge.  This one is definitely a keeper!

B00005AG7K|2.0|I don't own this product, and from the reviews posted, I won't ever own it.  I do, however, own the VHS version that was released in 1987.  It was an official Apple release, and the quality is superb, both picture quality and sound quality.  Fans please note that the songs that are in the movie have entirely different audio mixes than the mixes that appeared on the MMT album.  So Magical Mystery Tour, Fool On the Hill, Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know and I Am The Walrus all have unique mixes on the soundtrack that you can't find anywhere else, and on the VHS tape these mixes sound really great in VHS Hi-Fi (gosh, remember that?) IMO, these mixes blow the \\"regular\\" mixes of these songs away.    The tape is still easy to find and reasonably priced.  Again, its quality is superb and I'm sure puts this DVD to shame.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|George A. Romero discovered a universal truth: Zombies rock. What's not to love? Shambling, animated corpses with a taste for living flesh? Desperate survivors with trigger happy fingers decapitating said zombies with rusty machetes or well-aimed head shots? Zombies piling up like chords of wood? And the screaming!    It's like Christmas at the organ donor shop.    Romero's original \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" made in 1978 is a lot of things: horrifying, taboo-shattering, gory, and disturbing. It's also horror camp at its finest - skewering the mass consumer culture of the United States in our most shallow of decades: the 1970s.    Romero has a gleefully good time with his pack of survivors holed up in an indoor shopping mall. The slow-moving zombies that bang into the display cases or stumble up the escalators aren't so far removed from normal everyday mall shoppers - at least according to Romero.    Why do the zombies congregate at the mall? \\"Some kind of instinct. Memory, of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives,\\" one of the characters informs us.    Yeah, even dead we like buying stuff at the mall.    But one thing the Romero film is not? Scary.    That's one reason why we're also fans of the much maligned 2004 remake by director Zack Snyder. That's a sacrilege in many quarters, but for pure fright - Snyder tops Romero. That's the truth. Romero's low-budget wonder is a classic - no doubt. It can be uncomfortable to watch, but there is more dark humor than actual chills. Romero focused his film on his wicked wit: satire instead of terror.    Snyder isn't interested in delivering a sardonic message. He wants to scare you. And damn it if he doesn't. His zombies - like the times we live in - are fast. There's no shambling here - but straight out sprinting.    The gem of Snyder's movie is the opening 10 minutes. It may be the most frightening sequence of any horror movie made over the last 20 years. It has a disjointed, sour flavor as if the orangejuice you drink every morning has been spiked with cyanide.    Sarah Polley plays a nurse named Ana. She's at the end of a difficult shift at the hospital. All she wants to do is go home. Traveling home over washed out streets in a bland suburban tract, she arrives home for \\"date night\\" with her husband. They make love in their messy, little bed in their messy, little house.    Then it all goes to hell.    The little girl next door wonders in and lo and behold the lower half of her face has been chewed off. She creeps into the bedroom and Ana's husband jumps up concerned. But before he can react, she takes a bite of flesh out of his neck.    Ana locks the little girl out of the bedroom and then has a grueling life and death struggle as her husband dies and then reanimates as a zombie. It's bone rattling violence and by the time Ana gets into her car - her neighborhood, her world is in chaos.    It's absolutely chilling.    While the overall Snyder's film doesn't quite live up to the original (and the characters make some ridiculous decisions - especially at the end), Snyder delivers a zombie movie that belongs on the list of greatest undead flicks ever made - with Romero's original and the superb \\"28 Days Later.\\"    The two movies follow the same premise - but are very different movies. That's why you can enjoy them both: turn to Romero for the horrifying satire (you can often overlook the rather awkward acting) and then lean on Snyder for some in-your-face terror (and for using Johnny Cash's \\"Man Comes Around\\" as an opening number).    Either way -- it's a great two for one.    Like undead literate blather?  Then plodded on over to the Dark Party Review.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|This DVD, released last year, is an absolutely terrific representation of John Carpenter's vision of terror in a suburban setting. The picture is nice and crisp, thanks to THX, the sound and video system developed by Lucasfilm, a great restoration of this true classic of horror. In the film, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is terrorized by the man who later is found out to be her brother, Michael Myers, an unstoppable juggernaut of a masked killer. Myers is pursued by his Doctor, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance in a very memorable role), who seems to encounter hints of Myers' evil as he chases him down to attempt to apprehend or kill him. 30 years later, this film still does not disappoint to frighten everyone. But hey, as Sheriff Leigh Brackett points out, \\"Everyone's entitled to one good scare.\\" Plus there is a terrific behind the scenes featurette, along with cast bio and behind-the-scenes photos. Get this one if you can. 5 stars!!!
B000VLOKQI|5.0|The WHO!! How can you go wrong? As one of the great lasting Rock and Roll bands from the 60's, THE WHO never disappoint. The documentary \\"Amazing Journey: The Story of the Who\\" shows the growth of the band throughout the years of turmoil within the group. The rare footage, collected for this film, is amazing. The footage dates back to what appears to be pre-Decca recordings though the 2007 Hollywood Bowl performances. The detailed background of their history includes the merging of The Who, the loss of Keith Moon and John Entwistle, and the survival of the band with only Pete Townshend and Roger Daultrey in the lead positions. This film is a must for who fans and an absolute for all fans of Classic Rock and Roll.
B00005JPO1|4.0|The year is 1957, and Professor Henry Walton \\"Indiana\\" Jones (Harrison Ford) is kidnapped by Russian soldiers and their leader, Irina Spalko (Oscar Winner Cate Blanchett) to search for a magnetic box in Nevada which contains remains of alien bodies, which plays into the title of the film, referring to the Crystal Skulls. Indy and his colleague, Mac (Jim Broadbent) are taken into a secret warehouse, where Indy manages to find the crate containing the remains, but he manages to escape, but the Russians do escape with the remains. He then manages to get caught in a nuclear blast (which he survives, thanks to some quick thinking and a handy refrigerator). He is taken in and cleaned up by the U.S. Government and is fired from his Professorship at fictional Marshall College, so he embarks on a search for an old colleague, thanks to a chance meeting with a kid named Mutt Williams (Shia Lebouf), who turns out later to be Indy and Marion Ravenwood's son. His old colleague, Harold \\"Ox\\" Oxley (Oscar Winner John Hurt) holds the key to the mystery of the Crystal Skulls, but has gone missing in South America, where Indy and Mutt travel to and run into the Russians and Ox, as well as Marion (Karen Allen), and they embark on the quest to find the temple containing the answers to the whole mystery. Oh, and yes, the famous Wilhelm Scream is heard at least once in this movie. I would give this movie 4 out of 5 stars. Aliens may not be everyone's cup of tea when it comes to Indiana Jones, and I admit I was not entirely sold on it, but it is still a major thrill ride, and Harrison Ford still manages to make Indy a believable and viable action hero, nearly two decades after the last adventure.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I LOVED this movie.  I saw it six times in the theater and laughed and bobbed my head as much the sixth time as the first.  The music great!!  Ok, so Pierce Brosnan isn't the best singer in the world.  You know what?  I've paid a whole lot more money to see people in concert that were suppose to be great singers and were so much worse than Pierce. Besides if you don't want to listen to him just watch him.  He's showing some age(but then aren't we all) he's still quite attractive.  I think Merryl Streep did an incredible job.  Who knew she could sing like that?!  And Donna's two friends are a hoot.  And I think the girl that plays Sophie is adorable.      In today's times it's great to be able to sit down with a movie and not have to think about it.  Just be entertained by it.  It's a great \\"bad day\\" movie.  Go home put your feet up and just veg out.  Sure to improve your bad mood greatly!!
B001F2W4Y2|3.0|I give this CD a \\"fair\\" rating of 3 stars.  It's far from great - too many of the songs sound the same and very few of them are memorable.  For the most part, the hooks just aren't there.  I love the band, I just wish they had put out something more consistent.
B001B71NPC|4.0|Don't buy this from hmv.com, I pre-ordered it two months before release and received an email 4 months later saying that they didn't have it. I then went to amazon and I got it quickly to my door!
0385340990|3.0|One of the first decisions a novelist must make is how to tell the story, i.e., the point of view.  Most opt for first person or third person omniscient.  A few use stream of consciousness or some variation of it, and a very few have employed a form that literateurs call epistolary or a series of letters and documents.  The latter form was once used more frequently and is now quite rare.<br /><br />\\"Guernsey Literary\\" is in the form of letters, telegrams and notes, mostly concerning the German occupation of the isles of Guernsey, a British protectorate in the English Channel.  The topic is certainly interesting and one I had never seen previously.  But the form, the point of view or lack of point of view gets in the way of the story.  It comes down to this:  while a wide variety of letter writers participate, the letters sound as if they were written by the same person.  There is the same wit, the same turn of phrase, the same syntax, the same education level.<br /><br />It is always a mistake, I think, for the writing or the writer to get in the way of the story.  Unfortunately that is what happens here.  I was never able to shed the consciousness of the form as the story unfolded.<br /><br />Characters do emerge.  There is a certain atmosphere.  There are numerous sub-plots (the disappearance of free spirited Elizabeth, for example).  But there is no dialogue, as such.  The narrative form prevents it.  And the hiatus between letters prevents immediate give and take.
B001C08RHA|5.0|If you've seen this movie, than you know that Marvel has done it again. Once again, yet another super hero breaks onto the scene in John Favereau's Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect fit for millionaire play-boy Tony Stark aka Iron Man. I thought this movie was great. The acting was good, the plot flowed smoothly, and the set up for a sequel was perfect. My only negative remark is that they should have gotten Tony and Pepper together. If you loved the movie as much as me, buy it! The price is great on Amazon.
630460291X|4.0|we recieved our CD quickly and are pleased with it. You must stop and turn the CD over to watch the second half of the movie.    We are puzzled by this. Grandsons liked the movie.
B00168HARG|3.0|This show was both good and disappointing.  It started off great with the first few episodes as they were filled with action, we were really getting to know the characters, and the show was breaking off from the whole \\"chase\\" procedures established with the previous movies.  The season began to become boring and tiresome in the middle as it focused more on emotional issues instead of being action driven.  The emotional conflicts that were brought up when Derek Reese (another character from the future) travels back in are just boring.  The only exciting parts dealing with Reese are the glimpses of the future, other than that everything that surrounds his character is dull.    Things didn't being to pick up until the final 3 episodes.  This is not the worst show that Fox has spewed out but it isn't the best.  I do recommend picking up the first season on Blu-ray as Amazon's price is really great (they are charging less than what Stores like Best Buy charge for the DVD version).  The show also looks good on Blu-ray, it is not perfect but it does look better than the HD broadcast.  There are some minor flaws here and there that are normally associated with digitally shooting TV shows in HD.  TV shows often experience rushed productions and they are unable to go back and re-shoot scenes that don't out looking their best.    I gave this release 3 out of 5 stars as the show's quality starts off good, dips in the middle, and begins to rise back up near the end.  The video quality has some flaws but it looks great overall.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Like others...i tried watching the 2d version with 3d glasses as the disk is not very clearly mark....very small writting..bad eyes.<br />Anyway the 3d effects with the glasses were pretty descent on my 42 inch tv.<br />So bottom line....Good movie...good 3d....still enjoyed this movie after watching it twice...1 normal...1 3d...A Keeper, good for multiple views.
1596912863|1.0|I just love her other books, Book of a Thousand Days, The princess academy, The Goose Girl and Enna burning.  My friends warned me it wasn't the same and they didn't like it. When I read it I figured out why.  It lacks all of the depth and imagination of her children's books.  It is basically one makeout session after another, NOT my type of book at all.  It was very disapointing and I really couldn't believe the unreal ending either.  In the fairy tale type books the fairy tale type endings work and she does it masterfully and usually with a twist.  This ending was just bizarre and it leaves you wondering if the main character will ever ever grow up.
B001E75QGG|5.0|I've always been an Indiana Jones fan and always will be so of course I'm a little bias with this movie but I don't think by much.  The one thing people have to remember is eighteen years have gone by so Indy can't still be fighting the nazis any more so we come up with the Soviets during the cold war era.  I also think the movies story quest about the crystal skulls was also pretty good and I think it depends on the person points of view whether or not the crystal skulls were truly alien in origin.  I don't want to give away to much so you'll just have to see the movie and see what I'm talking about.  The one downside I think was the actor who played Indy's son I'm not saying he was a bad actor but he just seemed a little lame to be Indy's son not to be cruel.  It's to bad we cant go back in time a little because if you've seen the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles I think the actor Sean Patrick Flannery would have been great to play Indy's son in the movie.  I do also like that they brought back the original actress who played Marion in the first Indy movie that brought a little nostalgia back for me. The blu-ray dvd does do the job the video is superb and the audio is incredible a great job done for the blu-ray dvd.  So if you're like me and have the Indiana Jones movies as well as the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles set finish your collection and get this final incredible movie for yourself right away...
0823004325|5.0|I'm a sculptor, very interested in capturing expression, and have been looking for a good book of facial expressions for some time. I saw the title, ordered the book and was extremely disappointed when it arrived; the last thing I wanted was someone else's interpretations of facial muscles. I needed photographs of the real thing, so I set the book aside, intending to send it back.<br /><br />Then I took a class with a very well-known portrait sculptor, and was surprised to hear him recommend this same book. \\"But it only has pencil sketches!\\" I protested, \\"Shouldn't we use pictures of real people?\\"<br /><br />\\"Forget photographs. You need to actually read the book. Have you?\\" he asked, \\"You must READ it, every page. This is the best facial reference for the sculptor that I have ever found.\\"<br /><br />I followed his advice, and he's right. Faigin is an extremely talented sketch artist and his drawings will teach you a lot, but the accompanying text is really what makes this book work. He's carefully catalogued what each of the muscle groups in the face is doing throughout the expression of an emotion, and the sketches simply show what he's talking about. The text explains WHY we recognize certain muscle positions as a particular expression, and helps us understand the relationships of muscles, tissue and skin when the face moves.<br /><br />Faigin starts with how facial muscles portray key emotions, then moves to comparisons of different muscle groups in subtler positions. For sculptors, it probably helps to have a 3D model of the facial muscles (in addition to a mirror) handy while reading this book. But it's such a rich store of information that you'll learn plenty without them.
0375826726|4.0|As always, Christopher Paolini serves up a very well written story. I was pleased with the more central focus on Eragon and his story in this installment of the series, as opposed to the half and half balance between Eragon and Roran in Eldest. Note to those interested in the novel -- new secrets are revealed and some that were revealed in Eldest are found to be false. I enjoyed the book very much and am now dreading the wait for the last book.
1577314808|4.0|Although this book may get a bit too far \\"out there\\" towards the end for some people, the essential tenets are so profoundly true and helpful, I'd say it is a must read for anyone.  The power is all in the now.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This was the best movie we had seen all year.  The best Marvel movie so far.  Hulk comes in second.  Most people dont know there is a secret scene after the credits roll with a huge star that is not in the main movie. So watch it after the credits.  I urge you to watch this before you watch the Hulk.  They play on each other.  I wonder whats coming next.
B00003CWN3|4.0|a strange movie, based on a true story, but ended up just the same   check out the movie!
B00006RCNW|5.0|The Shield season 1 is a great way to start off knowing the show better. On the very first epidsode, it shows the main character who is Vic Mackey killng one of his own strike team members to show what type of a guy he is. Vic Mackey does alot of crooked things in this show and manages to get away with them! The season contains deleted scences and other bonus features. If you are really into The Shield, I reccomend starting of with the first season and keep continuing season after season in a row to find out what all goes on in Vic Mackey's crooked cop life.

B001D25MNE|3.0|(Note: I'm a huge fan of this band and my beef has nothing to do with the music.)    How much would you, dear fan, pay for two new songs from your favorite band?  Does $22 sound right?  Unfortunately, that is the going price of this Greatest Hits, a collection containing even fewer tracks than 2003's Singles 93-03.  Billed as \\"DJ only, ten ultra-rare Electronic Battle Weapon tracks\\", the bonus disc seems promising until you put it in and find that the majority are demo mixes of previously released material such as \\"It Doesn't Matter\\", \\"Under the Influence\\", \\"It Began in Afrika\\" etc. - and these all sound fundamentally the same as the original versions!  In defense of this disc, the new tracks are really good, particularly \\"Keep My Composure\\", a collaboration of the Chem's sexy, soul tearing bass, arpeggiated arcade synths and MC Spank \\"Can Do No Wrong\\" Rock. However, unless your hard dive and physical copies recently melted, this collection is for people who think that fancy CD packaging will get them laid.
0393327345|5.0|Fight Club: Self-Improvement, Self-Realization, and Self-Destruction    Growing up, no matter if I succeeded or failed, I received a big hug from my mom and a little-league trophy from my dad.  I grew up in a school district that continued to bash the bell curve and inflate grades until we were all winners.  We learned through reward and we liked it; we were raised to win and we strove for perfection.    Unfortunately, we were raised wrong.  I realized this when I read Fight Club for the first time at age sixteen.  I am writing this review because of this experience; I am writing this review because I believe every teenager in the country should read this book.      Keep reading and I'll tell you why.    I reviewed Fight Club by asking two distinct questions: How did the novel change me? And, why did it change me?  While I am reviewing this novel for teenagers and their parents, many of my claims are built off other Amazon.com reviews not always written for the same audience.  This might sound corny, but just as Fight Club`s protagonist is attempting to crack society's shell; I am attempting to crack to the novel's core.    You see, Fight Club is not just the bloody mess its title indicates, but the story of a man finding his place in a society that does not suit him.  The author, Chuck Palahniuk, uses this character to critique the hypocrisy of a culture in which ordinary people are tormented by the drudgery of their modern, daily routines.  Tortured by monotony, men are driven to violence in order to escape.    Palahniuk uses this violence to get his readers to question their own lives--to question how they were raised.  As the narrator struggles to find a balance between himself, a \\"rag doll of society\\", and Tyler Durden, his schizophrenic alter ego, he concludes that if \\"self-improvement isn't the answer... Maybe self-destruction is\\" (Palahniuk 49).  This kind of teen self-reflection is \\"extremely important\\" to development explains Dr. Bernard Golden in his bookHealthy Anger.  At the same time the narrator becomes involved with an underground fight club, leaving the reader to question the legitimacy their own role in society.    As the fight club quickly becomes a method of therapy for the protagonist, it also becomes an addiction for the reader.  As reviewer Kevin Joseph points out, Palahniuk's characters fight for that second of self-realization, a psychological balance that day-to-day life cannot supply.  Do we not do the same thing when we are teenagers?  Are we not the \\"all-singing, all-dancing crap of this world\\" searching for our own place to fit in (169)?  You see Palahniuk's characters go to these fight clubs not to impose pain upon others, but to have it imposed upon them.  They need to find out what is really real, to temporarily get away from reality--something we all do as we grow up.    This is exactly why every teenager in our country should read Fight Club.  It changes a young reader by getting him or her to explore what we as often take for granted.  It gets teenagers to question ideals that their parents, their society and sometimes even their common sense enforce.  It turns a sixteen year old learner into a sixteen year old thinking.    While there are critics like reviewer Justine1212, who claim that Palahniuk's themes of nihilism and his harsh criticism of consumerism damage the minds of young readers, they ignore the value of self-exploration.  In fact, Palahniuk's bitterness towards materialism provides the reader with the dark humor that reviewer CapLeoGem and reviewer Czombie find to be the \\"bitterly sarcastic\\" essence of the book:    I think this excerpt from Fight Club kind of sums up my feelings about the book: \\"[Before,] it used to be enough that when I came home angry and knowing that my life wasn't toeing my five-year plan, I could clean my condominium or detail my car\\" (49).  What does one do when having a nice condominium and car is not enough?  Personally, I would not think to start a fight club, but it is these absurdities and incongruities that flood the book, allowing Palahniuk to reveal the dark side of American culture that reviewer Theodore Burke finds \\"essential.\\"    After all, \\"`It's only after you've lost everything,'\\" Tyler says, \\"`that you're free to do anything.'\\"  While I cannot say I've read Fight Club five times in two months like reviewer Dan Seitz \\"cinnatusc,\\" I can say that reading Fight Club has, indeed, changed me.    Everyday for one hundred and eighty days of the past fifteen years of my life I have woken up, gone to school and come home only to do it again the next day.  Before I read Fight Club, I never really questioned this schedule--my life.    Overall, Fight Club is a book definitely worth reading and has a very accurate customer-rating of four and half stars (even though I gave it five stars).  So be a good parent, buy your children a copy this holiday season and break their materialistic obsession or be a good teenager, beg your parents for a copy this holiday season and question authority.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Testament have reunited the traditional line-up and crafted a surprisingly catchy, very heavy & aggressive new CD that compares very favourably to THE NEW ORDER & LEGACY. Unlike notable contemporaries, they've managed to do it with good production, too. If you enjoy bay-area thrash with attitude, you can't go wrong with this disc. Well worth a listen.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|Angus, Malcolm, Brian, Cliff and Phil, welcome back boys to your rightful place atop the rock and roll world! Tell me, is there anyting more pure than the sound of AC/DC slashing through your speakers or headphones? Don't think so. Black Ice is just what rock and roll needed and the boys have not disappointed this fan. From Brian Jones's gritty vocals to Angus's sizzling guitar, AC/DC has never sounded better. As far as the lead track, \\"Rock and Roll Train\\" goes, I may have a new signature AC/DC song. What else can I say....buy this one!!
0743496736|3.0|I would recommend this book.  However, I think the editor did a terrible job.  The dates and ages are completely inconsistent throughout the book.  On one page, Peter is told to have gotten his dog at age three, but on the next page, two year old Peter rode on the dog's back.  The second to last page the wrong character's name is written; it should be Patrick but says Alex.  Yes, I admit that these are minor details but they detract from the book's overall impact.  Very sloppy!
B00003CX9S|5.0|Rightly regarded as one of the classic British films of the last decades, this broadly true tale of dignified humanity shining through the gloomy, impersonal smog of Victorian London hardly puts a foot wrong. Anthony Hopkins is superb as the dispassionate surgeon who rescues the maltreated circus freak and convincingly settles his own (and our) moral doubt as to whether he has simply replaced the morbid curiosity of the voyeuristic crowds for an equally exploitative scientific curiosity and means of personal gain. But it is John Hurt's rendition of a humanity that has refused to die that makes this film so memorable, a peerless performance that is heartbreakingly never less than utterly convincing.
B0002J4X1Q|3.0|Ravenous zombies - what more could you ask for on Halloween?  RESIDENT EVIL is chock full of monsters, blood, gore, and actually cool, creative decapitations.  Based on a popular computer game (which I have never played), RESIDENT EVIL is an entertaining monster flick for a cozy evening at home.    RESIDENT EVIL opens with a bang:  something has gone seriously wrong in a secret, underground research facility.  (Isn't that always the case?)  Red Queen, the computer that runs the complex, has gone mad, killing everyone in the place, and initiating a complete lock-down.  The only people on the outside who might know what is going on have no memory.  A crack military team is sent in to determine what happened.  But things go horribly wrong...    As zombie movies go, RESIDENT EVIL is pretty fun.  It launches the viewer on a wild ride, rarely pausing for breath.  The special effects are pretty well done, and as stated earlier, there are some pretty original decapitations using lasers.  The plot is pretty loose and full of holes, but I really didn't care; I was having too much fun.  The acting is typical for a monster flick, but then again, you don't watch a monster movie for the acting.     If you enjoy this sort of thing, you will really like RESIDENT EVIL.  My husband and I did, and it was just the thing for Halloween.  But seriously, couldn't the Umbrella Corporation, who owns the research facility, see this coming?  I mean, they named their master computer Red Queen.  It was in the cards.  Eventually, the Red Queen is always going to say \\"Off with their heads!\\"

B001GAOY5U|1.0|I have a 65\\" HD TV and a 7.1 system with a Velodyne 12 subwoofer. When I heard the movie had been released I went a immediately bought a copy. I figured WoW!! A high definition 3D movie --- Great.------Boy was I wrong. What a waste of money. It is the old style 3D and it looked terrible. Washed out yellow and green --almost like the tint was set wrong. When you spend that kind of money on a movie you expect to be bowled over. I always liked the story and Brenden is from my neck of the woods, so I guess I just expected too much. I guess the Spy Kid movie kind of spoiled me.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|Supernatural is one of the best shows on T.V; it is definitely the most addicting.  It is well acted, written and directed and has some cool special effects.  It is not a superficial show just for teens like most of the others on the CW.  It has depth and intelligence, as well as incredibly hot stars!  As for the season 3 DVD, it showcases all of that and is therefore very entertaining. However, because of the writer's strike, the season was short.  Instead of making up for that with more extras, we got less: no full-episode commentaries, no commentary at all by Jensen Ackles or Jared Padelecki, no behind the scenes with the actors, and the gag reel seemed more mugging for the camera than goofs caught on tape.  That said, anyone who's watched seasons 1 and 2, MUST watch season 3!!

B001GAPC1K|5.0|I can really think of only one word to use to review this movie. Awesome! I'm not a big comic book follower, nor am I a super hero geek so I was little worried going into Iron Man that I was going to be left feeling a little out of the loop. There has also been a boatload of press so I was also a little worried that the movie wouldn't live up to all the hype. I was pleasantly surprised.    Iron Man ends up being a 126 minute action packed masterpiece that once it winds up is like the Energizer bunny, it just keeps going and going. The film starts with the introduction to fast talking, suave billionaire Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) who is in Afghanistan to show off his company's latest piece of military hardware to the United States Army. En route back from the presentation his convey is ambushed by insurgent rebels and he is taken prisoner. His captors make a deal with him, build them his new missile system and they will give him his freedom. So Tony Stark does what any smart alec, fashionably hip genius would do... build a freaking awesome, super human, punch your guts out robot suit to aide in his escape. Once back on home soil he finds he has a new purpose in life and uses his weapons and inventive genius to target and torment those who are using his weapons for their evil gain.    The plot is fairly cookie cutter and you won't be surprised be any of the twists and turns but that doesn't really detract from the movie. The non stop action doesn't give it a chance to. Once Stark's chest mounted arc reactor is powered up the movie blasts off and you're on the edge of your seat for the ride. Love, allegiance, and morals aren't even enough to stop Iron Man from rocketing from zero to awesome. Sure, they are all mixed into the story but sprinkled in just the right amounts so they don't weigh the story down and turn it into a preachy political mess.    I wouldn't normally refer to a movie as a must see, but if you enjoy action then this one is for you. The acting is fantastic (especially Robert Downey Jr), the action thrill ride punches you square in the chest (hopefully not in your arc reactor), and the entire film just drips with style. I say it's an 8 of 10 and a must see, especially on Blu-ray!

1400067936|5.0|I've always thought it was funny for some executives whose company lost major amounts of money to say something like:  \\"so and so, unexpected event occurred, and we lost money.  (It's not my fault), just look at all my competitors (who also lost money)\\".  How is this a justification?  Did your mother tell you don't jump off the bridge just because everyone else is going to?  Don't drink that poison Kool-aid!<br /><br />Whether it's the dot-com meltdown, the mortage meltdown, the Enron collapse, the Arthur-Anderson accounting scandals, Katrina, Andrew, or 9-11 leading to terrorist wars, when one looks into history, there was always someone who did calculate for such risks factors.  They were always overruled by some then-high-flying executives who denied such possibilities.  These events are the black swan of reality.<br /><br />The book is fun and informative book.  The author throws his sarcastic personality into this book tells amusing stories of how a finance occupation with a great deal of randomness in success rate produces all kinds of successful incompotent characters.  Frequently, as Taleb points out, even after a black swan, these once-successful characters still walk away with millions of dollars or other successes.  As for example, the not-indicted Enron executive with $98 million, the Arthur Anderson execs who still had tens of millions, Mayor Nagin of New Orleans, the dot-com and mortage-related companies that kept their money, etc.  It's not just the financial market--it is life in general, as Taleb notes.<br /><br />Most reviewers here find his views narcissitic because he knocks so many occupations and people; I actually think he's just sarcastic; and it is evident he is also highly self-critical.  The way he knocks these others is very entertaining.  Everything from Russian scientists to MBAs to zero-risk traders to aggressive traders and to himself.<br /><br />Anyhow, what can one learn from this valuable book (other than be cautious assumming that those who are successful are compotent):<br /><br />1. If one is in an occupation where there is luck (randomness) involved, the occupation will produce a large number of lucky and unlucky people.<br />2. People aren't very good at remembering or assessing the percentage of luck in their decision process, and the lucky will be fooled into thinking their luck was skill.  Therefore one will meet a large number of successful lucky incompotent people.<br />3.

B0007PALZ2|5.0|I'll try not to explain the contents of the movie, which will be difficult because this one is hard to review without actually defining what happens within.    Suffice it to say, though, that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It seems to not get much more than a cult following at this moment, but as time passes there's no doubt in my mind that this will become a classic science fiction psychological thriller of the first order.  Bruce Willis is unbelievable in this movie.  Brad Pitt is very good, too.  The acting is superb.    But, what I cannot stress enough is the absolute necessity of understanding what this film is really intended to do: *spoiler below*    *It's intended to express as best as possible what paranoid delusions are actually really like for mental illness patients.  Trust me on that.    Ok, spoiler over, and that's not really much of one as it is.  But, if you want to get into a little schizophrenia for yourself this is your movie.  It's not for all audiences, though.  Those who have genuine mental illness probably should not watch the movie at all.  Maybe.  On the other hand, maybe it could help them to understand better their own confusions.    Whatever.    The bottom line is that this is a fantastically well developed thriller with science fiction elements.  It's totally psychological, and completely and utterly confusing in every way.  In the end you are left wondering what you've just witnessed and what has just happened.  You really don't know, but you think you do, but you don't.  Seriously, the gripping conclusion continues the parallel theme of mental illness along side fantastic sci-fi trek through time.      It's perfectly done.  I cannot recommend too many better movies for you.  There just are very few that are as good as this one.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll remember why you fell in love with Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda.  It really is a two and a half hour long episode, but we get to see all that has happened in the four plus years since its bittersweet finale.  The fashion still leaves you breathless and the issues the girls face still relate to your own (or one of your best girlfriend's), it's hard not to love watching it!  It is a must-have to add to your Sex And The City DVD collection!

B001F12J48|1.0|The other reviews for this seem to have been lifted from the regular version of the Polar Express DVD.  This review is solely for the 3D version.  If you haven't purchased it yet, avoid it like a petrified fruitcake.  I saw this film in 3D Imax and was so enchanted with the 3D effects that I couldn't wait for a 3D release of the DVD.  I was disappointed to see on the packaging that the 3D used the red/blue method which generally eliminates the color scheme of the movie right off the bat.  (I noticed that the 3D version of \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" which was released the same day came with the more modern polarized glasses with the neutral color.  I haven't seen that yet and can't comment on the success of that process with that particular DVD)    What makes this presentation of the Polar Express in 3D such a failure is that THE GLASSES DON'T JOIN THE RED AND BLUE CHANNELS INTO ONE IMAGE.  Everything in the mid to foreground is seen in double vision which is extremely annoying.  We switched to the 2D version less than 5 minutes into the film because it was too disconcerting to see 2 chins...4 arms...etc.  Whoever made the decision to present the film in this manner should be fired for incompetence.    The bottom line is that THE 3D EFFECT IS SO INCREDIBLY SLIGHT that it can't outweigh the major problems with the faulty technique.  If you enjoy this film, as I do, avoid the disappointment and skip this disaster.  Maybe they'll try again in the future with a more successful presentation...until then...do yourself a favor STICK TO THE 2D VERSION!

B00005JPO1|5.0|Movie great....a little pricey and did not receive it any faster then if I purchased it in store for less money.  Usually I am extremely happy with all my purchases thru amazon but this one was a little disappointing.  Cost me about 10.00 more then in stores.
B001E7OO2I|4.0|I love John Legend and have ever since his first album. Yeah I bough Get Lifted 3X and have been to too many concerts...Even venturing out on my own to catch a local concert.  The smooth RnB grooves from the first album have somehow dwindled on the later releases.  So if you are hoping Evolver will Get You Lifted Higher...ahh you'll still be waiting.  Anyhow I really like this album.  It is sooooo different from Legend' previous projects.  But for true Legend fans that was won over from Day 1 by his unique voice and touching lyrics, you will be satisfied.  Here's the breakdown of this worthy album. This is Grown n Sexy musik at its best..perfect for a dinner party!     Green Light-Grown n Sexy club groove makes any1 want to head out to the club.  Andre3000 is perfect for this song.  It's hot and the video is event hotter    It's Over-This one is growing on me.  It's really smooth but this duet with Kanye lacks something that previous duets like Number One had...I can't put my finger on it yet but true fans will know exactly what I mean    Everybody Knows-This is my favorite track.  Really what gets you on this track is the lyrics. FAV LINE - Everybody knows that nobody really knows how to make it work or how to ease the hurt.  This is on permanent repeat...LOL    Quickly-Anyone who knows me knows I HATE brandy's music...but this duet really works...primarily because the snappy lyrics and just a great combination of both voices...Legend serenades his lady to love him quickly...like the world is about to end...    Cross The Line-I luv this one as well...the words are so vivid that you could almost see the friends become lovers...Real smooth track with a catchy chorus.    No Other Love-One Word...Sexy!  This is a groovy reggae inspired dub...Estelle kills it on her her verse...as expected.  The guitar and the drums just take you away to shores of MoBay or Negril...    This Time-Touching song of boy meets girl, boy screws up, boy relfects and realizes he missed out on the best thing yet, boy wants gurl back, boy vows to be a better man THIS TIME...Yeah We;ve all heard this sorta song before but this one is really done.  I like it...like it alot    Satisfaction-So I like really don't like this track but every other blog is raving about it...sorry this is a filler for me...and you know this song and quickly is Legend's favorite songs on the album...go figure    Take Me Away- For all the Legend heads out there..this one is kinda like Maxine from Once Again the second album.  Tells a sweet story of sad gurl that wants to be taken away. This has a smoothy jazzy feel...    Good Morning-Ladies you would sooo want to wake up to this...Again Legend gets you with raw lyrically talent...Smooth, sexy, and refreshing love song..    I love, you love-OFFICIALLY my 2nd Fav song on this 3rd effort.  It's stripped down, raw, bare, and down right hot.  You are left with the soulful acoustics of the guitar and legend's raw voice..the lyrics are hot too..It's about loving love and still return after being burned...I wanna say it is like So High but in a lot of ways it is not...it's mych more mellow and toned down...u gotta hear it.    Can't Be my Lover BONUS-My 3rd fav track.  Reggae tune with Buju Banton...makes you holla PULLL IT PULLLL IT...Not a forced combo...Buju and Legend fit perfectly on this dub tune...FAVE LINE-I'll be damned if i lose my gurl, i'll be damned if i dont touch her...Catchy chorus and hot riddim you are sure to hear at reggae club dis weekend...it's Buju u really can't go wrong
B001BKG9SK|5.0|This is an excellent DVD/CD set for anyone who enjoys David Gilmour's work and his playing. The sound and video are superb quality and the music is great. Warning if you are looking for another Pink Floyd calssics collection, this is not it. There is a really nice version of Shine On You Crazy Diamond and a cool version of Comfortably Numb with the symphony orchestra playing the string parts. It is nice to see Rick Wright in what I suppose is one of his last recorded performances. What stands out the most here for me is Gilmour's guitar work. I especially enjoy the \\"barn jams\\" which are just what they sound like and his lap steel playing is particularly nice. This is well worth the cost.
B00188M5TM|5.0|I was not sure that I wanted to see The Changeling. Having seen the trailers a few times I was not looking forward to seeing the film. When my wife and I did go I was a bit bored by the story since I knew what was coming.     But as I watched more I became caught up in the story as it became more and more unbelievable. I was left wondering why the story of Christine Collins and her son had not been told before.  The film is very close to the real events that to us would be abuses of power that could only happen in third world countries.  As was related in LA Confidential, the Los Angeles Police force was a formidable crime organization but that they could have someone committed to a mental institution - without evidence or due process - is a stunning abuse of power.     The performance by Angelina Jolie is amazing. She became Christine Collins and the emotion she brings to her role was never over played.  Simple put she acts as a mother would and her character is required to carry the film, which she does admirably. It was great seeing John Malkovich in a part that was not sinister. He is the Presbyterian minister Gustav Briegleb, who is perhaps the only person the LAPD fears for his radio sermons and the corruption they expose.      Jason Butler Harner is fantastic as Gordon Northcott, who is the suspect in what came to be termed as the Chicken Coop Murders.  Mr. Harner played his part as someone who was profoundly mentally disturbed, entirely divorced from reality. The story of the Wineville murders would make a movie in itself.  Eddie Anderson is outstanding as Sanford Clark, the boy who confessed to helping his cousin (Gordon Northcott).  His scene where he confesses to the murders was remarkable for his depth of emotion and when forced by the dubious detective to dig up the remains of the victims his display of revulsion with precisely what his part demanded.     As for the villains, Colm Feore played the Chief of Police memorably and Jeffrey Donovan is equallygood as the amoral and domineering Captain J.J Jones.  The scenes where he bullies Christine Collins are difficult to watch without wanting to scream back at the screen in protest.  I have not had this kind of involvement with a movie in a long time. Michael Kelly was every inch the police detective as Lester Ybarra, especially memorable was the scene when he decided to give Sanford Clark the benefit of the doubt about his story of the murders.       My wife found The Changeling too long but I became so caught up in the story that time was not a factor. I think the criticism that I have read about this movie - that it is not mysterious enough and is confusing - miss the mark.  It is not an easy film to watch with the gross injustice committed against Christine Collins to say nothing of the length of the film (141 minutes).  There is a lot of story to relate between the story of Christine Collins and the murders but Clint Eastwood manages to weave together as a single story.      The Changeling brings to life the late 1920's where women's rights have a long way to go, to even become supervisors, and where the police serve their own needs and not those of the community.  Clint Eastwood has put together a remarkable film that will not be appreciated right away: he has shed light on a crime that was never solved and a mother who was never reunited with her son. The fate of Walter Collins remains a mystery to this day.
B00005K9LK|5.0|Judas Priest-Screaming For Vengeance *****<br /><br />It wasn't long after Screaming For Vengeance that the Priest slid into a world of pop-laden 1980's hair metal-Esq albums (minus the hair of course), but Screaming For Vengeance was one hell of a way to go out. One of the metal, metal albums of the decade. No thrash, death, or gore here just pure metal. More than that it is regarded as one of the defining metal albums of all time.<br /><br />Glen Tipton and K.K. Downing prove once again that they bring the strongest guitar arsenal in metal (or at least they did back in the day) with solo's from other worlds and riffs to rival that of anyone. The man, the voice of metal, Rob Halford tares the walls down with his glass shattering pipes through out.<br /><br />'The Hellion/Electric Eye' open the album and are among the greatest recordings in metal history. A true powerhouse and easily the best on the album. 'Take These Chains' is almost power metal but saves itself because than you realize it is Judas after all and they wouldn't dare. 'Pain And Pleasure' feels like the only misstep because of the production but even it is enjoyable. The title track is among Halfords greatest moments as a vocalist. It is also one of the hardest, heaviest, and all around most powerful tracks in JP history. 'You've Got Another Thing Coming' was and still is their biggest hit single, and for good reason; it is one of the all time greatest tunes in metal.<br /><br />Screaming For Vengeance is prime Judas Priest. Some of their greatest work can be found here. Not only is it a nice place to start when entering the realm of Priest but also when entering metal in general. It's a classic and an essential Judas album.
0385720920|4.0|(First published in 2001, this book has been re-released because of the upcoming movie.)    Choke tells the tale of Victor Mancini, a recovering sex-addict and medical school dropout. A story filled with piercing social commentary accented by creative storytelling. Palahniuk presents the personality of Mancini by way of disgusting, yet thought-provoking parallels and phrases in the same vein as a Physician's Desk Reference. A drug-addicted, baby-boomer mother, an overly dependent best friend, multiple urban legends, and a miracle-working doctor all make for an incredibly enjoyable and somewhat disturbing read.    This book was very interesting, and I enjoyed it fully. Palahniuk is one of the better contemporary satirists out there, and Choke is a prime example of his ability. All the characters were well developed and perfectly caricatured. Furthermore, his clever writing style matches the storyline perfectly, and his perverse jumps from sex to grotesqueries to religion keep you reading when you most want to turn away.    What we have learned from Palahniuk with \\"Fight Club\\" is that his novels transfer beautifully into film, and I am sure Choke will be no different. This is one of Palahniuk's best works, and I would have no qualms suggesting it to a friend or even stamping it with a parental advisory sticker.    Whether you are a Palahniuk fan or not; this book is well worth the read, and I personally cannot wait to see the film.    Armchair Interviews says: Another book from an edgy writer who gave us \\"Fight Club.
B00009TB5G|4.0|I must thank Peter Jackson, the cast, the crew, and Tolkien himself for the LOTR trilogy. Because if it weren't for them, then I wouldn't be the avid reader that I am to this day. As for \\"The Two Towers\\" it's an astonishing sequel to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\". And the Extended Edition makes it all the more compelling. What you miss are great scenes that are mentioned in the book (Numenor), more character development between the main characters (Legolas and Gimli's final count at Helm's Deep), and a bit of comedy (Eowyn's cooking) that fairly lightens up the darker atmosphere that's present here.<br /><br />As for the cast, they're just above excellent. However, I personally didn't like Gollum as much. Oh, Andy Serkis did a terrific job as the character, and the CGI is so realistic that Jar-Jar Binks must be crying his eyes out, but the overacting somewhat irritated me. The prime example would have to be the scene in which he battles his tries to depart from his evil \\"conscience\\". But other than that, it doesn't really ruin the entire movie. The new cast members (Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, Brad Dourif, David Wenham, etc.) give out fine performances, and the scenery of the land of Rohan gives more beauty and majesty in Middle-Earth.<br /><br />The battle scene in Helm's Deep is the highlight of this film. For about half an hour, men and elves fight against the ten thousand Uruk-Hai. So there are hundreds of arrows, spears, swords, and probably only one axe (from Gimli). It's grand alright.<br /><br />The music is more epic than ever before. The \\"Rohan Theme\\" with the Norwegian fiddle is the finest out of all of them. The choral motif with \\"Arwen and Aragorn\\" sounds beautiful and mystical. Gollum's Song is also a treat.<br /><br />40 minutes worth of new scenes really IS worth getting this Extended DVD. And soon, I'll be buying \\"The Return of the King\\" Extended DVD, and I hope I get more thatn I expect (I couldn't believe that they cut out the \\"Steward and the King\\" chapter).
B001GAOY5U|5.0|Really great entertainment value here, looks fantastic on my hi-def TV and with a great story to boot.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is without doubt the best workout DVD I have bought so far. I have bought quiet a few different ones and have never been completely satisfied with any of the workouts till I bought the `30 Day Shred'. It is fantastic. Each work out segment takes only 20 minutes and you don't do the same move for more than 30seconds at a time so you seem to get through the workout so much quicker. I have used the DVD only four times and have noticed results already. I could hardly walk the next day after the first time I did one of the workouts, however after the second and third time it so much easier and you just feel fantastic and so much healthier in yourself.   If you're looking for a quick, hard workout and want results quickly, get the '30 Day Shred'.
B001676320|4.0|I was very impressed with the quality of the bands, as well as the overall quality of the Blu-ray disc.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|I had high hopes that they would make this film stand out and be compeletly diffrent and better than the first hulk movie. And boy did they... I was a little worried about edward norton playing the hulk but he was awesome.... The CGI was great and the plot was not too bad... Over all this was a good movie to add to my Blu-Ray collection.
B00132D808|5.0|I always thought of Panic At The Disco as just another pop / rock wannabe band similar to Fallout Boy or a host of others.  In other words, not a band to be taken seriously.  Shortly after this album came out I kept hearing the single \\"Nine In The Afternoon\\" on my local music channel, and then caught a live concert broadcast of the band on HDTV.  I ended up watching the whole show and something about these guys really captured my attention, so I took a chance on this album.  I am certainly glad I did.  \\"Pretty Odd\\" takes its main influence from The Beatles as there are many similarities to the \\"Sgt Pepper\\" era here.  The diversity of the album also hearkens back to the days of Queen's more adventurous work like \\"A Night At The Opera\\".  This is not to say that the album is a retro release.  Although it takes influences from the past the band manages to stay modern and fresh.  Fans of the band seem to give his album really mixed reviews.  The level of maturity between their debut and this album is a giant leap, but some of the band's fans don't seem to be able to handle this.  I like every track on this disc and it is right near the top of my best of 2008 list of albums.  If you enjoy really well done pop / rock, with a bit of a retro psychedelic, experimental bent this album is a much purchase.  With all of the generic bland crap being released these days, \\"Pretty Odd\\" is a breath of fresh air.  I just hope that the general public can tolerate a popular band that is willing to step out on a limb musically and try something different from their peers.
0061565407|5.0|This was one of the most wonderful books I have read.  I have recommended it to everyone I know.  Heartwarming, poignant and oh so enriching.  Loved it!!  The narrater also did such a great job.  I hated for it to end but it ended in such a wonderful way.  I've passed on my cd but am purchasing the book to keep and re-read again.
1596434252|5.0|This quickly became my 2-year-old's absolute favorite book. I am considering buying a second copy so that he doesn't need supervised reading of our only copy.  He was a little confused at first (called the angled \\"L\\" a \\"V\\" and the V to W is a bit confusing for him) but keeps asking for it again and again.  He recognizes almost all of the letters now thanks to his magnetic letters that he loves and now this book.      We pre-ordered this one and have had it since its release.  It is still in perfect condition and I try to use the book as a lesson in being gentle with more delicate books.  So far we have had success.

B00005KB9R|5.0|Cannot ever listen to this album without pondering what was gained, what was lost when two of the original Wailers (Tosh, Livingston) left the band. This though is an enduring statement of how much talent left the band when those two departed. Bunny Livingston's contributions, singing and writing, are particularly noticeable on this effort. This is high level music by any measure. The harmonies are especially poignant on songs like \\"Hallelujah Time\\" and \\"Burning and Looting\\". Highly recommended.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|The Movie<br /><br />Presented in what I understand is the first ever not-blue-BD case and with a limited edition 3D cover, the incredible film from Louis Leterrier arrives to BluRay. I do not intend to get into many details of the film as other reviewers have already done so, the franchise reboot was indeed of great help, the cast and their performances are simply incredible and very serious for a film of this kind. What made this Hulk movie better than the previous one is the fact that the people behind it are trying to set the Marvel universe in a real-world scenario, with great results. Add the factor of Marvel being involved, the special cameo by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), several references to the \\"super-soldier\\" and the imminent coming of an \\"Avengers\\" film and even non-fans will want more!<br /><br />The picture and audio quality in the BD are superb, while the movie does not have too many sequences that could take advantage of the format (such as \\"Speed Racer\\" by the Wachowski brothers) the fight sequences look and sound clean and sharp. The level of detail high definition brings is very notorious in this BD as the deleted scenes included are presented in standard definition, so after watching a HD film presentation and going to the extras to watch the material not included the difference in quality is huge (Not sure really why the deleted scenes were not presented in HD though)<br /><br />The Extras<br /><br />All extras except the deleted scenes are presented in full HD.<br /><br />The famous alternate opening sequence is included, Leterrier was known of being very fond of this sequence that was removed in the end.

As a reference and if you are not familiar with his work, he also draws all the paintings used in the TV show \\"Heroes\\".<br /><br />Documentaries included are \\"Making of the Incredible\\", \\"Becoming the Hulk\\", \\"Becoming the Abomination\\" and \\"Anatomy of a Hulk out\\".

B0013ND30W|5.0|I love this film, it's even better now that it's on Blu-Ray. I would have liked this video to have come with a digital copy, but the bonus DVD is okay too. I tried to put the DVD on my computer so I could add it to my iPhone, but it wouldn't work. :(  Still, it's a great movie and I can't complain about the picture quality, even on the regular DVD. I'm really very happy with this purchase.
B000WTNCYA|4.0|Melody Gardot \\"needs a hand with her worrisome heart.\\" And according to her, \\"she gravitates towards soothing music, often genres that are soft and somewhat unassuming.\\" She further states that \\"music can do wonders for your spirit especially when it's the kind that calms you down.\\"<br /><br />About five years ago, Melody Gardot was slammed into by the front end of a jeep that left her bedridden and disabled. As a result, she had turned her recuperating time into something creative and productive by writing the lyrics and music on all ten tracks on this remarkable album, \\"Worrisome Heart,\\" which starts off with the title track and ends with \\"Twilight.\\" This album is a showcase of Ms. Gardot's versatility where she shows off not only her remarkable vocal style, but also her talents in guitar and piano, and composing and songwriting as well.<br /><br />She is ably supported by a crew of fine musicians who are all skilled in their respective instruments namely Ken Pendergast (bass), Dave Posmontier (piano), Charlie Patierno (drums), Matt Cappy (trumpet), Joel Bryant (Hammond B3/Rhodes/Wurlitzer), Jef Lee Johnson, Barney McKenna (guitar), Ron Kerber (clarinet), Diane Monroe (violin), Mike Brenner (Lap Steel guitar), Krista Nielsen (cello), Kurt Johnson and David Mowry (Dobro guitar).<br /><br />In conclusion, I admire Ms. Gardot's impressive vocal artistry and for the simple fact that she turned her pain and discomfort into something creative and productive -- and as a result, an impressive debut album with a remarkable set of all-original-songs, which represent her innermost feelings and heartfelt thoughts set into beautiful music and meaningful lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Special thanks...most importantly to God and the universe for bringing so many wonderful people into my life, to all the people who have touched me with their support and generosity and to everyone who took the time to look my way and lend a hand when I least expected it.\\" ~ Melody Gardot ~
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Not only is The Dark Knight the best movie of 2008, it is also THE best comic book movie ever. Forget Spiderman, or even Superman. Everything pales in comparisson. The reason the film did so well is because it is not so unbelievable as it could have been. The emotions were real, the characters felt real and most importantly, Batman is not your typical superhero. He has no powers that are extraordinary or special. He made himself into what he is and that is the difference between this saga and all the wannabees.    Once again, the acting makes the film, and this is no exception. Bale, Oldman, and of course Ledger are the reason this movie is so wonderful. You end up loving the characters, whether in a good way or not. Everyone just does a fantastic job and by the end you just want it to continue, to see and to know more about each character. This is not the type of film that after it's over, you just shrug and walk away. No, it leaves an impression behind and you can't help but think about it long after the viewing.     The plot is a bit tricky to put into words and requires more than viewing to really appreciate all that is going on, but it really is a rich and engaging story that will probably feel as fresh ten years from now. This is more than a comic book movie, this is a drama/action/crime film all in one. And it deserves all the praise and recognition it gets.
B001BTG3OQ|3.0|I am a wedding photographer.  We have 3 Nikon SB 80's and 3-SB 800 units used weekly for the past 4 years.  We also have 3 Canon 580 units which have worked flawlessly.    This year, I switched back from Canon to Nikon, and when the SB 900 appeared, I purchased it for my new Nikon D300 and D200 cameras.  The first unit was Dead on Arrival.   The replacement unit works well and has wonderful program and update capabilities. It is easy to use.    My only concern is the unit overheats very quickly when shooting wedding groups and bouncing the light off ceilings ect... This requires the strobe to do larger power dumps than would the flash if pointing directly at the subject....   My SB 900 shut down in the middle of Group photos, and I quickly pulled out my trusty SB 800 and completed the job.      Outdoors, using fill flash, the SB-900 works well.  It does not work well in large halls, darkened receptions etc.      I turned off the Over Temp Shutdown feature, but the unit still squeals at me with every shot after 6-8 shots have been taken.  I find myself blowing into the top of the unit, trying to cool it... but, it needs cooling holes or a fan... with the constant overheating problem.    I thought my flash was over -sensitive, until reading other reviews here... Now, I know, sadly,  it is just part of this finicky $[...] beast.      Jim Jones  [...]

B000003TSP|2.0|In the three years following Portishead's first album about 1 billion trillion bands ripped off the portishead sound...  Or tried to.<br /><br />Postishead reponded with this lame effort.  I barely remember it. I think it had one mediocre song and a bunch of really bad ish.  The singer decided to rip off Barbara Streisand instead of billy holiday.  wtf?<br /><br />I have yet to check the third album.  even though it was released six months ago.  this sophmore record is THAT BAD<br /><br />1.5 stars.<br /><br />(the best band to deliver that \\"portishead\\" sound was LAMB who mixed a beefy style of creative DnB with the style.  Locust also had a dope mix by Boom Boom satalites that did a grunge rock take on the sound.  you can also go back in time and peek Skinhead Oconner, Suzi Sioux and Cocteau Twins first album if you like P-head roots muzak)
B001C08RHA|3.0|The one thing Iron Man has going for it is Robert Downey Jr who is just perfect for this role. He is a natural and really embodies the character just right. There is wit and charm and appeal. However, I found the movie a tad on the slow side and fairly predictable. There was no doubt in my mind who the 'bad guy' was, and I know nothing about this comic book.     This film, though fun at times did not spark my interest like The Dark Knight or even Transformers did. There were boring lulls and nothing particularly interesting to fill the action-less void. Iron Man is certainly a very good comic book movie, far better than many I've seen, but certainly not the best. It will appeal to many, mostly, again, because of the main character's likeability and the very nice special effects the film has to offer.
0375826726|3.0|Paolini's writing is improving; I'll give him that much.  Brisingr, the third installment in what was supposed to be a trilogy but now has become the Inheritance Cycle, is definitely an upgrade on Eldest.  Though it lacks the childlike excitement of the first book Eragon, it most certainly trumps the quality of Eldest.  Paolini is more than nine years removed from when he commenced writing this series, and it really shows within his writing.  His writing has surely matured since the first book, but he is still too smart for his own good.    Having graduated from home schooling at age 15, Paolini is indeed an intelligent fellow, yet he needs to understand that his largest intended audience is a group of teenage boys whose vocabularies are no where near as complex as his own.  If Paolini doesn't abuse his thesaurus then I'll eat my socks.  Yet despite his overuse of six syllable words in the foremost pages of his novel, his story starts to gain speed and flow after the first hundred or so pages.  Of course, instead of advancing the plot, Paolini instead chooses to put his hero, Eragon, through a moral quandary, so that we can learn more about his character.  So, instead of giving his readers what they want-battle scenes, romance, dragons-he decides to let Eragon battle with his conscience in isolation.  Great idea Paolini, show your readers how righteous your hero is at the expense of advancing the plot.  At this rate, we are going to be stuck with a Wheel of Time sized series, only with about a third of the substance.    Even though Paolini has his problems-and they're numerous: hacked plot, flat characters, cheesy love story, unoriginal creatures, wooden dialogue-his story is entertaining.  I felt myself compelled to continue reading into the early hours of the morning.  I just kept that midnight oil burning.  I don't know why.  I do really like Roran's character.  His love for his wife, and how he comes to here defense, is portrayed in a really legitimate way.  I also like his battle scenes so much more than Eragon's because he is unaided by magic.  He has to fight his enemies with his bare hands, or with his hammer.  Unlike Eragon, he can't pull some lucky magic trick out of a bag, and he doesn't have a fire-breathing dragon watching his back.  (This is where I begin to see that Paolini never had much of a social life.  The character he sees himself as is obviously Eragon.  He always wished he found a dragon egg which allow him to harness magical powers.  He never wanted to do things for himself, unlike Roran.  I don't know though, I've never grown up in the boonies of Montana before.)  I just wish Paolini would dedicate more to tree to his hero's much more likeable cousin.     Eragon's storyline is completely worthless, of course.  He gets to interact with some interesting acquaintances.  The Varden's leader, Nasuada, has to deal with the fact that she is a woman and that that causes her to be constantly underestimated.  Her character proves herself in this story, and that is a very fascinating scene.  Eragon also gets to moon over the mysterious Arya, whose athletic feminine prowess provides the romance side of the novel with some intrigue.  Eragon also has to deal with the super-orthodox Oromis, an ancient elf, who no one will miss.  The dwarves are somewhat interesting though why Paolini dedicates hundreds upon hundreds pages to their politics is beyond me.      In conclusion, the book is very readable if you go in with an open mind.  There are entertaining parts, and Paolini can write when he doesn't think too much about it.  You can just tell he tweaks everything a little too much.  But all in all, I think he will eventually be a more efficient writer; I just hope that he comes with some more original plot lines.  I will be reading what will hopefully be the last installment in the series though, because I always finish what I start, and I am interested to see the outcome of Eragon's battle with Galbatorix, who I wishhad a POV in this series.    freshumassstar.blogspot.com

B000FP2Z0S|5.0|This CD is awesome.  I had it playing on repeat over and over for a few weeks.  It's still in my cd changer, but their new cd, Appeal to Reason is now getting most of the playtime.
0385340990|5.0|I just started this book today and cannot put it down.  I love it.  It makes me laugh and cry.  It is perfectly written.  I wish everyone I know was reading it.<br /><br />  I am going to try to find more books by these authors.
B00008DDSC|4.0|Two emotionally wounded people find love through a dominant/submissive relationship.  Maggie Gyllenhahl is great, as usual.  Warning: although the domination scenes aren't that heavy, some people could find them offensive.  But I'm not into BDSM myself and still liked the movie a lot.
B000A7S4B0|4.0|You know how when you are flipping through the radio stations and hear a song from back in the day and ask yourself, \\"why don't they make music like this anymore?\\" Well, BRMC has answered that question with HOWL.<br /><br />They are an incredibly well-rounded band and true musicians whose sincerity and emotions are evident in every strum of the guitar. I am not a religious man but songs like \\"devil's waiting\\" trigger all kinds of emotions deep inside.<br /><br />For those of you tired of all the emo crap on the radio BRMC is a breath of fresh air and a reminder of what rock and roll is and could be. Cheers!
0446579939|5.0|As always, Nicholas Sparks has provided his readers with another nail-biting, romantic story. I loved it!
B001GM28HO|5.0|I had no idea who this person was when i initially saw the cover. I never even heard a single song from this artist. Since everyone has an MP3 player, a radio seems almost non-existent. So i sampled the entire album for 30 seconds per song on iTunes and i must say i was intrigued. Then when i saw the price tag of [.....] i was even more intrigued. So i decided to pick this album up. I must say, if an album is [.....], it isn't that big of an issue for me. But this is one of the best purchases i made this year. This is as close to POP perfect as your gonna get. Lady Gaga delivers the goods on almost every track. I listened to the whole album and there's only about 1 or 2 songs I'd skip over. Other then that, the majority of the album is excellent. It's nice to see a new artist deliver the goods. Every since Britney stopped working with Max Martin she has really lost her magic & only churns out a song of interest every once in awhile. Lady Gaga delivers the goods and the beats are INSANE. They are so beyond the realm of ADDICTION!!! Get this CD if you wanna dance, party, & have a good time =)
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This is the first Metallica album that I have bought since the Black album. I thought Load was fair and everthing since Load and up to this was garbage. I've been a fan for 18 years and this is a great album. A lot like Justice. Doesn't have the commercial appeal of the Black album but that's a good thing. If you are long time fan and you have been waiting since Justice for the real Metallica to return...their back.
0896762173|5.0|Like the Janet Arnold books, this is a fabulous resource for research, pattern drafting, and even garment construction (although this is not sewing instruction manual)--many drawings show the details of historical fashions, which can guide us modern stitchers in how to replicate.  Like the Arnold books, this is not a beginners' construction guide, but rather a research resource, which will provide some excellent drawings of period outfits.  If one should just happen to be costuming \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" this would be a splendid book to invest in.
B0000524CY|3.0|The Exorcist starring Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair is considered the best horror film of all-time, I have to disagree. The Exorcist is scary but the language and bodily fluids are a bit much, it's like enough already! The acting is excellent but overall this movie doesn't live up to the hype, sorry.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I absolutely love Dexter. It is witty and it is certainly far different from any other show I have ever watched. Just think A serial Killer with morals and a code of honor, how odd!
B00139W3NE|1.0|I've got a funny feeling that this was made by massive fans of the book.  And they thought that every one else in the world, has read it and where also massive fans of the book.  I've never read the book, so maybe if I had the movie might have made some sense.
0156030209|4.0|A wonderful, imaginative and utterly engaging meditation on the existence of God, really (not to mention a rollicking good tale).  And in the final analysis, I like the story with the animals in it better! (see page 352)  Enjoy.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Sookie Stackhouse is your typical girl next door. She lives with her grandmother in a small Louisana town called Beau Temps where everything is seeminly normal. Normal until Bill Compton returns to town.<br />Strutting into the bar and grill Sookie works at she finds herself immediately drawn to Bill. Unfortunately for Bill his charms that Sookie is so drawn to doesn't sit well with the rest of the town for Bill is Beau Temp's very first vampire resident. Sookie quickly falls for him and thrusted into a river of troubles that runs way above her head.<br />A tale of sex, blood and murder this show will have you scratching your head as you try to figure out whats to come next. If you are a virgin to True Blood you are missing out. This show presents more action, more mystery and more spine tingling suspense than any show that has come out in the past five years.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|The day finally came: a new Metallica album was realeased! And, as so many reviewers before me has stated, what an album it is. Death Magnetic has, in an ever more seldomly seen combination of riffs, solos, and intelligence, it all.     This release harkens back to ye days of yore when Metallica-tracks were more long metal hymns of 7+ minutes than songs under 5 minutes, with the shortest track on Death Magnetic being a full 5:01 (and the only track under 6 minutes). It also, and this is important, brings back the old days of proper riffs, proper speed, and the (fantastic) solos of Kirk Hammet. Just listen to 'All Nightmare Long' or 'Cyanide', and you'll know what I'm on about. The riffs are heavy, rhythmic, and, very importantly, thrashy. The solos are not, as in the olden days, attempts at landspeed records in the guitar category (although they at times are quite fast), but rather bluesy and very becoming indeed. The drums are back in true form, as Ulrich seemingly has remembered how a snare drum should sound, and really lays down a 'metal' foundation on which the beforementioned riffs and solos can build their tower of power on. And we must not forget the bass! Death Magnetic is the first stuidoalbum with (5 year) new bass player Rob Trujillo, and he does, in my mind and to my ear, a wonderful job. Trujillo, being a fingerstyle player (and a very fine example of the breed, indeed) as opposed to Newstead, who preferred picks, brings his own, slightly funky, but very metaly style of playing to the Metallica sound with great succes. The bass may seem a bit 'dead' on the CD, but that is the fault of the compression, as has been said so many times before. The vocals are not of the kind we knew 20 years ago, but rather the 'new', 'singing' ones we have heard over the past many albums. Some people dislike them, but I think they sound rather good. It's definitely a different sound, but it's quite suitable nonetheless.    This brings us on to a different matter: this is not \\"And Justice for All\\", or indeed any of the 80ies albums. The formula is roughly the same, but the people using the formula have developed. The music is as angry, as heavy, as fast, as good as before, but it is slightly different. And why wouldn't it be? One of the biggest strengths of Metallica, to my mind anyway, has always been, that they do not copy themselves. They experiment and reinvent themselves. Apart from Load and Reload, that were supposed to be a double album, not two of Metallicas albums have sounded the same. They may have been sidetracked by this and that over the years, but they did a complete and utter reinvension of themselves with St. Anger (an album, which, by the way, I liked. Very powerful, good riffs, but no solos, which was indeed bollocks) and Death Magnetic is the next step in the Metallica evolution. It is the Ride the Lightning to the Kill 'em All of St. Anger. It is Metallica as interpreted by Metallica, and it is absolutely, undeniably, irrefutably, and massively fantastic.     Highest possible recommendation.
B001DDBCV4|5.0|This was a great finale to the Sex and the City series.  I loved the movie and the special features.  Sarah Jessica Parker deserves some kind of award for acting in this movie.  Two thumbs up!
B0019MLVEM|5.0|Adding to the previous reviews: The Script, hailing from Dublin, are calling themselves a Celtic Soul band. Two of the band members, Danny O'Donoghue and Mark (sometimes Marc) Sheehan were members of a boy-band called Mytown in the late 1990s, and Mark is purported to be one of the top choreographers in Ireland. I find this interesting, in that they gave up the dancing completely, refocused on songwriting and playing, and are probably about to break huge in the states. Mytown got a huge advance and flopped badly, despite a lot of help from big US producers. The main dance numbers were very derivative, but the ballads were good. You could see and hear the talent in their videos (go on YouTube).     My HS age son has been playing The Script's songs for his friends and they are all going crazy on iTunes and YouTube.com, and god-knows-where-else, since they can't buy the album in the US yet.    Great vocals from the three official bandmates, including the drummer Glen Power, very catchy songs with soul, rap, reggae, hints of U2, and some very smart lyrics. We Cry's cool rap/soul foundation and political lyrics grab the kids hard enough to get them to listen to the great ballads of Breakeven (amazing chorus) and The Man Who Can't Be Moved. I found 'If You See Kay' pretty on the surface but a little cloying... the lyric refers to the singer as sweet f.a. without Kay, meaning he is nothing, or sweet f*&K-all, a common UK term (also the title of the old Sweet song). If You See Kay, also spells out the word (F_U_C...), if you catch my drift, so I feel they got a little too clever here, ruining the sentiment for me.     The best thing about The Script though are their amazing live performances. Danny changes up the songs virtually every time he delivers one live, and I have a lot of versions I prefer to the albums. Check out their appearance on Live at Abbey Roads on Sundance, or some of their live performances on balconies, tv shows, etc. on YouTube. They are gonna blow up in the US. Good looking kids, with great songs, great vocals, great performances. How can they miss...The Script is already written in platinum. One day they should drop the instruments and dance a little, too...
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|I avoided watching this movie, for some time, because I fell prey to reviews that indicated this movie as a disappointment. And shame on me for allowing myself to be swayed in that manner!    I found this movie to be exceptionally well done - and people need to take a little harder look at HOW the filming was done - how Elizabeth's clothing is brighter and more colorful, to the grey/brown-dull colors for the majority of others. The point was HER - attention focused on her. That's what she expected and craved - demanded.     The movie may not be dynamic - but folks, that's the way life was during that time. (At least this is more believable than the tragic \\"Tudor\\" series!)     I, personally, hope there is a 3rd movie - let's see how they handle her (Elizabeth) when she was nearing the end of her reign and still very vain.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|i own the three season and for my this is series is excellent the combination of suspense and comedy with some parts of urban legends i mind this series got it all
B001CZJKS0|5.0|Granted most Horror fans already own these films, but it's cool to have Halloween (extended, DVD, Blue-Ray) H4 and H5 all in one set with a cool Myers mask in the middle of the box.  Great gem to pick up to bring back the joy of Halloween.  This set arrived just in time, awesome!  All we need now is a full fledged boxset of all the Halloween films like the Nightmare On Elm Street box.  \m/
B000NTPDSW|5.0|If you happen to like the Godfather Trilogy, then you simply cannot own another copy of this movie. Go buy a Blu-ray player along with this movie. Its cinematic perfection.
