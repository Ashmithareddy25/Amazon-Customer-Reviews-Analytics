B00005JNJ7|5.0|Trey and Matt have topped themselves with this one.  Who knew they could be even more brilliant than others they've written before.  It just doesn't get any funnier than this!!!   <br /> <br />My fave things:  The puppet sex scenes produced projectile tears flying out of my eyes, the theme song's \\"America - F*** yeah!\\" chorus (especially when it slows down at the end) had me giggling for hours afterwards, and the Alec Baldwin song at the end just slayed me. <br /> <br />Cheers to Matt and Trey for making us laugh our tushes off and for supporting the war against terrorism.  For ONCE someone in Hollywood is speaking out against Michael Moore's propaganda b.s. - hooray for Matt and Trey!!!!
B00005JN4O|5.0|Ever since I was a little girl, Peter Pan has been my absolute favorite literary character, and now, as an aspiring writer (especially in the children's genre), I have begun to truly admire J.M. Barrie's work in a completely different way.  I went into this film with very high expectations, both for the story and for the performances of two of my favorite actors, Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet.  I was in no way disappointed.  Depp's performance was, as Peter would say in the film, \\"magical.\\"  He gave Mr. Barrie a childlike quality that made his creation of the character of Peter Pan inevitable.  Winslet, as usual, evoked so much emotion with just a look that it was no use for me to try not to cry.  I never thought that the story got overly sentimental, Depp and the children gave too many laughs in their performances to allow that.  I was also fascinated by the looks into Barrie's imagination throughout the film.  This not only provided some wonderfully striking images, but it lent itself perfectly to the creation of Peter Pan and his Neverland.  Overall, this was a beautiful film with stellar performances by both Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp.  I recommend this to any child, aged 0-99.
0767834739|5.0|the first resident evil movie was a real horror master but resident evil apocolypes is something else. this film has a lot more style in it and it reaveled more secrets. the director also did a great job in capturing some of the games scenes. now, this takes place were the first film left of, the people at umbrella have reopen the hive and the virus along with the zombies, mutant dogs, and lickers excape. in less then 13 hours all of racoon city is in shambles. we then learn of the women from the first movies name. ALice awakes in a hospitale and finds that something is wrong with her. she is infected with the t-virus but isen't a zombie, they mutated her. she is the joined by jill valantine (from the resident evil game) and other survivers. now with a entire city full of zombie, mutante dogs, and lickers they now must fight for there lives and escape the city before sunrise, at sunrise umbrella will destroy all of racoon city to barry its dark secret. also Alice must fight a new biogenice weapon called Nemises, a zombie more powerful then the licker and twice as deadlier. in order for them to excape they must find Angela, the daughter of dr. ashford. who made the t-virus. this movie was really worth the wait, it has more action, more thrills, and more effects then ever, see the next big zombie movie.
B00005MIZ5|4.0|Tracks 1 - 9: Thelonious Monk - piano, Sahib Shihab - alto sax, Milt Jackson - vibes, Al McKibbon - bass, Art Blakey - drums. Recorded on 7/23/51.<br /><br />Tracks 10 - 18: Thelonious Monk - piano, Kenny Dorham - trumpet, Lou Donaldson - alto sax, Lucky Thompson - tenor sax, Nelson Boyd - bass, Max Roach - drums. Recorded on 5/30/52.<br /><br />This is one of the great documents of Thelonious Monk's unique (and totally engaging) style and vision. I almost considered giving this 4 stars for no other reason than I know that the Rouse band is probably more popular/familiar for most people, but I just couldn't. This is five stars all the way.<br /><br />Actually, seeing a previous review (after writing mine) has made me slip this note in here and drop it down to 4. I don't have that '48 session! That IS a good question... if it can fit on here, why isn't it on here? Although, for what IS here, it's still a 5-star disc.<br /><br />I wonder whether this review will be mainly read by longtime Monk fans, or by people who are new to him. For those of you who know his stuff... everything that is Monk... it's all here. This is a fantastic disc! For those of you who are new to him but have other jazz discs... you're in for a treat. No one elses music moves like Monk's moves. Everything about him stands alone. Once you get acquainted with his music, his rhythms, melodies (of his tunes), and piano playing will be instantly recognizable to you because, like I said... his music has its own distinct sense of movement.<br /><br />That off-kilter sense of bouncy, swinging thrust that Dolphy's music has... it's due in part to his fascination with our man right here, Monk.<br /><br />I love this disc, and the fact that it's by 2 different bands is really nice. You get to hear that Monk Vision as filtered through the lenses of 2 distinct bands. As for which band I prefer, it just depends on my mood. Both bands have it! As for this disc, you should have it!
B00005JL3A|5.0|i first saw this movie at the video store and decided to rent it and it was mind blowing. unlike other horror films this one had a plot. the sequences were really inventive and the danger was almost real. any way, the film starts in the hive, a underground reaserch lab beneath racoon city. a women then wakes up with her memory completly earased. then a team of cammandos comes in a briefs her. saying about five hours ago the red queen (the super computer that controls the hive) goes homicidle and locks up the hive, killing everyone down there. they reopen it to shut down the red queen but when they shut her down and she reboots...something happens that isent in the plan. they find out the t-virus, a genetic mutating weapon, was realeased into the air vents and the entire staff was infected. then they became flesh eating zombies. they then find out that umbrella (the company in charge of the hive) was really doing military tactics, genatic reaserch, and viral weaponry. now the team must escape the hive and reach the surface in under 3 hours or they are done for. see this movie, it will leave you flabergasted.
B0006399FS|4.0|I really enjoy and laugh when I hear U2 has sold out on this one. For all you new listeners U2 sold out and has been admiting this since 1991. Since the ridiculous and crazy Achtung baby with the mirrorball man, corney zooropa military uniforms. U2 is and has been commercial and overload of images and commercializm. <br />     This record is great and time will show it. To say though that albums like Achtung baby were perfect is crazy. I love that album but like all U2 albums there live performances are much better. Consider the live \\"Love is Blindless\\" awesome performance. The album version was released before they could complete the song and left a middle section were the Edge just boringly and uncreativly strums the same note over and over. Switch to the live version and in the same spot is a nice guitar solo. Same can be said for the song \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\". Ok this was released on the great epic Joshua Tree. So tell me why the song just plainly was boring on the album. Later they would complete this song. Listen to that same song live in concert and you will find one of rock's little secrets! <br />     So I guess my point is the album is great as it stands but like all U2 albums, U2 has never captured there music to disc in its final form. Wait for the concerts and then the live recordings to see these masters at work. <br />     Sold out! I'm still laughing. U2 sold out on the Joshua tree way back in 1987, or so thats what I remember hearing then and now. U2 has been consistanly selling the crazy, absurd, commercializm....with all its make-up faced characters...lemons..spray painted cars...atomic bombs. I tell you they will go down as one of the best.
0671027387|4.0|Wow, I read this book on reccomendation of a friend and I am happy that I did. Not only does this fictional story come across very realistically, it also has some great twists and surprises toward the end. Although slow moving at times, it is a quick read and will get you hooked in no time. The characters are very well developed and it is interesting how some people change ( Gabrielle Ashe, for example ) and some never change ( Sexton ). Pick this book up right now!
B00068IOWM|1.0|I won't write about the album itself. Rather I'm gonna talk about Collector's edition. <br /> <br />Don't expect an actual collector's edition ( if you're a Genesis or Pink Floyd fan then you really know what is a collector's edition ) cause it isn't. The \\"book\\" is just filled silly drawings. Not even lyrics nor photos nor history... NOTHING !!!. 48 pages of emptyness. <br /> <br />The same thing happen with the filler bonus DVD. More and more commercials from a band who is lost and gone away by selling out to the i Tunes. Who need the same songs played twice ? why not more different tunes instead ? <br /> <br />Shame on U2.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|Whether you have \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" in the new Hybrid SACD version, the non-SACD CD remaster, a vinyl LP, or an 8-track tape from 1977, this is a great album. All the remixes this album has undergone may make the album sound better or different, but none of them can heighten the brilliance of the songwriting. \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" shines regardless of the latest \\"remix\\" or \\"version\\" designed to keep the music biz in the money.<br /><br />The lyrics deal mostly with lost or frustrated love, bizarre relationships, and regret. Subsequently, a feeling of melancholy pervades the songs. Sparse instrumentation emphasizes this feeling: Acoustic guitars, harmonica, slight drums, hammond organ here and there, and Dylan's vocals soaring over the mix. For some Dylan fans, the acoustic aura of the album led them to claim a rebirth for Dylan. He seemed to be returning to his \\"roots\\" after years of \\"meddling\\" with rock rhythyms and electric instrumentation. Many who heard the album, though, were not around for Dylan's beginnings and didn't care. They just liked the songs. Today, each new generation rediscovers this album from early 1975. Its intimacy, sound, lyrics, and melodies account for this.<br /><br />By 1975, according to Dylan's \\"Chronicles, Vol. 1\\", Dylan sought 5escape from the legendary status that grew around him (some even called him \\"messiah\\" and \\"savior\\"). He wanted to make albums, but shunned the role of revolutionary or leader of a social movement. 1970's \\"New Morning\\" featured lyrics that would dissuade any reading of \\"secret messages\\" or \\"political undertow\\". \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" continues in this vein. The only thing even remotely political here is the vitriolic \\"Idiot Wind\\". To his credit, Dylan managed to keep his chart status while alientating himself from those who called him to \\"action\\" (at one time his main fan base). \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" became a hit, and the album sold very well. On top of that, Dylan took voice lessons before the recording sessions and used very unorthodox guitar tunings. This created a new sound, one that obviously resonated, and still resonates, with many.northodox guitar tunings. This created a new sound, one that obviously resonated, and still resonates, with many.
081616598X|4.0|Graham Greene makes good use of his keen eye for human foibles in ``The Human Factor.'' Greene and John Le Carre are the masters of telling stories of intelligence agencies where intelligence is the thing usually most lacking. <br />This compelling tale centers on Maurice Castle and his black African wife, Sarah. Castle, an aging Briton, fell in love with Sarah, one of his agents in South Africa. Maurice helps Sarah evade capture by the apartheid-era South African police. Sarah and her son are smuggled to England where she sets up house with Maurice, who pretends to be the child's father. <br />Maurice continues working in the British Foreign Office. He hopes being a continent removed will mean safety and security for his family. But, as with many of Greene's superbly drawn characters, the past continues its encroachment on the present. <br />Human bungling and caprice causes a wrongful death. Maurice's serene journey to his pension is interrupted and he must act again to save his family. <br />The plot takes a few surprise turns (including a startling revelation by a communist agent and the reason why the seemingly useless information from Africa was important after all) before Maurice has to confront the most implacable foe of a man of secrets -- loneliness. <br />Published in 1978, ``The Human Factor'' is for spy readers who are interested in more than an Ian Fleming trollop. The book is an intelligent meditation on love and secrecy and the sacrifices demanded by both.
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|Paul Simon followed up the classic Graceland, his fusion of African and Western pop music with this stunning album of great songs with a South American and more particularly Brazilian flavour. This reissue includes four previously unreleased tracks.<br /><br />The Obvious Child is my favorite, a powerful melodic song with great drums and guitars and a wistful, nostalgic feel. Another favorite is The Coast, a story about a family of musicians taking shelter in a church; this song really impresses with its flowing melody, polyrhythmic drum patterns and moving lyrics.<br /><br />Proof is another charming pop song, particularly noted for its evocative backing vocals and gentle, lilting rhythm whilst Further To Fly and She Moves On are more subdued, melancholy numbers with bubbling and insistent rhythmic patterns.<br /><br />The mood lifts with the uptempo and buoyant Born At The Right Time, once again a lyrical and musical masterpiece and filled with catchy hooks. The guitar and atmospheric backing voices of Spirit Voices are beyond compare whilst the title track is a meandering piece with innovative instrumental flourishes.<br /><br />What makes these songs particularly moving is that Simon tells the stories of ordinary people and that his perceptive, poetic lyrics are carried so well on the exotic instrumentation. Of course, the beautiful tunes have a lot to do with that. Rhythm Of The Saints may not be as immediately appealing as Graceland and may not offer quite as many classics, but it remains a major achievement, a brilliant marriage of Brazilian and Western popular musical styles.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|This is perhaps one of the greatest animations ever -- and a DVD release with one of the WORST English subtitles in the history of home video. I'm not sure what brainless moron at DreamWorks Home Entertainment put together the release for this DVD, but DreamWorks has done a disservice to the American animation community and Ghost In the Shell's creators. <br /> <br />I only hope that DreamWorks will own up to their horrible mistake of mislabeling their DVD box to say it includes Closed Captioning AND English subtitles, because this is false advertising. This DVD ONLY contains the Closed Captioning which makes it impossible to watch for a hearing audience. <br /> <br />Purchase this DVD (and any future DreamWorks animations) at your own risk because they are obviously cutting corners in search of making money rather than providing the public with a quality product. Very very disappointing.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|This seamless blend of African pop and American folk styles is one of the most exquisite musical achievements of the 20th century. The melodies are beautiful, the voices divine, and each and every one of the tracks is a classic.  This extended version contains alternate takes of three songs.<br /><br />The best loved songs include The Boy In The Bubble, Graceland, Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes and Under African Skies, but the rest hold great charm too. The most rootsy African sounds surface on I Know What I Know with the soulful vocal infusions of The Gaza Sisters.<br /><br />Paul Simon has always successfully integrated exotic sounds in his music to create great beauty: Andean flutes in El Condor Pasa, reggae in Me And Julio Down By The School Yard and in Mother & Child Reunion, and Latin/South American sounds in Rhythm Of The Saints, but Graceland is his towering achievement as a solo artist, a truly exceptional album with a power and beauty that transcends all musical boundaries.
B00005JMJG|2.0|The premise is intriguing. Girl gets tired of a declining relationship and has all memory of boyfriend erased. Boyfriend finds out and decides he can't live with that: gets himself erased as well. In the middle of the procedure, which he experiences as a kind of dream, he becomes lucid, realizes what's going on and decides he doesn't want this to happen. But it's too late; despite all his efforts his memory is erased. Fate in the shape of an accidental post-erasure meeting and the other actions of other characters involved twists the plot around and brings them together again.<br /><br />The cast: a director's dream. Jim Carrey, Kate Winslett, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo. How can you go wrong? Well, you can, and something did. I've been trying to work out what, because there are so many factors that nuked this movie.<br /><br />First of all what went right: Carrey and the rest of the cast were amazing, even if most of them never got a chance to actually evince what you might call 'depth of character'.  Carrey and Winslett do get that chance in the first part, where 'Joel' and 'Clementine' meet again, and those few minutes alone make the movie worth watching; after that it's mostly downhill: the story falls apart in the same way that 'Being John Malkovich' ultimately does, except that here at least the story has somewhere to go, though the writer, director and editor seem to have no idea about how to get there, but ultimately fumble themselves through to an ending.<br /><br />There were some elements with incredible potential: for example the whole dream-like erasure process, with the built-in flashes of lucidity, followed by lapses back into non-awareness. Anybody who's had lucid dreams will recognize the process. Then there's what amounts to a mental chase and battle of wits, as Joel tries to hide his memories in places where the hi-tech backed pursuit cannot find it. The whole thing throws up a whole plethora of troublesome questions related to cognitive research and philosophy, and especially the nature of 'identity'. The suffocating predicament Joel got himself into (by surrendering control of his mind to someone else) and can't get himself our of. The twists and turns of contingency as, despite all this, it all appears to turn out all right.<br /><br />The flaw at the heart of this movie is that someone forgot what story to tell, and instead tried to tell too many, and in the process the movie lost its soul. The editing completed the job that the directing started. It was so VISIBLE as to become detrimental to the actors: in its contrived cleverness it erased much of the depth they could have brought to the characters. Sometimes I had the feeling that there actually WAS something more to this moment or that; but then it usually got zapped, as if the editor was chasing that precious something down like Stan was doing to Joel's memories.<br /><br />The cinematography was trying to be so clever that one could almost touch it. In conjunction with the awful editing, almost every 'cut-to' became a painful jarring of this viewer's attempt to relate to the story and the characters, and made the thing into a cinematographic, rather than an emotional experience.<br /><br />Without this, maybe the other problems of the movie would have been non-existent. I don't know, because the movie is as it is, and we can play 'what if' games forever and speculate into a vacuum. But I'd like to think that maybe in the hands of someone less keen to 'make a movie' and more interested in people and telling a story, we might actually have some emotional understanding of why Joel and Clementine needed to be together, and why it was right that in the end they were. Don't misunderstand me: give me ANY reason for an upbeat ending and I'll embrace it joyfully. So why, in this instance, did I feel that the ending was tacked-on, contrived, artificial? The back-together-despite-all-the-odds simply rings false, if only because the only reason why they are iscontingency, sheer dumb luck, twists of fate. They get a second chance and maybe they'll work it out this time. But did they do anything to earn it? In particular, did Clementine, who evinces no sign of actually thinking that there was something wrong with her method to opt out of a situation with the minimum of pain? Do these people actually love each other, and if they do, is that love enough or shown as even indicatively sufficient to bridge the gap they've created in their past and through their actions of surrendering their power of their minds to someone else?<br /><br />Finally, there is something offensive about the general attitude by director and editor towards the actors: in this case a dream-cast, whose potential was mostly edited out of existence. There is a school of film-makers who see actors as a kind of cinematographic element, like a piece of landscape or a prop. As long as they perform the correct motions and say the right things at some time or during some take, there's probably a way to edit it together so that it looks right. That's OK if the actors actually need such treatment. There is another school who believes that actors are to be considered not just essential, but next to the director the dominant visible participants in any decent story-telling process. To demean them into becoming just pieces in a mosaic of self-important film-making is degrading. That Carrey, Winslett and the rest of the cast still manage to shine is a testimony to their professionalism and consummate skill. That aspect was the one truly bright spark in an otherwise disappointing flick.<br /><br />Till Noever, Author: KEAEN, [...]<br /><br />2/5 purely because of the actorsthey are is contingency, sheer dumb luck, twists of fate.

B00005JNBQ|2.0|I will give it that those of you who live in the BYU, BYU-I, Utah, or Idaho communities, there are some wonderful gags.  Napolean wearing a Ricks College T-shirt and shopping in a DI are wonderful.  I also give it credit for being PG and not using offensive language. <br /> <br />But beyond that, if you like stories with a plot, you'll hate this movie.  If you like stories with a resolution, you'll hate this movie.  If you like movies where the characters have good distinct personalities, you probably won't like this movie.  If you dislike barely defined mellodrama, you probably won't like this movie. <br /> <br />Half of the movie has you scratching your head as you wonder what decade their living in; your brain keeps debating whether it's the 80s or the 90s (of course I realize that's making fun of Idaho, but it doesn't make it totally clear).  I guess what I'm saying is if all your friends want you rush out and see it and you weren't that interested in it in the first place, it won't rock your world.

I cannot stress this enough!!! It's like a very bad virus. You will be sitting in your office at work or desk at school and hear some kid ask \\"What are you going to do today, Napoleon?\\" to which someone replies \\"Whatever I feel like, gosh!\\" It's insanely annoying how much people quote this movie.

B000001DYY|5.0|I bought it for \\"Break it down Again,\\" and proceeded, of course, to listen to that cut untill my cassette wore itself ragged. Then one day I realized I paid for an entire album and started listening to the rest. I consider it the musical equivalent of comfort food. I wore the rest of the cassette ragged and haven't bought it on CD since. <br /> <br />Every time I think about the fact that I don't own it anymore, I die a little inside. The cassette is still in my old car. Seriously, what a perfect album. Listening to the little snippets on amazon right now has got me bouncing down memory lane. Grows on you like a bad rash. I will buy it today.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Cold Mountain is not just any war movie.  It is a war movie that not only shows the Civil War in a real light, a harrowing bloodbath, but also manages to weave a heartwrenching love story into it.  Inman, played by Jude Law, gives up fighting in the war and makes the long journey home to his sweetheart (Nicole Kidman).  Over the years the two lovers are apart, life becomes difficult and dangerous, and they fear they will never reunite. <br /> <br />This movie features excellent acting on the parts of the main characters (Law, Kidman, and Zellweger) and also by the not-so-main characters.  It is very easy to become engrossed in this movie and to really feel sympathy for the characters' struggles.  <br /> <br />The scenes of war and the senseless killing and hatred will stick in your mind, as will the Inman's grueling journey home to his love, and their subsequent reunion. <br /> <br />If you love an emotional love story combined with a historical war story setting, you should watch this movie.
B00005JMJG|3.0|I would be telling untruths if I were to say that I enjoyed this film.  Regrettably, it did not live up to my expectations.  This view being despite the fact that its screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, was responsible for \\"Being John Malkovich\\", a wonderfully magic yet funny film that I rate very highly.  \\"Spotless Mind\\" is a very different film in that it tried to take itself much too seriously.<br /><br />Over the years, it has been my observation that Jim Carrey, the lead in \\"Spotless Mind\\", is more highly regarded in America than he is elsewhere.  Americans seem to regard him as a genius while non-Americans see him as largely a slapstick actor.  I fall into this latter category.  Carrey's role is not one of humour in this role, yet he still fails to capture the imagination.  His hype precedes him.<br /><br />In brief, the film covers a process whereby one's immediate memory of a particular person or event can be erased.  Carrey's girlfriend, played by Kate Winslet, has the procedure down to eradicate Carrey (Joel) from her memory.  In retaliation, Joel does the same for his girlfriend.  In the middle of the process, however, he has second thoughts and tries to reverse or evade the changes.  He desperately tries to cling to his lover.  His memories become precious.  Identity tries to override deceit and revenge.<br /><br />I am very glad that I have now seen this film if only to understand other people's views.  However, I am unable to encourage others to follow my lead.

0783110871|4.0|Yes, the plot is stupid.  Yes the cast is less than stellar (other than Liotta), yes you've seen others like this before...OR HAVE YOU?<br /><br />Turbulence is a great ride from start to finish because it IS so predictable; you don't have to pay that close of attention and think too hard to get the plot but it is suspensful and a kick to watch Lauren Holly's character grow in her own self-confidence by the end of the film.  At the beginning of the film she's the weak little blonde who lets men walk all over her.  By the end she's a flight attendant who kicks butt.<br /><br />Liotta, as always, does a great job portraying his character.  As Ryan Weaver, a serial killer, he did his homework on the nuances that make \\"serials\\" serials.  He uses his good looks and natural charm to get women to trust him, uses his brain to take advantage of a great situation in his favor, is  emotionally manipulative, and then masterfully becomes a complete psycho all in the blink of an eye.  Probably one of the best portrayals of a serial killer I've seen on the big screen for a long time.<br /><br />Without spoiling the \\"big\\" moments in the film I will say that what happens to Catherine Hicks'(Child's Play, Star Trek IV, tv's 7th Heaven) character is a shame (sad, actually), one of the funniest moments of the film (in a sicko kind of way) is when Liotta \\"decorates\\" the plane with some of the passengers, and the ending is pretty schlocky and cheesy.<br /><br />But all in all, I was certainly rooting for Lauren Holly's stewardess (sorry, \\"she's a flight attendant\\") when she outdoes Karen Black (Airport '77) by a mile in finally landing the plane and basically telling the officials on the ground to go to hell!<br /><br />The photography is decent, a few of the special effects very cool, and there are a few real decent laughs along with a little gore.  Oh, and you will never watch \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" in the same light again!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Ah the superior thinking of Network television bigwigs.  Here was one of the best series' I have ever seen on television, (US TV that is) and the network know-it-alls had to sabotage it.  First they did not allow the amazing Mr Whedon to present it in the order that he developed it, so not many people got attached because they didn't understand the characters or situation. Very unfortunate.  And then for those starved for decent sci-fi, that were getting into the series, they yanked it off the screen.  I feel like Oliver, Please sir, may I have MORE?  <br /> <br />The writing was fabulous.  My father and uncle both are screenwriters and were very impressed.  The acting was great and you could tell that they liked each other and the project.  Sigh.  Maybe someday it will replay on the sci-fi channel.  Maybe if I wish really hard, someone will take the sci-fi genre seriously and realize that there is a demographic out there that will make someone some money if they put something this good on the tube and leave it there.  Gee, Star Trek was almost cancelled and look what happened to it.  This could have easily gone that far.  Have fun with it.
B0000009RX|5.0|This album is pretty much the complete opposite of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper: absolutely dripping with sarcasm and cynicism.  Although all the hippie bashing seems a bit dated and unneeded now, it is still an interesting alternate view on the 60s.  I think What's the Ugliest Part of Your Body? is the best track on the album, just for the last line that totally hits you and makes you think.  It also features some interesting and odd studio techniques that add to the sarcasm of the music.  I wouldn't get rid of the chipmunk voices if I had a chance! Zappa's sound and tape manipulations are interesting also.   <br /> <br />After reading and considering some other less enthusiastic reviews of this album that point you in the direction of Zappa's later albums, I felt I needed to say that Zappa's best work was done with the Mothers of Invention, when everyone in the band was pretty much at an equal status, playing because they wanted to be in a band and not just to play with the almighty Frank Zappa.  Zappa's later albums, while they're pretty rockin', also carry Zappa's continuously inflated ego, as he barks out random and over-silly nonsense some people call \\"intelligent criticism\\".  He was just proving a point that the public will buy any junk they're told to buy, and he was successful in conveying that, let's move on!  If you want silly and pretentious, go for his later stuff, but if you want silly and pretentious with a heart and soul, go for the Mothers stuff.  Most of his orchestral work and Lumpy Gravy is excellent, too.
B00000K3D4|5.0|...I have found that other reviewers have pretty much covered everything concerning the movie's plot and detail, yet I still have at least one thought to add:<br /><br />- This can be an educational tool.<br /><br />In my Myth and Legends class, we were able to watch it by applying the Greek tale of the Minotaur, Theseus, and the Labirynth. I've heard some have been able to watch it in psychology classes because of the metaphorical environments and maturing Sarah's perspectives.
B000002H2Z|5.0|I was 16 and listening to rap music in 1988, when I heard this \\"cassette\\" in a friends car.  Six Different Ways and Close to Me hit home in a major way, and I left my Public Enemy and Run-DMC cassettes behind. Bought Disintegration when it came out the following May and my musical taste was turned on it's ear.  I worked my way forward and back, and 16 years later, the Cure are still my favorite band.  If asked what my favorite Cure CD's are, Disintegration and Head on the Door are the top of the heap.   <br />As many reviewers have mentioned, this is a good place to start.  Disintegration is genius from start to finish, and maintains a dark mood.  But this CD has plently of pop, spanish guitar on the Blood, six different ways is a waltz.  This record flows through many musical styles, but is a very coherent and fluid listen, and would give a good introduction to The Cure, and their experimentation, and often mastery of various styles of music.   <br />This CD was the Cure hitting their stride, especially in the US, and is a must have for any Cure fan, or fan of great music in general. <br />
0451191153|5.0|Ayn Rand was probably the 20th century's most profound American philosopher, and the best female philosopher who has ever lived. Her ideas are startling and powerful. However, chances are many people go through their entire life without ever hearing her name. Strange, isn't it?    The reason is because Ayn Rand has a philosophy of individualism. She believes people should think for themselves independently. Doesn't sound like anything scary, does it?    Pre-Internet, you probably never even heard the name Ayn Rand. That's because the media establishment controlled everything - television, magazines, radio - you name it. Ideas were in the hands of a few. Do yourself a favor and read \\"The Fountainhead\\". It's a manual for being a real human being.
0790729407|4.0|Michael Collins is a fine historical film that essentially captures the life and times of the Irish hero who founded the Irish Republican Army and became the first man since George Washington to force the British Empire to the negotiating table.  The production values are very high and the acting is very good.  There are a few liberties taken with historical accuracy but most of these are for dramatic effect and do not detract from the overall historical perspective of the film.   <br /> <br />The film has gained additional importance since 9/11 and for this reason should be viewed by all Americans concerned with our current conflict in the Middle East.   There is no way of getting around the fact that Michael Collins was a terrorist and that he founded the first modern terror organization.  The film can be used as a study of how terror can successfully be used to obtain political ends, in this case independence for Ireland.  It also demonstrates just how difficult it is to defeat an insurrection of this kind, even for the greatest military power on Earth.  The film thus becomes a very important warning for the American public, and policy makers in Washington, concerning our current war in Iraq.  Collins is presented as a sympathetic character who most Americans will root for; certainly not a bad guy like Osama bin Laden.  But remember, there are a large number of people in the world, especially in the Asia, for whom Osama is a sympathetic hero.  Both he and Collins fight the same kind of war against similar enemies.  Will Osama, like Collins, win in the end?  I certainly hope not, but then I am speaking from the perspective of a 21st century American.  And if I were an early 20th century Englishman or American, having just fought a bloody world war to make the world safe for democracy,  I certainly might have regarded Collins as representing the antithesis of my values.   <br /> <br />So my advice is definitely to view Michael Collins.  It is an excellent and exciting action film with a very sympathetic hero who was largely responsible for founding the Republic of Ireland.  But then keep in mind that we are now engaged in a life and death struggle with enemies that have similar aims, use similar tactics, and, like Collins, will stop at nothing to achieve their ends.   <br /> <br />A little bit about my own background, I am a non-Irish American (unless you go back about 300 years) who has lived and traveled in Ireland and has close ties with that country.  I have also read a great deal of Irish history.  I think this gives me a different perspective on Ireland's conflict with the British Empire from someone who is either Irish or from a family recently immigrated from Ireland.  Having read the other Amazon reviews of this movie, I am somewhat amused with those (few) who seem to have hated it.  They seem to fall into two major categories.  The first are the die-hard Sinn Fein-IRA types who cannot forgive Collin's compromise with the British.  The other categories are those die-hard Unionists who cannot forgive the fact that Collins beat the British Empire!  Get a grip guys!
B00005JMUL|5.0|I have to say I loved this movie as much as I did the book when I was young.  This is a simple heartwarming story about Christmas spirit and believing in Santa.  Please take this movie at face value and you will enjoy it much more.  As far as santa looking like a prophet...he is simply \\"designed\\" to look like the actor who does his voice, nothing more.   <br />My 2 1/2 year old loved this story and was particularly fond of the train animation and the great music.  I for one ADORED the mix of both OLD and NEW christmas songs.  We could not have asked for a better Christmas time movie!
B00004ZAV3|2.0|What I have realized since I started listening to the Beatles albums, is their commercial single releases suck for the most part. Add to that EMI'S Monetary greed. to keep rehasing the same old songs time and time again. And you have a very unappealing album. The best Beatles songs were never single hits.    IN MY LIFE  TAXMAN  AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING  TOMMOROW NEVER KNOWS  GETTING BETTER   A DAY IN THE LIFE  DEAR PRUDENCE  HELTER SKELTER  GLASS ONION  BIRTHDAY  SOMETHING  COME TOGETHER      Those 12 songs are real Beatles classics. Only a few on ones are worthy. like Paperback Writer & Eleanor Rigby...
006441034X|5.0|Sophie Hatter is the eldest of her sisters and in the land of Ingary, if you were born first, you would be destined to fail first. One day, Sophie's mother decides that she would have to settle all of her three daughters in apprentichip somewhere since there father had died and they were running low on money.  She set's up Martha with the local witch to learn magic because Martha is the youngest and her fortune will most likely be grander if she learns from a witch.  She than sets up Lettie in a bakery where she would be bound to \\"meet handsome young apprentices and live happily every after\\". That leaves Sophie, the eldest and least likely to succeed.  Mother decides to take Sophie in as her own apprentice for her Hat Shop.  At first, Sophie tries to make herself happy by puting all her energy in making and decorating hats but soon, she begins to feel very depressed at how dull her life is looking.  She believes that she will never leave the hatshop and will grow old and withered without having any adventures of her own.  She begins talking to the hats she makes and as the days pass, she becomes more and more of a recluse.  However, one day, a powerful witch enters her Hat Shop and for some reason or other curses her and she becomes an old lady.  This event sets Sophie on a new path, in which she encounters more magic and adventure than she thought an eldest daughter could ever have.   <br /> <br />Diana Wynne Jones writes out the very funny, odd, magical adventure of Sophie as she determines to seek out her fortune and break the curse before it is too late.  This book was a startlingly interesting read for me, as I thought this book would be boring since it seemed to be written for a younger reader.  However, I found this book surprisingly and uniquely fun and I throughly enjoyed Sophie's wonderfully entertaining adventure.  I especially liked the character of Calcifer and Howl, and there strange bargain of a relationship. I definitely recommend this book, to readers everwhere.  If I couldn't help but read the book at in one sitting, it must be pretty enthralling. So read it!
B000000W5N|5.0|The Stones are totally amazing both on record and live. They seem to go forever. And this is one of their finest. Worth the money just for Brown Sugar & Wild Horses..
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I thought this movie was such a good movie i sorta feel guilty in saying that this movie is better than Return Of The King but in some ways it is......the battles are thought out and carefully crafted and the stroy is top notch.....it is truely a captivating story that keeps you on the edge of your seat if you like movies such as Gladiator then you will fall in love with Troy.......Critics bashed this film but i really don't see why this movie is a modern day Masterpiece that will be remembered years from now.......Two Thumbs Up
B00000DHZJ|5.0|I am just getting into Jimi Hendrix. And this compilation of his best work was recommended to me by a friend. Its truly wonderful, and shows why Jimi is the best guitarist ever. Little wing is so beautiful. People who only know Jimi for his power playing need to hear this. All along the Watchtower is also another favorite. Really worth the money. I really recommend this album, if you want to hear a legend at his best.
B00005JMXX|1.0|This is the stinkiest movie I have ever, ever seen, with the possible exception of Signs. This movie stinks. I was expecting lots of action, shooting, and people blasting away at ice. No. Most of it is just geeks sitting around in a library talking about their little lives. I mean, that's cool and all, but it thought this was supposed to be an ACTION MOVIE!  <br />I don't like the little romantic story that the writers HAD to add to attract teenage girls. Can't you have ONE movie without that claptrap thrown in? You might like this movie if you are a 14 year old geeky girl, who actually understands what theyr'e talking about half the movie, and will dig all that mushy goo-goo crap. Don't see this piece of garbage. It ain't worth your time or money.
B00006AG5N|1.0|Elvis was never the king of rock and roll. That would be Little Richard. Elvis was lame compared to Richard. And this collection only re-inforces that fact. The King of Country Ballads maybe. But ROCK AND ROLL NEVER. If Elvis had looked like Roy Orbison he would've been long forgotten...
B0006284JQ|1.0|Her last CD was heavy breathing and giggling, just enough to hold the still-with-pimples set.  THIS is scraping the bottom of my shoe.  Truly junk
B00008H2LB|1.0|This is not punk! This is not metal! This is not Rock! This is barely music!
B00063MBU8|5.0|If Simple Plan thinks they are still not getting any, then they must be lost. They are deffiently getting a lot with this new CD/DVD combo. The songs are all wonderfully wonderful. Its a nice sequel to their very famous \\"NO Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls\\". Simple plan has lyrics that are perfect for any teenager, allowing them to rock out, too. The DVD has many great features, but I personally like the making of \\"Still Not Getting Any....\\". The new cd has three different covers and since I loved it sooooo much I got all three!
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin and Gods. Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones, and the late John Bonham are all extremely talented musical geniouses. <br /> <br />Black Dog: overated in my opinion 9/10 <br />Rock and Roll: one of the best songs on the CD. 9.5/10 <br />The Battle of Evermore: soft and very cool sounding about LOTR (Helm's Deep) 9.5/10 <br />Stairway to Heaven: classic best song ever made! 100/10 <br />Misty Mountain Hop: Unique sound to it very cool intro. 9/10 <br />Four Sticks: Cool guitar on this track 9/10 <br />Going to California: another calming and soft track. 9/10 <br />When The Levee Breaks: Great way to end the record 9.5/10 <br /> <br />There is no bad track on this album. Worth every Penny!
0064407667|4.0|Good, very well written in a way that holds your attention and thus making it into a quick read. One can tell that it is different in being a bit more darker than other \\"children's\\" fantasies( with the exception of Harry Potter). I like its Gothic-like feel to it, which only seems to add to its charm. Its also a bit more intelligent than other c.f. ,also(except HP). <br />   It is good to see a new,fresh take on the story of orphans in a fantasical-like world come up and be this good. Can't wait to read the rest in the series!
B00005RHGL|5.0|I've seen this movie a bunch of times. Doc Holiday steals this movie. Also I saw a review that says that when Doc dies he says \\"This is Funny\\" because he sees the light. NOT TRUE!!! He says that because most cowboys die with their boots on and he was not wearing his.
B00000JZC4|5.0|This album is much more lively than Filters previous album Short Bus, being that is was a much more darker album. \\"Welcome to the Fold\\" is probably my favorite song of all time\\". This is one of the few CD's that I can listen to all the way through and be completly happy with it. This album took over my life, i frickin' love it. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I Loved them before, I Love them even more now... I Love a Band that doesnt stop trying to be so...\\"Perfect\\", at least at what they do that is. You can definitely tell that the guys have been working at it... Their last album was hot... I Loved it... I never found anything wrong with it... but this one definitely takes the cake.... heres my personal review for Simple Plan or just pop/punk-fans:    1. Shut Up! -They start off the Album with a song that'll definitely get your attention... Its simply about that one person in your life you really wish would Shut up and mind their own buisness. (9/10)  2. Welcome To My Life - Their first single... we can all relate, need I say more! (9/10)  3. Perfect World -You ever just thought... \\"dammit, if the world were perfect, everything would go my way\\"??? well apparently, so did they:-)   (9/10)  4. Thank You  -This ones about a best friend that stabs you in the back and so you just wanna let them know that they can shove it! (8/10)  5. Me Against The World - I Like this one... the guitar tracks on this one are nice... I Looooooooooove it... I didnt say they were any Aerosmith or Nirvana... but someones been practicing! (9/10)   6. Crazy - This is about people that kind-of conform to what society makes them believe is \\"right\\" and how people have gone \\"crazy\\" because they would do anything to impress others. (8/10)   7. Jump -My personal favorite... Frustrated... wanna burn off some steam... You can forget about your problems with this one and Just JUMP.... Definitely Punk-Rock!!!! (11/10)  8. Everytime  - He's depressed that some chick left him so now he's remembering her and he wants one more day with her really bad... cute song. (8/10)  9. Promise  - He definitely doesn't want his girl to walk away... so he's making some promises if she will stay... enough said! (8/10)  10. One  - This is one of those... \\"We are the world\\" type songs gone punk... but they made it work. (8/10)  11. Untitled  - This is definitely a great song,Its about when somehting , messed up happens in your life and your just like \\"Damn... how could this happen to me\\" The only odd thing is... I could almost swear I hit the country station just for a minute in the beginning... but truthfully and honestly.... the song is still hot... I love it. (11/10)    All in all, The guys of Simple Plan came back strong and I Love it, you'll love it too if you buy it... trust me:-)    And to anybody HATING my boys in S.P.... Get over it.... They are rich no matter what you think (your not)... They are cool and real as he** (your probably not)and if there's anyone confused about why they are Punk-rock... know this... Theres' pop/punk, punk-rock, street punk, and just straight up hard-core punk.... Leave the guys alone, they are young, having fun and they are more... pop/punk rock... DEAL WITH IT!!!    ~S.P. ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000687M48|5.0|\\"Anywhere But Home\\" is not only a fantastic set and a definite must have for any die hard Evanescence fan, but it goes to show that they sound just as good live as they do on a studio recording.  As I'm sure you're aware, this CD is a recording of their concert in Paris last spring, and also includes the unreleased (well, at least here in America anyway) studio recording of \\"Missing.\\"  The concert consists of every song from \\"Fallen\\" as well as \\"Farther Away,\\" which wasn't included on the album's American release, their new song \\"Breathe No More,\\" which will be on the upcoming Elektra soundtrack, and in my opinion the centerpiece of the recording, an amazing cover of Korn's \\"Thoughtless.\\"  If for no other reason, it's honestly worth buying this CD just for this song alone.  I actually prefer this version over the original.  It's a tremendous concert.  There's a particularly nice moment in \\"My Immortal\\" where Amy just plays and lets the audience sing.  My only minor critiques are that Amy definitely scrapes the bottom of her range on \\"Going Under,\\" and that she has a tendency to not enunciate the ends of words, but as I said those are just minor things. <br /> <br />As if the CD wasn't enough, \\"Anywhere But Home\\" also includes a bonus DVD which has a video recording of the concert, all four of their current music videos, and plenty of behind the scenes footage.  While the seizure-inducing videography of the concert leaves much to be desired (and that's putting it very nicely), it's great to be able to listen to it in 5.1 surround sound.  The music videos are great, and go to show that there are so many different ways to interpret their music.  But the best parts of the DVD are the behind the scenes footage, particularly the gag reel and the \\"Evanescence Unleashed\\" section.  They really go to show that they're not just fantastic musicians, but awesome people as well. <br /> <br />\\"Anywhere But Home\\" is an essential addition to any fan's collection.  It's a great way to satiate us fans as we wait for their next release.  The only thing better would be if they rereleased \\"Origin.\\"  Do yourself a favor, pick up a copy.  You won't be disappointed.
B0000026NC|1.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I am as hardcore as Pink Floyd fans come.  I own everything they've released, including most solo releases.  While I side mainly with Roger when it comes to the band's breakup, I am being totally unbiased by that in this review. <br /> <br />This live album is utter garbage.  How David Gilmour could have unleashed this on his fans is a mystery.  With the exception of \\"On the Turning Away\\" (better than the studio version) the songs here all sound horrible.  It pains me to say that, because Pink Floyd are a legendary live band.  I don't know what went wrong on this tour.  It doesn't help either that the first disc is loaded with 7 songs from 'A Momentary Lapse of Reason', the worst \\"Pink Floyd\\" album ever (and I put Pink Floyd in quotes for a reason).  And literally every non-AMLR track on here can be found on 'Pulse', which is infinitely superior.   <br /> <br />To sum up, don't buy this.  Unless you are the type of fan that absolutely MUST own every album.  Even then, get David and Roger's solo albums first.  And if you need live Pink Floyd check out either 'In the Flesh - Live' or 'Pulse'.
B000002LPD|5.0|For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge is great, what a way to kick off the 90's in none other than a Van Halen fashion. This is an album that's safe to say that their aren't any love ballads on it that only has pure rock written all over it. Unforuately, this would be the last awesome VH album of the 90's and the last time they were on top of the world. Anyway, lets get to the music because more than anything that's what matters most.    1. Poundcake- Rate: 10/10- Awesome period, with a power drill.    2. Judgment Day- Rate: 10/10- Awesome!!!!!!!!    3. Spanked- Rate: 6/10- Not so good but its worthy to be on the album, I think.    4. Runaround- Rate: 10/10- Great song bringing Van Halen back to the Roth- era.    5. Pleasure Dome- Rate: 9.5/10- Great song and if it wasnt for Alex's amazing drumming, this song would be lost, lol literally.    6. In 'n' Out- Rate: 8/10- Nice Upbeat song with a great guitar section.    7. Man on a Mission: 8.5/10- Great.    8. The Dream is Over- Rate: 9/10- Great song and an awesome guitar solo inbetween.    9. Right Now- Rate: 10/10- Awesome song and one of my favorite Van Halen songs ever!    10. 316- Rate: 7.5/10- A nice guitar solo for the birth of Eddie's son. (316 refers to March 16th)    11. Top of the World- Rate: 10/10- A fantastic way to wrap up the CD with nothing more than standing on top of the world.     Great album and one of my favorite VH albums although I wish they could of added Judgment Day, The Dream is Over, or maybe even In 'n' Out too. Nicely, done album.
B00005JLH3|2.0|DRUMLINE is one of the few teen movies made in the past few years that seems to actually have some intelligence behind it's writing. It doesn't rely on stupid humor or obscenity. Not that I have anything against either of those, I just don't like it when that's all a movie has going for it. The characters here are all realistic; the plot's a pretty good one; the acting's pretty decent. BUT, and this is what earns only a two star rating, the main character is THE most unlikeable 'hero' I've ever seen in a movie. He really is a huge jerk, and the characters I thought were right end up 'seeing the light' and agreeing with the hero in the end. He really did not deserve a spot on the drumline, and I was glad when he got kicked off. <br /> <br />But, really, I'm arguing semantics over a teen flick. If ya like it, I can't stop ya, you know. It's just not a movie for me. I'll just keep watching the old John Hughes movies.
B00011D1OA|5.0|I have to wonder what happened to the longer Academy Awards show footage that was on the Special Edition laser disc.   <br /> <br />(This excellent, new, two-disc DVD edition of MY FAIR LADY is, essentially, a reproduction of a big, expensive laser disc box set that came out in 1994.)  <br /> <br />That set featured several minutes of extra footage from the Oscar show (Joan Crawford presenting George Cukor the Best Director Award, and Cukor's acceptance speech; Audrey Hepburn giving the Best Actor Award to Rex Harrison, and Harrison's gracious acceptance; Gregory Peck giving out the Best Picture Oscar to Jack L. Warner). All that shows up on this new Special Edition DVD is Warner's brief words of thanks upon receiving his award.   <br /> <br />Also, three sequences on the Special Features disc (the Hollywood premiere footage, and the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Martin Scorsese bonus interviews) include a rather distracting time counter in the upper left hand corner of the screen, that runs through out the sequences (at least on my copy).  The very same footage on the laser disc was (mercifully) free of this annoyance.
B00068IOWC|5.0|I love U2 but not unconditionally, they have to earn it.  And with their newest recording How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, they touched my soul once again.  U2 has a distinct sound but have always grown or tried new directions.  With this album, it is almost coming back full circle.  I say \\"almost\\" becuase it echos back to the 80s riffs and the Rattle and Hum bluesy/dirty sound without being a repeat.  Don't be fooled, this album sounds grity, rich, and is sensual like velvet in ways their prior albums have not.  Ironically, I didn't like Vertigo when I first heard it.  Spend a little time with the album, it is worth the experience.
B0006399FS|3.0|that's the best i could come up with - it's ok.  'all that you can't leave behind' allowed me to forgive them for 'pop'...all i can say is thank god this album didn't come out after 'pop' or i would've given up.  i'm a fan of 20 years and count the early years as some of my favorites but you have to give props to a band who's willing to take risks and change...they couldn't grow up, raise families and not experience a little bit of change.  the music is fantastic on every song..the lyrics are a bit boring & forced on some of the songs.  with that said, htdaab is worth the money and it's not a sell out.  it's a good album that may let some diehards down.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Sometimes words aren't enough to describe beauty. <br /> <br />When I purchased this, I knew nothing of Godspeed (well, very little) and their divine music. On the first few listens I grew attached to disc 2. I cannot describe the looming, ominous drama which takes you to 'heaven' and throws you back down again. This disc is so delicate, so uplifting and dare I say it for sounding clich - hauntingly beautiful. Each new listen brings a refreshing musical touch, leaves you deep in thought and on top of the world. I felt like I watched a piece of theatre - it is a complex ride of musical tunnels, overlapping sounds... this is music. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I had listened to disc 1 but hadn't felt attached to it, so I never used to play it on my discman sitting on the train to college. My friend told me I was stupid: \\"Disc 1 is the better of the two\\". I wanted to be convinced. After about six listens I grew attached to it. These two discs are pure musical magnetism. I cannot describe disc 1's ethereal beauty, its pulsating rhythms colliding against haunting vocal recordings, the airy silences which only cascade against ominous drones. And as for the violins... (I have a thing about violins). <br /> <br />The downside, however, is how long it takes to understand this music. It took me around 10 listens to understand it in all its majesty.  <br /> <br />This is 5-star material. Buy it. Buy it if you adore Sigur Rs or anything which is not deemed ''normal music''. Today I completed my collection of SR albums; now all I have to do is complete my collection of GY!BE material and I'll be a very happy listener.
B000099T2L|1.0|beyonce would not make all of the money that she makes nor have number one hits if she did not show her body off the way that she does, dye her hair blonde, and wear crusty weaves. she sounds like a dog in pain. her voice rattles when she sings and she sing TERRIBLE live. No one wants to admit it to her. i admit when she first came out i liked her, but i was little so i couldn't tell if someone could sing. now, i know because i have taken music and voice classes. she disrespects herself, she treats herself like a low-class girl. her cd was terrible because she is talking about sex and little girls are not catching on. her writing is dull, any teenager with no self control could have written her songs. Alicia Keys is a better alternative, no sex. She can play anything on the piano, her voice is superb, it can go from opera style, to jazz, blues, r&b. her words are deep, she doesn't have to show her body off. she is extremely beautiful, intelligent, classy, respects herself, and is not superficial. Best voices in this business who do not have to disrespect themselves, are real, and don't lyp sync: Alicia Keys, Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani.
B000006TRV|5.0|This is the album I recommend if you want to get started on Pink Floyd.  It has many hits, and the music is extremely melodic and catchy. I used to not understand Pink Floyd's appeal, but this album got me curious about them.  Since there is 26 tracks, I will review the highlights of this album. <br /> <br />In the Flesh? - awesome opening track! Edgy, powerful, and the guitars are incredible. There is no better way to open an album... <br /> <br />Happiest Days of Our Lives/Another Brick.. - you've heard this song.  It is everywhere.  I like it with the \\"Happiest Days\\" intro because it just leads into \\"Another Brick\\" so well. <br /> <br />Mother - great song. The music is just flawless on this... <br /> <br />Young Lust - one of my favorite songs on the album.  It is a steady song that flat out rocks. <br /> <br />Hey You - awesome song and one of Floyd's most popular. Very well done... <br /> <br />Comfortably Numb - Pink Floyd's best song. It is perfect from beginning to end, and I personally think it is one of the greatest songs of all time.  And that is the best title for a song! <br /> <br />Run Like Hell - an awesome rocker. A popular Floyd song that is often covered... <br /> <br />There are many short songs that help with the feel of the album, and are quite awesome to listen to (The Thin Ice, Vera, etc..)The Wall movie, as weird as it is, really helps you understand the concept of the album.  It is one of my favorites..a absolute pleasure to listen to from beginning to end.  If you are new to Pink Floyd, start here.
6303471714|1.0|Here is a video I am would recommend to no one. Do not bother recommending this to people you hate, too cruel. From the beginning in the video Cindy does the moves wrong, bending her back wrong, stretching her legs too far, twisting her whole body fast and the list continues. You spend the whole video saying, \\"Wouldn't that hurt doing the exercise like that?\\" Actually the beginning starts with one of her Revlon commercials talking about her lips. You later see two more commercials.     Her trainer \\"Radu... Known as New York's toughest trainer,\\" as described on the video specks too fast, you cannot understand what he is saying, has an annoying voice and talks over Cindy countless times. Because he helped make these workouts it shows he does not know what movements work and which movements hurt you.    Back to Cindy she never says anything like, \\"good job.\\" She finishes the workouts saying \\"and that's it.\\" With other videos I always have a smile when I have been working hard and they say \\"good job.\\" Those words never come out of Cindy's mouth. Also you know when you are getting tired from an exercise and just want to give up? Other videos they encourage you to finish by saying things like \\"Come on only three more you can do it!\\" When you hear that you know you can finish. Again Cindy is not encouraging.     Last by not least this video was only made to sell. Cindy claims she has used this workout for two years and I have a hard time believing that. Some excises she does wrong, some hurt you no matter how they are done. She wears what makes her look sexy, her stomach is flat, she has her hair hanging down flopping in her face, The screen goes to black and white so the only white you see are her shoes, socks and bra guess where you look when that happens. Cindy was trained to do this video and never did this workout again I am guessing. Imagine at our time an exercise video of Britany Spears. This is a video more for men who want to see a \\"sexy super model\\" workout. Enjoy guys!    I recommend one of the Billy Blanks workout videos instead of this video. Does not matter if it is beginner or advance all of them help. Billy encourages you to work your hardest, he explains the instructions very well, the steps are easy and the movements help you not hurt you.
B0002RNXNM|5.0|excellent, excellent cd.  i highly recommend it.  was able to see them live in nyc back in november...and their live show was as good, if not better than the cd.  i'm looking forward to hearing more from these guys..
B00008NG5V|4.0|when I listen to this cd I feel like Im on the beach, having a carona.Great stuff.I saw a guy in LA that sounds alot like jack. Joe Sneva... Also great summertime music. check him out [...]
B0006399FS|4.0|[...]I can understand maybe 3 star reviews, since this is by no means their best album, but it is certainly far better than their worst. I would give that honor to the Pop album, which has a few decent songs alongside some of their most abysmal songs. But the new album seems to be hammered by some reviewers because U2 are no longer trying to push the creative envelope; they are content to turn out music much like what they have done in earlier albums like the Joshua Tree. So what? Just because they aren't breaking new ground does not mean they aren't creating decent music. Anyone who liked the Joshua Tree should like songs such as Miracle Drug, City of Blinding Lights, and Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own. U2 seem to be in a no-win situation where no matter what they do, they can't possibly please all their fans. Throughout the 90s they were criticized for departing from their 80s sound. Now that they have to some degree returned to that sound, they are criticized by others for no longer pushing the envelope. If people were expecting more high-energy songs like Vertigo, I can understand why they might be disappointed (especially when the album was hyped as returning to the sound of their first 3 albums). Also remember that some fans of their first 3 albums actually believe that classic albums like the Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby are crap! So even if U2 had turned out another classic, there would still be some people giving out 1 star reviews. I will say that the second half of HTDAAB does suffer somewhat from inclusion of too many mid-tempo songs; it would have benefited from a couple more songs where they cranked it up a notch. But U2 have nothing to be ashamed about where this album is concerned. I can't think of another band that have turned out an album this good in their 25th year. At the very least, I certainly prefer it over Pop and Rattle and Hum.
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is Pink Floyd's best work.  It is the only album I can think of that you have to listen to from beginning to end. I can't just pick a song and listen..it has to all go together. What makes this album work is because the music is melodic and flowing, it has great lyrics, and the album cover is classic.  Song by song review: <br />Speak to Me/Breathe - excellent intro to the album. Many sounds slowly layer on until it crescends into 'Breathe'. Its a nice opening track because it doesn't rush you into the album. <br /> <br />On the Run - one of the instumentals, which I absolutely love. The DSOTM DVD shows how this song was created, which is quite interesting. <br /> <br />Time - one of the best songs on the album. 'On the Run' really leads into this well, and 'Time' just starts rocking when the vocals kick in.  Great melodic song, and is often covered. <br /> <br />Great Gig in the Sky - this is my least favorite song on the album, but I still like it. The accents with the music along with Clare Torry's screaching vocals makes for a powerful song. <br /> <br />Money - one of Pink Floyd's most popular songs, if not the most popular.  Bass line is one of the best, and the song all together is quite flawless. Addictive and catchy...If you don't like this song, then I don't know what to tell you. <br /> <br />Us and Them - awesome song to relax to.  The verse is so smooth and the chorus is a perfect compliment. A very emotional and moving song. <br /> <br />Any Colour You Like - another instrumental, and a nice jam before going into \\"Brain Damage\\".  <br /> <br />Brain Damage - this is personally my favorite track on the album because it has great lyrics, and the chorus is so anthem-like.  It really brings out the mood for the album to me. <br /> <br />Eclipse - an absolute perfect way to end the album.  Short, powerful, and ending the entire theme for the album.   <br /> <br />I usually hate when people give positive reviews for every song on an album but I can't getnegative on this one.  It is quite perfect.  However, it may take some time to grow on you.  I used to despise it, but after a few listens, I couldn't figure out why I hated it in the first place.  If you're new to Floyd, you could give this a shot.  However, I recommend starting out with \\"The Wall\\" simply because it has some shorter pop songs that might help you ease into Pink Floyd's sound. <br /> <br />Overall, a great album to own.  And a recommendation...whenever possible, listen to this album on headphones.  It is simply better that way.
B0002OERI0|5.0|When it comes to music, i'll listen to practically anything. But this album stands out as an almost life-changing commentary on society today and the sad Ennui of my generation. <br />1. American Idiot - the cover song - this energetic opening prepares you for the journey one will take if you really listen to this album. <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia - 9 minutes of bliss, broken into 5 acoustically different but compatible mini-songs <br />3. Holiday - while essentially another chapter in the album's story, it also provides a scathing, yet somewhat optimistic political commentary. <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams - another well known single in the album, this one is kind of sullen and low, but a very good isten nonetheless. <br />5. We are the Waiting - seems like one of the the only filler songs in the album. <br />6. St. Jimmy - mmm...old school Green Day <br />7. Give me Novacaine - the weirdest wong in the album, and no, that's not novacaine thay speak of... <br />8. She's a Rebel - Sounds Old-schoolish, and a major part in the story. <br />9. Extraordinary girl - A very strong lament on lost love. <br />10. Letterbomb - a twist on commonplace teen angst with a powerful rythm <br />11. Wake me up when September Ends - Very alternative in its style, but still seems like filler. <br />12. Homecoming - another 9 minutes of goodness, a strong and culminating end to the album's story <br />13. Whatsername - The epilouge of the story, a depressing song of concession to being a nobody, the opposite of American Idiot. Pure genius. <br />If Pink Floyd did alternative Punk rock, this would be Dark side of the Moon. I recommend it to anyone. Heck, even my older brother, who doesn't listen to rock much at all, liked American Idiot. <br />
B000002N2Z|5.0|The Deftones first album \\"Adrenaline\\" is very different from the Deftones we are now used to today. \\"Adrenaline\\" is a straight-forward metal album. No experiments, no electronics or anything that the Deftones are widely known for today, just rock. This release is more in tune with \\"Around The Fur\\", which I think is the Deftones' best. This one came out in the height of the nu-metal explosion, which the Deftones were partly responsible for. Deftones were one of the first bands, beside Korn, to play what was known as \\"nu-metal\\" and they were doing it long before Korn ever got together, even though this one came out a year after Korn's debut. There was a lot of things to me that made the Deftones better than most of the other nu-metal bands out there, mainly being Chino. Chino is such a great vocalist, and I've always prefered him over others like Jon Davis and Fred Durst. Not to mention his lyrics have always been a cut above the others, not just doing the same old topics that eventually became done to death in the genre. The rest of the band isn't too shabby on their instruments either. If you're a fan of the Deftones, it's nice to see where they came from, and how they've evolved over the years. <br /> <br />The album opens up with one of the Deftones' classic songs, \\"Bored\\". Introducing the \\"soft verse, loud chorus\\" approach that would later become a staple for their, most other nu metal bands, material. This is where the Deftones show what they're all about. Most of the album follows this pattern, like \\"Lifter\\" and \\"Root\\". Some tend to use rapping approaches (which would become yet another staple in nu-metal) like \\"7 words\\" and \\"Engine #9\\". One of the highlights (and my favorite moment on the entire album) is on \\"7 Words\\" when the music stops just before the bridge, and Chino says \\"you don't know me, shut up you don't know me, squeel like a pig...\\", you know the rest. It's just so good before it goes back into the song. Some songs see the Deftones slowing it downa bit, and getting very melodic only to turn into fierce bursts, most notably \\"One Weak\\" and \\"Fireal\\". The untitled hidden track (which is really called \\"Fist\\") is a hauting, extremely light song which mainly features Chino mumbling and Stephen playing guitar, and is quite good once you listen to it. Most songs on the cd however see the band going to heavy route, showing their metal influence, that would later only be used in small doses. The album also features a great deal or screaming which is not nearly used as much in later albums. Compared to the Deftones releases of today, this one does not even stand up in the diversity department, because really the only thing they do different is slow down songs like \\"Fireal\\" and \\"One Weak\\". Even with the lack of diversity (which I love about the newer albums) the collection of songs on here will please any fan of the band, especially those who love \\"Around The Fur\\". Fans of new releases like \\"White Pony\\" and the self-titled might just want to check it out for nostalgic purposes. I fell in love with this album years ago, and still I find myself listening to it and loving it just the same. It's so good, and that's the way it's always been with the Deftones. Everything they've ever done has been great, and this album is no exception. <br /> <br />Definitely a worth while addition to any Deftones fans collection. Most won't be dissapointed with this one. I know that if you're a Deftones fan, then most likely you already own this one. However if you're someone who has recently got into the band, then don't hesitate to pick this one up and add it to your collection. The Deftones never make the same album twice, so it make \\"Adrenaline\\" even more essential. The things that made the Deftones amazing back then, are still the things that make them amazing today, and it's great to see those things in an early form. It's cool to remember when the Deftones were one of the front runners in nu-metal. Now they deny all association with the genre. However this one will always remain as one of the most influential nu-metal albums out there, and really you can't do any better.
B00005JMAH|2.0|I've read all the Harry Potter books and saw the first two movies.  I was really looking forward to this movie.  The acting was fine (the \\"kids\\" are getting better) and the animation and special effects were great.  However, if you hadn't read the book, you'd be totally lost.  The plot kept jumping around with no explanation of how they got from one place to another.  I got the impression that Cuarn was trying to fit everything in but didn't have enough time so he just jumped from one scene to the next with no tie-in.  My husband has not read the books.  Although he watched both previous movies and was looking forward to this one, he walked out within the first half hour because he found it so confusing and, thus, unenjoyable.  This movie was a real disappointment.
B0002858YS|5.0|What a breath of fresh air this album is.  I first heard of them, when they were featured on an episode of Fox's hit TV show \\"The OC\\".  They played a couple of their songs, and they were extremely catchy, so I decided to grab one of their CD's.   <br /> <br />I started listening to it, and its really catchy and upbeat music to listen to, and its really well thought out. <br /> <br />Then I went to a club in Rochester, NY, and the club was playing this album from start to finish, I knew that the killers had arrived. <br /> <br />The only negative thing I can say is its too short, but is that really a negative thing?  Alot of bands will put alot of poor \\"filler\\" songs in.  Honestly this CD probably only has 1 filler song in the entire thing.  The rest could easially be singles or hits. <br /> <br />My favorite lyric \\"you got a real short skirt, I wanna look up, look up\\".
B000024D4R|5.0|I love this album.  Like most Pink Floyd albums, it took a little time to grow on me, but that is why I love Floyd...their music gets better and better with every listen.  I love this album because it has everything that Floyd always perfects..great songs, great lyrics, great theme, and a classic album cover.  Here's my review.. <br />Pigs on the Wing (Part 1) - a nice acoustic song to ease you into the album.  Great chords, and nice and short. <br /> <br />Dogs - this is my favorite song on the album.  It is the longest, but it actually doesn't feel like 17 minutes when listening to it.  I love when it calms down, stops, then Dave Gilmour hits that huge bend on his guitar.  That gets me pumped every time.  And the song ends really well. <br /> <br />Pigs (Three Different Ones) - I love this song from beginning to end.  Great chords, and awesome rhythms by Waters and Mason.  Again, the song doesn't feel as long as it is. <br /> <br />Sheep - the most popular song from the album.  It is a steady rocker that has great feel.  It is a nice song to lead to the end of the album. <br /> <br />Pigs on the Wing (Part 2) - Pretty much the same as the first track, and it ends the album nicely. <br /> <br />Don't bother downloading songs from this album, because it will take too long.  Buy it, and I promise you won't regret it.  It took a few listens for it to finally click with me, but once it does, it is completely worth it.  If you're new to Floyd, I suggest \\"The Wall\\" first, then follow up with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and then \\"Wish You Were Here\\".  \\"Animals\\" should follow, but all are classic works.
B00005JNEI|3.0|I would strongly recommend watching this movie along with one of the several responses to it (I suggest Fahrenhype 9/11, since it is a very direct response which is well done).  It is difficult to disentangle truth from fiction in this movie, but it is worth approaching it in a balanced manner, since Michael Moore is anything but balanced in his approach.  This movie is NOT a documentary; Moore has no interest whatsoever in approaching his subject manner from a neutral standpoint.  It is purely propoganda, but as far as that goes, it is entertaining propoganda.  Just don't automatically take what Moore says at face value.
B0001M0A4I|2.0|I have always been a Genesis fan...and also a classical music fan of long standing. This ain't no classical music. Sure, there's an orchestra...and soloists...and the tunes are hum-able. But these pieces at best are movie score material (forgive me Bernard Herrmann, Max Steiner, et al). <br /> <br />The music on this CD is derivative of all the second tier movie composers who have ever lived. Banks gets a melody set up, then he embarks on digging out whatever shmaltzy emotion he can develop, building to some sort of climax, as if he were thinking while writing it \\"ooh, watch me do this to that tune...and now this...and this...\\". But his technique is cut & pasted from those who came before. There is nothing unique about his craft here (as opposed to his work in the rock world, which one could argue was distinctive, if not unique).  <br /> <br />Good thing the price is right, so I don't feel compelled to return it. <br /> <br />Wanna try a living, breathing classical composer who will get you over the chasm? Try Michael Torke. While his \\"Book of Proverbs\\" is superior work, it is full-priced. His recent Naxos CD (same label and price as this Banks CD) with \\"Rapture,\\" \\"An American Abroad,\\" and \\"Jasper,\\" ought to do the trick.  <br /> <br />Or, try Steve Reich's \\"Tehillim\\" as a great intro to his style. Different from Torke, but certainly this is quite approachable to those thinking that Tony Banks is writing classical music.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I can't believe how many people panned this movie.  It really is a great film about the subtle things in life that we hardly notice and having real conversations that we rarely have. The people that don't like this movie should just give up trying to understand it and go watch Spiderman.
0767830555|5.0|If you haven't seen the movie it's good in any format, and there's no need to tell you why. Just watch it and enjoy. Because many film buffs have already seen the flick, it's probably better to discuss the bells and whistles contained within the DVD.  I have an old VHS copy that was beginning to lose its luster, so I added the Collector's Edition DVD to my library. Here are my thoughts on the \\"extras\\": <br /> <br />There is an excellent \\"the making of\\" documentary. De Niro, Scorsese, Foster, Brooks, Boyle, Sheperd, Keitel, and even the screenwriter add their anecdotes. Find out exactly where they found the weird street drummer guy who's seen performing during Betsy and Travis' big date. Other tales are told with regard to the making of the film. <br /> <br />This DVD claims to contain the WIDESCREEN VERSION of the film; however, I find no difference between this version and my VHS full screen copy. Perhaps you see a quarter of an inch more of the picture, but nothing more. Why letterbox the full screen version? Either the theatrical release closely resembles the Full Screen version, or the Producer of the DVD thought no one would notice. <br /> <br />Although the Widescreen is nothing more than Full Screen inside a letter box, the Photo Montage surprises in a very good way. Instead of a silent slide show, the producer of the cd provides additional commentary on the making of Taxi Driver. You'll learn how the screenwriter named every character, and what lengths De Niro went to prepare for his performance.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for a DVD to replace your VHS edition, then this is suitable; however, if you want a real Widescreen edition complete with audio commentary, then you should wait until the next \\"Collector's Edition\\" is released. With 2006 just around the corner, a 20th anniversary edition is sure to come.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has done it again.  After a break since their last cd, the guys came back with an amazing album with catchy tunes, lyrics and that special Green Day spark.  Old fans and new alike will get a kick out of these great songs.  Is it any different from their past cd?  I'd say it has a different, but great, taste, with the hint of the old Green Day we know and love.  Songs like \\"American Idiot\\" \\"Boulavard Of Broken Dreams\\" were great choices for singles.  They're the songs that'll be stuck in your head for eternity.  With thirteen songs on the disk, are you getting a good deal?  Totally.  If you count the fact that both songs, \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" are made up of not just one but five little tunes, comprising each with nine minutes of Green Day mania, it's really like the cd has twenty-one songs.  That's almost double what most other cds have, with their lame ten track cds.  My ratings of the songs is as follows: <br /> <br />American Idiot: Title track, first song on the album, and first single.  The lyrics and tune are catchy, and you'll be singing them from here to everywhere.  Just an all around great song. <br /> <br />Jesus Of Suburbia: One of two nine minute songs, and a favourite of mine.  Jesus of Suburbia, City of The Damned, I Don't Care, Dearly Beloved, and Tales From Another Broken Home make up one hell of a fantastic listen. <br /> <br />Holiday: Catchy, Lyrical and amazing.  What more can I say.  The song is based on political themes and is just... AMAZING. <br /> <br />Boulavard Of Broken Dreams: Second single and is destined to become a favourite classic of many.  In the years to come, we'll still be singing this one. <br /> <br />Are We The Waiting: With four amazing songs before it, the Green Day crew must've had a hard time coming up with a fifth track that didn't sound really crappy next to the others.  They did it.  It's no song of the year, but great all the same. <br /> <br />St. Jimmy:  The kind of old Green Day music we know and love.  It's what you'd expect to hear.  Fast and up beat, it gives you a first hand look at Jimmy, whos name appears multiple times later in the cd. <br /> <br />Give Me Novacaine: Afer St. Jimmy, the song wont leave the most lasting impression, but it really is great.  Slower, but stikk very lyrical, I loved it.  A definet favourite on the cd. <br /> <br />She's A Rebel:  Another song that you'd expect to hear from Green Day.  Fast, catchy... I garuntee you'll never get sick of it.  Although it is short, it makes up for that in spunk. <br /> <br />Extraordinary Girl: If any song on the cd had to be chosen as least favourite song, it's this one.  Only because every cd has a down point and if I absolutly HAD to choose, it'd be this one. <br /> <br />Letter Bomb:  \\"Where have all the bastards gone\\"  Who knows, but with a first line like that, this is a great song.  Another Green Day original sounding tune. <br /> <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends: A slower tune, similar to the older \\"Good Ridance (time of your life)\\" song.  Touching and surprisingly heartfelt.  I took it as a song about 9/11, others may take it differently.  Another destined to be a classic. <br /> <br />Homecoming:  The second of the nine minute tunes.  Death of St. Jimmy, East 12th Street, Nobody Likes You, Rock And Roll Girlfriend (my favourite song on the cd), and We're Coming Home Again make this great.  I loved it.  The lyrics are so catchy. <br /> <br />Whatsername:  A very nice end to the album.  Upbeat and cool, I don't think they could've ended the cd better.  Great. <br /> <br />   All in all, the guys from Green Day did an amazing job.  Old and new sounds alike bring something for everyone.  Absolutely Fantastic, out of ten, I give it an 11.
0345452585|5.0|Jonathan Kellerman is a very good author. Many years ago, on one of his first books, he got a blurb from Stephen King, saying he'd revived the Private Eye novel singlehandedly. I don't know about that, but he has done a lot, and the books he writes are very interesting. The style that he uses is interesting, and you can tell that he works at the prose and the characters.<br /><br />The Conspiracy Club is a complete departure for him. Most of his novels are technology-driven to an extent anyway, and the characters and action are reasonably rational. The atmosphere, such as it is, comes from the city they're in, the tension between the characters, that sort of thing. And there's a plot, generally a fast-moving one with twists and turns, false clues and real killers.<br /><br />Here, instead, we have what's almost a Gothic Romance novel. Dr. Jeremy Carrier is a shrink at a hospital in a nameless easter city (ala Scott Turow). His live-in girlfriend was killed six months before the start of the book, and he was the chief suspect, but the police could never develop enough evidence to arrest him. He wanders through the first hundred pages or so of the book, not really sure why he's so suspicious of everyone, meeting interesting people and not being sure what their motivations are.<br /><br />Somewhere in there, it becomes obvious that something's going on, but what it is remains murky and indistinct for most of the book. It's clear it has to do with the girlfriend's murder, but not how or why. As Jeremy slowly burrows his way through the mystery, following leads and suspects, we begin to suspect that someone else is controlling the pace, somehow, but we're not sure.<br /><br />This is an interesting, atmospheric novel. There's not as much plot, or as many twists, as the usual Alex Delaware novel, but there are enough for the usual reader. The characters, however, and the atmosphere, are palpable, and this is what shines through: Kellerman's skill with prose is undeniable.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book.eniable. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this book.
B000005Z0E|4.0|I just got this album a couple of days after Christmas, and it is really, really good. My favourite tracks are \\"Young Black Male\\", \\"Trapped\\", \\"Souljah's Story\\", \\"If My Homie Calls\\", \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\", \\"Rebel Of The Underground\\" & \\"Part Time Mutha\\". I recommend anyone who is a 2pac fan to buy this album.
0805066691|5.0|This is a heartbreaking tale of how the United States destroyed the native civilizations of North America.  Dee Brown tells this story from the Native Americans' point of view.  He details how Americans used a series of treaties to swindle the natives out of their land.  Time and time again, these treaties were broken.  Land was continually stolen from the natives, and when they tried to stand up for their rights as outlined in the treaties, then the U.S. army was there to murder and torture the natives until they could no longer resist.  This book will prove to be an eye-opener.  As an American, I was spoon-fed the theory of Manifest Destiny in American high school.  I think it would be better to call it what it really is -- genocide.  If you would like to read about \\"how the west was won,\\" then I would recommend that you pick up this book, so that you can learn the real truth about American history.
B00063MBU8|5.0|simple plan is a great band and their new Cd rocks. i strongly suggest buying it. the dual disc is awesome too. buy it!
B00000J9HE|3.0|These recordings of the last 4 symphonies of Sibelius date from the mid 1960s, when the Karajan/BPO/DG team were at their finest. The accoustic is reverberent enough to add atmosphere but not too much so as to seem cavernous. The playing of the BPO is perfect. And the restoration in first class digital sound makes this seem like a highly recommendable package. And there was a day when I might have recommended it wholeheartedly. But not any more. <br /> <br />Many fine recordings of Sibelius from native Scandinavian conductors have made their way into the catalog since these recordings were made, and those recordings prove once again that Karajan does not understand the cultural flavor of some music. When I hear these now, I have the same reaction I do when I hear Karajan's Mahler; it sounds more like Richard Strauss than like the music the composer wrote. I just listened to the sibelius 4th from this set; I thought at moments it was some lost movements from Also Sprach Zarathustra or Ein Heldenleben.  <br /> <br />And the other symphonies similarly lack the Scandanavian flavor.  <br /> <br />Some western recordings are exemplary (the Davis BSO 4th, the Maazel 6th), and I could certainly not leave out Barbiroli in any discussion of the major Sibelius orchestral works. <br /> <br />But, if you want to experience pure Sibelius, get the BIS recordings, preferably the Vanska with the Lahti orchestra. Neeme Jarvi on BIS is good, but no where close to Vanska.  <br />
B0001Z52RU|4.0|When I first saw the trailor for this movie I really wanted to see it but was put off by the bad reviews.  I caught it on cable tonight and now wish I would have seen it earlier.  Very good film and suprisingly good acting on Ashton Kutcher's part.  I'm not gonna go into the story because you can look to other reviews for that but this movies is definitly worth watching. This movie keep me interested throughout the film and I thought ended well, wrapped everything up in a nice little package.  It's pretty much one of those movies your either going to love or hate.  I will definitly tell people about this film.  I would, however, recommend that you rent this one before buying because there does seem to be some disagreement on the quality of the movie.
B00003CXAW|5.0|This is, of course, the classic original KING KONG that has inspired so many sequels, remakes and rip offs over the years. I give you something to consider: I believe the character KING KONG has been misshandled and underused by its owners. There is so much potential to the character, that it is a shame that he has only had<br />7 real movies, and one he isnt even in. Compare that to the successes of Universals Dracula (6 movies),<br />Frankenstein (8), Godzilla (29 movies) or james bond (23). After Kongs first sequel, Son of Kong, several<br />other projects were considered but went unmade. Toho productions, after the release of the third movie,<br />King kong vs. Godzilla, also attempted to develope several projects for Kong biut only one wa made.<br />The same goes for Delorentis Entertainment. So much potential all goes to nothing. Kong is a beloved character<br />who mostly gets stuck in remakes of the same story over and over. Yet a giant ape captures the imagination and the potential for limitless adventure is here.<br />here is the series break down:<br />#1 KING KONG (1933)<br />There are three versions of the original.<br />a.

B0002OERI0|5.0|The term \\"punk\\" is up to anyone's personal interpretation but i think the entire thing is stupid. Dont like a certain album based on whether it fits a genre. In my personal experience, every band my friends call \\"punk\\" really blows. they cant sing, they cant play their instruments. \\"punk\\" kids are trying so hard to fit in with other \\"punk\\" kids that they will hate on an album for reasons they dont even know. Anyways, this album is great on all levels, billie's lyrics are much more meaningful, and the group's playing is unbelievable. Whether or not this cd fits some little kid's idea of what \\"punk\\" is doesnt matter to me. so before you write your bad review, tell the reader that you are a punk, gothic, non-conformist that wont like anything that is well-liked so as not to turn a person away from buying an otherwise good album.
B00005QK3B|5.0|One of my top three albums of all time.  Probably number one.  A tremendous musical experience, well thought lyrics and great musicianship.
091581112X|5.0|Why you don¡®t have it£¿Amazon.ca<BR>I want order it through amazon.ca.When will you have it?<br />Just as other books of Orin and Daben,this book is extremely helpful.<br />Thank you and I am looking forward to hear from you
B0001LJCMK|5.0|Damn, this is good stuff.  I was driving home after a hard day, listening to my satellite radio when \\"I Only Want You\\" came on and rocked me out so hard I had to dig around in the floorboard for my errant receiver to see what it was.  Later in the commute, on another station, I heard \\"Whorehoppin'\\" and it, too, forced me to fish through a net of wires and adapter cords to see the name of the group -- and of course it turned out to be by the same band.      Though I'd previously only wanted to get home and curl up on the kitchen table, I actually stopped at a record store and picked it up and have been cranking it ever since.  Not since I stumbled onto The Monks' \\"Black Monk Time\\" have I been so thoroughly and completely seduced by a group that traffics in such blunt, infectious sounds and skewed good humor.    As many have said, these guys land somewhere between both the Eagles and a death metal group.  The singer's high, buttery vocals remind me of a young Neil Young, and the music has the same bang and clatter of the JSBE or the five upstart Americans.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Brad Pitt is HOT!!! He does really great acting. I think this is one of his best movies yets.I am not familar with the whole story of Troy, but it is one of my favorites and it means up to my expectations. Although I HATE Orlando Bloom in this movie. I think he could have done better and he fights like a girl in this movie. I like him A LOT better in Pirates of the Carribean.
B0002X314C|1.0|The man whines too damn much.  His songs sound broken down...like they need to speed them up a little.  I cant complain though, I brought it for 2 dollars boot leg!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Genious abstract lyrics akin to perhps the Dog Faced Hermans of old, with sounds are piced together beautifully and rhythmically. The pure energy is like the output of 80 billion hampster wheels, and that is a lot of energy.  Funeral has songs that hit on a variety of subjects and all are clever and powerful.  If you don't own this, buy it now, if you do, pat yourself on the back often for doing so because it is bloody sweet.
0385335482|5.0|Although I have not always been a great fan of contemporary novels it is my great pleasure to anounce that I have changed my views. Confessions of a Shopaholic is not what I expected. I thought it would be terrible and cannot live up to the hype that it has become, but instead I found it an utterly refreshing read.<br /><br />Confessions of a Shopaholic teaches us all something about the worth of money and how important it is to be responsible. I'm not really a zealous spender, but still I was able to relate to the character Becky Bloomwood. I adore Luke almost as much as Becky. This novel has something for all of us. I highly recommend.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|There are a few good reasons to get this:<br /><br /># 1 - Nostalgia<br /><br /># 2 - Queen<br /><br /># 3 - U2<br /><br /># 4 - Bob Geldof's worthy cause<br /><br /># 5 - The liner notes which encapsulate the struggle of the cause and the injustice of the system<br /><br />LIVE AID was the definitive concert document of the eighties.  What you get here are some bands at their peak or ascent and others who weren't very good.  It's almost like watching the men with the boys.<br /><br />If you're a Queen fan, that is probably reason alone to get this set.  Ditto if you're a U2 fan.  Both bands absolutely dominate  the stadium in extended sets.  You'll feel like you were there - and you probably were - watching back in the eighties.  A good way to watch this is with your friends over drinks...play the whole set and you'll feel like you were back in the past, minus the MTV hosts.<br /><br />You'll also get to catch INXS and Madonna on their ascent upwards.  And forgotten acts like the Thompson Twins and Nik Kershaw.<br /><br />The set is dominated primarily by British bands, but warning: only about 85 % of the performances have been salvaged - much of the footage was actually destroyed.  Many have moaned about Led Zeppelin not making the DVD - I saw them that day and they were dreadful, so it's no real loss.  There are others who sing off key here as well like Bryan Ferry...and one song by Duran Duran (\\"View to a Kill\\") where Simon LeBon loses his voice is omitted.  These are minor foibles of course as a live event is all about performing warts and all. But this set is also missing: Power Station, Stevie Wonder and several others who played on that day.  I recall Big Country had played as well.<br /><br />After watching it, you wonder where the American acts went to.  Where were Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen and other big acts of the day?<br /><br />This is a worthy buy even if you don't like all the acts.  And catch the rousing finale \\"Do they Know it's Christmas\\" by Band Aid.<br /><br />Pray for Africa and help them out.
0064407667|3.0|I decided to try reading this book since everybody seems to be talking about this series.  It doesn't seem to me to warrant all the gushing reviews heaped upon it. <br /> <br />The age range listed for the book is 9 - 12, yet the author constantly explains the meanings of words as though he was writing for 2 year olds.  This seriously bogs down the story, and in my opinion is an example of bad writing.  If you think there's another term that's more understandable to your audience, you should have just used that term in the first place. <br /> <br />At one point he took time out to explain the the term \\"faked\\" means \\"feigned\\".  Faked is a more common word than feigned, I'm sure any 9 - 12 year old knows what it means.  In fact, I'm betting that 9 - 12 year olds know most of the words that the author painstakingly takes time out of the story to explain. <br /> <br />It seems to me that the author is simultaneously trying to portray kids as intelligent, while insulting their intelligence.  At one point one of the characters takes on the author's explanatory role and explained to Klaus what the word \\"duration\\" means.  Klaus responds angrily \\"I know what duration means!\\".  It seems a little ironic, doesn't it? <br /> <br />The author also gives a lot of unnecessary commentary that bogs down the story as well.  At one point Violet's making a grappling hook, and the author goes out of his way to explain the kind of knot she was making and tell us about it's history.  That kind of thing has nothing to do with the story and serves as an annoying distraction. <br /> <br />Even though the author talks up the cleverness of the characters, they're really not that clever at all. If you haven't read the book you can stop reading here because I'm about to give some examples. <br /> <br />Count Olaf goes to a whole lot of trouble to sneak the baby out of the kids bedroom, when he could have just picked her up and carted her off at any time and the kids wouldn't have been able to doa thing. <br /> <br />Klaus confronted Olaf alone with the information that he knew about his evil plans.  Apparently it never occured to him that Olaf was bigger and stronger than him and trying to blackmail him with going to the authorities might not be such a good idea, seeing as there are dozens of ways Olaf could stop him. <br /> <br />Violet tells Count Olaf that she'd foiled his plan before she'd gotten Sunny back safely in her arms.  Sunny did manage to get back safely to her before Olaf contermanded his order, but just barely!  That seemed like a very foolish move to me. <br /> <br />There were a lot of details that I found were lacking or not well thought out in this book.  Some of them are technical legal matters and the like and maybe that's nit-picking a little too much for a young readers book.   <br /> <br />However, if you take how detail oriented the author is towards things as simple as what type of knot Violet tied to her grappling hook, it's a little hard to believe the author missed pointing out that forcing somebody to marry you is good grounds for an anullment.  Even if Count Olaf had successfully married Violet, he would not have been able to get the money from the bank because he would have been in jail for hanging Sunny out a window. (by the time he got out the anullment could have gone through) <br /> <br />It's also a little hard to believe that a pair of rich parents who had the foresight to write their will would have made it so vague as to only suggest that their kids must be in the custody of a relative.  This is a decision that parents agonize over finding the right person or people to take care of their kids after they're gone - who in their right mind would just put \\"We don't care who, just make sure it's a relative!\\" <br /> <br />Talking about legal matters and the like, I realize some of you may be accusing me now of nit-picking on small details.  I'm only pointing out what I noticed though.  I'll tell you straight away that to me having a few details lacking does not ruin a good story.  However, it seems that this author did not make much of an effort to properly work out the details of this story.  Or, to be more accurate, he concentrated quite a bit on very unimportant details while completely ignoring the important ones. <br /> <br />Generally, the characters of this story were 2 dimensional, the narration was long-winded, and the plot was thin.  One of the good things about the book was that the author isn't affraid to have his characters face adversity.  But adversity is a good tool for character building, and it's quite a shame that the author didn't make full use of that. <br /> <br />The plot also had a few surprising twists and turns, it's good to see authors trying not to fall into the trap of predictability.   <br /> <br />Maybe you think I'm setting my standards too high for a simple young reader's book, but I don't think so.  I've read young reader's books that meet my kinds of standards, and I believe that young readers appreciate it when authors have high standards as well. <br /> <br />But generally, even though I've been nit-picking this book to death, it wasn't a completely terrible read.  Sometimes you just feel like some light reading to mindlessly waste time with, and this would be a good choice for that.
B000002P2W|5.0|I won't pretend to be an expert on the Who or delve into the minds of the artists.   After all, it isn't what the author intended but what we get out of a peice of art that is important.  This album is one of the few that I was able to listen to from beginning to end and find that it evoked a certain mix of emotions.   Quite honestly, I am not a big fan of the Who.  They did some great stuff like Teenage Wasteland, and some real crap like Who Are You? But this album struck a chord in my imagination.  It was somewhat melancholy, granted, but there seemed to me a seed of hope in it that helped me see the sunshine behind the clouds.  Most important I got the feeling that the artists had invested sincere emotion into the music.  I can't begin to put to words the emotions I felt from listening to this album.  If I could, it wouldn't be worth listening to.  That is the magic of music.  It transcends words.
B0002KQNZO|5.0|I ordered this album based partly on the reviews of my fellow jazz lovers, and- - - - - I can't tell you how passionate the playing is; you will have a meltdown just taking in the title track (no joke) So skip 2 video rentals and pick up a piece of art that will stand for all time. jb
B0006A9FMI|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater - it was a glorious experience.  It was nicely subtitled.  It was one of the best jobs done on an anime release for North America.  So I was counting the days until the DVD release. <br />I wish I hadn't bought it; it includes NO SUBTITLE TRACK.  Thus one may watch it in the original Japanese if one wants, but options for an English version are limited.  The only option (excluding proper French subtitles) is for Close Captioned English which makes the movie unwatchable for most viewers.  This does not seem to be a literal translation of the Japanese but a summary and includes descriptions of sounds.  I quit after a few minutes of it and I won't play it again except for the raw Japanese; obviously I can't show this to friends who don't know that language. <br />Don't waste your money on this.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|I first became a Shania Twain fan when I heard \\"Man! I feel Like A Woman\\", \\"Forever and For Always\\", and \\"Party For Two.\\" So I figured, what the heck, I might as well buy her CD of greatest hits. It was bound to be good. And it IS. <br /> <br />Twain is one of those rare stars who can really dig deep into emotions in her songs. A lot of musicians today like singing about sex, drugs, and booze, but a bunch of her songs are really more about actual love. My favorites of these would probably be Don't, You're Still The One, and Forever And For Always (\\"I'm keepin' you forever and for always/ we will be together all of our days/ wanna wake up ev'ry mornin' to your sweet face/ always...\\") Sorry, I really think that song is beautiful! <br /> <br />Twain also has her really fun songs, e.g. Man! I feel Like A Woman, Up!, and Party For Two. By the way, a note about that last one: the Mark McGrath version is really annoying!! I can't stand listening to it! The Billy Currington one is so totally better. Anyway, the money spent buying this CD is really money well spent.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|napoleon dynamite is the best movie ever! it is so funny! the funniest thing would have to be when he dances. i was lauging really hard. a lot of people in my class says the quotes..my math teacher even watched it! but she left just 2 minutes during the movie. but i all i have to say is, this movie is awesome and hilarious!
1558908455|4.0|I really enjoyed From Dusk Till Dawn.  I won't go into story detail except that this film is pretty noticable mainly because of Tarantino and Jewlyit lewis.  The film is pretty good, has some really great vampire make overs and has some pretty violent moments.  This film isn't the type you should see with your lil' brother, this film does contain extream profanity, some nudity and some Gritty violent images and moments. <br /> <br />George Clooney was excellent in this film and has to be his best film.  The film felt like a western type Vampire flick.  The only thing about the film is that the first hour is superb but the last hour of the film just falls short with really lame Vampire sequences and some parts I rather not talk about.  One part I will bring up though...This film had a pretty upsetting depressing scene which involves a girl and her Brother and Her EX-preacher Father..Honestly is it just me or was anyone els upset about what happends to her family at the end of the film.  Very unsettling scene.  What I really enjoyed was the fact that even though Clooney is a ruthless criminal you're still gonna' be rootin' for him just to make sure he survives.  Great film.. <br />Great acting <br />Great Vampires <br />very sad moments near the end of the film... <br /> <br />Great film... <br /> <br />4.1 out of 5...If you're looking for something like this check out John Carpenters Vampires....great film.. <br /> <br />Lates..
B000002UAU|5.0|I think people get too carried away with the importance of artists like Elvis and The Beatles. What impresses me about the Beatles though, was by the time they released this album. They really didn't care too much about out& out commercial success. And had the courage to be true to their artistic ambitions. Is this the greatest album ever made? I think people will be arguing about that FOREVER. Rolling Stone place it at the top ahead of equally great Beatles albums like REVOLVER & RUBBER SOUL. I find it the most enjoyable Beatles album to listen to from start to finish, for the very fact that I know its not trying to pander to any audience or commercial criteria. Even tracks like FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR KITE. Have a woderful sound, that has me asking myself \\"how did they do that in 1967\\"?? And the amazing A DAY IN THE LIFE proves beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this Merseyside Beat group had come a long way since the days of LOVE ME DO AND SHE LOVES YOU. <br /> <br />I don't know if this is the greatest album of alltime or even the Beatles greatest. But I do know, there is no album I get more enjoyment from listening to from start to finish. It is very enjoyable, check it out... <br /> <br />
B000063K2W|5.0|All female cast in a movie that's all about men. And frankly, it's a cast to DIE for. All of M-G-M (it WAS mgm, right?)'s top leading ladies, clawing each other to bits! <br /> <br />Norma Shearer plays the sympathetic wife/mother of the movie, Mary Haines; the main character. She overhears that her husband has been cheating on her, having an affair with shopgirl Crystal Allen (played by a wonderfully evil Joan Crawford). After much trial and tribulation, Mary ends up on the train for Reno to get a divorce. But in order to find out what happens in the second half of the movie, you'll have to see it yourself! <br /> <br />While Shearer and Crawford are both excellent in their roles, I must say that this film belongs to the two strongest supporting actresses, Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard. Russell plays Shearer's cousin and \\"best friend\\", Sylvia Fowler, and Goddard plays a gal Shearer becomes friends with at Reno. The cat fight between Russell and Goddard is one of the BEST examples of physical comedy I have ever had the delight of seeing (I actually watched it in slow motion once). Russell talks about a hundred words a second, so try to keep up!  <br /> <br />Joan Fontaine, Phyllis Povah, and Virginia Weidler are all also brilliant in their supporting roles (as is Mary Boland, another personal favorite--she is just as funny as they come). So for those looking for a very different comedy, rent The Women today!
B000002IOJ|3.0|i rememer reading a review on this album back when it came out (the things i remember)that said it was recorded live in studio.so for all these years i assumed this was the culprit behind this albums lack of umph (is that a word?).before writing this review i was reading some others where the lack punch was mentioned.so before i blew the lid off this mystery i wanted to check w/my \\"practice what ..\\"cd foldout ,to substantiate the claim . it says nothing of it .so i don't know where the hell the punch went.i would've given this 5 srars if it was a live in studio album ,this changes everything!
B0000025RI|5.0|Michael may not be the King Of Pop NOW. But that is even debateable. Because who will ever surpass this incredible record? Its sold nearly 60 million won 8 grammy's, 7 American music awards, spawned 7 top ten hits & god knows how many platinum awards. Yes this is thee greatest phenomenon in the history of the music business. And it still sounds GREAT. I love Wanna Be Starting Something & Human Nature the best.    If you don't already own this alltime classic, give it a try. There is a very good reason why it is still the best selling album of alltime after 20 years.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This movie was exceptional.  It had history, epic adventure, sentiment and war. It was graphic enough to understand the true situation but wasn't gory, it wasn't excessive blood and guts. My 12 year old son watched even though it was rated R and I was not disappointed for letting him. There was slight sexual content but again, not graphic.  Everything was done very subtile but every point was put across.  Kudo's to the producer and director for this exceptional film. I hope they can take these same characters and style and remake the Odyssey to finish Homer's work.
B00000JLWW|4.0|I do like this movie and when it came out, I saw it 4 times in the theater.  I recently watched in on DVD and though still good, I liked it better on the big screen.  The shots of the ship: leaving port and sailing straight toward the camera, the 3 screws lifting out of the water when it was sinking, sailing towards the setting sun, standing near vertical, etc. just looked much better on the big screen. <br /> <br />As I see it, the movie was about \\"Titanic\\" itself.  Yes, there is a fictional love story between Jack and Rose and the all too familiar love triangle, but really the human characters are there to \\"show off the ship\\".  Bare with me a moment, and I'll try to make this statement clear.  Watch the movie without really focusing on the actual human characters (especially the \\"fictional\\" ones)...look past them and you will notice that the scenes occur all over the ship.  The main staircase, the dining hall, various locations of the deck, the bridge, numerous hallways, steerage, engine rooms, crow's deck, exercise room, baggage compartment, first class staterooms --- the \\"fictional\\" love-story exists to reveal the ship in all it's Grandness.  Also note, the fictional characters encounter many real characters -- Molly Brown, the Captain, Shipbuilder etc.  The viewers are given glimpses of these people and those are the ones we truly connect with -- atleast I did. Watching the captain's face the moment he KNOWS most of the people on board are going to die -- or the shipbuilder's face, then and when he's watching the clock .... you almost ache for their sorrow.  Or stop for a moment and try to imagine that YOU are one of the crewmembers on deck choosing who is to go and who is to stay behind and die -- how difficult would that be?  Could you do it?  The scene with the father telling the daughters to stay with their mother, that \\"he\\" would be getting onto another boat, the elderly couple holding each other in their beds while the water fills their stateroom, the woman trying to get her children to relax and sleep....the captain standing alone at the helm just before the water rushes in --- THOSE are the moments of real emotional connections.  The \\"fictional\\" characters move through the ship and past the real characters to reveal \\"their\\" story (if you look for it), and that is why I really like this movie. <br /> <br />Now, the primary reason I think this is \\"flawed\\" is let us consider the \\"narrator\\" for a moment.  The Narrator is a 101 year old Rose retelling \\"her\\" story about being on Titanic.  It is supposed to be her \\"Point of View\\" (POV)  If that is true -- she would ONLY know what happens in her immediate area.  She would not \\"know\\" about Mr. Lovejoy hitting Jack in the stomach while handcuffed, she would not \\"know\\" of the owner speaking to the captain about increasing the speed, she would not \\"know\\" her mother, the countess and the third woman did not want to sit with Molly Brown, the entire Jack playing cards and winning his ticket and running / jumping onto the ship, finding his room, the dialogue between the captain and the radio operator --- etc --- any scene that Rose is not \\"actually in\\", she could not truly be telling to the present day men.  It is a \\"flawed\\" POV and once you notice that, they story itself does seem a bit flawed too (and I do apologize to anyone that now views the movie and notices \\"this\\" flaw) which is why I rated it only 4 stars. <br /> <br />Watch this movie.  Watch it, and look for the little stories that happen behind the \\"romance\\" and I think you'll \\"get it\\".  Yes, the line that Paxton says at the end is \\"corny\\", but in a way, it is true. <br /> <br />Enjoy --- <br /> <br />
B0006B29Z2|5.0|Many people might wonder how Iron Maiden got to where they are today.  This DVD set certainly answers the question.  It includes 3 full length concerts from the early 80s (2 with Bruce, 1 with Paul) plus a bootleg concert video from before the first album!  Also included on this is a 95 min. documentary on the early days of the band.  It features Steve and other previous members of the band talking about the beggining- the first gig, the making of Eddie, why certain members left, etc.  And thats not all- many other things are included too, like rare british tv peformances from the early 80s, and promotional videos for some of the songs (including \\"women in uniform\\").   <br /> <br />Overall, this a great buy for any Maiden fan.  And it is also a great value!  Buy it today
6301174240|4.0|When Michael Jackson's \\"Moonwalker\\" was released on video in early 1989... Michael Jackson was still the king of pop.  If anything, this could be the final stand of this amazing chapter of his career (beginning with the release of Thriller and ending here). <br /> <br />Michael Jackson's \\"Bad\\" album was a great record,  while it wasn't as good as Thriller or Off The Wall, it was still as satisfying a followup one could expect.  He had 7 big hits (5 #1's) off this album and a massively successful world tour.   This video montage was released as his tour (which included a very young Sheryl Crow) was winding down,  and it provided a big treat for his fans... <br /> <br />Here's what was included: <br />-  Man In The Mirror - a live performance of the #1 hit (the music video for the song only had about 5 seconds of MJ) <br />-  a classic MJ video montage - a neat little megamix going from the Jackson Five days through the Bad album. <br />-  Badder - a remake of the Bad video but with kids featuring Brandon Adams as a mini-MJ.  Cute but not one of the highlights of the set. <br />-  Speed Demon - a mini movie making great usage of the claymation boom of the late 1980's (ie. California Raisins).  MJ fighting against Claymation paparazzi and animated as a rabbit.  The highlight of the video is the end when motorcycle clad MJ and the bunny have a dance-off. <br />-  Leave Me Alone - music video that got plenty of MTV/VH1 airplay back in the day.  MJ basically saying what he feels about the tabloids by opening himself up as an amusement park. <br />-  Smooth Criminal - the centerpiece of this collection.  An extended mini-movie also featuring Joe Pesci (right before Lethal Weapon and Home Alone took him to the next level and made him an A-list star) as an evil drug lord intent on pushing drugs to kids.  Great special effects, including Michael morphing into a car as well as a spaceship in the climatic finale. <br />-  Come Together - the end of Smooth Criminal leads us to alive performance of the Beatles classic, which didn't appear on a MJ album until HIStory six years later. <br />-  The Moon Is Walking - over the closing credits, is another video with MJ and Ladysmith Black Mambaso.
B000002VBY|4.0|This is rock, and it sure does roll!  I love Krokus.  There ain't NO B.S. when it comes to Krokus.  I like the song Headhunter a whole lot, Night Wolf is superb, and so is Eat the Rich.  But by far my favorite part of this Krokus album is White Din/Russian Winter.  This little mini-suite really evokes a time of revolution.  We Americans, I think, sometimes don't have a sense of history like Swiss people do.  I think the Swiss people like to look at the history of the world from their neutral stance, and I think Krokus got at the insanity of the 1917 revolution with these songs.  I actually gives me the shivers everytime I hear them.  I think everyone should buy this album.
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|the market has been flooded with Michael Jackson collections the past few years, and sadly this box set doesn't correct any of the mistakes. Every MJ collection so far, including this, has intentionally left off at least one major hit, why? So Sony can sell another copy of Thriller.<br /><br />If I was in charge of compiling the collection, using four discs (and the bonus tracks). I would make it look like this.<br /><br />Disc 1 (1968-1976)<br /><br />Would start off with \\"Big Boy\\", and then segue into all the solo and Jackson Five Motown hits, and would end the disc with \\"Enjoy Yourself\\", the Jacksons' first big Epic hit<br /><br />Disc 2 (1978-1983)<br /><br />Would start off with the one-two punch of \\"Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground)\\" and \\"Blame It On The Boogie\\" from the Destiny album, then put five tracks (the four singles and \\"Working Day And Night\\") off Off The Wall, then a few Triumph tracks (\\"Can You Feel It\\" and \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\") and then throw in \\"Someone In The Dark\\" from the E.T. Soundtrack and include some of the Thriller tracks for the rest of the disc (as I consider Thriller the ultimate MJ album... I'd put the whole cd on it), but would save \\"Billie Jean\\" as a leadoff for the third disc since the song is such a great leadoff track.<br /><br />Disc 3 (1983-1992)<br /><br />Would start with \\"Billie Jean\\" and whatever remaining Thriller tracks left. Knowing Paul McCartney hates Michael, \\"Say Say Say\\" wouldn't be on here though it deserves to be. Would then throw in \\"Farewell My Summer Love\\", a track MJ recorded for Motown in the early 70's but sat unreleased until his Thriller success. Then throw in \\"Somebody's Watching Me\\" with Rockwell, \\"State Of Shock\\" from Victory, and \\"We Are The World\\". Then would throw all the Bad hits in. And start on Dangerous.<br /><br />Disc 4 (1992-2004)<br /><br />The rest of the Dangerous hits, three tracks from HIStory (\\"Scream\\", \\"You Are Not Alone\\", \\"Earth Song\\"), \\"Blood On The Dance Floor\\", two Invincible tracks(\\"You Rock My World\\" and \\"Butterflies\\") and 2003's \\"One More Chance\\".<br /><br />The rest of the space on these discs would have the unreleased tracks.<br /><br />If Sony had compiled the collection more like this, I would've bought it without flinching. MJ's latter music IMO doesn't deserve to be as represented as it has, as the 69-92 music is much better IMO
B00004KD11|3.0|The very first album from Deep Purple isn't a classic, but it is a very good representation of late 60's psychedelia. The band was able prove even at this early stage what excellent musicians they were but not terribly gifted songwriters as the over abundance of covers may indicate. Everyone knows \\"Hush\\", which is a cool song but I'm sorry it's NOT their best song, it's just not possible. Yes, Purple was a much different band in 1968 then in 1970, but what they would do with the Mach 2 lineup would create the beast known as heavy metal, \\"Shades\\" is just heavy acid rock. Evans was a good singer but to compare him to Gillan is just dumb. Blackmore is a god but not because of songs like \\"Mandrake Root\\", \\"And the Address\\" and \\"Hey Joe\\"(not as good as Hendrix but close), although his budding genius shows up on these tracks which are arguably the best on this lp. Ritchie's playing on much of \\"Shades\\" seems very derivative of Hendrix at this stage of his career, that would change. \\"Help\\" is very good as well, but to say it is better than the Beatles is a stretch and I'm much more a Purple fan than a Beatles fan. Deep Purple would evolve their sound and become much better, especially as a live band once Gillan and Glover joined. Bonus tracks are kind of unnecessary, nothing special so why are they on here? Fans of Purple do need this record, as well as 60's fans, but metal fans beware...
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I am a big fan of the character, so I enjoyed the theatrical release.  However, I thought the director's cut was much better. <br />There was a more substantive plot with this version, and the overall movie was much more cohesive.
6305508550|4.0|This film is such an accurate satire of today's enclosed corporate environment that it's almost surreal.  It was recommended to me by a couple of colleagues @ work and now I well understand why.  All of the usual office politics, personnel clashes, annoying bureaucracy, ever-present red tape, silly rules / policies and the fixation of management on meaningless matters.<br /><br />While watching this movie I sometimes almost felt like I was AT work myself.  A few of the incidents brought back vivid memories of instances that I've experienced.  I'm sure that most people who work in an office will find a whole lot in this story that they can relate to, just as I did.<br /><br />The one big name in the cast is Jennifer Anniston (big hair and all!) who portrays a fed-up waitress.  She doesn't have too many lines but she is the one bona-fide celebrity who appears on the screen.  I don't recall seeing any of the other actors in anything else.<br /><br />If you're a white color worker (and perhaps even if you're not a white color worker) then this film is certainly worth a look.  I would especially recommend it to persons in management as they just MIGHT understand how foolish they look in front of the working bees whenever they make stupid decisions.  Yes, for management types this flick might be VERY humbling indeed.
0316779237|5.0|This book got me through November and December, two months when I'm weighed down with holiday depression. Sedaris crafts these stories with sincerity and humor and he makes you ponder how such events could ever happen. You'll read the book in a matter of hours because of its shortness, but the following year, you'll want to pick it up again and revisit the hilarity.
B00005JN0T|5.0|This is, in short, perhaps the greatest movie that deals with Artificial Intelligence there ever was.  All of the usual motifs are there (robots yearning to become human, etc) but the film has a sufficient number of twists and turns to deliver a story that is both familiar and fresh at the same time.<br /><br />While I've never been a huge fan of Will Smith, he has starred in several fabulous movies.  This is one of them.  To his credit, he plays his role with convincing authority and also demonstrates a vulnerability altogether missing from most previous roles.<br /><br />If you're a fan of CGI special effects, this is an absolute for your DVD collection.  However, the best news is that there is much more TO this film than the eye-candy effects!  That's something pretty rare to see in a high-budget FX film in this day & age.  As a matter of fact, I would argue that this film would STILL be worth seeing even if (hypothetically) it was made with 1960s technology.  However, for your FX fans out there, you can relax.  The FX this film has are nothing short of stunning.<br /><br />So, if you're into action films, sci-fi, AI or cerebral films you will find something in the present film to like.  If you don't, then I'm not sure what could possibly please your cinematic appetite!
B0001ZX0OM|2.0|What a sad little disappointment this movie was.... or should  say the longest disappointment of my life.  The story moves along soooooo slooooooowly that I fell asleep 4 times before finally finishing it.    Sean Penn tries too hard; and if it's possible, Tim Robbins tries even harder.  I just didn't buy it.  The whole thing was ridiculous, and it had the potential to be really great.  I just don't see what all the fuss was about.
B0002OERI0|1.0|When it comes to \\"real\\" music by artists who mean it, you should avoid the mainstream music scene at all costs. <br /> <br />Which is currently populated by dreadful whiny boy bands like \\"Simple Plan\\" who are absoultely pathetic and are just out to make money - not music - which should make alot more people than it does, sick. <br /> <br />Green Days new album \\"American Idiot\\" sounds way to polished and sounds nothing like their previous \\"punk rock\\" records which they developed musically each time. <br /> <br />But now this - I can't even believe \\"Simple Plan\\" have are touring with them. They are without a doubt the most dreadful popular band around at the moment. <br />It won't be long before they have sold out and are forgotten. <br /> <br />Green Day have made an album which is totally wrong and out of place in what they should of done. And have not only embarresed their fans, but in a few years they will have embarressed themselves to by realising how \\"Punk poppy\\" they had become, with their war crazy war ideas and opinions. Which was all the rage to be singing about at the time. <br />For goodness sake, its not gonna change anyones opinion on whats going on in the world. Keep your opinion to yourself. <br />We've had a guts full of it thanks very much! <br /> <br />On this album, they no longer sound dangerous - although Billie Joe Armstrong(songwriter/singer/guitarist) believes they do. <br /> <br />If you want to hear the real Green Day I suggest getting Insomniac or Nimrod. (Dookie is overated in my opinion)
6305910340|5.0|The reviewer below was right. Josh Waitzkin repeatedly did say but I'm not him. The person who gave it 1 star also misses the point that the story is indeed true. Josh waitzkin grew up playing chess in Washington Square Park and played against homless thugs. He was later taught by Bruce Pandolfini and won many National championships. He used to be the #1 ranked under 18 US player, but I don't know what he is now. He is currently an IM (International Master) though and wrote the book Attacking Chess.
B0000026WD|4.0|With the release of \\"Dangerous\\" in 1991, Michael Jackson had lost Quincy Jones as a producer. That move lessened his career somewhat, but \\"Dangerous\\" proved to be a good album anyway. <br />1. Jam: great, catchy song. 10/10 <br />2. Why You Wanna Trip on Me: great guitar solo. 10/10 <br />3. In the Closet: haunting and superb. 10/10 <br />4. She Drives Me Wild: stupid. Worst track on the album. 5/10 <br />5. Remember the Time: GREAT. You can dance to it as well. 10/10 <br />6. Can't Let Her Get Away: nothing spectacular. 7/10 <br />7. Heal the World: good message, but not effective. 8/10 <br />8. Black or White: the album's huge #1 hit, its a fabulous pop song with an important message. 10/10 <br />9. How is it: uhhh, listenable but not that good. 6/10 <br />10. Give in to Me: fantastic. Guitar by SLASH. 10/10 <br />11. Will You Be There: a church choir? It works. 9/10 <br />12. Keep the Faith: good enough but forgettable. 8/10 <br />13. Gone Too Soon: a beautiful song. 10/10 <br />14. Dangerous: the title track . . . catchy. 10/10 <br />There you have it. Fourteen tracks, eight of which are outstanding, the rest are average. Is it as good as Michael's previous albums? No. But is it worth getting? I'd say so.
0670033375|5.0|This is a fascinating examination of how ecologically speaking, we may be doomed to repeat history's mistakes due to the lack of their immediacy to our consciousness. The prospect of self-preservation on a societal level can be a daunting one, but it is a profound question author Jared Diamond handles with skill and panache in his sweeping book. He primarily covers four extinct civilizations, showing how human-led environmental damage was at least partially responsible for their devastation and illustrating how the ramifications of such behavior persist today. As an evolutionary biologist trained in biochemistry and physiology, Diamond deftly uses comparative methods in his areas of expertise, such as archaeology and anthropology, to marshal evidence that sustaining societies over time depends primarily on the quality of human interaction with the environment. His arguments are compelling and act as a direct counterpoint to more common thinking where ideology, culture, politics and economics help shape the course of history. But the author is far more focused on what they bear on the far more important relationship society has with its climate, geography and natural resources.<br /><br />The overriding theme of human history, the author feels, is that societies aren't murdered; they commit suicide. He uses the Viking settlements on the coast of Greenland as a prime example. While it did get colder in Greenland in the early 1400's, it didn't get so cold as to make it uninhabitable. The Inuit survived long after the Norse died out, and the Norse had all kinds of advantages, including a more diverse food supply, iron tools, and ready access to Europe. The problem was that the Norse simply couldn't adapt to the country's changing environmental conditions. Human accountability also shaped the fate of Easter Island where seafaring Polynesians settled over a thousand years ago. They cut the trees for canoes and firewood and used logs to help transport huge statues weighing as much as 80 tons. Eventually, they chopped down all the forests, and their society collapsed in an epidemic of cannibalism. By 1600, all of the trees and land birds on Easter Island were extinct. Diamond covers similarly fatalistic behavior in the native American Anasazi tribe in the southwestern U.S. and the Mayan civilization in Central America.<br /><br />Diamond's perspective is not just historical, as he discusses in depth what is happening now in Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, China, and Australia, as well as in Montana, a state that once was among the wealthiest in the nation but now struggles with poverty, population decline, and environmental problems. The author remains hopeful by giving more uplifting examples of societies that have found ways to sustain themselves without overexploiting their environments. His conclusion is that what determines a society's fate is how well its leaders and citizens anticipate problems before they become crises and how decisively a society responds. But as we know, and as Diamond corroborates, many societies, including ours, suffer from short-sightedness and political selfishness, which prevent us from seeing the scope of the potential destruction. But it is hopeful, the author asserts, that the U.S. has reduced major air pollutants by a quarter over the past thirty years, as energy consumption and population have risen forty percent. The author's guarded optimism signals a need to take so-called green issues more seriously than we have in the past. Strongly recommended reading.as 80 tons.

B00004I9VE|5.0|I don't know how to classify \\"Thriller.\\" Sure, it's an album, but it's really more of a legend. Michael Jackson created history when he released it. It became the biggest-selling album in the world; practically every track was a chart-topper. And, even now in 2005, it still sounds excellent. <br />Of course, the title track is the most famous, most notably for the groundbreaking music video that went along with it. However, my favorite track is \\"Beat It,\\" a semi-rock song with an amazing guitar solo by Eddie Van Halen. \\"Billie Jean\\" is a great dance song. As a matter of fact, every track was good--and that's rare.  <br />\\"Thriller\\" is probably in my top 10 favorite albums. It was so revolutionary when it came out in 1982, and twenty-three years later, it hasn't lost its edge. <br />1. Wanna Be Startin' Somethin': great beat. 10/10 <br />2. Baby Be Mine: catchy but forgettable 8/10 <br />3. The Girl is Mine: duet with Paul McCartnet. Great. 10/10 <br />4. Thriller: CLASSIC. 10/10 <br />5. Beat It: best track on the album. 10/10 <br />6. Billie Jean: one of the greatest dance songs. 10/10 <br />7. Human Nature: another Top 10 hit. Pretty Good. 9/10 <br />8. PYT: Uhh, good but not too memorable. 8/10 <br />9. The Lady in My Life: nice ballad. 10/10
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I found this Cd to be better than IOWA but not as good as thier first cd.This cd does however show coreys actual singing abilitys with the vermillion tracks. While slipknot isnt for everyone if you are a fan of them you will enjoy this cd, and if your not sure of them or have never heard them depending on your music tastes you may want to get thier 1st cd or this one. <br />to those of you that are bad mouthing the fans and the band, post your opinions but if your going to throw out insults make sure they actually can hold water. corey cant sing? vermillions 1 & 2 or maybe you should see them live where corey doesnt scream so much as he sings all the songs.not to mention that all that screaming is actually incredibly hard to do for a whole song let alone the 2 hours they perform. when you can do better then you can throw out comments like that. point out flaws in the music, dont just say \\"they are for geeks who dont know music\\" because YOUR idea of music may not be the same as MINE. free speech free opinion.
B000001ESP|5.0|When this record originally came out I was a fading Rush fan.  I absolutely loved everything from 2112 to Hemispheres, including the live album, but Permanent Waves left me cold and I thought this band had jumped the shark (although we wouldn't have used that term back in those days!)<br /><br />Over the years Moving Pictures has gained a reputation as the strongest Rush record and after careful consideration I agree with that.  Side 1 alone is a mini greatest hits with four of their best coming at you one after the other.  Side 2 isn't quite as well-known but \\"The Camera Eye\\" satisfies the Prog quotient and \\"Vital Signs\\" is very catchy.<br /><br />\\"Red Barchetta\\" has always been one of my favorite Rush songs ever, with lyrics that tell a story and great music to match.  The instrumental jam in the middle adds some more excitement, as you can actually feel our hero speeding along in his Red Barchetta fleeing the Anti-Car Police.  Environmentalist-types won't like the message though!<br /><br />\\"YYZ\\" is a very well-known instrumental that I wish had been extended to \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" proportions.  Alex Lifeson lays down some great guitar work.  Very Nice.<br /><br />\\"Tom Sawyer\\" is a rocking opener and the record's hit.  \\"Limelight\\" is yet another classic-rock radio staple with another killer guitar solo.<br /><br />It's hard enough to find recordings that are strong all the way through, especially today but even back in the LP days when records were MUCH shorter.  Moving Pictures is not only strong from start to finish, it's absolutely jam-packed with classic tracks. It's also Proggy enough for an old Proghead like me.<br /><br />And to add to the debate, I once dated a girl who loved Rush, but in general girls do hate Prog.
B00005JL1C|5.0|I have made several people completely disgusted with me on the account of watching this movie over and over again. I can never get enough of the style and the perfect cast it just couldnt get any better. I am still stuck in the 80's and movies like this an For Keeps is a big part why. I love this film because it is a tale of what can occur when love takes Over. P.S.  Molly ringwald i love you forever and Andrew MCcarthy your a king!!!!!
B0006A9FMI|2.0|As a longtime fan of the GITS canon, I was eagerly awaiting the US release of Innocence... I wasn't disappointed in the film, it's one of the best anime I've ever seen and a worthy addition to the Ghost in the Shell universe. However, I have to say that the DVD is a huge let-down. First off is the cover art... Absolute crap. I found a link to the artists' original cover art, before he sent it off to Dreamworks, and it looks ten times better. Next up is the DVD insert. Wait, there's no insert. Strike two. Finally, how on Earth does Dreamworks think they can get away with publishing such a fantastically popular film in the States without a dubbed track, and with the only English subtitle track constantly spewing crap like, <br /> <br />\\"{rain falling}\\" ... \\"{gun shot}\\" ?? <br /> <br />Ridiculous. If you're going ton include a hearing-impaired subtitle track, fine, just don't make it the -only- English subtitle track! I can only hope that a \\"Special Edition\\" is in the works, to fix what should have been in the first pressing. <br /> <br />Film: ***** DVD: *
0756902401|4.0|Robert M. Pirsig begins his quest for truth and the 'why' of existence by taking the reader on a trip across America with his young son, Chris. To be honest, I thought this book was going the director of \\"On The Road\\"- the protagonists of both books travelling the country and learning a lesson at the terminus. But this novel has a deeper purpose, which Pirsig explains through his digressions throughout the book which divulge the details of his dissent into mental illness. I was mesmorised by the amount of detail Pirsig puts into the novel- from the descriptions and subsequent explanations of his dreams to the relative triviality of his cross-country trip. A note of warning- this book is not for the faint-hearted. If philosophy is not your thing, then steer clear of this novel. Even though philosophy is one of my favourite subjects, I found the book a bit tedious at times. That said, Pirsig is an excellent writer and does a superb job of transporting the reader right into his mind during every step of his descent into madness. \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" is a must-read on the subjects of philosophy and mental illness.

B0006399FS|1.0|A review can be taken from \\"Maximun U2\\" sleeve: <br /> <br />\\"This is an spoken word product and contains no original music by the artist\\" <br /> <br />We are not allowed to copying, hiring, lending, broadcasting, recording or renting ( in any manner ) any official U2 stuff. <br />Neverthless U2 are allowed to copying, hiring, lending, broadcasting, recording or renting themselves in any manner, for worse... any time they want. <br /> <br />The dream of a new Joshua Tree is no longer worth swallowing. <br /> <br />A good deal of U2 fame derived from their extraordinary ability to reinvent themselves. But by 2000 that magic had vanished and crushed. U2 are now an incoherent scale of those golden years. That's essentially sado-masochistic. <br /> <br />Sadly, yet many fans deny such commercial aspects from the former rebel ( 80's ) and experimental ( 90's ) band. Because is relatively simply stated and easy grasp, yet in many U2 forum fans who dislike this glamoured product are treated badly. <br /> <br />\\"Maximun U2\\" sleeve has the perfect review indeed, don't forget it. <br /> <br />\\"This is an spoken word product and contains no original music by the artist\\". <br />

Every song is class and fits the album. And thats all 16 of them. Roger Daltrey's vocals are amazing. Petes guitar and synth work is mind blowing. And Keith Moons drumming. Man you'll know why he was the man when you've heard this album. And lets not forget John Enwistles awesome bass work, that holds it all together and drives it along with Keith. THIS IS THEE ALBUM. If you've never heard this album you're missing the finest ROCK album ever recorded. ITS ABSOLUTLEY ESSENTIAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000VAFO0|1.0|One star for the always sexy hot/good looking Kate Beckinsale is all I can say about this movie, and I mean...wow! I guess in some aspects that's MAYBE a SLIGHTLY good reason for purchasing this movie, because let me tell you something, us guys DEFINITELY weren't complaining when we first feasted our eyes on her tight leather clad character! <br />But despite that one bonus point it is to this day, Miss Beckinsale has still yet to make a movie that doesn't suck (terribly). I mean COME ON! Does anyone really take her seriously in her Blade esque nay rip-off film role? Of course not! She looks like someone you could knock over with a feather, she hasn't even got that 'tough girl' demon slayer image feel to her, it's basically wrong actor for the wrong type of film. <br /> <br />And no immediate original super-spectacular feast for the eyes found here either, I can also say that perhaps the 'other' good thing about this movie is that the acting is just ever so BARELY above average. <br /> <br />Overall, waste of time, should've and could've been better.
B00000099Y|5.0|Well it's obvious to see there are a lot of die hard Tool fans here and also teeny boppers who wanted to know what all the fuss about this album is about, but have bagged it instead.  Well after some 25 years of listening music, I thought I would like to share my views on this album.  First of all you need to take a look back to 1996 where I am sure half of the reviewers here were more interested listening to pop(face it, there are not alot of pre-teens who are into metal before they can tell the time on a watch).    In 1996, there still were some strong forces in the Metal Scene: Metallica, White Zombie, Pantera etc, however when Aenima was released, fans of metal and alternative music were astonished with the release of this album.  Why?  Because Tool have never been a metal band or an alternative band, they are like Pink Floyd, an experimental band, who Maynard has said in  interviews that they are big influences.  Tool are also an experimental band, who don't fit any genre.  How can they when tracks range from less than a minute to over 15 minutes?      There is no use comparing them to other metal bands who do not make music like Tool.  There is no use comparing them to alternative bands either.  Tool are unique and Aenima is a very unique album.  Yes not everyone is going to like it.... If you want lots of melody then this album is not really for you as Tool are not interested in releasing songs to make the general public happy.  I won't even bother telling you which songs on this album are the best as everyone has their own opinions.    What I will talk about is the production of this album instead.  It is simply flawless, this is why Aenima is such a listenable album.  Danny's drumming is absolutely brilliant and makes every song have such depth.  Not bad for an album now nearly 9 years old.  When Tool toured back in 1997, they played songs that are on this album just as perfect as the studio release.  This indicates the brilliance of the band's ability to play just as good live, which is why this album is one of the strongest albums to be released back in 1996.  Many metal bands polish the studio releases then sound absolutely terrible live, but not Tool.  (Hmm reminds me of Pink Floyd, who were also just as good live as in the studio.)  Anyone see a pattern here?    If you want to blow your mind, take Aenima to a Home Theatre Shop that allows you to play your favourite song on an AV system which only audiophiles own.  Try Hooker with a Penis or Aenema on speakers from B&W or Linn and then you will be convinced why Aenima is such an excellent album.    Have I gotten angry that some people don't like this album? No.  Do I go on that this is the best album ever? No.  I will say however that it was the best album to be released back in 1996 and is still one of the best produced and best sounding albums ever made.  Well done Tool and David Botrill.  Even the vinyl copy I own sounds brilliant.    I think I have justified why the album deserves 5 stars.

0393035158|4.0|Sam Harris takes an unpopular but interesting position when it comes to the Religious moderates.  He makes his point from the start and even if the reader disagrees with his premise, Mr. Harris is able to drive his point home in such a way that even a skeptic would fine it hard to refute.   <br /> <br />Overall, I found it to be an excellent book but I had to take exception that all the blame lies with the Moderates. For example, page 45, end of the first paragraph reads:  <br />\\"Religious moderates are, in large part, responsible for religious  <br />conflict in the world, because their beliefs provide the context in which scriptural literalism and religious violence can never be adequately opposed\\"  <br />Though I am opposed to religion in any form or degree, I would say that Sam Harris had \\"missed the mark\\" even just a little by blaming it all on the moderates.  After all, its not as if we are experiencing a global up swell of vocal Freethinkers, Humanist, and Atheists, united in the effort to eradicate irrational thinking and superstition from the minds and hearts of our fellow men....  <br />Some of the blame finds itself planted firmly at the door steps of the silent, do-nothing, rational thinking non-believers of which, I too am a silent member.  <br /> <br />Yes, a moderate is far better than an extremist but if one disagrees with critical annalist of religious beliefs is to be a coward of analyzing one's own faith.     <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|So this is the best kind of review: from a listener fresh to the table with no opinion of what has gone before, of who U2 have been sleeping with in the past. Get this: I DON'T CARE! I am taking Atomic Bomb on its merits, and I just love listening to this album.  <br />It's obvious that the test of time will tell here, but I think this one will be the most appreciated U2 album since Achtung - but wait, I'm not supposed to be comparing. <br />I love City of Blinding Lights - that OOOh OOOh refrain and the guitar lick are both going on my mobile phone. In fact, the guitar and melodies on this album are SO catchy. Miracle Drug came on in this cafe the other day and I was bopping with my cappucino. Sometimes You Can't Make It.... what a gem. Love and Peace hits the heights and A Man and A Woman really sends me to another place. <br />Oh and the so-called \\"obscure\\" lyrics. Vertigo is clearly a song about TEMPTATION; Sometimes You Can't... is about a father-son relationship; Just listen to the words, people. I love these lyrics. <br />I find myself walking along the street and one of the riffs or lines from Atomic Bomb just drifts into my head and I start singing. Now that doesn't happen very often with me. So it must mean this is a fine album. <br />
B00004XPP0|5.0|This Star Wars is the best of all the futuristic films from previous years and of those that came after, in my opinion.  It had all the makings of a good film allowing the viewer to see in the future with the possibility that this could happen yet maintain the familiar humanity we cherish.  Star Trek sitcom may have played a small part in some features of this film, but the majority was originally orchestrated and what most futuristic films today are based upon.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina Aguilera burst into the big time a couple years ago with what to this day is the best song of her career, \\"Genie In A Bottle.\\" Hot on the heels of Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson-a gorgeous teenage blonde girl with a breathtaking voice-she rode on the crest of teen success filling the charts. 2002 and the sweet innocence is long gone. I have to admit, however, \\"Lady Marmalade\\" provided a lot of sassy fun and her collaboration with Ricky Martin in \\"Nobody Wants To Be Lonely\\" was downright stunning. But the \\"Lady Marmalade\\" collaboration gave a good indication that Christina was keen to distance herself from her teenybopper peers and show the world that she is a real diva. She just barely succeeds with 'Stripped', which sooner portrays her as just another sweet-teen-pop-idol-gone-(...) rather than a genuine powerful diva. From start to finish Stripped is as full-on bold and over the top as most of Christina's outfits. The most frustrating error she made with 'Stripped' was that the potential this disc had was drowned out by something more potent and less appealing. The empowerment and modest tenderness of \\"The Voice Within,\\" \\"I'm OK,\\" \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\" and \\"Soar\\" are overwhelmed by the in-your-face filth and overt anger of \\"Fighter,\\" \\"Make Over,\\" \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" and \\"Dirrty.\\" It didn't help that the only songs from 'Stripped' that made it on radio were the angrier, dirtier cuts (the extremely minor hit \\"The Voice Within\\" and the album's best-accepted smash \\"Beautiful\\" being the only exceptions). Not to say it doesn't have its standout tracks-because it does-but 'Stripped' heavily lacks the unique charm and sweetness of its predecessors. And those hoping for an addicting pop cut, along the same lines as \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" will be left extremely cold with 'Stripped.' The closest this album ever gets to pop is in its uninteresting, often icky ballads. So. Yet another point must be made-if you truly enjoyed her debut, chances are not unlikely that you will despise her second attempt (I'm not counting the non-albums 'Mi Riflejo,' 'My Kind Of Christmas' and 'Just Be Free,' all of which provided little original material). The prissy, radio-friendly pop is left far behind, and almost too abruptly replaced with heavy, hard-hitting R&B, hip hop, and even a bit of blues (the Billie Holiday-esque \\"Walk Away\\" being the best example of the aforementioned genre). The not-icky tracks are the funky womens' anthem \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" the barely tolerable \\"Fighter,\\" the Latin-inspired \\"Infatuation,\\" the compassionate ballad \\"Beautiful,\\" and the jaw-dropping but catchy \\"Get Mine, Get Yours,\\" whose topic is casual sex. The album's lead single, the party anthem \\"Dirrty\\" was a song that I loathed for the longest time.....it is musically and lyrically offensive, I couldn't handle its angry insanity. And yet lately, it seems to be growing on me. Like Britney Spears' \\"My Prerogative,\\" its crackling, furious funk will rub a few too many listeners the wrong way, but if you give it a chance to grow on you, you may be in for a pleasant surprise. I enjoy it now in small doses-sometimes we are in the mood to get 'dirrty,' and that's when this song triumphs. Another mild perk of this disc is Aguilera's voice-it is still as clear and beautiful as an Alaskan stream, and yet has the power and impact of a juggernaut. Whether she's belting out the chorus of a ballad or shouting the verses of a dance track, her breathtaking vocals stay in tact. She still lacks restraint, but as she states in the album's booklet, 'real' voices come with imperfections. Sadly, though, better tracks like \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" and \\"Beautiful\\" do little to deviate from the monotony of tracks like \\"Underappreciated\\" and the irritating \\"Make Over.\\" And because this album is so long, its more memorable cuts get lost in the murk. Unlike her debut, which was a smooth, easy listen, this is explosively angry, loud, dirty, and in-your-face....and its slower filler is dull, depressing, and meaningful but hopelessly un-catchy. If you are a hardcore fan of Aguilera and can tolerate any and all reinventions that may come her way, then you might like this, as should R&B enthusiasts. It really has a unique, jazzy, rebellious feel that sometimes you're just in the mood to hear. If you fell in love with the old, poppy Christina, this will make you grimace, so stay away. I'm reluctantly rewarding this CD four stars for Christina's voice and its handful of pleasing tracks, but it is a far less solid 4 stars than her debut.
B000268QB2|5.0|Keane's album is fabulous all the way through.  They give rival bands Coldplay a run for their money!   The songwriting is fabulous, and  I love the songs' smooth landscapes. You can tell that they put a lot of effort in the performances and the music.  The music is mostly pop and piano driven, but there are shades of an electronica-like sound in some parts that keyboardist Tim Rice Oxley does. Tracks 4 to 7 are the standouts after the first 3 high-charged numbers.  She Has No Time and Your Eyes Open are among the most addictive. Tom Chaplin has such a nice falsetto voice, my goodness!   Sunshine, Untitled 1 and Bedshaped are also strong songs.  It took me 8 months after the May release to get this album and I have to kick myself for not getting it earlier.  This is such a dynamic first effort for this trio and I hope that they get more promotion on it.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I have always wanted this collection but never was motivated to plop down $100+ for it until I broke my arm.  My mother and temporary caretaker could not find anything we could agree on to watch.  Now, war documentary is the last thing my mom would watch if not tied down with a gun pointed to her head, but I convinced her that when I saw this on TV in the seventies, Jimmy Stewart was on this show all the time talking about his squadron leader experiences, she said, \\"OK, let's watch it.\\"  And indeed, Col. Stewart is one of the interviewees credited.  Problem is, we watched 2 2-sided DVD's before seeing Mr. Stewart's very fine, but brief, explanation of the reason for strategic bombing and its effectiveness. And off he went to shoot the \\"Shootist\\" or fly to the \\"Airport 77\\" set or whatever. HE NEVER IS SHOWN AGAIN.  I guess I was so impressed at the age of 12 simply by the fact that an actor who was already a star would risk everything to go and fight in this war that I remembered him being in every real.<br /><br />N'importe!  as our sometime ally would say.  There is no star in World at War. Unless it is the documentarist, Jeremy Isaacs, or the crowds of civilians in film from Leningrad, Dresden, London, etc., as they wake up to death and devestation, rebuilding and reshoring themselves instead of allowing themselves to feel defeated.<br /><br />Today WAW is difficult to watch because we are used to the Ken Burns style of using acting and sound effects to bring the protaganists \\"alive\\". Any guest interviewees are expected to keep within the dramatic framework.  In WAW, what we get is newsreel-type film and a bunch of talking heads, not chosen for their acting ability (although the aforementioned Col. Stewart might be there for a Hollywood draw).  So it takes some patience to listen to.  But it is well worth it.  If you want to know anything about World War II, you want to hear Mitsuo Fuchido talk about the details before and after the Pearl Harbor attack.  You want to hear Albert Speer tell of how, from the inside, the rotting of the great Third Reich became obvious to all within, even as the Allies were closing in.  You want to hear Mrs. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's first nauseating understanding, from a fellow market customer in Berlin, of where the \\"resettlers\\" were really being taken in the crowded freight trains they saw daily.  Perhaps it was she who told her husband, the great theologian, eventually hung for attempting to kill the Fuehrer.<br /><br />Then there is John Kenneth Gilbraith, Kay Summersby (Ike's secretary and possibly a leetle bit more), and oh.  Ladies.  You haven't lived until you've seen Stephen Ambrose with a ponytail.<br /><br />But the most poignant talking head...and she who seems to remember the most detail of the key personage of the war...is Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary during the last 2 years of his life.  Given her appearance in 1973, she could not have been more than 17 at the time.  And since of course there are no newsreels to complement her story, she tells it all.  And very well.<br /><br />WAW was long, but it was written as a season-long television series.  In some ways, it's better viewed piece by piece, if only because of the more disturbing reports. It is said that if citizens could see what was going on in World War II as it happened, it would have ended sooner.  I don't know if it would have ended sooner (sometimes the best way of ending a war is winning it); but WAW brought WWII in our living rooms in the same way Vietnam had come into our living rooms in the 70's, providing a chance for a great deal of debate that had been absent in discussions hence about that conflict.want to hear Albert Speer tell of how, from the inside, the rotting of the great Third Reich became obvious to all within, even as the Allies were closing in.

B000003TAR|4.0|First off this is Nirvana's 4th studio recored album.  It was my second Nirvana cd and i personaly think that its great.  However i dont think its Nirvana's best.  I recently perchased Bleach and Incesticide(Nirvana's third album), and I really enjoy those two and would suggest those over In Utero.  Some highlights of the album are Heart-Shapped Box, Rape Me, Dumb, and All Apologies.  I think that Dumb and All Apologies are way better live though. But I enjoy listoning to all of the tracks. I would suggest this ablbum to anyone who likes Nevermind.
B00005JN4O|5.0|This is the best movie that I have seen in probably about 6 months.  Now I know what you are thinking \\"Johnny Deep playing the guy who wrote Peter Pan?  If can never work\\".  That is exactly what I thought until I saw the movie for myself.  The performances by all are excellent and at the end of the day the movie will leave you with a warm feeling, even if you are confused as to how the various elements of the movie combined to give you that warm feeling.   <br /> <br />Its not just got elements of comedy there is also a fair amount of drama and something of a love story in here as well.  Several important life lessons are learned as such as how we all deal with grief individually.  Obviously some liberties were taken with the actual events as they occurred but the movie manages to sprinkle in the Hollywood elements without insulting the audience.  Please give it a chance.   <br /> <br />Overall-10/10  <br />
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A really good cd, it was my first APC cd and i really like it.  I like all of the songs ecspecialy weak and powerless, the outsider, pet, and gravity.  APC is very similar to Tool, but Tool has a hevier sound.  I recomend it to anyone who likes Tool, or anyone who wants to liston to good music.  Also Mer De Noms is very good as well.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I did not see Underworld in theatres. I was always both wary of it due to scathing reviews, and yet curious about it due to its subject matter. When I purchased the \\"Unrated Extended Cut\\" of this film, I was expecting to be disappointed. Instead, I was thoroughly delighted. Read other reviews for a synopsis. I simply want to state that this film is destined to become a cult classic. Some of its many strong points include virtually non-CGI Lycans (even a scene where Lycans are running toward the camera on the walls of a corridor was done with stunt men and digitally erased cables); desaturated color, using digital technology, that provides this film with an amazingly beautiful Gothic look; and some fantastic action sequences that, although occasionally derivative, fit the storyline very well and do not seem forced in the least.  <br /> <br />It's a shame that this extended/recut version of Underworld was not shown in theatres, because the edited theatrical release that generated critical trashing almost assuredly hurt the studio financially. Although I cannot compare the two versions, I can tell you that if audiences had seen this \\"Unrated Extended Cut,\\" Underworld would have been a critical and financial success, and deemed a major milestone in Gothic cinema.  <br /> <br />I do not wish to hype this film, but I do believe you will find it to be a valuable addition to your film library.

B00009V7T2|5.0|Thank You Mars Volta for bringing back True Music and real Rock n Roll the type of Rock n Roll Led Zeppelin fans probably never thought that their might not be a band that are just as good a Led Zeppelin but now their is and their called The Mars Volta! They dont just bring Great Prog-Rock, Hard Rock, but they also bring some Latino into the mix and it souds GREAT!!! TMV might also remind you of Pink Floyd because of their prog-Rock style.  I love the way Cedric (lead singer) sings, hes kinda got a geddy Lee and Robert Plant powerful voice. Televators is my Favorite song cuze the music is just beautiful.  I would recomend The Mars Volta to pleople who enjoy listening to classic Rock bands like led zeppelin, rush, pink floyd etc and hard rock bands like Tool, A Perfect Circle, Nirvana,sound Garden, etc. <br />The Mars Volta is not for everyone but give them a chance you might have to play it a few times to soak it all in..... well thats because you are hearing music at its best <br />also watch out for their new album called \\"Frances The Mute\\" it might be released around March 2005
B00006AG5N|1.0|Elvis wasn't creative, he simply had a pretty face and a good voice to sing other artists creations and take too much credit. I don't like his music.
B00000099Y|5.0|GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!! this is my Favorite Tool album and its just kickass!!!! Listening to the song Aenima in the dark will put images in your head its one of the best songs EVER!  Theirs just something about that band they just make you want to turn that dial up to the MAX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002UAX|5.0|This album is marvellous. I only had to hear BACK IN THE U.S.S.R & DEAR PRUDENCE to fall in love with this album. But you also have great songs like. BLACKBIRD, BIRTHDAY, GLASS ONION, & THE MANIC HELTER SKELTER (which had McCartney's most manic and aggressive vocal performance ever) An intriging and creative double album. Get it...
B00009V7T2|5.0|An amazing album.  Well written and performed.  I love every song.  A lot of production and some might find some of the songs drag on, but just keep listening to it and it will grow on you.  Unless you suck.
B000002UAR|5.0|I can't decide if this or the White Album is the great Beatles album. I love them both. This album is however their most complete and perfect album ever overall...
B0002OERI0|1.0|I wanted this CD for a long time and when I finaly got it it wasnt that great. The only 2 good songs were American Idiot and Boulevard of Broken Dreams and the rest were just filler. Its not worth the money to buy it. I suggest you just buy Boulevard of Broken Dreams or American Idiot because the rest is trash
0441172717|5.0|\\"Dune\\" is the first novel in the \\"Dune Chronicles\\".  The detailed writing style is superb with inventive explanations behind the science fiction physics and the imaginative items plus a fine mixture of politics, warfare, and individual introspection.  The cycle of life on desert planet Arrakis contains well thought out processes from the overall planetary scale to the biological.<br /><br />Aside from fifteen-year-old Paul Atreides, I found one of his mentors Gurney Halleck to be a great character to follow during the story and wish there had been more regarding his background.  The Fremen desert culture has been tempered in the harsh planetary environment, forging a hard society.  The primary attraction to the hostile planet is the spice melange, a poison yet a potent drug to its users and the inhabitants of Arrakis (it even permeates the very air people breathe).  The spices' negative side effects are not completely discussed, leaving me to question whether it is even considered a drug or poison if it doesn't significantly impair a person other than a lifetime addiction to its benefits.<br /><br />At the end of the book, there are excellent appendixes including ecology, religion, and terminology.  As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movies thereby leaving the series entirely to the imagination.<br /><br />I highly recommend the series to any fan of the science fiction genre.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00008ADPF|5.0|This is my fav. Nickelback CD. I love it so much a know ever single song by heart. Song #2 is an excellent song and I can't understand why it isn't a hit single. This truly is an amazing CD and you have to be crazy not to love it.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|First that everything should say that I like avril lavigne from Complicated, the truth although this album is not similar of successful to Let Go I find completely better, Under My Skin has good sales but it cannot overcome Let Go, for my the best Track in the Cd is Nobody's Home, although in the billboard I am stagnated of #42 or something like that is very good, Take My Away is one of my favorite ones  had wanted that it was single,bueno in few words in its entirety the album it is good.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Way too much quoting of this movie from people who think they sound like napoleon.  Other than that this is one of the funniest movies of all time.  Everything in this movie is 100% hysterical.  Ive never seen anything like it.  Hope mtv keeps making movies like this and stops making movies that are supposed to touch your heart???   MTV???
B00007GZR5|5.0|The movie is based on the author's thoughts on the true nature of the afterlife, (as expressed in the foreword of his novel).  The story is both depressing and philosophical.  The scenery and special effects are awe inspiring.  I really recommend this movie, but beware that it is a real kick in the emotions.
B00008EYA5|3.0|The fact that this story is hardly plausible undermines it, and you have to take it for what it is....  An action film with a thin excuse of a story.
0064407667|1.0|I find it inconceivable that people will slam Harry Potter for its lack of Christian values, but recommend the Lemony Snickett series.  That anyone could enjoy a book whose sole plot is a sick old man trying to marry his 14-year-old niece to get her fortune is disturbing to me.  The strange warning to the hook man that Violet is \\"his\\" and a reference to the \\"wedding night\\" are beyond disgusting.  The poor writing, demeaning definitions and lack of any real literary value add up to a cheap piece of trash...
B00005JN4O|5.0|I LOVED this movie!!!  I wasn't sure how much longer it would be playing so I went last night to see it and what a treat it was!  The story is, of course, how Peter Pan came to be.  And though there may be some historical inaccuracies in the name of art, the story, acting and pretty much everything about this film is perfectly done.  Johnny Depp, who charmed his way into everyone's heart with his wickedly funny portrayal of Capt Jack Sparrow in the surprise hit, \\"Pirates of the Carribean\\", will no doubt win more hearts with this role. He is thoroughly charming as J. M. Barrie, a writer suffering from a couple of back to back flops in the theater world.  As fate would have it, he is out one day in the park and comes across a group of boys with their mother (the beautiful and talented Kate Winslet).  These boys steal Barrie's heart, especially the stoic Peter, who seems to be drowning in grief over the loss of his father.  In no time, he becomes \\"Uncle James\\" and spends more time with the boys and their Mom than he does at home.  This doesn't help his already suffering marriage; his wife has all been given up on the marriage by this time but ultimately gives the writer an ultimatum---her or the work.<br /><br />Depp's performance is extremely good and shows how he just gets better and better.  I would love to see him get an Academy Award nomination for this role.  Ms. Winslet is, as usual, perfect in her role as the adoring mom.  She too deserves a nomination though many feel if she gets a nod it will be for her earlier film, \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\".  And though I doubt it will happen, it would be nice to see the young boy who played Peter get a supporting nod.<br /><br />Regardless of winning awards or not, this is my favorite film that was released in 2004.  Run, fly, swim----do whatever you have to do to get to the theater to see this heart warming film.  I'm already awaiting the dvd release...I'll be one of the first ones in line for this little treasure.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!Y RECOMMENDED!!!
B000005HO0|2.0|Simple as that.  It is obvious that when this was recorded, Euronymous was still a lousy guitar player.  The production is sh*tty, and not in a good Darkthrone or De Mysteriis way, just an annoying and sh*tty way.  Dead, while being very recognizable, sounds as if he is drunk, and I can imagine him doing a better performance if he maybe cooled down on the liquor.  On this album, though, he sounds as if he's a whining windbag complaining to his drinking friends about how tortured he is after having too many beers.  Now to all of the Mayhem fans who say Hellhammer is so much better than their old drummer, Manheim, Hellhammer sucked in this release, and this was 3 years after he joined Mayhem, so Manheim was probably better than Hellhammer when he left in 88.  Necrobutcher is still in the infancy of the learning of his instrument, and the song performance is quite underwhelming.  If you want hellraising Mayhem performances, try preferably U.S. and European Legions, or if not, Mediolanum Capta Est.  Also, I wish that the production was as good as it was in the two \\"legions\\" cds, instead of the sh*tty hiss and noise in this production, because as it is now, it is pretty embarrassing.  Even for the low quality BM releases, this blows, and if you take this seriously, you need to get a life.  Even Deathcrush was better, because Maniac genuinely sounded evil, while Dead sounds like an imitator.  Call me insane, but Dead sucks.  I can do a pretty skilled impersonation of him with no rehearsal.  All you have to do is scream your lungs out until your voice distorts.  Attila sounded evil, too.  Attila sounded like an angry European man who was about to kill you.  He sounded underground, he sounded extreme.  Dead sounds like a intentionally crappy vocalist.  He really isn't all that he is cracked up to be.  Want tortured sounding vocalists?  Try Varg Vikernes.  Listen to Deathcrush.  Listen to Dissection's Storm of the light's bane.  Just don't buy this; it sounds like a bootlegof a crappy Berkeley band, and trust me; I've heard many crappy bands from Berkeley.  It doesn't matter if Mayhem was from Norway; Mayhem cared more about image than they did sound.  Don't let the other reviews fool you;  This doesn't sound dark or evil.  It sounds like a bunch of pretenders decided to do a show.  I have heard eviler bands, better musicians, and darker sounding recordings.  This just sucks. And on Pagan Fears, Hellhammer dropped his drumsticks.  And on Freezing Moon, the tape stopped (even more evidence that this used to be a bootleg.)  If you want your head torn off by a Mayhem recording, get Chimera.  And yes, I have heard more extreme metal recordings;  Get any live album from Marduk and it will leave Live in Leipzig in the dust.  And this isn't the true lineup;  The true lineup is Euronymous, Manheim, Necrobutcher, and Maniac, the one that recorded Deathcrush. This one is just a lame recording of a fledgling extreme metal group from Norway.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Hard to believe but Jackson says in the commentary for ROTK:EE, that they showed off some pre-vis effect shots(including the following piece of building arcing into the orc army) and preview shots to some hollywood industry heads during early LOTR production before \\"Pearl Harbor\\" was out and then PH shows off the bomb drop, so now PJ dubs his scene the \\"pearl harbor\\" shot.  <br /> <br />As for the movie itself. Remember that idiotic scene where the zeros were strafing the hospital and nurses were all running around in the midst of it instead of staying in the hospital? In fact, the Japanese never attacked the hospital or flew close to it. The carriers and battleships were the main targets, secondary were the factories. That's just one instance of many of ridiculous scenes just to serve Ben Affleck with a love story. The common denominator must be pretty low for the public market to keep supporting Michael Bay's drek. the story could have been set in modern day \\"Sex and the city\\" type of drek scenario and it  wouldn't make a difference. Just that an important historical event has been lampooned into soap. Watch \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\" for something really historical about Pearl Harbor.
0060934913|5.0|I think this book was very well written.  If you are reading it for inside knowledge of culinary techniques and serious kitchen methodology - you have picked up the wrong book.  There's a lot of other books here you could read for that.  I think this is an excellent book for anyone considering restaurant work because its very telling- lots of long sweaty hours of you working when everyone else is relaxing with their glass of wine.  its more of an expose, I would say of what really goes on in a restaurant kitchen.
B0000009SI|5.0|One of my new personal favorites. It's hilarious without holding anything back musically. The songs are dilightfully absurd and frank has a pretty cool voice. The man can write some really good songs. <br />One of the songs was only O.K (Excentrifugal Forz). It was not up to Frank's incredible lyric writing ability showed in all the other songs.   <br />All of the other songs are 5 out of 5 and make up for one 3 out of 5 song. Simply put: incredible <br />
B00005QAPK|4.0|In response to the reviewer's query below concerning the French overdubbing of \\"Toby Dammit\\" - sorry, this DVD ALSO features a French actor's voice dubbed over that of Terrence Stamp. I, too, was greatly disappointed at this.  <br /> <br />I do not know of any other version available that has Stamp's English dialogue, but I remember seeing it on television in the 80s and onscreen at the American Cinematheque in Hollywood in 2004. Maybe if there is enough demand they will remaster it and put out an English version of this delightful foray into subtle, 1960's-style psychological horror? One can hope.
B0000CEB62|5.0|These DVD's are great! This would have to be one of their greatest concerts ever. An absolute must for die hard DM fans - and anyone who wants to re-live the 80's!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Most of u people think that Moore is just making fun of bush. Your wrong.  He is just expressing his views on how Bush reasponded to 9/11.  Also alot of you people think that the info in the film is fake.  Its not.  Moore has 3 lawyers that say that is true.  If you can provide info to show thats its true then i will believe you.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Hell, Slipknot may start to be overlooked by metalheads who don't listen to commercial radio, but this band still is pretty damn heavy. This album proves it in many ways. \\"Duality\\", the first single, is the song I used to listen to all the time. I even got my hands on it before the whole CD was released! \\"Pulse Of The Maggots\\" and \\"Before I Forget\\" are brutal icons, as well as \\"The Blister Exists\\", and \\"Vermilion\\" has more of a gothic vibe to it. (Type O Negative mixed with Pantera is what it's like.) They're not much of a nu-metal band, and they're not a poser band, unlike what I've heard from \\"true metalheads\\". This is an icon for any rock fan.
B000002KKS|1.0|Black Sabbath were groundbreaking. They didn't invent metal, but helped define the genre - a very important band that spawned thousands of imitators. This album sounds like it's the work of one of those imitators. The songs are very light - generic metal pop. The power has been taken out of Iommi's guitar - there isn't a single good riff on the entire record. And the lyrics are, well, just plain stupid. Black Sabbath never really recovered from this. How the mighty have fallen. Children of the Sea versus Children of the Grave? No contest.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I don't know why this movie was so poorly received. I thought it was excellent. In contrast with a movie like 'Alexander', 'Troy' had a coherent storyline. 'Alexander' failed because it didn't explain to the audience clearly enough who these people are and what they're doing. As for 'Troy' I think the director tried to draw in a large audience by frequently showing off Orlando Bloom's hairless body or Diane Kruger's breast implants. But the movie's strength is Eric Bana's great performance along with Peter O'Toole. The sets and locations were absolutely beautiful and the fight scenes were well directed although I agree with Roger Ebert and think the armies were made to look much bigger than they actually were. I doubt the armies stretched out as far as the eye can see. The only down part of 'Troy' is Brad Pitt who looks and sounds like a California surfer dude.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|The reason why many people panned this movie in their Amazon review is the same reason why a movie like \\"National Treasure\\" does so well at the box office: namely that most people are pretty dumb, and unless a movie has explosions, car chases and naked chicks writhing around to bad rap music, they just can't understand or get into it. Or if they're female they don't get the movie unless it has a bunch of overblown, hard-to-believe sappy romance. Don't get me wrong, every once in awhile I like to watch a brainless action movie too, or (even more seldom) a sappy romance, but most of the time I like my movies smart, and Lost in Translation is a smart movie. So it's really not surprising many people didn't like it.  <br />Most of the people who wrote positive reviews did get it: this movie isn't about people going somewhere, or accomplishing something. It's a snapshot of a few days in the lives of two very different people who are lonely, not only because they are in a very alien culture but because they are at crisis points in their lives, and they searching for human connection. I won't waste my time talking about people's allegations that the younger girl-older man thing was \\"creepy\\" or that it was immoral for Bill Murray's character and Scarlett Johannsen's character to spend time together because both characters are married. All I have to say about that is: it's the 21st century, y'all, and it's time to grow up. I thought this was a very intelligent, sensitive portrait of two people who the outside world would view as successful but who feel very lost and alone. Their relationship wasn't about sex or unrealistic sappy romance (the two things most movie romances are based on), but about two minds meeting and two people finding out they aren't as different from other people as they had thought. I don't know, maybe the movie is hard to understand if you've lived a completely straight-line, unexamined, unadventurous life. But I went through a crisis similar to the oneexperienced by Scarlett Johannsen's character when I was about her age, so I could totally understand where her character was coming from. I have also traveled overseas (including to Japan) so I understand what it's like to feel \\"lost\\" in a foreign culture, so far from your home. Since most Americans, especially those in the Midwest, have never been farther than 300 miles from Columbus or Grand Rapids or Milwaukee or wherever, I imagine the whole idea of foreign travel is a mystery to them. But anyway. This is a great movie, it makes you think and it stays with you long after you've seen it. Definitely worth watching, but you won't get much out of it unless your I.Q. is higher than your body temperature.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Troy is an epic story loosely adapted from Homer's Iliad, which is in its own rights an epic masterpiece.  The story is known to most people who were probably coerced to read it in either high school or college as it was required reading in order to receives a passing grade.  Most probably found the tale difficult to read as it was written in prose, which left most readers missing a story full of intrigue as humans and gods are faced with deceit, love, bereavement, faith, war, heroism, despotism, and much more.  The divine portion of the Iliad is immense as the god's choices always reflect upon the humans, but in Troy Wolfgang Petersen decides to focus on the human aspects of the tale.  This creates an interesting perspective on the story as the many characters still deceive, kill, love, commit heroic deeds, and much more.<br /><br />Troy begins with depicting Agamemnon of Mycenae (Brian Cox) who is on the war path as he seeks to conquer all of Greece and become the king of kings.  The many battles that Agamemnon faces are decided with very little bloodshed as he suggests to each king that if their best warrior can beat his best warrior then he will retreat, but if his best warrior wins then the opposing king will have to pledge his legion to him.  Agamemnon's best warrior is Achilles (Brad Pitt) who seeks immortal fame through the battles that he fights and he also strengthens the confidence of the men in the troops.  However, Achilles also believes in his independence as he believes that the kings should fight their own fights, which makes it difficult for Agamemnon to handle Achilles.<br /><br />The Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) is welcoming peace with Troy as Hector (Eric Bana), the throne prince of Troy, is visiting Sparta with the duty of declaring peace.  In joy Menelaus and Hector celebrate the truce between the cities while Hector's younger brother brother Paris (Orlando Bloom) is secretively courting Menelaus' wife Helen (Diane Kruger).  On the voyage back across the Aegean Sea Paris reveals the secret to Hector as he has persuaded Helen to return to Troy with him as they have fallen in love with one another.  Hector is furious as he realizes that the truce is broken and a war might be approaching in the near future unless they return Helen to Sparta.  Nevertheless, Helen sails to Troy with Paris as Hector is not willing to give up his little brothers life on account of his love for Helen.<br /><br />Wrathful vengeance boils within the veins of Menelaus as he discovers that Helen has left him for one of the princes of Troy, which leads him to visit his brother Agamemnon in a request to seek his vengeance on Troy.  Agamemnon understands that Helen's abandonment of his brother has provided him with an opportunity to ensemble all the troops of Greece to attack Troy, and his advisors recommend that they also bring Achilles.  This is something that Agamemnon resents, as he hates Achilles and his independent manners.  Despite his own dislike for the man Agamemnon listens to his advisors as he send for him through Odysseus (Sean Bean), the only person that Achilles respects.  When all troops arrive they set sail for Troy as Agamemnon has gathered the largest army ever, which is 50,000 men strong.<br /><br />When the many ships arrive to Troy the audience is to see a siege of enormous proportions as the 50,000 men settle on the beach outside Troy.  The siege of Troy offers many interesting views of the characters as intrigue begins to build up and create different camps within the Greek camp.  Achilles' hatred for Agamemnon and vice versa depicts an interesting perspective on power and the symbiosis between characters that detest each other.  There are also several interesting comments such as Odysseus talking to Achilles: \\"War is young men dying and old men talking.  You know this.  Ignore the politics.\\"  These comments offer much to reflect upon as the siege of Troy continues to kill husbands and fathers.<br /><br />Troy is depicted through radiant cinematography, which uses many vast shots where the background seems to go on forever.  The camerawork and lighting also offer several shots with silhouettes of the characters, especially of Achilles.  These silhouettes provide an interesting notion for the uncomplicated existence of Achilles as he perceives life rather black and white as he fearlessly moves through the battlefield with no thoughts of the death he is delivering to other.  The casts performances are, however, unbalanced and it affects the complete cinematic experience as it on occasion feels too 21st century, and in other scenes it is nothing but brilliant.  Altogether, Troy offers a solid cinematic experience, which provides the audience with several lessons and morals in regards to war and the aftermath of war.<br /> <br />Troy is depicted through radiant cinematography, which uses many vast shots where the background seems to go on forever.

B000002AGB|5.0|Many have written about how this performance is weak when compared to Live at Leeds, but I would most certainly disagree. Entwhistle is brillant as always, and Daltrey sounds fierce, especially during some of the Tommy stuff. The jams on \\"Water\\" and other tracks are to die for. This record shows Townshend doing more improv than the note for note perfection of Leeds. Add to that a wonderfully distorted sound mix and this album just feels more raw than Leeds, more dangerous. Listen, the Who were supposed to be a loud, distorted and angry band live. And for all those who say Moon's playing was off that night...could you do any better? NO? Then silence yourselves. If there is any fault I can find with the performance is that Pete's voice is pretty ragged, but again this makes the album feel more raw and intense. You can feel Townshend reaching down inside to get those notes. I must say that the Tommy stuff comes off much much better than on Live at Leeds (Deluxe Edition). The Tommy CD on Leeds uses way too much noise reduction and makes the whole performance sound very weird. Not only that, Roger Daltrey was brought in over 30 years later to re-dub the entire \\"Listening to you...\\" chourus at the end of Tommy! Ummmm excuse me? I have heard the original Leeds bootleg and his vocal was fine to begin with. The performance of \\"We're Not Gonna Take it\\" on Isle of Wight is simply earth-shattering, the best Ive ever heard. So for all those people who claim that Leeds is the end all Who concert and shove this one down the trash, think twice...and for all those who feel this CD mix is weak, you simply arent playing it loud enough!
0670033375|4.0|This is another great contribution to the public's understanding of crucial issues from the UCLA geographer Jared Diamond.  COLLAPSE is an examination of several societies that have collapsed (including Easter Island, the Vikings in Greenland, and the Mayas), as well as a few that have solved their ecological problems and succeeded.  As in GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL, his previous Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Diamond takes a big-picture view.  The lesson is clear -- we must take action to avoid the collapse of our interdependent global society.  \\"Our world society is presently on a non-sustainable course,\\" observes Diamond (p. 498).<br /><br /> My only criticism of this fine book is that it devotes nearly 500 pages to examining various collapses of the past, and only a brief section at the end to examine our present crisis.  In Chapter 16 Diamond presents a summary of the evidence that we are in a condition of overshoot, and in danger of collapse if we stay on our present course.  He says we need 1) long-term planning, and 2) a reconsideration of core values, in order to avoid going the way of the Mayas.<br /><br />I would recommend that everyone who reads COLLAPSE also read [[ASIN:193149858X LIMITS TO GROWTH: The 30-Year Update]] (see my review), which presents a much more thorough summary of the evidence Diamond mentions in his concluding chapter, and [[ASIN:1597260657 THE UPSIDE OF DOWN: Catastrophe, Creativity, and the Renewal of Civilization]], by political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon.  Once informed of our situation, a crucial book pointing toward the necessary answers is [[ASIN:1844070751 THE SOLAR ECONOMY]] by Hermann Scheer (see my review).
B00005JMJG|5.0|After eighty years of cinema, the film industry is running out of original ideas.  There seem to be more and more remakes of old films, or recycled ideas, everyday.  I find this loss of originality to be quite depressing.  That's why I'm overjoyed to find that there is still some creativity in Hollywood today.  \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is a perfect example. <br /> <br />Jim Carrey stars as Joel, a man who one day discovers that his lover, Clementine (Kate Winslet), has had him erased from her memory after their relationship has gone over the edge.  In retaliation Joel decides to have his memory erased as well, but it's only through doing so that he realizes all the good times they had together. <br /> <br />Charlie Kaufman is one of Hollywood's most important writers, and certainly one of its best living screenwriters.  Before bringing us \\"Eternal Sunshine\\", he's written such greats as \\"Being John Malkovich\\" and \\"Adaptation\\".  Thanks to Mr. Kaufman, I feel happy knowing that there is still such a thing as an intelligent script nowadays. <br /> <br />One of the things that leads this movie is the cast.  If ever I had any doubts about Jim Carrey's acting talents, they were cleared up after this movie.  Mr. Carrey is excellent, and thanks to his performance I really sympathized with his character.  Kate Winslet is also terrific.  These two are both equally deserving of an Academy Award nomination.  Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood and Thomas Jay Ryan play in supporting roles. <br /> <br />At the director's helm is Michel Gondry, and he knows how to steer this ship.  Jon Brion's emotional score really adds to the film. <br /> <br />I am proud to declare \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" as my pick for the best film of 2004.  This is one of the greatest films of recent years, and in my opinion one of the best films made.  \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" truly is a spotless film.
B000005HLV|3.0|I gave it three stars, because, like it or not, this WAS one of the defining black metal albums of the early 1990's. Countless amazing bands have been influenced by and inspired by the likes of this release, and we all can thank God for that. Well, you know what I mean...    However, this album is a songwriitng disasterpiece. Riffs fall all over the place on this album, and songs are nearly indistinguishable due to this incoherence and the expected poor production which goes hand-in-hand with 'true' black metal releases. Hellhammer's drumming would become commendable later when he revealed his diverse styles, ridiculous technicality, and myriads of influences in later bands. Here, he's a machine, in the negative sense of simply blastbeating through the entire record. Euronymous is his usually sloppy self on guitar, the bass is inaudible, and don't get me started on the vocalist, Attila. He'd have half a half-decent rasp if he had a toenail's worth of Dead's ability, but no, he had to suck, and on top of that, he tries this weird 'clean' vocal technique that sounds like the wailings of a Norwegian child with Down Syndrome coked out of his skull. Absolutely horrendous, to say the least.    \\"Funeral Fog\\" and \\"Freezing Moon\\" are two passable tracks, but both have appeared before in far better condiiton on other releases. The title track begins with an interesting riff, and loses any sense of decency once the vocals and drums kick in. The song haphazardly thrashes and bashes along until a seemingly random end. The other tracks aren't much better, and straining through the din of fuzz to ascertain a few other passable moments is a tedious task. The moments do exist, but the album is too much of a bore and an embarassment to dig through to enjoy those moments like one would with a favorite release.    That's Mayhem's DMDS. Take it for what it is, and try not to let yourself down. A defining release of BM? No. But, sadly, influential to the max. And 'atmospheric' if you'rewilling to trick yourself into thinking so.     Sometimes I think this band sold more records on notoriety as opposed to geniune musical worth.
1400032717|4.0|I was prompted to read this by my pal, Barbara Heizer, who resides in NYC.  I asked her to recommend a book for me when she happened to mention a blurb in the NY TIMES about this particular book.  Think it might be a fun read I bought it via amazon.com.  I read it while on a train going from Tokyo to Takayama, Japan.  The star of the book is a young boy who is immediately admired.  He is looked upon as a misfit, but in reality he is a genius.  He makes total sense.  It's everyone else that needs work.  What a wonderful story.  It also reminded me of one of my favorite high school books called FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON.

1591840562|5.0|I sent the following email to Guy after reading AOTS several weeks ago. <br /> <br /> <br />I'm on my way to the Bay Area to pitch five Sand Hill road VCs for $6M. <br /> <br />I've been at this start-up stuff for about three years and getting better, but still learning. <br /> <br />I've read about half of AOTS since Friday, between doing the final revs to the pitch and plan. Your book is the absolute best out of all the guidance on the subject (of which I've read and heard quite a bit.) Not just better -- it really is in its own category. <br /> <br />AOTS is cogent and highly readable.

B00005KB9W|5.0|Recorded during the \\"Natty Dread\\" Tour at the Lyceum Ballroom in London on July 19th, 1975, \\"Live!\\" is the most powerful live reggae album to date.  The show starts off with a powerful \\"Trenchtown Rock\\" to get the crowd moving.  Marley later rallies up listeners with the astounding \\"Lively Up Yourself,\\" and the fun, uplifting bonus track, \\"Kinky Reggae\\".      The strongest emotion portrayed in the performance, however, is Marley's classic sociopolitical and spiritual side with the sorrowful, \\"Burnin' and Lootin',\\" the solemn \\"Them Belly Full (But We Hungry),\\" the enigmatic world-renowned equal rights anthem, \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\" and the chart-topping hit that broke musical boundaries the world over: \\"I Shot the Sheriff.\\" On this live rendition of Marley's classic testament to innocence, he seems to enter a stage of blending his own original version with Eric Clapton's 1974 cover, making the song all the more memorable and astounding for the listener.    The album's most vivid gem is the seven-minute-plus rendition of \\"No Woman, No Cry,\\" with Marley's heartfelt and touching vocals alongside a beautiful church-style organ and a soothing, yet cutting guitar solo from Al Anderson.  Also extremely moving is the sense of calm that seems to come over the crowd while still radiating from Marley's powerful energy; leaving his audieance calm yet alert at the same time.  Also astounding are the hauntingly beautiful angelic backing vocals of the I-threes.  This song alone is worth purchasing the CD.    \\"Live!\\" is an amazing album and a milestone for Bob Marley & the Wailers; a must-own for any fan that is sure to delight.  The music that Marley and his band gift the audience with here is utterly flawless.
B000068TPN|4.0|<br />We Were Soldiers is a compelling war movie seen from multiple perspectives.  It is a refreshingly uncommon war movie. The movie disapproves of war.  However, acknowledging that war does exist, this movie celebrates the heroism that can be found in it.    <br /> <br />We Were Soldiers not only gives us a look at the soldiers whose side we're on, but the enemy soldiers as well.  It shows that these are people too; they have girlfriends, wives, sons and daughters, just as `our guys' do. The movie also shows us very accurately how war can affect these people who have relationships with the soldiers. <br /> <br />We Were Soldiers takes place in 1965; America has just entered the Vietnam War.   The movie is centered on the 7th Air Cavalry unit.  This new form of cavalry rides into battle not on horses, but in helicopters.  The movie focuses on the soldiers, their relationships with one another and their relationships with their families.  <br /> <br />The combination of realistic characters, a dramatic script and a heart-rending story may make viewers' emotions run high.  The movie was much more than gunfights and special effects.  Relationships were explored, and emotion was evident in each character, not always being expressed, but you could see it lying just under the surface.  It would be difficult to see the film in its entirety without tearing up. <br /> <br />Inspiring acts of heroism are celebrated throughout the movie. Selfless acts of bravery were apparent throughout the film.  People had to make sacrifices, and they were rarely for their own benefit.  These acts were also ironic in that many men died for the dead. <br /> <br />A huge slice at the beginning of the movie is used to get the audience familiar to the soldiers in the 7th Air Cavalry.  You get to know their families and their daily lives.  This is especially the case with young Lt. Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein) whose wife is due with a baby.  Klein played a much more sophisticated character in Geoghegan than he is used to (2001's American Pie 2, 2002's Rollerball).  Despite this, I think he did a commendable job.   <br /> <br />Getting familiar with the soldiers only serves to make the deaths of the soldiers hit us harder.  The deaths of the soldiers hurt us more when we find out news of their death is sent from Vietnam via telegrams.  It falls to Moore's wife to deliver these telegrams to the various families of the deceased, and we see these epitaphs in all their misery. These poignant scenes show us the full extent of the tragedy of death. They also force the viewers to ask some questions about war that one doesn't always keep in mind.  Is it really worth it? In war you need to know that the forces that made the war occur tried to do everything they could to prevent it from happening. War needs to be a last resort. This is clear from the outright pain and grief it causes other human beings. <br />  <br />The beginning also creates a sense of foreboding.  The first scene of the movie is of a French troupe of soldiers being massacred in the la Drang Valley.  This is the same valley in which the battle between Moore's troops and the Vietnamese was fought. Also, the name of Moore's troops, the 7th cavalry, is identical to that of the fabled General Custer.  Custer was a successful commander like Moore himself until his entire unit was massacred. Foreshadowing perhaps?   <br /> <br />Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) is an accomplished commander that is appointed as the leader of this unit.  Mel Gibson (1995's Braveheart, 2000's What Women Want) delivers a stunning performance as Moore, the loyal leader who commands the 7th Air Cavalry. Gibson is familiar with the role of a courageous, inspiring leader (Braveheart, The Patriot).  Therefore, playing Moore probably wasn't a challenge for Gibson.  However, I can forgive him because he played the part flawlessly.  The character Gibson plays is both concerned about and dedicated to the troops he leads.  On the eveof the cavalry's departure to Vietnam, Moore proclaims, \\"When we go into battle, I will be the first to step on the field and I will be the last to step off.\\"  Soon, the unit is called into battle and they travel to Vietnam, to a world of war, violence, and destruction. <br /> <br />We Were Soldiers is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once... and Young written by Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (Ret.) and Joseph L. Galloway. Randall Wallace, who directed it, also wrote the screenplay. Wallace also wrote 1995's Braveheart, 1998's The Man in the Iron Mask, and 2001's Pearl Harbor. Wallace and Gibson have paired up before, and in Braveheart, the two were extremely successful together.  Wallace is obviously no newcomer to screenwriting and did a nice job converting the book into a form suitable for film.  He also does a good job directing the film.  He had previously directed 1998's The Man in the Iron Mask, so this was not his first movie.  Violent war movies can be a tricky and nauseating experience if the battle scenes aren't filmed with expertise. The war scenes in the film were organized and clear, however they didn't fail to portray the reality of a real life gun battle.  Specifically the scene with the \\"hot LZ\\" was particularly well done.  Somehow Randall gave us a clear picture of the mayhem that was there along with showing us coherent shots that left us with no questions as to what was occurring. <br /> <br />Although We Were Soldiers might at times be graphic and at others emotionally tough, there is some comic relief.  Sgt. Maj. Plumley (Sam Elliott) is Colonel Moore's strict second-in-command. Elliot is an experienced actor who has been on the scene since the late 60's (1969's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1998's The Big Lewbowski).  However, I think Plumley posed a fun and fresh character for Elliot, and he played it to perfection.  Elliot's experience was an invaluable asset to the film.  Plumley's demeanor alone was always enough to give me a hearty chuckle. I found myself repeating one of Plumley's lines on multiple occasions, one that involves a fellow soldiers comment on the weather.  <br /> <br />We Were Soldiers is rated R, and for good reason.  Many of the gunfights in the la Drang valley and instances with napalm at the end of the movie are hard to stomach.  However, it is my belief that you need to show the world what war really is, how horrific and gruesome it can get. Powdering war up like a geisha is as good as lying to someone.  We Were Soldiers is the real deal; it gives us the impact of war and the reality of it in its entirety. People should see this movie, as it not only entertaining and captivating, but will also develop your understanding of war.  And in this, world, we desperately need this understanding.  Especially in the one we live in today. <br />
0739313126|3.0|\\"The Da Vinci Code\\", by Dan Brown, New York, Doubleday, 2003 1st Ed. ISBN 0-385-50420-9 HC, 454 pp. This book is one that should be read cover-to-cover, not skimmed. I will only name the main intriguing characters: Symbologist Robert Langdon,  Agent Sophie Neveu and Curator Jacques Sauniere who have relationships to the Opus Dei, a keystone, Cryptex, Masons, Knights Templar, the Holy Grail and so much more.<br /><br />There is an abundance of fascinating chronicaled facts in this well-woven novel and it is sometimes difficult to separate fact from fiction,  fabricated from legendary.  It is a sexual book but not about sex.  The dissertation on diverse codes and 'word games' is engaging but frustrating if we are wont to figure it out on our own. It's unnecessary to condemn this book, written as a novel, as \\"anti-Catholic.\\"<br />The author has extensive authoritative command of sundry, disparate areas of knowledge which are inspiring and attest to his research & the attention he paid to weaving intrigue, trivia and legends in poignant style. It is an amazing, absorbing, and accomplished mystery story where the reader gradually learns who really are the good vs. the bad guys.  This is a must read which takes little effort to open the cover, especially with the illustrations! -- then the book's enticements take over.  Worthy inveiglements relate to codes within the book, some of which are smoke and others allegorical and the later edition which is nicely illustrated and features prints of historic places of Europe that are discussed in the text and are well-received.  Do get this illustrated edition!  The book's price is more than fair.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Coming off all the hype surrounding Antichrist Superstar, Marilyn Manson decides to just DO SOMETHING ELSE. And boy was that a good idea. In chosing to turn from \\"Is this guy actually the Antichrist?!!\\" \\"Is he really that evil?\\" and \\"Is he for real?\\" Manson turns around and says \\"Ok! and now on to the next thing I want to do as an artist.\\" AND ART- THIS RECORD DOES DELIVER. It's lyrically brilliant (some of the best Ive ever read), edgy, satirical, bleak, funny and moving. The songwriting is clearly better. It creates atmospheres reminiscent of BOWIE and GARY NUMAN's REPLICAS (The later of which, must have been a big influence) and shows off the band's knowledge of ROCK history. Not to mention they're skill at applying it.  <br />The unfortunate dilemma Manson encounters, is that his \\"ACT\\" seems to be whitewashing his own creative brilliance. Or at least the misunderstanding of this \\"ACT.\\" To clarify, his message and art exist on a deeper level than most are willing to look when confronted with his imagery and over-the- top theatrics. However, it is necessary to note that this misunderstanding itself is something he uses in his favor and incorporates into his art. To the trained observer, what you get when you actually give it a chance is one of the only relevant, \\"Real\\" Artists left in music. Complex, Intellectually profound, enigmatic, extremely well thought out, and creative entertainment. His blending of various elements from different genre's is not a crutch, but rather a tool he uses well to get a particular message across. It is a huge mistake to just toss this band aside, writing them off as High School rebel rock designed to make your parents angry. That in fact is PART of the \\"ACT\\" and just the tip of the iceberg. What MARILYN MANSON is doing is creating one of the most valid artistic statements of his time.   <br />If ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR said, \\" I have arrived...and you should worry.\\" ( heh ) <br />MECHANICAL ANIMALS added,  ...\\" Because I know exactly what I'm doing.\\" <br />In fact- he actually says that!!! <br />\\" I know what to do and I do it well..\\" from FUNDAMENTALLY LOATHESOME Track 12. And while we laugh at this pretense, we notice that it has been spoken in shame and apathy. Bravo indeed. <br />
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I had watched this movie the first time right when it came out but I just watched it again and decided this is a movie to speak on. Yes, I only give it three stars but this is average in my book and this film is average. It's no Interview with the Vampire, but compared to modern- day vampire movies, average is a great compliment. It had what we modern- day viewers love, a whole lot of weapons and fast movement and loud noises that will leave you deaf. The leather I think was a little cliche but oh well. Kate Beckingsale was actually quite good in this film compared to her paper- thin performance on Van Helsing. She pulled off being a no- nonsense, semi- feeling vampire and she fought well. The others actors were fine as well, but Kate Beckingsale is truly the only one who shines.  <br />The plot is simple. Vampires against werewolves. Or so it seems. At the end of the movie you see there's a deeper meaning to the the head werewolf but I won't blow it away. But for the main body of vampires and werewolves it's just a main battle for power and dominance. Sounds cool.  <br />But the movie lost two stars because of the hardly- there romance that was to be promised between the vampire Beckingsale and the man she's trying to save who eventually ends up a werewolf. The romance everyone was talking about was not there whatsoever between those two. Matter of fact, this movie is hardly emotional. It's cold and the characters are all stone- faced for the good part of the movie. So don't bother buying a box of tissues or anything. That's fine with me though, but when they say there's a romance I expect to see something brewing! Another problem was I didn't think they made the plot as great as it could have been. Maybe it's just me, but I was expecting more than what was given, and a little more depth to the characters.  <br />Overall nonetheless, it was worth seeing once, and at least this movie respected the myth of vampires and werewolves, unlike so many other films. That much alone gives the film a solid three stars.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The lowest common denominator of the collective American mind is pretty darn low, and unfortunately, movies are often made to appease this group--those who want movies to massage and reassure their simple-minded, unrealistic value systems.  Lost in Translation was not made to be a box office smash.  It is a truly sensitive look at relationships, lonliness and culture.  The cinematography is beautiful, the acting superb, and its themes are timeless without being trite.  It also has some of the funniest moments that I've seen in a film in a long while.  Unfortunately, some people missed all of this, and these people may describe the film as any of the following: boring, weird, stupid, immoral, pointless.  They may be better off watching Dickie Roberts--Child Star, Airbud, or Freddy vs. Jason.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|When I heard of this film I thought it would be a flop honestly. I have had many bitter memories of watching great tales be torn to shreds when adapted to films, and I only tried this one out of sheer curiosity and love for the Illiad story. (And of coruse having Brad Pitt in it was a temptation as well.) <br />I was left surprised at the end of this two- hour and some film nonetheless! The scenes were beautiful, the actors well picked for their characters, and the fight scenes were bold. I loved it when Brad Pitt would jump high in the air. It looked so dramatic. And Brad Pitt himself excellently portrayed the cocky, self- assured and yet self- destructive Achilles. Orlando Bloom was interesting as Paris, appearing as one of those men that are not fighters, but lovers. The others actors as well, including the actor whom played Hector, was fanatastic. I thought the actor for Helen was a bit paper- thin, but the rest of the cast leveled her out well. Overall this movie plays the very essence of the story of Troy very well, even if they do stray somewhat from the orginal Illiad, but they indeed did not tear it up like so many other movies do to legendary stories. I liked this movie very much, and that's why I give it four stars. Why not five? Well one because some parts of the movie did not fit the main storyline, but the major problem they lost a star was because of the ending. Right when Achilles died, that was the end of the movie? No. A few other things happened! They made it seem that right when Achilles died that was it, but the story continued on for a little longer. I didn't like that too well because people should know what happened afterwards, and a few things do. I guess what I can tell people who don't know the full story should read it, because other events happen after Achilles is killed. But I loved this adaption far too much to be too angry at this.  <br />It was a creative film, and I am proud the main story of the Illiad is still going on through themodern age, for it is one of those legendary stories that should be remembered.
0790740443|5.0|I cant imagine why anyone wouldnt like this movie.  I recently discovered it didnt do well in the box ofice. that was a surprise to me, I've liked this movie since the first time i saw it on TV and I think with creativity a sequal could be made.  If you agree say this review was helpful to you.
B0002Z0EYA|2.0|Two discrepencies are quite obvious.  First, the Trojan War consumed ten years.  There is no sense of this in the movie.  We seem to get around the war in at best a few weeks.    Second, where are the gods?  The gods were a vital part of Homer's story, but for some reason the gods simply took a hiatus in this movie!  First, I wonder whether a modern audience can understand and assimilate the intimate relationship between gods and men in Homer's classic.  Perhaps it would have been impossible.  Second, I wonder whether modern audiences could take the utter brutality of the Homerian account.  I take it not from this movie, since it is certainly a sanatized version of Homer's epic poem.    All in all, perhaps no sane person would actually screen the Iliad in a manner that is faithful to the original.  But I wish someone had the guts to do so.

B0002X314C|5.0|First off before I comment on the album. Kanye West only produced 3 tracks on the album which are \\"Used 2 Love U\\", \\"Number One\\" and \\"Alright\\". He worked with long time collaborators Dave Tozer and Devo Harris. Just clarifying for those who think Kanye West is responsible for this amazing talent. Maybe for putting him out there but he would have blown up regardless. <br /> <br />This album is beautiful from beginning to end. I am glad to see that real music isn't lost on the world. It gives me hope to see people embracing John. If you haven't seen him live you need to esp  for those 2 or 3 people saying he isn't \\"all that\\"..The hype is true. For once the industry and the world got it right. He will be around for a long time. Watch and enjoy! <br />Get the album, buy it for someone..just get it..It is Totally worth it!

B00008QSA5|5.0|One of the reviewers here notes that it took him a while to listen to side 1 of the original vinyl release.  I was the same way when I got the album lo those many years ago.  But, I disagree, side 1 is better.  This is music which has withstood the test of time.  The bonus tracks are frosting on this cake, and, if \\"Blues for Nothing\\" is any indication, one can only hope that Kooper will eventually release any more tunes that were cut that session.
B000067UUJ|4.0|As the title of the review says, I'm a bit divided about this album. Muse's third release 'Hullabaloo' is not an ordinary studio album but rather a 2 disc edition comprised of a collection of B-sides from Showbiz and Origin of Symmetry and a live album. As is with most of such releases, this is fans-only. So don't consider buying this until you own the rest of Muse's work. <br /> <br />Muse's earliest B-sides aren't unfortunately nearly as good as their album tracks. This is usually the case, but as Showbiz is their weakest album the songs tend to follow the same pattern. I'll admit that I haven't listened to it that often...but Nature_1 and Shine Acoustic went right past me, unfortunately. Map of Your Head is an acoustic song accompanied by a lute. It sounds very mediaeval and is therefore very  interesting. The first three songs are quite typical of early Muse and not very memorable. The rest consists mostly of electronic noodling, such as on The Gallery, and there's a slower version of Hyper Music called Hypochondriac Music. But the stand-out B-side for me is Ashamed. It is a cut above the rest and reminds me of good old-fashioned rock 'n roll. <br /> <br />The live album is a different matter alltogether. Muse as known for their explosive and spectacular shows. I have been unlucky enough to not be able to witness one yet. However, the album more than compensates. There are versions of the B-Sides Dead Star and In Your World, which are miles removed(and miles better!) from those on Hullaballoo. An advice would also be to get one's hands on the studio versions of these 2 songs, as there is a piano cut from the live version of In Your World which sounds like it was inspired by Bach. As this concert was recorded in 2001 naturally all the live tracks are also from Origin of Symmetry and Showbiz. Track 2, a sumptuous performance of Microcuts, is definitely one I would've liked to have seen live, in all it's baroque decadence. My favorites of all of these are the renditions of Screenager and Space Dementia. Unlike on Origin Matt here introduces Screenager with a piano improvisation which is lifted from Prelude in C#m by Rachmaninov, no less. And no, I have the original piece, I did not make it up. Just listen. Space Dementia, which in my opinion is the best track on Origin, is also performed here wonderfully. The closer of this live album is Agitated, which is a non-album track. <br /> <br />Well there you go. 3 stars for the B-sides, 5 stars for the live album. So 4 stars in total. The B-Sides are interesting curiosas, of course. But I would mainly recommend this album if you've got all the other albums by Muse, and you would like to experience some of the energy that Muse put into their performances.
1878574590|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said. Yes, it is violent and yes, Marv, the main character probably isn't your friendly everyday neighbor. But who cares? This is a comic book. It has a truely amazing storyline, the most wonderful graphic art I've ever witnessed in black and white. Superb!!! <br />If you like this one, check out Frank Miller's \\"Daredevil, The Man without Fear\\" and \\"Batman, the Dark Knight Returns\\".
B000002G23|5.0|I grew up listening to the Police in the 80's and had most of thier albums on viynl. I finally purchased a couple of the cds and occasionally listened to them. I bought this on sale one day and was blown away at how good they really were. This box set has just about anything you could want from the Police from the early raw sound to the later stuff. Well worth the money.

B000001C6M|5.0|If you really like metal at all this 1's 4 you.  In my opinoin (which doesnt matter 2 much) this is Slayers best album.  The entire cd is in your face non-stop metal.  Contrary 2 what that other guy said, the solos are some of the best ever.  You do whatever you want but I'm just here 2 let you know this is the best of Slayer.
B000067FP7|5.0|How can something so sweet and cuddly as a Gremlin become so mean and angry like your own kids when they don't get what they want. The ideas behind this hilarious transformation are so marvellous you'd want to watch this one again and again - with or without your  own kids present (who knows, they  might get ideas). Gremlins is one of the funniest movies ever. A cult-classic.
B000687M48|1.0|Although I have only listened to the CD, I found this set to be a waste of money. Amy Lee's voice is far from being on key during the early tracks of the CD. Also, the CD was poorly recorded with the crowd screams often drowning out the song.<br />The only part of this CD I found worthwhile was the studio track at the end, Missing. A very good song, but hardly able to justify the entire CD.
0441172717|5.0|This is a must have. I'd even say one of the best novels ever written. The idea behind the entire Dune Universe is tremendously well worked out. Frank Herbert's craftmanship is to be studied for ages if you ask me. Many popular sci-fi and fantasy novels haven't got more to tell than the neverending fight between good and evil. The good is white and the bad is black - how very boring. Frank Herbert paints us a universe that is so detailed in both characterization and storyline that it truely becomes real. Marvellous!!!
B00028HBKM|1.0|I would have to say this happen to one of the most funnest movies I ever seen! If you are looking for good laugh then look at this movie and Jesus gets killed that part is so great I think I rolled out of my chair. I wish i could been in this movie to kill him of what a min I can on another web site. That's right you too can now kill christ, or mabey play dress up with him. If you are looking for any truth don't look in this movie because all this stuff in the movie is made up. I think Jason movie seem more real then this movie. I don't know why you people think this could ever happen do you have any prof over this? No you don't have any prof of this or anything this so called person has done. Say it is true and i am putting a big if out there don't you think that these storys would have gotten changed over years? I know all of you people hate me and good that's how I like it. I know you want to see free thinkers like myself die but gusse what we are not going anywhere! If you don't like it oh well because this what I will teaching my kids so they can grow up like me. Burning bibles, etc. I will tell my kids when they get old enfo if you see someone with a bible grab it from them and rip up the bible before it's too late! I will burn a bible out there for all of you people out there who hate me.  <br />HAIL Satan and Myself!!!!
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Lost in Translation is not the great movie many people make it out to be, but it is not as awful as the others claim either.  For me the movie lays somewhere in the middle. For her first movie, Sofia Coppola did an outstanding job, but she is nowhere near the director her father is... yet. The story itself is nice, but it falls a little short for me personally. I saw much of the depiction of Japan as right no, but I also felt the isolation the two are suppose to feel is totally overblown. I see it as a very American view of the world, if it is different why should I try to understand it. This might not have been the director's intention, but that is what I got out of the movie. Worth a look, but not Oscar quality. Bill Murray is great in his role as he always is, but not Oscar quality.
B00003W8NM|4.0|Fight Club is one of the best films critisizing western type life of today. Film is about the psychology of destroying the current life dynamics and dream for a simpler, more humanistic life style. However, in the film no executable alternatives of better living were given, like todays american way of life:)  <br /> <br />For a better execution of critizing todays life, with everyting in it, I highly recommend Stalker from Tarkovsky.  <br />
B00005JLFC|5.0|Can't understand why the DVD has not been made yet. This is a perfect movie to be transfered to a DVD. A nice story, good acting, beautifull camara work, perfect voice (Streisand) and above all a brilliant music (Legrand). What else is needed in order to make an atractive DVD? <br />It is about time.
0553381350|4.0|This book is a great way to aquaint yourself with one of the best--certainly the most exciting--contemporary American writer.  The wealth of detail and penetrating insight into the origins of the space program, the men who rode the rockets, and their subsequent lionization make this book highly enjoyable.<br /><br />My only complaint--and it's a small one--is that toward the end it gets a little bit repetitive.  Wolfe has a couple of metaphors that he extends through the entire book (the \\"pyramid\\" of status among test pilots, the astronaut as modern \\"single-combat warrior\\").  In fact, these are the heart of the book and give some of the deepest insight into the space race, but after 300 pages you might be like, ok--I get it.<br /><br />I think Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test was a better book, but if you think that the 60's counterculture was a big waste of time and youth (and you've never partaken of its elements), you'll like this one better.
B0000025RI|5.0|I'm only seventeen years old and even I can see this is a great album. I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, Prince and Stevie Wonder so I pretty much know all the history behind Thriller.I'm not saying that this is the best album because I love Off the Wall just as much but its an excellent album. I'll rate my fav songs 10 being the highest and 1 the lowest.  1.Wanna Be Startin-7 (This is good song especially the ending)  2. Baby be Mine-8 (I really love this song)  3. The girl is mine-6- (Kinda corny but alright still)  4. Thriller-9(who doesn't love this song)  5.Beat It-7(good but not one of my favs)  6. Bille Jean-9.5(This song is off da chain even still today. All my friends and I still like it)  7.- Human Nature10!!(My fav song on the album. I mean who can even hit notes like that but Mike!!)  8. P.Y.T-8 (Great song!! #4 fav song on album)  9. Lady in my life-9 (Another great song)    Only one thing makes me mad and that's people don't appreciate Michael's music for what it is a masterpiece! People are like, \\"Oh don't listen to Thriller b/c Michael is a child molester,\\" but nobody knows that for sure, I'm sure almost none of us have even been invited into his house. I don't hear anybody saying, \\"Don't listen to Rick James or Elvis because they were junkies or addicts,\\" see that's how messed up America is, it's ok to listen to drug addicts and users but not listen to a man who no one knows whether he is guilty or not. I think everyone should keep their views to their selves  and enjoy this music for what it is A MASTERPIECE!!!     If you like R&B, soul, funk, pop, and even rock then buy Thriller, you wont be disappointed.
6305128952|1.0|i'm extremely happy we rented this instead of bought it ..  <br /> <br />This has to possibly be the worse movie out of every horse movie i've seen so far. The characters, i think, are pretty dim. Nice try on being a redneck, there. The only part that i actually got into was the beginning to where she gets injured .. then i thought it started going pretty downhill. they don't pay any attention to Pilgrim's markings there .. he'll have a huge star, a little star, not really even a star and no star. You could think they would've put more effort into the movie, but i guess not. The horse shows some emotions and some of the things are alright, but other parts .. are just .. unrealistic. I wouldn't rent the movie ever again, i grit my teeth at it, its my opinion that you move to a better movie before deciding to spend your money on this ...

Now, even after having majored in English in college and become an English teacher, this remains my favorite book of any genre, any time.

The characters are so well-developed, so vividly portrayed, so multi-faceted, and so REAL that they become a part of you.

However not very appropriate for the young, do to some of crude and sometimes violent events.

B00000AFFF|4.0|when I first got this CD, I played it for two weeks straight (I'm sure my wife was sick of that..). <br />The combination of Costello & Bacharach really works. <br />My only issue is that it can be a little melancholy at times. <br /> <br />other than that its a good addition to the collection. <br />
038551123X|4.0|Dexter is a great character. Definitely different from your usual protagonist. I found myself charmed and creeped out all at once. I look forward to the sequel. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I found the ending less than great; but I still recommend it highly.
B00005JMJG|2.0|I do not understand why critics are praising this movie. It is one of the most strangest and boring movies you will ever see. Personally I watched the movie because I like Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey, and they do not dissapoint. Their acting is indeed very strong, but I don't see anything diserving Oscar here, especally for Jim Carrey. If you are looking for the Oscar for the best male performance watch Tom Hanks in \\"The Terminal\\".<br /><br />Story of the \\"Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind\\" is very unique and till the last minutes of the movie you don't know what is happening. But, believe me, it does not worth waiting for two hours, it is very boring.
B000002GB9|3.0|Given the massive success of this album, maybe that's the real concept behind this album. Make an average album, and get it power-promoted so it sells and sells and sells. So the 'grand illusion' could very well be the the quality of an album based on sales and reputation.     When I first put this album on, I heard the first song, sung by Dennis, and it was alright I guess. Then the second song came on, but the first song started playing again. I figured there was something wrong with my copy of the album. They put the first song twice, instead of the second song. As the song played, suddenly Tommy started singing! So this actually was 'Angry Young Man'. Then when it was over, the third song started playing, 'Superstars', and it sounded like the first song again, only, a bit faster this time, although this was more of a group vocal.     Once I had finished listening to the 7th song, 'Castle Walls' (or was it another man in the wilderness? Both songs were lumbering, heavy hearted affairs) there was a brief reprise of earlier songs on the album, funny how 'Superstars', 'Grand Illusion' and 'Come sail away' all seem to roll into one song in this reprise. Wouldn't be 'cause they all sound the same would it?     Anyway, even if this album rarely rocks like it's follow up, 'Pieces of eight', it's still a good album, as Styx usually put out good albums. They only put out weak albums when all the band members are in court suing each other and revealing evidence such as 'he once said I am an idiot' and 'It broke my heart to be called controlling, I have always maintained I am a really nice person' etc. Rating ***
1591396190|5.0|The authors have published many articles over the last decade on Value Innovation. This is their first book. It summarizes their extensive knowledge on out-of-the-box strategic thinking.    What is a BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY? The authors explain it by comparing it to a red ocean strategy (traditional strategic thinking):   1. DO NOT compete in existing market space. INSTEAD you should create uncontested market space.   2. DO NOT beat the competition. INSTEAD you should make the competition irrelevant.   3. DO NOT exploit existing demand. INSTEAD you should create and capture new demand.   4. DO NOT make the value/cost trade-off. INSTEAD you should break the value/cost trade-off.   5. DO NOT align the whole system of a company's activities with its strategic choice of differentiation or low cost. INSTEAD you should align the whole system of a company's activities in pursuit of both differentiation and low cost.     A red ocean strategy is based on traditional strategic thinking - e.g. Harvard's strategy guru Michael Porter.    Some cases:  * Airline industry price wars result in bankruptcies and low profit margins. Southwest Airlines creates a new market by offering the speed of air travel with the low cost and flexibility of driving.  * Golf equipment industry competes to win a greater share of existing golf customers. Callaway Golf creates \\"Big Bertha\\", a golf club with a large head that attracted new customers to golf that had been frustrated by the difficulty of hitting the ball.  * The cosmetic industry creates a red ocean with models, expensive advertising, and promises of youth and beauty. The Body Shop creates a blue ocean that lasts more than a decade by creating functional cosmetics that defied the industry which sold emotionally appealing cosmetics.  * The wine industry gluts the market with a red ocean of thousands of brands competing on the finest oaks and tannins and legacy winey names. Casella wines creates [yellow tail], a blue ocean wine that succeeded byeliminating complexity, elitism and consumer confusion and creating a fun simple image that non-wine drinkers could enjoy.    A blue ocean is created in the region where a company's actions favourably affect both its cost structure and it value proposition to buyers. Cost savings are made from eliminating and reducing the factors an industry competes on. Buyer value is lifted by raising and creating elements the industry has never offered. Over time, costs are reduced further as scale economies kick in, due to the high sales volumes that superior value generates.     Examples of strategic moves that created blue oceans of new, untapped demand:   - NetJets (fractional Jet ownership)  - Cirque du Soleil (the circus reinvented for the entertainment market)  - Starbucks (coffee as low-cost luxury for high-end consumers)  - Ebay (online auctioning)  - Sony (the Walkman - personal portable stereos)  - Cars: Japanese fuel-efficient autos (mid-70s) and Chrysler minivan (1984)   - Computers: Apple personal computer (1978) and Dell's built-to-order computers (mid-1990s).     The INSEAD professors Kim and Mauborgne have written regularly on the subject of Value Innovation since 1997 in Harvard Business Review. Being a business development manager, their thought leadership on strategic innovation has inspired me tremendously over the years. Their articles have been standard texts for many MBA students for some time (e.g. \\"Value Innovation\\", \\"Creating New Market Space\\", \\"Charting your Company's Future\\"). I expect their first book to be just as dominant in any strategy library as Michael Porter's books (the guru behind the classic red ocean strategies).

B00005JNBQ|5.0|ok those of you who say its dumb, its cuz you dont get it...THERE IS NO POINT! Its so flippin hilarious. Funniest damn thing Ive ever seen, BUY BUY BUY!
0805076476|4.0|I hate to say that I liked the movie better than the book but I did. But before you decide that this is a horrible review, let me finish. The book is is narrated by a guy we don't know, what we do know is that he's an insomniac and that he goes to support groups to help him sleep. Then he meets Tyler Durden and the two start Fight Club. An underground boxing club, but this eventually escalates in Project Mayhem. Project Mayhem features members of Fight Club going out and commiting acts of vandalism before they reach their goal. Anyway, why did I like the movie more? The movie was more visual (which is kind of obvious) and the story kind of went along a little better. Plus, <br />in the movie, Tyler Durden was considered (more or less) the main character. In the book however he really isn't. Some of the events that took place in the movie like the part where they steal fat from a lipo-suction clinic, featured the narrator and Tyler. In the book its the narrator and some other guy. And also, in the book. The narrators relationship with Marla Singer is a little bit deeper,rather than the I-Hate-You  <br />relationship they had in the movie.B+.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Yes, the movie did leave a lot out that would make things easier to understand.  That's why I won't let my preteen watch any of the movies until she reads the books (I'm funny that way.)  With a book the size of 'Prisoner', you simply have to expect a lot of changes and details to be omited.  Its a 2 1/2 hour movie, not a mini-series.  I, for one, think the screenwriters did a great job.   <br /> <br />Expect more of the same as the books aren't getting any smaller. <br /> <br />I also like the new Dumbledore.  Yes, he was a bit of a shock the first time I saw it but he does, I feel, fit the role better.  The books describe Dumbledore as being old but with an impression of great power.  In the first book, Dumbledore is also described as a bit crazy.  No offence but Richard Harris always seemed to me to be to feeble (especially his voice.)
B00009V7P8|2.0|This album has to be one of the most overrated and unmelodic albums of 2003 -- The lyrics are halfway decent, but his voice...it sounds like he's singing while he's laying down just waking up in the morning. <br /> <br />There's so many other folk singers out there that deserve Rice's recognition -- I just find this album to be very boring and undeserving of anything more than 2 stars.
0393057658|5.0|Lewis has written what is one of the top 5 baseball books of all time.  <br />The book, unlike what some baseball broadcasters have said, is not exclusively about Billy Beane. It focuses on the Oakland A's and their different way of viewing the potential of baseball players by using statistics such as on base percentage and not simply using scouts to provide judgements based upon watching the player play in a few games. The book if it was written a couple years later could have just as easily been written about the Boston Red Sox, which adopted this statistics based approach after Theo Epstein took over as general manager. Lo and behold, the Red Sox after 84 years of futility, won a World Series largely because of this new way of looking at baseball.  <br /> <br />The book also provides a wonderful historical background for this approach and isn't written like the reader has a degree in mathmatics. Every theory is well explained for the average person who hated and struggled through high school statistics to understand. A historical background for the theories used by Beane and the Red Sox, and as mentioned briefly in the end of paperback edition, later the Blue Jays and the Red Sox, is provided. One of the main characters in the book, Bill James, is the father of many of these statistics and the way of looking at baseball used by Beane.  <br /> <br />The book also isn't just about boring baseball statistics either. Lewis goes into depth about why Beane looks at baseball the way he does. According to Lewis, it's because Beane was a player that, according to the old way of looking at baseball using scouts and data such as 40 yd dash times, was a can't miss prospect. The scouts ignored statistics that would have raised red flags about Beane's major league prospect status. Beane never rose above a major league bench player. This experience, according to Lewis, drives Beane to never make the same mistake that major league general managers made in drafting him so high.<br /> <br />If you're a baseball fan and want to understand how the Oakland A's have won all those games in recent years even after losing players like Miguel Tejada and Jason Giambi, read this book. After reading this book, you'll also come away with some idea of why Beane traded away two of his best pitchers this offseason too.
B00005MP58|5.0|A faithful interpretation of the events, characters and dialogue written so beautifully by Jane Austin.  This film transports you into another time and place where pride about the family fortune or prejudice about the inferiority of one's connections could keep people well suited to one another apart.   Fantastic casting and direction truly make the characters come to life!  Everyone from Darcy, Bingley, and Wickam to the entire Bennet family shines and comes to life.  Elizabeth truly does have fine eyes.  You will enjoy it, especially if you love the book.
B00005JMAH|2.0|The third book is still my favorite.  Therefore I was more than looking forward to the movie version.  This movie has stunning special effects.  The adult actors are wonderful, especially Gary Oldman, who rarely disappoints in any film.  I could even (almost) adjust to the new Dumbledore.   <br />That being said, I was greatly disappointed by this movie.  Granted, there is a huge amount of material to be covered, but there were just too many plotholes in this film.  Anyone who didn't read the book will miss a lot of the charm of the story.  A few open loops: Who really wrote the Marauder's Map? Why does Prof Lupin know how to use it? Why does Harry's Patronus take the form it does? There are many more, but these were my biggest concerns.   <br />The younger actors can't get away with just being cute anymore, and that's a problem.  Daniel Radcliffe is developing nicely, but the others are not at that level.  Emma Watson's laughter is almost always painfully forced and it simply makes me cringe. <br />On top of all this, a lot of the expositional dialogue feels totally rushed and unnatural.  Oops, here's some more backstory real quick, let's shove it in there.  Maybe because so many arbitrary incidents are far too fleshed-out for the sake of a bigger message (Harry's growing feeling of manhood and freedom while riding the hippogriff) or for special effects sake (same example), thus leaving little time for plot development.   <br />I absolutely hated a lot of the director's choices.  It is important to leave one's own mark on their work, but I think he forgot that this is still Harry Potter, and that he should have been more faithful to the text and to the characters, not to mention the overall feel of the series.  I enjoyed the first two movies much more...they captured the magic, and the second film managed to be darker but still hold the charm that the third film almost totally lacked. <br />If this is the way the fourth film is going to be...I might not be too eager to see it.  Goodness knows the fourth book is much longer than the third.  I shudder to think what might result. <br /> <br />
B000784WMW|5.0|For the Jane Eyre/Bronte aficionados, this faithful interpretation will delight you.  Although Timothy Dalton is physically not who I picture as Mr. Rochester, his passionate portrayal will captivate you.  By far, of the 3 recent versions available on DVD, this is the one that sticks closest in plot, dialogue, text and subtext, with no unnecessary departures from the book.  If you loved the book this is the DVD version for you.
0060512806|5.0|What do Ronald Reagan, the Nazi Enigma Code, Captain Crunch cereal, and Internet Privacy all have in common?  Cryptonomicon.  Neal Stephenson weaves a fantastic web of connections until the reader begins to suspect that all things are related, if only one knows where to look.  Cryptonomicon is fairly brimming with useful advice.  Thinking about dating the daughter of a homicidal ex-Navy Seal?  It's in the book.  Have you suddenly found yourself doing business with a lawsuit-happy dentist with masochistic streak?  It's in here.  Need to know the optimum procedure for eating Captain Crunch cereal?  How about the Cartesian parking lot method of dividing family treasures, or tips on using heavy gauge pseudo-antique furniture to revitalize your love life?  It's all in here.  This book is fun, informative, irreverent, and fascinating.  What more can a reader ask?<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo\\"
B00007K02F|4.0|Zeffirelli's sweeping vistas and beautifully shot scenery lend to the feeling that you are watching a classic.    Charlotte Gainsbourg's Jane is probably my favorite portrayal of the intelligent, witty, plain governess yet.  William Hurt is passable as Mr. Rochester, however, the version starring Timothy Dalton has a much more convincing and considerable Mr. Rochester.  In fact, the version starring Timothy Dalton, in passion, plot and character development, and faithfulness to the book far surpasses all the other versions available on DVD today.  I believe it is impossible to cram all the amazing and beautiful dialogue between Jane and Mr. Rochester into a 2 hour film, however this version does try and nearly succeeds.  Enjoyable, but not a faithful portrayal of the book.
B0006399FS|5.0|You know, when a band has been around for 20+ years, it is rare to see such a good album.  There have been albums from older bands that always have songs that make you cringe when you hear them.  This album is not like that at all.  \\"Vertigo\\" is a very strong start to this album that has some really good riffs courtesy of The Edge.  \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" are songs that are reminiscient of The Joshua Tree.   \\"Love and Peace or Else\\"  reminds me of Achtung Baby to an extent.  \\"The City Of Blinding Lights\\" is another beautifully written tune that to me has a very etherial sound. \\"All Because Of You\\" is a lot like Vertigo though not quite as hard rocking.  \\"Man and a Woman\\" had a very R&B flavor to it.  \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" is a song about a person who has everything except, appearently a heart and is a very good song.  \\"One Step Closer\\" is a mellower song that sounds like it could have come from \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\".  \\"Original of the Species\\" and \\"Yahweh\\" speak directly to a spirituality that is hard to hear in music anymore. <br /> <br />The last two years of my life have been hard.  I have had a hard time finding my niche in life and I dealt with some pretty heartbreaking failures.   I even had a friend die last year.  U2's music speaks to me and offers me comfort through these times.  This album is no exception.  The only complaint that can be made is that it isn't \\"The Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Achtung Baby\\".  But then again what is?
1572814349|5.0|Just recieved my deck and I am astounded at the high quality of it.  An incredible buy for the price.  If you're a Tarot enthusiast, an admirer of Middle Age/Renaissance Art or just love owning beautiful things you'll be glad that you have this deck, it fulfills all three.  I had barely opened my package at my desk before co-workers were stopping by and asking about the cards and admiring the imagery of them.  The production values of the deck are quite good as well, a nice heavy card stock with a good \\"feel\\" to the cards and the gilt edging is a wonderful touch.  I can't imagine anybody purchasing this deck and being dissapointed by it. <br />If you'd like a preview of the cards before buying be sure to visit Kat Black's(creator of the deck) website at [...]
0446677450|5.0|I really liked this book! At first, I thought it was pretty much going to say the same things I haver heard before: \\"save your money and invest wisely\\". I thought it was interesting that this book advises people to not work for money, but to make money work for us. It makes sense. Another interesting point is that making good money doesn't always necesarilly mean that we need a safe, secure job. As rich dad would say, we need to make our emotions think and not let us think by our emotions. Overall, great book! I really enjoyed it and I definitely recommend it!
B0002JJBZE|4.0|Season two of Classic Trek epitomizes the best and worst of the 79 episodes.  In classic favorites like \\"Amok Time\\" and \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" we find our bold trekkers in the top form; the writing is excellent, the acting and directing are superb.  Yet, in classic groaners like \\"Patterns of Force,\\" \\"Omega Glory,\\" and \\"Gamesters of Triskelion\\" we find some of the worst television ever produced.  \\"Bread and Circuses\\" remains one of my all-time favorite episodes for lampooning television while presenting the most credible interpretation of the \\"Prime Directive,\\" which Kirk managed to break in most of the other 78 hours of the series.  \\"Tribbles\\" also has one of the best choreographed fight scenes in television history.
B0002MRPE0|1.0|This is embarrassing.  Please stop making music Joe.  You can't do your own material well so don't try to ruin other people's material as well.  The fact that you enlisted Clapton on guitar makes it clear that you hate music.  Thank you, <br />The American Public
0800141660|5.0|What else is there to say about this film besides the fact that it is charming, funny, touching and just bloody great!     Emma Thompson penned the flawless screenplay, adapted from Jane Austen's 1811 novel of the same name. The story centres around Elinor and Marianne, two fatherless sisters who have been forced to accept their fate as women unlucky in love and station or can things improve themselves?    * The casting! It is just perfect. It couldn't be bettered: Thompson, Winslet, Rickman, Wise, Grant,Jones were all brilliant, never over-acted but did exactly what was needed to immerse the viewer into the story. One stand out pair of the film is Mr and Mrs Palmer, friends of Col. Brandon, played with wit and humour by Hugh Laurie and Imelda Staunton. They were just hilarious! Kudos has to go to Harriet Walter (Fanny Dashwood) and Imogen Stubbs (Lucy Steele) as well, just great.     * The locations in films are really important for the visual effect and authenticity - S&S doesn't disappoint, showing the stunning English countryside of Devon and Cornwall in Regency times, making it all the more believable.       * Top class period film and another great Austen film adaptation. Shame period films aren't as good as this anymore!     --> Besides the wicked nature of this film, the DVD is very good as well. I am so pleased to see an international range of subtitles ranging from Dutch, Danish,Italian and Swedish amongst others. The deleted scenes, excellent commentaries, interesting trailers and Thompson's funny Golden Globe acceptance speech round off this cool DVD. 'S&S' is one DVD where the distributers FINALLY make the special features complement the film. (NB: In terms of special features, this review refers to the Region 2 DVD)    Well done!  BB
B00005JMEW|2.0|After the many kudos and great reviews this film has received, and having enjoyed Quentin Tarantino's other work such as \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" I was truly ready to enjoy \\"Kill Bill.\\" What a surprise then that I found it dreary and couldn't wait for it to end!<br /><br />The plot of Kill Bill is very simple: a woman assassin (whoa!) played by Uma Thurman, has been attacked and left for dead at her own wedding. She recovers and wreaks sweet revenge on her attackers in one-on-one, mano-a-mano martial arts fights. That's about it. The live action is intercut with dark anim&eacute;-style cartoon sequences. Dramatic lighting, acrobatic swordplay and stylized blood gushes give the film an almost comical cartoon feel of its own. While we have seen this sort of thing in other martial arts films like \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and \\"Hero,\\" Tarantino ramps up the action with graphic dismemberment, beheading and disembowelment. Some scenes are literally awash in blood. In a way, this is a welcome relief. Many films show swords slicing enemies, but few show the effects. Yet the effect in this film does nothing to lift the action out of its own numbing repetitiveness. There is no narrative arc to maintain interest in the characters. The heroine is already expert in her art, so there are no inner obstacles to overcome. She is just a nearly-invulnerable killing machine, let loose on other nearly-invulnerable killing machines. Halfway through the film, with no additional plot lines to keep my interest, I couldn't wait for the end credits.<br /><br />\\"Kill Bill\\" is drenched in blood as well as excessive and (IMHO) completely unnecessary profanity. Though some fight scenes are well-staged (the opening knife fight in a suburban kitchen is a standout), the rest were too predictable to keep my interest. I missed the last 20 minutes of the film, and I don't expect to see them -- or \\"Kill Bill, Vol 2,\\" for that matter.
B0002O7XWC|4.0|Well, I hadn't seen this movie in ~20 years, never owned the video OR an earlier DVD, so it was worth purchasing. But I WAS disappointed in the &quot;song-track&quot; (as a previous reviewer so aptly put it), why wasn't the other music from the movie, and especially &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot; (a personal favorite) included? And the book is a little dry for my liking - focused too much on the film-industry aspects and not enough on the times that generated the movie and what it meant to all of us who lived (even partially) during those times.<br />On the positive side, I'd never seen the documentary about the making of the film, and it was affirming to learn that most of the actors really were stoned out of their minds while they were making the movie...one always wonders about these things.<br />Overall, I'm happy to have finally added this to my collection, and to be able to share it with all my similar-generation friends.
B0000399WI|5.0|...one of the best movies I have ever seen. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman along with the many other great actors deliever  remarkable as remeberable performances in The Shawshank Redemption. You will never forget this movie! <br /> <br />A perfect movie? <br /> <br />If nothing is, well, then this is the closest thing to it. The ending is so amazing, and the last minutes of the movie so filled with \\"screen-poetry\\" and \\"footage-beauty\\" that it fills me with some sort of longing every time the credits starts to roll with the brilliant score. The ultimate movie about friendship.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is a great CD!!  <br /> <br />Best Songs on the Album: Toxic, Everytime, Shadow and Breath on Me and Boom Boom. <br /> <br />Worst Song: \\"Early Mornin'\\" it's just terrible. Sorry Britney. <br /> <br />Album Score Overall 8.5/10
B000002H1T|3.0|Lots of people say that this is the best Cars album, but they probably only like it because it was the only one publicized enough to make them want to go out and buy it. <br />\\"Panorama\\" is the last good album that The Cars put out, then they started to get a top 40 sound, they weren't themselves when they released their last few albums, it seemed like they just wanted to make money. <br />Pick up the 2 best albums by the Cars instead, \\"The Cars (self titled)\\" because it has some amazing songs, and the band is nice and fresh, and \\"Panorama\\" because it's really experimental, giving the album some elements you can't hear on the other ones, which I really like.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Man, what a ride! This movie just oozes with cool. Cruise does some of his finest work to date as a professional hitman who comes to the stark realization that he is somehow \\"flawed\\". He just simply nails the character, and brings to it a level of complexity quite often lacking in today's run-of-the-mill action crime dramas. Foxx was quite a surprise as the film's \\"ordinary man caught up in extaordinary events\\". I didn't know if he could pull it off, but I found myself quite pleased with his performance. These 2 lead characters play off each other quite well, and before the end, I kind-of hated that you knew the very fragile emotional bond they had forged during the night's events had to end. I very much liked that the whole movie spans just a few hours. It feels very \\"immediate and now\\", which just continually builds tension as the night presses on toward morning. Jada-Pinkett Smith doesn't do anything impressive, especially at the film's taut finish. She could have been a little more emotional about her situation. But that is one very minor flaw in what is great picture.<br /><br />Michael Mann's movies simply blow me away. The guy has a natural instinct for pairing film with music. I was such a big fan of \\"Miami Vice\\" back in the day, and was always impressed with just how much the right music can bring to a scene. He is the absolute best at this in the business, and \\"Collateral\\" just showcases this at every turn. Before this movie, \\"Heat\\" was my favorite Michael Mann movie. Now \\"Collateral\\" is!
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Communiqu is a really good follow-up to the band's debut album. <br />Once Upon a time in the west is very similar to \\"The Gallery\\" on \\"Dire Straits\\" but I think it's a better song than The Gallery. \\"News\\" is a really cool song too, something about it blows me away. Where do you think you're going is cool too, and the song \\"Communiqu\\" is certainly worthy of having the album named after it, it's great all around. The real masterpiece of the album, however, is Lady Writer, a song I can't stop listening to. Great chord progression and tempo make this song amazing. <br />Angel of Mercy and Portobello Belle are songs I like also, they're softer but still good. My personal favorite on the album \\"Single Handed Sailor\\" is next, it's fun to listen to and a great song all-in-all. Follow me Home is a good end to the album, making this a must-have for anyone who likes Dire Straits, 80's music or just Rock in general.
B00005JMYI|4.0|I bought this DVD mainly because of Will Ferrell. Almost anything he does I often find hilarious. Also, I liked the supporting cast with Paul Rudd, Steve Carrell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard. Well, the first time I watched it, I got about 20 minutes into it, and popped it out of my DVD player. Didn't care for it, didn't particularly find it very funny. I was pretty disappointed.<br /><br />Then I let a couple of friends watch it. They watched it while I was in adjacent room, working on a project for work. And they pretty much laughed throughout the entire movie. Laughed HARD. I couldn't figure out what they were laughing at, as I sure didn't expect them to find it as amusing as they did. One of them said it was the funniest movie he had seen in years!<br /><br />Well, now, I had to give this movie another shot. I'm glad I did. Little did I know; what a hilarious movie! I found myself laughing so I hard I literally hurt! I don't know whether it was just kind of slow in the beginning, or I really didn't have my mind on it, or what. I think a lot of people who didn't like the movie did like I did the first time I saw it, and gave up on it much too early. This is destined to become a cult classic, believe me! Pay attention to Steve Carrell, who plays the weatherman. He used to crack me up on \\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\\". He has some of the best moments in the movie. Vince Vaughn actually has some significant screen time in this, and he is more like the Vince Vaughn from \\"Old School\\" and less like the Vince Vaughn from, (ugghh!) \\"Dodgeball\\".<br /><br />Just give this movie a chance, if upon first viewing you find it not to your liking. You just might find it worth your while.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I was very pleased with the Trilogy on DVD.  All of the minor changes work towards making the entire Star Wars saga more cohesive.      The commentaries for the films were nice though at times I wished it would just be Lucas on the commentary as during scenes pivotal to the Star Wars story we would hear from one of the others and I kept wishing George would tell us more about the development of the scene from his perspective as the writer.    The other bonus materials were great, especially of course Empire of Dreams, which included information I had never encountered before even though I have watched just about every previous Star Wars making-of documentary.
B0000TB050|5.0|This album brings alot of memories back.Bono's voice just like other veterans of the stage is superb.They all end up a bit scratchy but hey they been at it for a long time.The music is great,stage and lights are fantastic. <br /> This venue is huge.The Castle in the background gives it a real Irish meaning from your living room.The transition from \\"All I Want Is You\\" to \\"Streets With No Name\\"was a tear jerker,it was full of emotion and bono made sure you felt it... <br /> Excellent packaging also.I hope they come out with a regular CD of the live show.
B00005JN0T|2.0|Nice Transfer, nice Audio, nice F/X, bad Script. A missed chance. Yes Will, you have been working out. With all that product placement I wonder if somebody put any money. No, it is far from Asimov. The good robot movie is still to be done. Spielberg's AI was a better try. The Day The Earth Stood Still has still the best robot so far (1951). It must not be easy.
B000055Y0X|3.0|Of course this is an all-time classic movie, but I am surprised to hear all the accolades about this DVD 40th anniversary edition. Most of the DVD extras are already available in various releases. The Robert McNamara interview is definitely only worth one viewing and he is not very credible to begin with. <br />Sadly, this 40th Anniv. Edition has attempted to present an aspect ratio of 1.66:1, which was only achieved by cropping the top & bottom of the picture. Also, the transfer is decidedly darker than any version I have seen. This results in a loss of detail, especially in the B-52 interior shots. <br />I would recommend buying the Special Edition DVD release already <br />available. The varying aspect ratios are true to the original theatrical release and it includes most of the extras on the 40th Anniv. release. Plus, you can get it for about half the price.
B00000J2SO|4.0|Down to earth came along in a really transitional time for  <br />rainbow . People need to understand this . I hear alot of people <br />say ( sorry , it was not dio ) . Personaly I was not a real big  <br />dio fan . Give credit were it is do RJD had a fabulous voice . <br />Graham Bonnet on the other hand just seem to do something for <br />this album . Ritche Blackmore once said this lineup , he really <br />felt could have been another Led Zepplin . And he could have  <br />been very well right . Yes , By this point RJD was gone but it's <br />time to move on , let's get over it , and give this album the <br />credit it deserves . this is a very honest album that was not <br />seen in the right perspective .
B0000C7PSW|5.0|My goodness can this man write a song.  The Schumann-like piano chords of \\"Pretty Things.\\"  It's driving me crazy that I don't seem to be able to find any sheet music yet for Rufus Wainwright's songs.  I want to be able to sit down and play it on my piano and guitars. <br /> <br />I think I listen to this CD at least once a day. . . .
B00005JMJ4|5.0|....I have.  We lived there from 2000-2003, and the first few months were very lonely for me due to the extreme differences in the culture.  To make a very long story short, our time near Tokyo has changed us forever, and we love Japan as a second home.  The friends we have there are very dear to us.  There is a brilliance in this movie that we don't see very often.  The scene where the whiskey commercial is filmed made us laugh.  The Japanese man talks for several minutes, and the translator comes back with just a few words; it's like that!  The English translation is usually shorter.  We saw things in that movie that made us miss Japan every time we see the movie.  For those who watch the movie and have any sense of cultural appreciation and sentimentality, pay attention to the scences when \\"Charlotte\\" talks to her friend stateside (who sounds shallow) about her first trip to the shrine, or how she willingly accepts her first ikebana lesson.  To see the Americans slow down and consider another country's traditions and cultural expressions as options to their own is a mature attitude, and I guess it takes a mature attitude to watch this movie and \\"get it\\".  See it for yourselves, and I hope you get to experience Japan some day.... <br /> <br />p.s.  My ONLY negative comment is about a club scene that made the movie have an R rating.  Other than that almost-nude scene that was out of place in this movie, it could've been a PG-13.  It's probably pretty realistic about some of the clubs in Tokyo, but it could've been left out of a movie.  My 2 cents.
B000654YS8|3.0|First off, I never had MTV back in the 1980s, so I never saw most of these dated videos.  I was a big Dire Straits fan as soon as the first album hit, and continue to purchase every Mark Knopfler CD to this day, so I was interested in seeing this DVD, if only for a historical perspective.  To be honest, this is the last DVD that I purchased from this group / artist from Amazon.  I bought the Mark Knopfler DVD \\"Night in London\\" and the Dire Straits DVD \\"On the Night\\", as soon as they became available back in mid-November and as of yet have not seen them due to those DVD not being in stock.  I bought this DVD as a fill-in until I get (what I hope is) the superior Mark Knopfler DVD.<br /><br />Just to get the negative things out of the way, first this is a two-channel stereo DVD.  I wouldn't care, except the cover has a sticker that says 5.1.  It is not 5.1, but only your basic left and right front speaker stereo.  Next is the cover's track listing with numbers that do not match the actual track numbering.  This makes direct access a bit confusing, since everything is one-off for some reason.  Last is the interview with Knopfler, which I was looking forward to after reading about it here.  It is only audio, not video, so you don't get to see him or have any way of knowing how old it is (which hair line he is sporting in it).<br /><br />Overall the music is pleasing.  In two-channel stereo, the sound quality is equal to the CDs from these songs.  The video transfer is average quality, about what you'd see with a VHS tape.<br /><br />I won't go over every track, but I was a bit frustrated by a couple of short songs.  They left the whole terminal solo out of \\"Sultans of Swing\\", which I was looking forward to watching as a guitar player myself.  \\"Love over Gold\\" also ends abruptly compared to the actual track on the CD.  There were a couple of songs that were clearly cut and pasted from stock footage to make a video for songs that never had a video.<br /><br />All of that said, there were some nice videos that really worked well with the songs.  \\"Brothers in Arms\\" is a nice looking video that replicates pencil sketching, but in motion.  The mood really compliments the song.  There were some humorous tracks also, such as \\"Heavy Fuel\\" which has actor Randy Quaid  (the Vacation series' Cousin Eddy) as a roady that keeps getting in the way during a sound check.<br /><br />This DVD is fine for true fans of the group that might wish to simply have everything from them, but it is not first class in terms of the things that make DVDs great.  If you want to see how good a video can be of Mark Knopfler, in terms of both the sound and video transfer, then check out the rendition of \\"Brothers in Arms\\" on the DVD, \\"Music for Montserrat\\".  Run this through a good sound system with all 6 speakers to support the 5.1 sound and it is stunning. Maybe this DVD has caused me to be hypercritical for the reduce quality of the Dire Straights DVD that I am reviewing.eos that really worked well with the songs.  \\"Brothers in Arms\\" is a nice looking video that replicates pencil sketching, but in motion.

B00004S367|5.0|in 1971,(after his breakaway motown album \\"where i'm coming from\\"-an album that mixed lovesongs of regret and it's social political message)the musical genius stevie wonder exiled himself from the musical restraints of motown and chairman berry gordy-moved to new york and pursued a new ground breaking musical journey and chose \\"electric ladyland\\" studios-a studio that was built and made famous by the legendary guitarist jimi hendrix.the sounds of new musical technology was on wonder's mind and he met with robert margouleff and malcolm cecil(who were the experts of synthesizers,the moog and the ARP.)whom wonder had hired for the development of his new sound.wonder felt that synthesizers gave him a way to express what was coming from his mind.so,the title that stevie came up with his new album would be entitled \\"music of my mind\\" an album of musical maturity and glorious modern sound.but it was also the first official album in his new second phase of his brilliant career where he was allowed to roam free in flight with a new liberated musical spirit.\\"music of my mind\\" is the dawning of a new era for stevie and it was the album that had started it all for him in his new beginning for all of his seventies glory.released in march,1972-\\"music of my mind\\" opens with the lyrics of all the songs printed inside the album jacket which also opens with a beautiful collage of the earth,human beings and other artifacts including five photographic images of stevie.<br /><br />\\"music of my mind\\" opens with the first funk cut of the album 'love having you around'(which was co-written with his ex-wife syreeta wright)which is 7 minutes and 21 seconds of wonder delivering his funky synthesizer magic,and celebrating the funky joy of love with his woman:'and when the day is through/nothin'to do/just sit around groovin'with you/and i say it 'cause i love having you around'-this jam also sounds like a love party.what is also unique about this funk number is it's hypnotic bass drum beat.the song features art baron on trombone.'superwoman'is the album's first love ballad.the song could very well detail his relationship with his ex syreeta.this lovesong of romantic regret is one of the many beautiful lovesongs that is in his loveballad  repertoire.'superwoman'has a jazzy soulful sensuality.the song's instrumentation and complexed melody is a thing of wonder to listen to.it takes the listener inside wonder's mind for music of the future.despite the song's beautiful and complexed jazz melody,it is a song that speaks of a romantic relationship that was coming to an end.the romantic but regretful tone that wonder sings in the song about his lover:'mary wants to be a superwoman-but is that really in her head-but i just want to live each day to love her for what she is'...midway thru the song he had to leave her because she tried to 'boss the bull around'...wonder continues:'but very well,wish that you knew me too-very well-and i think i can deal with everything going thru your head'.at the song's conclusion,as the seasons changed from summer into winter he missed his woman as she was nowhere to be found.this love story has heartbreak reality written all over it when one lover wants to dominate the other.heartbreak aside,this masterpiece of a song has many musical treasures to it,with its progressive chord changes,jazz stylings, and the many vocal and musical moods that wonder displays in this piece.it also features great guitar work by buzzy feiton.<br /><br />'i love every little thing about you'is a midtempo groove and is a song about a woman whom he loves very much.the song's glorious celebration is that he loves her because she has been there for him thru thick and thin,and he tells the world that he loves her so.in the song,wonder details the outside forces of those who may criticize him for the love that he has found:a woman that is very good to him of which he vocalizes:'though they put me down because-i love you as much as i do-they don't know what you've done for me-you've made such a happy man out of me'...this song is a good reference point for couples who are truly in love and just ignore people who are jealous of couples who have a strong loving bond together.'sweet little girl'is wonder's most funniest erotic song in his entire catalogue,but it is done in good taste.the song is split in half:part vocal and part talk rap.the track's subject matter is a hunger from the man waiting in vain for his woman to make love to him.in a spoken word slow rap tone wonder implies:'come on now honey-sugar,you know your baby loves you,more than i love my clavinet.so baby,do me good,do me good baby'...near the song's ending wonder tries to influence his woman to make love to him by taking her to see the classic 1971 movie\\"sweet,sweetback\\"(a film by melvin van peebles)by the song's conclusion he begged her to the very end to no avail.<br /><br />'happier than the morning sun'is one of wonder's most simplest of melodies that is so heartfelt and warm.the melody although very simple in sound with just wonder's classic voice and clavinet.it's the type of song that you could wake up to in the morning when the sun is shinning it's rays through your window.the song's lyrics are not complex in any way,but they are simple enough for you to understand the song's meaning about simple happy love about the sweet lady that he has found:'all my life i was alone,didn't think i'd find my part,now i see there's joy inside your arms'...i'm happier than the morning sun/and that's the way it will always be/ever since the day you came inside my life/bom bom bom-i love you...(this song's simple melody is a precursor twin to 'big brother'-a political song that would be on wonder's next album later in the same year of 1972-\\"talking book\\"...in fact,'you are the sunshine of my life'was written and recorded around this time which was inspired by his new girlfriend,gloria barley at the time and it could have been included on \\"music of my mind\\" but wonder saved the song for \\"talking book\\" he did not want to include the song on \\"music of my mind\\" because of his breakup with syreeta.)<br /><br />'girl blue'co-written with yvonne wright is a song that has a'bluedawn'feeling to it,with some of the greatest poetry ever written in a songpiece.the sound of this track reminds me of fall weather on a cloudy afternoon.this track is about a sad girl who is feeling down with depression as wonder cheers her up with beautiful lines of songpoetry:'in an instant there'll be sunshine sprinkled every place.drops of rain will kiss the softness of your lovely face'...a great poetic songpiece...'seems so long'the second and final loveballad on this album.words cannot describe how cool this song really is.i would have to put this song in wonder's top ten of his many classic loveballads.though it is often very much overlooked and ignored i rank it in the top ten of his collection of lovesongs.this song would fit nicely after 'superwoman'because both songs melodies are similar in style and composition.'seems so long'has wonder's keyboard mastery of the synthesizer with such glorious musical textures.it is amazing how wonder opens this track with a synthesized wind breeze as if one needed to put a jacket on when hearing the track's wind sounding introduction.despite the song's romantic sounding vibe,it is about having love and suffering without love when it leaves you.stevie intones this topic perfectly:'lady loved and lady cared,and lady went away,and left me all alone to suffer...lady loved and lady stayed,until she was too pleased she knew i wouldn't leave for her to suffer.i'd never make her suffer...by song's end he is on the rebound:'now i think i've found someone to make me trust in someone again'...'seems so long'is a song about losing and regaining love.<br /><br />'keep on running'is a relentless funk assault.although the lyrics are repetitive,the song's message can still be understood.this is a song about a man who is pursuing awoman who he desperately wants of which she keeps on running from his love for her and he informs her that the man that she is with is no good,and that he will break her heart.the powerful backing vocalists on this funk workout add to the tune's power and climatic ending.'evil'co-written with yvonne wright,is the final cut on this album and is his first gospel song of his new musical era.the song's opening somber synthesizer gospel chords is setting the tone for a spiritual revelation in wonder's music.in the song, wonder questions the evil forces that hurts the souls of humanity:'evil,why have you destroyed so many minds...leaving ,room for darkness where lost dreams can hide'...midway through this spiritual gospel saga,his backing vocalists give wonder outstanding backing support as their voices reach a heavenly crescendo,as wonder continue to question the negative forces of evil's wrath on society:'evil,why have you broken so many homes...leaving sweet love all alone,an outcast of the world'...this was the perfect song for wonder to conclude the first album of his new era.stevie wonder's \\"music of my mind\\" was the the first major milestone in his career.and as the album cover liner notes states:'this album is a gift to the spirit from one who really cares'...alking book\\" he did not want to include the song on \\"music of my mind\\" because of his breakup with syreeta.)

B000002G8N|5.0|Well, most of the people knows about 461 ocean boulevard or slowhand, but somehow misses this brilliant album. There are no monster hits on it (I shot the sheriff, Cocaine, Wonderful tonight,...) but all the songs are good, and what's more, they blend together nicely. <br /> <br />It opens with Something Special, Clapton's original, cheerful country. Somewhat ironic lyrics - \\"she ain't too pretty, she ain't too tall, in fact she ain't too much of anything at all\\", plus hooky melody, easy, relaxed playing, and you're in laid - back mood... It continues with another country, Black Rose, with refrain so catchy, that you'll sing along with Clapton and Brooker. Just not to sail all the way to Tulsa, there is juicy Muddy Water's blues, Blow Wind Blow. What you hear first is Clapton's voice - next time he'll sing like this on From the Cradle. Second thing you'll notice is that guitar isn't as distinctive as you'll expect on EC's album. Than you'll realize that you didn't even hear the guitar on first two songs! But this is classic blues song, guitar solo is mandatory, but guitar is \\"burried\\", you can hear ALL the instruments - you're listening to the BAND. And I like that. I dare to say that this is the sound Clapton was looking for very long time. Or, let's not say the sound, call it the blend. Title song that follows this blues is luckily beautiful, and sang with heart - otherwise it would make you sick - synthesizers are the main instrument (for the first time on EC's album, I think). Side A is completed with I Can't Stand It, song that miraculosly was top ten hit, and later was on every compilation from that period. <br />B side opens with Hold Me Lord, gospel song played in J.J. Cale style, with slide guitars, and cheerful rhythm,... And than, the best song on the album - Elmor James' Floating Bridge! Played solwly, slowly, and quietly, for your ears only... <br />Catch Me If You Can is twin brother (or sister) to I Can't Stand It. Call it Blues-pop or blues-rock, this is very close to another hit song. <br />And than - grand finale! Rita Mae! Crazy jam, the only complain is - it's too short, mere 5 mins. One good thing about cd is you don't have to get up and aim the needle. You simply press no. 9, repeat, and it goes on forever... Bend sounds so inspired, almost like the best moments from Layla album. <br /> <br />As I said in the title, Another Ticket is most underated Clapton's album.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I found this movie to be enchanting and dark all at the same time.       There is much beauty in the scenery and the emotions in the characters.      I find this movie to be extremely enchanting, however it does have it's tense moments, so I don't recommend it for children under 7 years of age; or any child that is prone to nightmares.      Peter Pan has always been a wonderful story, and I love to see different interpretations, and this one stands right up there with Disney's cartoon version.
B000002G8J|4.0|One of Clapton's best albums. Biggest flaw is certainly a poor production - even digital remastering cannot improve the sound significantly. <br />There are number of great tunes there - Walk Out In The Rain, Watch Out For Lucy, If I Don't Be There By Morning, Tulsa Time,... Of course, there is J.J. Cale's cover I'll Make Love To You Anytime, than great blues, Early In The Morning, and even some pop tunes, Golden Ring and Promises... <br />But as I said, production is \\"muddy\\". If you happen to have Just One Night - you know what I am talking about. Backless is the base for this, widely accepted as, best solo live album.
B00004RJEG|5.0|I've always liked the Corrs but this DVD really highlighted their talent (and beauty!) even more. Unplugged/acoustic music DVD's are always a measure of how much is real talent and musical proficiency. Especially with singing, there's no hiding a lack lustre performance behind sound effects and noisy crowds. Andrea's singing is spot on and the viewers are small in numbers so as she puts it, it is \\"intimate\\" giving it a different atmosphere to a concert of thousands. <br />I think their set list worked well to, also giving Andrea a break by having the other two sisters perform a duo.  <br />I'd really like them to do another unplugged/acoustic set with some of their material as its been a few years now since this DVD was recorded. <br />The Corrs are real musicians and artists. No need for lip syncing here. If you're a Corrs fan, and can only afford one DVD, this is the one to get.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|MEET THE FOCKERS is 100 x better than this boring garbage of a movie...It has two funny parts...When he gets slammed against the locker and that little kick he does, and then when they two guys are riding their bikes.  THATS IT!
B00028HBKM|4.0|Take any book, true or fictional, have the director, producers, actors, musical composer, set and costume designer etc etc - (anyone involved with the films making)make a film adaptation based on their own artisitc interpetations, and not everyone will like it. <br /> <br />This is a film. Not an effort to convert everyone to christianity. Its a historical adaptation and intpretation of the last hours of Jesus life prior to his death, not about his enitre life's work or message of what people think his life was about. <br /> <br />It was gory, but they were gory times. There are a lot of complaints about the whipping scene, but just because one verse in the Bible is devoted to his scourging (ie \\"and he was scourged) doesnt mean the ordeal was that brief. <br /> <br />I think the film was well done. For the christian believer, I think the quiet utterings of well know verse should have more impact and profoundness rather than getting caught up in the hype of its violence. <br /> <br />If you're not a christian believer, this movie in not bad as a historical account of the man called Jesus Christ. <br /> <br />Judge the film because its a film. DOn't judge it based on your prejudices /persuasions(for or against) about christianity.
0783225857|5.0|This is one of the all time classics.  There is a reason schools use it in their classes!!  It is an illustration of good vs. evil, the innocence of the young, courage, discrimination, prejudice and many more themes that have been missed by some of its critics.  If you want to know what life was like in the 30's this is it.  Ms. Lee's writing is a wonderful blend of child like innocence and the intelligent pen of a mature woman.  Some people will never understand but for those who do, you will never forget your sojourn with Scout and Jem. <br />
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|More than any other film that comes to mind, \\"Blow Up\\" illustrates the adage distinguishing the novelist from the filmmaker: the former's concern is to make the significant visible whereas the latter's passion is to bring significance to the visible.  Little does it matter that the film's protagonist fails in that quest.  Antonioni manages to make the search itself so absorbing that the \\"whodunnit\\" motif of the narrative is incidental to the  journey itself.  \\"Pictures don't lie\\" is another old bromide being put to the test by this film's unique thematizing of the photographic process itself, and Antonioni's accomplishment is to preserve the spirit if not the letter of the statement.  We leave the film believing in the power of the photographed image even if both its meaning and content remain inconclusive.<br /><br />Watching the film in the theater was a spellbinding and unforgettable experience. Anyone who has seen the director's out-of-control if not disastrous \\"Zabriskie Point\\" and subsequently decided to pass up \\"Blow Up\\" should definitely reconsider.  Just a couple of caveats: the film does, in fact, transfer quite poorly to a small video monitor, bringing excessive attention to dated features of the pop cultural landscape of the late '60's London scene.  Moreover, because video cameras are now the everyman's commodity, while cropping, editing, and enlargening images are common practice in modern-day consumer culture, some of the undeniable excitement experienced by David Hemmings with each of his successive blow-ups is bound to seem much more mundane.  And perhaps by now we fancy we know more about photography than either Antonioni or Hemmings, especially after the failure of even instant replay to be definitive about whether a touchdown was scored.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if you have a large screen, some patience and a memory of the promise and challenges of an earlier technology, \\"Blow Up\\" still is capable of working at several important levels--as existential philosophy, as postmodern text, as compelling narrative (Hemmings is wonderful), and as a respite from many current overly loud, fractically edited blockbusters that, despite the sound and fury, signify nothing whatsoever., as postmodern text, as compelling narrative (Hemmings is wonderful), and as a respite from many current overly loud, fractically edited blockbusters that, despite the sound and fury, signify nothing whatsoever.
B000089QEN|3.0|My interest in vanity Fair was first piqued by the Mira Nair version, which I saw in the theater.  In comparison to the big Hollywood production this series paints a much bleaker view of Becky Sharp.  It is Natasha Little's portrayal of Becky that makes this worth seeing. Ms. Little does an incredible job with the ups and downs of Becky's ambitions. You don't often get a heroin who you struggle to like, but this Becky is coniving, and a bad mother-- qualities that get sugar coated in Reese Witherspoon's version. There are downsides-- the music is often annoying and seems to have the wrong timing, there are visuals of people picking thier noses, vomiting, and pigs snorting around during the credits.  After getting over these ugly visuals I began to really enjoy this series.  Don't write-off the Reese Witherspoon version though- it is stunningly colorful and a beautiful production.  (p.s.  Look for Natasha Little in both productions -- she plays Lady Jane in the hollywood version)
B00005JN0T|3.0|This movie is okay.  The speical effects were awesome the actors were good but it just felt like I was missing something when watching it.  I did like it just not well enough to own it which I did buy it because I had never seen it before and thought it looked good.  I would recommend going out and renting it first because like me you may not feel this is a movie to own just more of a one time thing.

B0000CFW87|5.0|I listened many times to this beautiful album.  Josh's voice has a tender innocence and a hopefulness that comes with youth. I think that is part of the great charm of this CD. <br /> His CD falls well into the new genre of classical crossover greats like Bochelli, Liata and Brightman. Like these artists he sings in several of the latin based languages, Italian, French and Spanish. The world needs more of these wonderful artists to lift our spirits. I hope this is a rennaisance of the great romantic ballads that the world was so full of during the early 1900's to 1940's. <br />Groban's newest CD is a welcome addition to the new movement of music for today discerning listeners. <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|I am a new U2 fan. I am young (14). I have heard thier hits from thier last CD. I decided to buy this CD since I new thier history and wanted to give it a try. I was glad. I was surprised when I learned that Vertigo was misplaced in this album. This album has great guitar riffs and great lyrics by Bono. Each song has its own meaning. Vertigo which is getting overplayed is a great song besides that. My other favorite songs are Miracle Drug, City of Blinding Lights, All Because of You . My least favorite was A Man and A Women and Yahweh, they are still ok songs just my least fovorite. I just found that song dull. This CD does have some flaws but it is sitll a solid album from a great band. I will start buying some of the older U2 albums that way I can see the progressing over the years. <br /> <br />And to the reviewer Myles J. Burke: Yes I will listien to this CD in a year!
B000003TBP|1.0|I'm in more or less total agreement with Janitor-X's 10/5/04 statement that this is basically a pile of pop culture detritus regurgitated and cut-and-pasted in a nonsensical way. Let me add some of my own thoughts.<br /><br />I love strange music, but Beck's works are just a mess. Anyone with a substantial record collection and random instruments could throw something like Odelay together in a few days. This is part of Beck's \\"ironic\\" and \\"quirky\\" shtick (two concepts that are often and pretentiously abused in the world of indie rock) along with his completely nonsensical lyrics and flat, monotonal talk-singing (calling it \\"rapping,\\" as far as I'm concerned, is an insult to every respectable MC out there). Basically his inspiration is the masterful Dust Brothers production job on the '89 Beastie Boys album Paul's Boutique, which was a thousand times better at achieving the \\"pop culture thrown in a blender\\" thing (copyright laws have made any attempt to usurp that album's throne impossible, at least in the sampling realm). Turntablists like DJ Shadow also do similar material, to much better effect.<br /><br />Odelay comes off as an amateurish and sonically busy copy of that sound, masking any lack of soul and originality, genuine inspiration, and lyrical statement in favor of an unbearable forced irony and weirdness. And then you have the fact that Beck seems to try to \\"reinvent\\" himself with every album, but it comes off as an attempt to stay trendy rather than any sort of honest artistic progression.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Beck is still the darling of indie music critics and media outlets such as Pitchfork, for reasons I still cannot entirely fathom; the existence of musicians like Mr. Bungle (and Mike Patton in general), Secret Chiefs 3, Frank Zappa, Soul Coughing, and the aforementioned hip-hop artists, all of whom blend humor, ecclecticism, innovation, and musical talent seamlessly, render Beck and his entire catalog obsolete.
B00004Z400|5.0|I am truly saddened that some people actually don't enjoy this album. This is by far the best Deftones album. Chino was meticulous about arranging his vocals on this album. There is little or no profanity on this album which is unlike previous Deftones records. Which I'm not against profanity at all, but it was nice to see less aggression and more subtlety. There is hit after hit, starting with the anthem Back to School (Mini Maggit) and ending with a follow up version of the song called Pink Maggit. Every song is wonderful and the lyrics prove that Chino can write deep meaningful lyrics contrary to his more aggressive writing style on Around the Fur and Adrenaline. Digital Bath is nearly the best song on the album, just beautifully dreadful. It's a song telling about killing your girlfriend by throwing an electrical appliance in a bath tub while she is bathing and killing her. RX Queen is my personal favorite because I dedicate it to my girlfriend(It's a mushy love song). Teenager and Change (in the house of flies) are both softer mood influenced songs. Passenger which Chino is joined with Maynard James Keenan ,the lead singer from Tool a.k.a. God, and they really go together well. I wouldnt really consider this a concept album, but this cd is better listened to from start to finish. If you ever see Deftones live in concert, they will probably perform at least 5 or 6 songs off this cd, so I would highly recommend this album to anyone. It's a good album to start off on if you are not familiar with the Deftones' style, since it's not overly aggressive and it's an easy cd to just listen to and relax. White Pony is definitely a five star cd. Well worth the price.
B000001FRY|4.0|Taking a look at my old u2 vynile collection of the 80s, I thought first which of my old u2 records sampler should i purchase in cd, and finally i decided undoubedtly for this one.<br /><br />\\"Boy\\" is the debut album every rock band wish to record for the first time. It's besides, one of the u2 albums which had survived sucessfully the path of the time and it's in its esence, the most true, energetic and hence, darkest of them all...Boy posseses a spirit that cannot be found in other ones - those commercially more sucessfull u2 records of the nineteens-.<br /><br />The strenght of this album is based on its powerful stream, its brilliant lyrics, its danger...It's the most genuine Irish of all their records, taking its Irishness not as a patriotical statement, as they did -more or less explicit- in later post-Eno works and at the same time discovering the fascination for everything American-, but as spontane and truly Irish in its roots and originallity...This is a beautiful piece of Irish Rock at its best, not self indulgent or  cynical. It performs -through a musical high tension wire- several tracks all connected in its tematic as a round block of self analysis of fears and features of desperation.<br /><br />The song's titles are full of literary winks and soul searching statements of someone who's taking a step into the insecure outer world contrasting with the richer inner world. Bono's self-portrait of his expectactions and fears turns out witty and beautiful and it reaches interesting masterpieces in a introspective way in which he  -unfortunately- didn't show so often and so poetically after gathering the millions...<br /><br />A special mention deserves \\"An Cat Dubh -Into The Heart\\", one of the biggest -not the most acknowledged, though- tracks in u2 career...In the cd separated in two different tracks, it's therefore, the same suite. An Cat Dubh (A Black Cat in Gaelic) tells about how beauty and danger goes beside at times and about the jeopardy of some relationships based on fascination which turn out in certain destructive endings that don't run into new disclosures. As it's been pointed out above pointed above, a relationship inspired this song and the sight of a black cat playing first and after killing a mouse for inmediately falling asleep beside the victim, as if nothing had really happened. A thought about the danger that sleeps beyond all beauty (\\"Yes, now I know the truth about you\\"). The guitar is yelling-banshee like and full of tension, leading the string into a catarsis at Into The Heart.<br /><br />Other best of Boy-songs are \\"A Day Without Me\\", surpringsingly a insight of the world after an hypothetical suicide, though the cheery melody; \\"The Ocean\\", a beautiful onomatopoeia of staring at the motion of sea, and of course, the gorgeous \\"Twlight\\", \\"Shadows And Tall Trees\\", amongst others. Somehow Boy settles the milestone for the second and more aclaimed hit album \\"War\\" that made them known internationally, in which they got more into political statements with few exceptions (Drowning Man), thus, the existential depth of \\"Boy\\" is lacking here...After that, Eno should come to polish that raw and gifted poetry and nothing would be the same as before, therefore, Boy shall remain as a sort of memorial to prove of what they were keen to do...even without Brian- for the time being...n fascination which turn out in certain destructive endings that don't run into new disclosures.

B000002UB3|5.0|I think to truly appreciate this CD, one has to go past the front line lead melodies, guitar riffs, etc. For instance, I think the background harmonizations show just how tight these guys were, vocally. There are the obvious, such as Because and Here Comes The Sun King, but even on the silly stuff. Oh, Darling comes off at first like a Paul McCartney bowel movement. But listen to the background vocals. Among the tightest I have heard from The Beatles. Or the three minute ending to I Want You (She's So Heavy) which, if you let it surround you, almost takes you on a strange and mystical flight as it slowly increases in intensity. I could go on like this, but instead, I challenge all to toss on some headphones and let the lead vocals and insturmentations blow by you. Dig into each song, and I think you'll see why this has to be classed as one of the three top efforts produced by The Beatles.
0800105877|5.0|Reading the lines above : No matter of how easy may be to scorn gifted genius, folks, you should first think and then act before trying to trench infamously this delightful dainty in a couple of poorly woven sentences, for this is one of the best Hamlets EVER seen and heared. Williamson's Hamlet crashes Branagh's right and left and overshadows the rest of the ensemble -but Hopkins'-. Yes, he looks like 50, though he was just 30, and so what?. So did also Orson Welles when he played the Claudius with Miche&aacute;l MacL&iacute;ammo&iacute;r in the Hamlet role though this last one was over ten years his senior...Williamson could be for my sake 120, then his contribution to the character (edgy, defiant, sour, superb!) is probably the best one. And even if the backdrops were kind of unsofisticated and the whole production sparse -Richardson was lacking of the buck, hence the humble get-up- its darkness rather enhances the characters on stage, getting more eye-catching and preventing the spectator from any superfluous item that would disturb his attention. It's beautiful the way characters emerge from and slink and into the darkness. Williamson doesn't fall in the trap of giving the audience what they expect, nor needs to dye his hair or hide behind a million dollar scenery for a self complacent showing off, then what he's offering the respectable is a raw and intensely truculent Hamlet full of sarcasm and dangerously strong emotions, provided you can take them...<br /><br />Yes, folks, this guy is unreachable, the KILIMANJARO of all Hamlets, if not the Everest. Not to be missed in anything -check the Merlin in Boorman's \\"Excalibur\\" or as the coke-snoring Sherlock Holmes in \\"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\\"-. And where is he hiding now?. Is he still playing theater in London or elsewhere?.<br /><br />Richardson was brilliant as well and did a good producer work,  risky and controversial, it's just a pity that the play had to suffer from the many cuts in the screening version. This fact merms the whole thing a bit.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to the Kenneth Branagh's Estrogen Brigades, but for the rest of the respectable is just indispensable, if you can renounce to overloaded parades of firework in Shakespeare's adaptions.<br /><br />Yes, mamma, give me more of this!ng a bit. <br />I wouldn't recommend this to the Kenneth Branagh's Estrogen Brigades, but for the rest of the respectable is just indispensable, if you can renounce to overloaded parades of firework in Shakespeare's adaptions.  <br />Yes, mamma, give me more of this!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Anyone liking Iron Maiden's previous music (with Dickinson at the helm) will absolutely love this album. Strong songwriting and good performance from everyone.    If there's anything negative, it is that a lot of the time they don't take full advantage of having three guitar players. With the previous album, Brave New World, you could hear it immediately and it really kicked (...)big time. This time you have to listen extra carefully to notice the extra guitar. You can distinquish the different styles from solos etc. but the interplay between the three guitars is not nearly as fun or noticeable as on Brave New World.    Other than that one gripe, I find nothing negative to this album.
B0006399FS|5.0|What is left for a band to do after playing with BB King and experimenting with electronica?  Maybe they can go back to just write some good old rock songs?!?  In other words, be a rock and roll band again. U2 did just that on \\"How to...\\"  Do not be fooled by the simplicity of these 12 tracks.  The simplicity conceals decades of sonic experimentation.  U2 had assimilated diverse musical styles so well that we hardly notice them.  As in Zen, simplicity may be Art at the hightest level of realization.  Album highlights are    \\"Vertigo\\" -- smash single in the tradition of \\"The Fly,\\" \\"Discothque\\" and \\"Elevation.\\"  \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Sometimes\\" -- two tracks build up slowly and climax in the middle.  They recall \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" and \\"Joshua Tree\\" sessions.  \\"All Because of You\\" -- U2 does David Bowie glam rock.      \\"Man and a Woman\\" -- This song has R&B feel to it.  Great bass and drum beats.  The meaningful lyrics makes it the best love song in rock for adults.   \\"Original of the Species\\" -- U2 does the ballad in the way only U2 is capable of.    Rock music is so fragmented right now.  U2 may well be the last great rock band that unites us all.  It offers something for everyone...even those who hardly listen to rock.  That by itself is a testament of their greatness.
0156421178|5.0|It's been said that George Orwell is every conservative's favorite liberal and every liberal's favorite conservative.  This book likely did more to create that sentiment than any of Orwell's other works. <br /> <br />\\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is the story of Orwell's experience fighting in Spain, during 1936 and 1937, against Franco's forces that were seeking to overthrow the Spanish government.  Orwell originally traveled to Spain simply to report on the war as a journalist, but falling in love with the people of Catalonia and their revolutionary, honestly egalitarian spirit, Orwell joined the Workers' Party of Marxist Unity (POUM) militia.   <br /> <br />Once enlisted, Orwell traveled to the front lines of the fight in Catalonia.  His observations of life on the front-line and the daily struggles for a soldier during war are at times funny, fascinating, and depressing.  Remarking on war, especially the politics of war, Orwell writes, \\"I believe that on such an issue as this no one is or can be completely truthful;\\" yet Orwell seems supernaturally honest throughout this book. <br /> <br />After risking his life for the socialist cause he believed in, even being shot in the neck, Orwell eventually realized that many people he once assumed were fighting for the same anti-Fascist cause as he were really no different than the enemy he was fighting.  The anti-Fascist soldiers were generally divided into Anarchists (who believed that a Marxist revolution should be the immediate goal) and Communists (who believed that the Fascists must be defeated first and the Marxist revolution addressed after that).  Orwell originally sided with the Communists in believing that the Fascists should be defeated first, but over time he came to realize that all the Communists were really wanting was the installation of their own totalitarian system.  This left Orwell to fight with and support the Anarchists who were far more genuine than the Communists and simply wanted to be free from any oppressive rule.  After months of political bickering, the pro-Stalin Communists in Spain began to arrest and remove the Anarchists with whom they had originally partnered in the fight against Franco, and many of Orwell's friends and brothers-in-arms were arrested and executed.  Orwell, still recovering from his gunshot wound to the neck, barely managed to escape from Spain and avoid being caught in the brutal purge of the Anarchists.  Knowing he had done nothing morally wrong or anything for which he should logically be arrested, Orwell inititally wanted to stay and help free his friends arrested in the Communist crackdown.  But he soon came to realize, \\"It did not matter what I had done or not done. This was not a round-up of criminals; it was merely a reign of terror. I was not guilty of any definite act, but I was guilty of `Trotskyism'. The fact that I had served in the P.O.U.M. militia was quite enough to get me into prison. It was no use hanging on to the English notion that you are safe so long as you keep the law. Practically the law was what the police chose to make it.\\" <br /> <br />Orwell wrote \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" seven months after he escaped from Spain.  By then he had time to consider the politics of the war from a distance and relate what he had seen and heard from people who never experienced life on the front-line of a war.  The parts of the book in which he addresses these people are the most fascinating.  In several of these passages Orwell writes of how he came to the realization that many of the people driving the Marxist ideas he once supported were every bit as dishonest and treacherous as the right-wing Fascists he always hated.  As he writes of the press covering the war, \\"One of the dreariest effects of this war has been to teach me that the Left-wing press is every bit as spurious and dishonest as that of the Right.\\"  Orwell's scorn extends beyond the left-wing press to wealthy English travelers through Spain at the time who were obliviousor apathetic to the widespread misery around them.  Writes Orwell, \\"Some of the English visitors who flitted briefly through Spain, from hotel to hotel, seem not to have noticed that there was anything wrong with the general atmosphere. The Duchess of Atholl writes, I notice (Sunday Express, 17 October 1937): 'I was in Valencia, Madrid, and Barcelona... perfect order prevailed in all three towns without any display of force. All the hotels in which I stayed were not only \\"normal\\" and \\"decent\\", but extremely comfortable, in spite of the shortage of butter and coffee.'  It is a peculiarity of English travellers that they do not really believe in the existence of anything outside the smart hotels. I hope they found some butter for the Duchess of Atholl.\\" <br /> <br />It must have been hard for Orwell to come to terms with the fact that many people he once supported were no less repugnant than his enemies.  When faced with such a situation, human beings have a natural urge to deny or make excuses for what they are seeing or hearing, for whatever their reasons.  It is hard for people to admit when they are wrong, especially regarding something they care deeply about.  Orwell faced this situation, and he chose honesty over ideology.  Sadly, many of his contemporaries did not.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Prospective viewers of MASTER AND COMMANDER should be warned up front: This movie may not be what you expect.  And you should be further warned that if you go in with the right expectations, you will be rewarded with now seems to be the very best movie of its kind - and certainly one of the very best movies of 2003. <br /> <br />It is impossible to discuss MASTER AND COMMANDER without reference to the now legendary 20 volume series written by Patrick O'Brian.  O'Brian managed the unlikely feat of taking Jane Austen (two of whose brothers were naval officers during the Napoleonic Wars, after all). to sea.   In his heroes, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and O'Brian's magnificent prose, a growing and devoted crew of readers have found themselves at sea - and content.  Given the demands of this fanatical following and the extraordinary and well known difficulties of filming any production at sea, Director Peter Weir set himself no small task in bringing O'Brian's world to the silver screen. <br /> <br />Remarkably, Weir succeeds in no small measure.  One can tell after only a few moments scanning the extra documentaries that come with the Collector's Edition that MASTER AND COMMANDER was a work of love for Weir, his cast and his production team, and the results are plain to see on the screen: the excruciating attention to detail, the small human touches, and the willingness above all to faithfully translate what is not only a world of manners, but a world of honor and faith that may seem quaint or even jarring now to modern audiences. In Master and Commander, one is brought closer than any movie has ever managed to a true feeling of what life on board a Napoleonic era man of war must have been like.  Everything from the 1790 Encyclopedia britannica Dr. Maturin consults to the mizzen sail rigging is the real thing.  Even the soundtrack sticks to period music (mainly, Bach and Bocherini) - and not just mere period music, but music that would have been known and loved bynaval officers long at sea.   <br /> <br />Expectations are key: MASTER AND COMMANDER is a tale cobbled together from various book of the O'Brian series, with the meat of the plot of the 11th Volume, \\"The Far Side of the World,\\" taken for the heart of the story and yet transformed: The year is 1805 and Captain Aubrey is given orders by the British Admiralty to take his command, HMS Surprise, to hunt down and \\"sink, burn or take as prize\\" the French privateer Acheron (almost twice Surprise's size) before she wreaks havoc on trade in the Pacific Ocean. The movie opens, however, with the prey ambushing the predator, with Surprise crippled by a sudden (and on the screen, spectacular) and devastating surprise attack in the fog, and Aubrey's uphill struggle to repair his vessel and catch up with his quarry amidst a dispiriting run of bad luck.  O'Brian devotees may be thrown off at first by the fact that no one novel is really adapted here and the one claimed is heavily altered (in the book, the antagonist is American, which presumably would have had less appeal at the U.S. box office), and yet if they stay with the story they will be struck by how sucessful Weir is in capturing the characters of Aubrey and Maturin and their relationship, especially the tensions that arise over ship discipline between the autocratic Aubrey and the Enlightenment philosophe Maturin: \\"You have come to the wrong shop for anarchy, brother,\\" retorts Aubrey in an aside straight from the book.  If O'Brian fans go in expecting to see their beloved characters faithfully captured rather than a specific book, and the same devotion to the capturing the life of the period that O'Brian cultivated, they may find themselves more than content. <br /> <br />For more casual viewers, correct expectations are even more in order.  The trailers and the cover may lead them to expect a ferocious sea battle from beginning to end.  MASTER AND COMMANDER, however, instead captures the true nature of nautical life inthe Age of Sail: Long periods of edgy boredom punctuated by horrific violence.  There are two full scale sea battles in MASTER AND COMMANDER but they are seperated by long stretches of the human dimension of nautical life and the unending struggle for survival with the sea, and it is here that Weir, like O'Brian, succeeds most.  Paul Bettany and Russell Crowe work even better together than they did in their turn in A BEAUTIFUL MIND.  For this O'Brian reader, Bettany simply *is* Dr. Maturin.  But even the casual viewer will be able appreciate the power and believability of his performance.  And if the expectation is kept on that performance, and the human drama that develops between 197 men and boys imprisoned in wooden walls deep at sea, the viewer will find himself deeply rewarded, even if the complete lack of women or any romance ensures that this is in some ways a boy's movie and, in the end, perhaps not for everyone.   <br /> <br />A final note on the DVD: The Collector's Edition proves to be an enormous improvement on the bare-bones standard DVD, in both its packaging and the additional features.  \\"The Hundred Days\\" is a fascinating look at the love anbd care that went into filming MASTER AND COMANDER.  O'Brian fans will enjoy the \\"In the Wake of O'Brian\\" documentary - and those who have not read the books may feel the itch to pick one up.  The production featurettes are largely standard fare but of interest to those who find this sort of thing interesting.  The deleted scenes are also a nice addition, especially the scene depicting a reading of the articles of war before flogging - a gripping reminder of the less romantic side of life at sea.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|I lost respect for the girls I went to see this film with when they laughed or simply cried out loud calling this film boring.But Im simply quiet when Im disgusted.I was disgusted but knew its not for everyone.<br /><br />I think Cold Mountain is something that will always mean a lot to me. I cant forget those absolutely brilliant shot nerve ticklers of emotional chasers of scenes. The scene when there's a song that plays. The song thats a travellors song \\"I'm going home to see my mother\\" and then I thought this movie has the best ever music for it. I think the Soundtrack to Cold Mountain is totally magnificent but thats another story. I think Jude Law acted well. I dont like Renee Zewellger but she was funny and the accent really suited her.<br /><br />Overall,its more of a story than a film. I just was really moved by the detail that went into the whole project. I suggest this movie to only those people who dont expect to see inside out of a film within a few scenes but like understanding the concept and its works.<br /><br />Much Questions,<br /><br />Kanwar
B000002513|5.0|I bought this albumn and championed it amongst my friends when it was released. We became big fans well before the Time cover. And how could you not be - it's a masterpiece of expression, lyrically and musically. I know that Rosalita is the party favorite but it's actually out of place in this collection. Why no one has even made a film based upon \\"Incident on 57th St\\" and/or \\"New York City Serenade\\" is beyond me. Martin Scorcese, are you listening? I grew up in NJ and spent a lot of time in New York: Bruce's early music just nails the way we lived and thought. I know someone (sometimes me) who just fit the mood of each song. Sad to say, but that NY is long gone (NJ too)
B00028HBKM|5.0|I'm 20 years old and have lived a life where I openly believe in Anarchy without knowing much about what GOD stands for. This and that and that is that but this is that kinda life.I constantly would try to punch in my logic each time someone would suggest something to the effect that points out their belief in GOD.<br /><br />After watching this movie on a Thursday night I felt a way I have never felt before. I was simpy taken aback to an extent I never thought I could be. I was shivering when it was all done. I closed my eyes and cried. I cried cause I felt cheated and felt wasted. I think it simply is the most significant film I have seen in my life. But then you'd ask Why? In my opinion, I think this movie portrays the history of the world. It symbolises what faith stands for. Its the greatest story ever told.<br /><br />(I think the subtitle barrier which a lot of people very conveniently claim is there reason for not watching the film should be avoided)<br /><br />Now I watch a lot of commercial movies but I think this movie was influencial in a way I cant comprehend owing to my limited comprehension abilities.I still don't believe in God. I just don't talk about it.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Well, there goes Green Day. There is ONE good song on this CD, and it's Boulevard of Broken Dreams. The rest of the CD? Not even commenting. It's driven by a hatred of conservative values as well as a hatred of our great President, George W. Bush. This ends up being the cd, as well as Green Day's undoing. Yes, I've heard this whole CD, and it's horrible. Will I buy it? No. I'll just download Boulevard of Broken Dreams, thank you very much.
B00009TB5G|5.0|For 50 years no one has been able to bring Tolkien's legendary trilogy to life because of his rich writing style and detail. Now, I don't think anyone could have done a better job than Peter Jackson. The deliverance of the story, while noticeably different, is highly accurate at reflecting Tolkien's masterpiece. The actors delivered a commendable performance. What is most breath taking, however, is the special effects. The sets, the environments, the costumes, and the visuals are so finely detailed that the movie is teeming with life. Tolkien would have truly been proud.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|Filmmaker Michel Gondry must be a firm believer in the old saying, \\"if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.\\" His feature film debut was the Charlie Kaufman-penned Human Nature that, by most accounts, was simply awful. Maybe Gondry just didn't connect with the material or figure out a way to bring it successfully to life. His second feature and second crack at a Kaufman screenplay, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, was met, initially, with trepidation. By most accounts, he's directed one of the most original films in years.<br /><br />The Collector's Edition comes with an attractive booklet filled with glossy photos and excerpts from enthusiastic reviews praising the movie.<br /><br />The first disc starts with \\"A Look Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\\" a promo with soundbite interviews and clips from the movie. The cast and crew talk about the characters and the unique nature of the script.<br /><br />\\"A Conversation with Jim Carrey and Director Michel Gondry\\" is an entertaining dialogue between the two men mixed with rehearsal footage. They talk about the hardest day of the shoot when they got into a heated argument that they can laugh about now.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Gondry and Kaufman. They had pitched the idea for the movie as early as 1998 and not surprisingly had a tough time finding a studio willing to take a chance.<br /><br />There are seven minutes of deleted scenes. Unfortunately, there is no context for the footage of a commentary track to explain why they were cut out. It almost simulates the mind erosion that Joel experiences in the movie. What do these scenes mean?<br /><br />There is a music video for \\"Light and Day\\" by Polyphonic Spree that tweaks footage from the movie in an unsettling way.<br /><br />There is also a funny commercial for Lacuna, Inc., the fictitious company that erases people's memories.<br /><br />The second disc begins with \\"Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry\\", a 20-minute look at the director's creative process. It is amazing how much of the film's more fantastical images were done without CGI, just good ol' fashioned editing, lighting or forced perspective shots.<br /><br />\\"Anatomy of a Scene: Saratoga Avenue\\" examines how a specific scene was put together, mostly through CGI with the sound effects and score explored in detail.<br /><br />\\"A Conversation with Kate Winslet and Director Michel Gondry\\" is a dialogue between the actress and the filmmaker. She was surprised that Gondry cast her as she was known mostly for reserved period dramas.<br /><br />Finally, there are almost 19-minutes of additional deleted or extended footage. Mostly, it is bits and pieces that were trimmed from existing scenes.

1592400876|5.0|It should not have been in the stars that a book on a subject as dry as punctuation would make it to the bestseller lists on both sides of the Atlantic, but it has and the reason isn't just good luck. Author Lynne Truss, a self professed punctuation stickler, writes with knowledge, passion, not to mention an entertaining jazzy wit, with the result that EATS, SHOOTS AND LEAVES is great fun and not a little instructive. <br /> <br />It is odd that in an era where the conventions of language are treated so casually in even the highest places, people still bleed when their grammatical usage is assailed.  In other words, nobody likes a stickler.  What sets Lynne Truss apart from the stickler chorus is the fact that she does not make it personal. She never assumes that the reader needs to be improved. She does use real world examples, like the title of the Sandra Bullock-Hugh Grant movie \\"Two Weeks Notice,\\" in which the possessive apostrophe eluded everyone from the screenwriter upward through the ranks of the studio brass, but she never wastes time flaying the irresponsible.  Instead, she spends her time on correcting the errors, clarifying the rules (with notes on American usage where it diverges) and slipping in some historical notes.  No one reading the book will feel as if they have been taken to the woodpile, only entertained and better informed.  I was actually sorry to see it end. <br />
0066620996|5.0|Collins and his research team analyze the transformation of good companies to great companies - those beating the market by a multiple of three for a fifteen year period - comparing them to selected companies in the same industry with access to comparable opportunities and resources.   <br /> <br />The research yields remarkable results... counter-intuitive, ground-breaking and strangely comforting.  FannieMae beats Coca Cola; Walgreens beats Intel; ten out of eleven CEOS overseeing the \\"good to great\\" transition come from inside the company; there is no systematic link between executive compensation and making the leap; no expensive, high-profile rebranding and launches are needed.   <br /> <br />Instead, great companies take off under humble but exacting CEOs who nurture leadership in those around them and recruit only competent and self-motivated staff. The companies are also brutally honest about their weaknesses and accurately assess the appropriate direction and focus for their efforts. They adhere strictly to their chosen course and only use technology as a means to that pre-determined goal.   <br /> <br />The book compresses mountains of data and conveys its conclusions crisply and clearly, using tables and diagrams and colourful examples and analogies. This handy desktop bible for managers also contains invaluable analogies to personal and national development. First, discover what you can be the very best at in the world. Second, get the right people around you and shed the rest. Finally, apply disciplined thought and action to achieve the dream - quietly and resolutely - every single day.   <br />

B0002VKZL6|5.0|This is probably Mark's best solo album. His voice is in top shape, after all these years, at an age when many singer's voices start to decline. The songs are just great and work really well together - this didn't happen with Ragpicker's Dream, in my opinion. Shangri-La has less solo guitar than his other works, but Knopfler's efforts are clearly concentrated on song craft and that's not necessarily bad. It's a nice change of pace and he's a great composer, anyway.  <br />There's wit, poetry and a great song for Sonny Liston, again inspired by a book, (Sailing to Philadelphia, was inspired by Thomas Pynchon's novel Mason & Dixon.  <br />Being a longtime Straits/M.K. fan, I have to say that his career is truly a progression and this is, no doubt about it, a beautiful chapter.
6304698690|5.0|My daughter is almost 21 and no longer lives at home, so my review is purely from an adult's point of view. If you're an adult looking for a change of pace in your movie viewing, this is an excellent place to start.<br /><br />The characters in this movie are almost all pegged to some sort of extreme mood or behavior: the angry Miss from India who has just lost the parents who didn't love her to begin with; the \\"Type A\\" housekeeper striding the halls of the Gothic mansion, keys jangling from her belt like a jail warden; the mysterious hermit uncle whose life ended the day his wife died; the know-it-all hypochondriac boy who has never been out of his bedroom; the almost psychopathically cheerful chambermaid who has agreed to dress the demanding \\"I Never Dress Myself!\\" little girl.<br /><br />The mansion is gloomy, spooky, far too big for its oft-absent owner, and stuck by itself in the middle of the lonely, wind-and-rain-swept English moors. You wonder how on Earth the abandoned little girl is ever going to find a secret garden in this forsaken, dysfunctional environment. But she does. A robin as full of personality and smarts as any of the people in this film shows her the way.<br /><br />The casting of this movie was superb. That they found a little girl who could so convincingly render the angry, puffy, emotionally abused facial expressions of the early scenes and later transform herself into the cherub of the secret garden is a marvel. The sickly boy's temper tantrums are top-notch and the hermit uncle's weirdly handsome decline into self-ruin is perfect. Maggie Smith as the housekeeper is the ultimate in self-righteous control freaks . . . and only the business-like Maggie Smith could properly pull off her epiphany at the end without appearing saccharine or hypocritical.
B00005JMXX|3.0|What can one expect from the liberal, scientifically illiterate Hollywood community?  Well, as usual, Hollywood sees it fit to lecture us on our global economic and political system.  Having failed to get their policies enacted politically, Hollywood feels content to say, well, you guys are wrong, and this is what will happen to you.  The Kyoto Protocol--the topic to which this movie touches--is a treaty that President Clinton approved, but knew would never pass, where it received a vote of 99-0.  That means not even a liberal senator such as Kerry or Boxer voted in favor of a jobs-killing bill.<br /><br />Hollywood is always far more liberal than even the most liberal senator.  This movie is not based on real life at all.  One should sit down and take this as a sci-fi movie - not based on reality, but simply entertainment.<br /><br />The premise of the film is that the environment is in the hands of one man -- the vice president, who looks similar to Vice President Dick Cheney.  The VP does not believe that we should sacrifice our economy for the environment.  As a result, the movie pedantically notes, the world suffers an economic collapse.  Things get so bad that Americans move to Mexico, and Mexico closes the border on us.  Well!  At least we now know what Mexico would do in an emergency.  Why don't we seal the border the way Mexico did in the movie?<br /><br />In any case, few reputable scientists would say that we face a crisis.  This movie would say otherwise, but it would be wrong.  But note the special effects -- it's highly amusing.  Excellent CGI.
B00005JNEI|1.0|To the stupid or Liberal Lemmings, this fat guy who does not outwardly threaten anyone seems to be a rather noxious form of P.T. Barnum, pied-piping his way to wealth far beyond his due. If ever the rich are to be hated, this is the blimp you want to attack. All of his so-called \\"documenteries\\" are rancid peepshows leaving one feeling they need to run home and take a long shower. His most recent, F. 9/11, as one reviewer said, this is his homage to Joseph Goebles.... and the film lady, Leni Reifenstadt(sp). Moore basically states in his film that the Bushes are in league with the arab oil merchants, I suppose to eventually own and rule the world. The implied conspiracies ramble on like some asteroid hurling towards earth to a quick and sudden demise of all humanity. If Moore had worked on Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\", there would have been twenty gunmen on the grassy knoll, and car bombs exploding nearby to kill all the witnesses, with a teenage George Bush calling Jack Ruby to do \\"his thing\\". It's unfortunate that society, even the conspiracy nuts, have to be exposed to a humorless, sour,untruthful, unpleasant movie like Fahrenheit 9/11. The closest \\"filmmaker\\" to Moore would be ED WOODS, but even woods tried to make sense of his pathetic attempts. We can only hope that Moore goes the way of the unfortunate \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle,leaving the industry that he has  harmed, as a poor, broken in spirit, and quickly forgotten man who thought far beyond his ability.
B000002U82|5.0|I admit I have never heard a Pink Floyd album before, but this album is great.  I like all kinds of music and anyone who give this album a bad review truly doesnt appreciate or history.  First of all, i am younger (21 years old) and my personal choice of music is undergroud hip-hop, but this album is amazing.  The mood it creates is amazing.  I will keep the review short and simple, but if you appreciate music at a great (and experimental) level, this is the album is for you.  I have one comment of which I would love to hear comments on....I believe that Radiohead is the Pink Floyd of the 90's and the new millenium.  The sounds are different but the portraits that are painted are similiar to the times.  Please feel free to commont on my opinion.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I am a Lois and Clark fan. I am also a Smallville fan. While one would think that these things would go hand in hand,there seems to be a division among some people. There are those hard core Lois and Clark fans who feel for some reason that Smallville isn't doing the legend justice.     Both series deal with Clark Kent at different stages of his life and while they couldn't be any less similar in their presentation yet, when you piece them together in sequence (and that will take several years with Smallville), you can see the logical progession from Clark Kent as a teenager growing up to the man he'll become in Metropolis.    You can see Tom Welling morphing into Dean Cain on some level (though seeing John Schneider and Annette O'Toole as Eddie Jones and K. Callan may be a bit of a stretch), but it brings us a fresh and different looks at Clark Kent's roots...before the flights and the tights. It throws the whole Superboy thing out, which is appreciated (and staying consistent with the Lois And Clark series, where his mother makes his costume).    Clark Kent tries, in some way, to be as normal as possible under the circumstances (you know, super strength, super speed, the whole xray vision thing), but it's not easy, especially when he has to hide his \\"secret\\" from the world and deal with the trials and tribulations of being a teenager at the same time.    Season one introduces us to a much different take on his relationship with Lex Luthor (they are friends...destined to become enemies), his friend Pete Ross (who never was black in the comics) and offers insight into his feelings for Lana Lang who was, prior to Lois Lane, the big love of his life.    The color on the series is breathtaking and the stories excellent. To see the development of Clark Kent as a heroic figure just as confused by his emerging powers as anyone and the development of Lex Luthor into the maniacal villan he will one day be, we are seeing a true grassroots version of this story.    One scenein particular sums this up for me. At the end of \\"Crush\\" when everyone is at the funeral of Whitney's dad, the glances between Lana and Clark and Chloe to both set against the backdrop of the rain and the cemetery takes my breath away each time I see it. A scene where no words are spoken out loud, yet thousands resonate in the wind.    A brilliant first season which only taps the surface of what is to come down the road.    Lois and Clark fans rejoice...the legend is alive.
0380789035|3.0|The three star rating that I have given to American Gods is reflective of the ambivalence I feel toward it. I enjoyed reading it, and found it a real page-turner. The concept was fascinating and the mythological elements were interesting and clever in their American guises. So what's the problem? It is akin to the old chestnut about eating Chinese food - after devouring 600 plus pages of Mr. Gaiman's novel I found that I was still hungry, still unsatisfied despite the tastiness of Gaiman's talent.<br />The problem is that I was expecting an epic. The book's subject matter, length, awards, and reviews all scream epic. I was expecting something deep, meaningful, and memorable. Gaiman's writing talent teased me nearly all the way through that this was indeed what I was reading, yet it never quite delivered. Instead of a memorable epic, what I finally discovered in American Gods was a well-written and enjoyable pulp novel that felt much closer to a particularly well done Stephen King story than it did to an important mythological epic.<br />I did enjoy reading American Gods. Neil Gaiman is a talented writer, and if you are a fan, you will probably want to read it as well. But be warned to limit your expectations. Despite its length and hype, this book is not an epic, mythic or otherwise. File this one on your bookshelf beside King's The Stand rather than putting it beside Tolkien, Joseph Campbell, or Jung.<br /><br />Theo Logos
B0002X314C|5.0|First off all the people making reviews and giving it one star...ya'll don't know what music is. Not good music at least. This is off the hook! John is like a male version of Alicia! His voice is wonderful, musically he's on point, lyrically he's on point...enough said! The production is bangin' it ain't that booty-shakin' stuff that's so unoriginal. John went back to the roots of R&B where it's about the lyrics, sound, etc. This is high quality...I pray this boy sells CDs like crazy he deserves it. Go John! You already a legend in my book w/ A. Keys...
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Franz Ferdinand is one of those bands that can take a bit of getting used to.  I bought it because I thought \\"Take Me Out\\" was just a catchy tune and hoped the rest of the CD would be much the same.  Well, after listening to it a few times I did warm up to the rest of the songs. <br /> <br />Franz Ferdinand are a bit difficult for me to categorize.  But, they are best described as edgy, retro, and plain fun with their heavy guitars and light lyrics.  Their sound is a little bit different and I think that works to their benefit. <br /> <br />I suggest this CD to anyone who just wants to rock out and enjoy some slightly quirky songs.  I somehow don't think this one will disappoint. <br /> <br />My picks for the catchiest songs: Take Me Out, Michael, Come On Home, 40'
0394720288|4.0|Wilfred Sheed in the forward to \\"Leave it to Psmith\\" classified Wodehouse, along with Gilbert and Sullivan, as anti artist artists. Anti artist artists were born something out of a reaction to English public opinion against Byron and Shelley and their questionable views and lifestyles. Their motive is to knock high ideals off their perspective horses. While Europe was taking art seriously, maybe too seriously, with rebellious Wagnerian operas and psychological probings of Flauberts and Prousts and such the English were being amused by Gilbert and Sullivan and other entertainment of high silliness. There is a method to the madness of Wodehouse and that is to knock down  any art that takes itself too seriously.<br /><br />Wodehouse can draw one sophmoric prank out into a mini novel which at time can be tedious and at times masterful. In the end not much is really said here or is it?
B00005V3Z4|1.0|If you're even thinking about buying this movie, have the clerk take you out back and give you a savage beating after taking your money.

B00008ADPF|1.0|this isnt a good album. their last one was mediocre but this one is worse, there are 2 songs here that stand out, which are the singles, the rest form a blur of alt heavy rock. if you like this, then this album will float your boat, if youre a real music fan you will probly hate it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This Green day CD breaks boundaries set up by punk haters that say it is just power chords and screaming, Billie Joe amazing lyrcis w/ background from possibly one of the best punk bands ever. It is a punk rock opera what else do I have to say, with great songs such as American Idiot, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, She's a Rebel, Whatsername and many others. But the consistent greatness of each song continues to amaze me and though I got the album a long time ago each song never gets old.
B000667GFK|5.0|Great album from one of the all time greatest Mexican singers.  By the way, Luis Miguel is Mexican, not Puerto Rican.
1592400876|4.0|Truss's book is sometimes clever and sometimes tries too hard to be clever.  The author does give generally sensible advice about punctuation, although I'm not planning to increase my use of colons and semicolons on her account.<br /><br />Three disparate comments: 1. The book is too long--consider how much bang Strunk & White got for their buck in 71 pages.  2. The numerous differences between British and Americans terms for, and use of, punctuation probably occurred after the American Revolution but before the modern period; a bit more curiosity on the part of the author would have been helpful here. 3. Perhaps both the popularity of this book and criticism of it reflect a desperate search for certainty somewhere, anywhere, in an intellectual world bent on destroying remaining certainties about things that really matter.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Pitchforkmedia gave it the #1 slot in their 2004 countdown.  While I do not, it is certainly up there.<br /><br />The album is hard to describe without making it sound stupid.  They manage to walk that fine line of being emotionally sincere, without sounding (too) pretentious or overwrought.  A healthy dose of alienation and loneliness is present.  An indie rock album that doesn't rock very hard (with maybe the exception of \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\"), but it works its way into your brain.  If you are unmoved by the opening track, \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\", I'd suggest looking elsewhere.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I'm pretty tired of hearing really simple statements like..\\"Linkin Park sux\\" and \\"This album is the crappiest crappy crap ever.\\"   <br /> <br />I think this album has some great songs on it.  Songs like \\"Numb\\", \\"Somewhere I belong\\", and \\"Breaking the Habit\\" are extremely catchy to any alternative rock fan and worth listening to.  Although their lyrics do seem to appeal to younger crowds, mainly younger angsty teens, it shouldn't stop a consumer from liking their sound. With a lot of albums, there is always the risk of not liking more than one or two singles released from it.  I found with this album, I liked more than three of the songs, which for me, made the album worth purchasing.  Even people who deny liking Linkin Park, find themselves singing along to some of these songs from Meteora.    <br />
B000089CJI|4.0|but this album is easy listening electronica.  That sounds horrible doesn't it?  Yet, it works.  The songs are soothing and very melodic.  Ben Gibbard's vocals speak to all the alienated geeks like myself.  Though maybe I should find a better term for myself since I just turned 30.  I make it sound like I am a teenager.  Whatever.  You will hear rip offs of this album for the next five years, I guarantee it.<br /><br />Even my dad likes it!
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Johnny Depp's performance in this film is nothing short of perfect-not overdone, not underdone-I truely believe that this role for Johnny is oscar caliber and the film also should get some recognition. <br /> The story is beautifuly done with great performances by everyone involved. Do yourself a favor and treat your and your loved ones to this amazing true story of one man's vision to create one of the most well known fairy tale's of all time. <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|After seeing this movie I felt sick of the lies and misleading information slanted towards an extremist personal view and twisted debauchery. I am literally ashamed that someone like Michael Moore exists. One thing I have learned we should call him the PREACHER of HATE!  The average people watching his movie I realize now are all followers and NOT Leaders and that is even a bigger shame, who needs the media and Hollywood dictating our lives...I examined several of the scenes and compared them to the true incidence and saw how he cut and twisted the facts. I along with several of my friends here in San Francisco are shocked to see how gullible our society has become and would actually give this move a negative 10!
B0002858YS|3.0|Finally I gave in and listened to the Killers after all the hype I'm hearing. When I first heard \\"Somebody Told Me\\" I really didn't like it and it sounded way to poppy for my taste. However I gave in and listened to my friends CD. I was blown away by the first 2 songs. Jenny Was a Friend of Mine is awesome. Crank it up in your car and this dark track sounds epic and reminiscent of the Cure and (ugh...Duran Duran). I love his aggressive singing style in the verses. Even though I don't like Duran Duran I love this song. Next song Mr. Brightside is probably the best on the CD, very meloncholic, bittersweet & inspiring at the same time. After song 5 \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" ends the album starts to blend together a little, nothing stands out like the first half. The last song is pretty cool though. All in all it's an excellent first album and I'm interested in how they'll evolve in upcoming albums, if they last to make more. If this is the future of pop radio, I'll take it over J. Lo Linsay Lohan Simpson Timberlake Beyonce Jr. & the rest of the stomach churning mindless drivel produced on the radio anyday.
B0002858YS|4.0|Eleven songs and approximately forty-six minutes later, I was left scratching my head. Where did these guys come from? Okay, so I read they're from Las Vegas, NV. I am always looking for new music - yet how did I miss the debut \\"Hot Fuss\\" from The Killers? Thank you ZIA's CD & Record Exchange in Phoenix (AZ) for playing \\"Hot Fuss\\" while I was shopping there one day. Frontman singer and keyboard player Brandon Flowers (and bandmates Dave Keuning-guitar, Ronnie Vannucci-drums, and Mark Stoemer-bass) have written some incredibly catchy music in 2004. I truly feel that if these guys can stay together and keep manufacturing great songs - they'll enjoy an incredible ride in the music industry. There are several relatively new alt/rock bands in 2004 with potential... namely Snow Patrol, Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, Keane, Modest Mouse, etc... but I give the Rookie-Of-The-Year award to THE KILLERS. You'll listen to \\"Hot Fuss\\" and think... I know this sound. These guys sound like 'somebody'. Something new, but definitely in the 1980's vein. Perhaps a little bit of the Psychadelic Furs, some of The Knack... who knows. intelligent songs, some synth/electro intro's that fade into catchy guitars and smart hooks. The vocals, as well as Vannucci's drumming and complex hi-hat work are top notch. Two songs even feature a full blown choir. I lean toward the heavier songs - my favorites being \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\", \\"Somebody Told Me\\", \\"All These Things That I've Done\\". Least favorite song is \\"Andy, You're A Star\\". Listen to the sound clips here on Amazon and you'll hear the rock roots (more rock & pop than anything else, such as alternative, indie, ska, etc). I thoroughly enjoy finding new music that I never knew even existed. Try \\"Hot Fuss\\". The new (and old!) rock fans will dig it.
0385510438|5.0|I listened to the abridged audio CD version of this book.  I have read just about everything that Grisham has written and I think this is the best one to come along since A Time to Kill.  Willie Traynor is a very likable character and his interaction with a town full of other interesting characters makes this a page turner.  This is probably the best novel I have seen in a couple of years.
1400032717|2.0|Okay, am I the only person who disliked this book?  Yes, I understand the \\"perspective\\" but I found it boring and tedious as heck.  Quite frankly, I didn't want nor need to know how Christopher solved all the Maths.  It was a major disappointment - thank heaven, it was short!

B00009V7T2|5.0|Well I discovered The Mars Volta about a year ago from a friend. When he showed the song Inertiatic ESP to me, I new that this band was special. Sure Cedric's vokles sound quite emo sometimes but it actually fits well with the exolent music. I am by no means an emo fan but this album isn't really emo as some people clame, it's more like spaced out music with driving guitars and some latton influences. Omar really has a signiture guitar style that really can not be duplicated. This album is full of complex instramentation with driveing guitars layered amung floydian soundscapes. It is a concept album about a friend of the band who OD'ed on morfine and ended up in acoma. The album presents the strange adventures he had in that dream like state. Sadly after this long time friend of Cedric and Omar's came out of acoma he successefully took his own life thanks to a former member of At The Drive-in (the band Cedric and Omar were formerly a part of) pushing him over the edg. This album may sound sad but the members of the band insist that it celibrates his life as an artest. One thing that really makes me angry though is when the people who give this album a bad rap try and play the Rush card. They clame that The Mars Volta \\"reak\\" of the sound of rush. I couldn't dissagree more. I am not a big rush fan at all and I love the Mars Volta. I love it because their lyrics are so noncencical and how they have fuzed all these musical styles together to creat their own nitch in the echo system of music. They are original and that is what I love about them. People can't listen to them with out thinking to themselves \\"What the...\\" Alsow I recommend buying their EP Tremulent. It's even crazyer then De-loused. The great thing about this band is that they have incuraged me to find more obscure music to listen to and since the day I bought the album I've been finding new bands that I absolutly love. I don't even know why people bother with Takeing Back Sunday and The Used, and all that normal music and all that goth metal crap. I don't even know why people think Nervonna were so good, or any grunge band for that matter. If you like The Mars Volta then you will probably like a lot of classic rock (because classic rock is for the most part exolent) and more motern obscure bands like Brainiac, Subarachnoid Space, Godspead You Black Emporer, De facto (the band Cedric and Omar formed right after the ATDI split), Omars solo album, Comits On Fire, and there is so much more. Remember, HELP SAVE MUSIC!
0345440900|3.0|I had heard so much about this book and everyone was either in two camps:  1. It is the book from the devil or 2. This is the best book out there and throw away all other parenting books.   <br /> <br />I don't agree with either of those. <br /> <br />I think for a new parent who is unsure of themselves this book can be helpful.  It does offer some great advice however I do agree it also offers some bad advice along with it. <br /> <br />I read this book and did listen to a lot of what it said in regards to helping keep my child from being overstimulated. It was extremely helpful on being able to read some of the cues that my son was giving me that I was mis-reading before. <br /> <br />However I was also a breastfeeder and this was really some of the worst advice I had every read.  If you are planning to breastfeed, then do not read that section at all.  It will just frustrate you and make you doubt yourself.  Same with co-sleeping. We co-slept until our son was 9 months old and we loved it.  We had no problems, and our son transferred to his crib very easily.  It was a wonderful bonding experience for us all.   <br /> <br />As with any other parenting book out there, read the book with a critical eye.  Only you know what is right for you and your family.   <br /> <br />I say borrow the book from the library, gleam the good information out of it, and completely ignore the information on breastfeeding.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This dvd was given to me as a gift that I did ask for.  I was looking forward to experiencing this movie after hearing all of the hype surrounding it.  After my experience, the only advice I can offer is save your 2 hours, save your $20.  This movie is pointless and a waste of any resources you devote to it.
B0000009RX|5.0|In order to parody something you need to be to able to grasp the entire concept and then to be witty enough to realize its futility then, produce the same concept except with a twist or quirk poking fun at the entire concept. This album is a perfect example of Zappa's mastery of the art of writing, engineering/mixing, and playing. Not only does he fully grasp these concepts but he continues to innovate the industry and propell music further into new directions with new sonic possibilities. The only drawback to this album is that at the time of it's creation, psycadelic pop was what was on the charts. Ahhh, how silly fads seem 40 years later, too bad we couldn't see it then.

B00005K3NY|4.0|Scanners revolves around a bunch of humans who have acquired extraordinary telekinetic powers that can cause havoc beyond any nightmare. An evil scanner played particularly well by Michael Ironside wages a war against some normal scanners. Patrick McGoohan as leader of the Consec Scanner Insititute unveils an untouched scanner played by Stephen Lack to combat Ironside. The film made in the late 70's boasts of some very good special effects & an excellent often under rated score by Howard Shore. This film is serious stuff & director David Cronenberg scores largely due to the tight script & straight-to-the point tell-tale. People who have seen this have either loved or hated this film. You take your pick.

B000066NW0|1.0|What angers about me about my generation, is its acceptence of corporate trash, which is so fluent in the pop culture community. I truly mean pop culture, even though Avril Lavgine is a self-proclaimed punk.         What a punk is in the music industry, is someone who would never sell out, someone whose music would remain underground.     These songs are shallow, catchy, and Avril's voice is frighteningly similiar to Hillary Duff, with its girlish high pitched sound.    Her glorified single, \\"Complicated\\" is nothing new, it simply deals with \\"being yourself\\" and not trying to be anyone else. True punk music and ideology are not about the self; they have substance and are radically political, dealing with the collective rather than the individual, as in communism or anarchism.     The rest of her songs, like \\"Losing grip\\" and \\"Sk8ter Boi\\" are equally self absorbed. Not one of her songs show any of that radical spirit of the sixties and seventies when real punk was alive.     This new generation of musicians, are all MTV clones of one another: Avril Lavigne, Brittany Spears, Christina Agularia, Simple Plan, and every rap arstist whose songs are more about their material possessions than their music.     I for one, refuse to be brainwashed into thinking this corporate manipulated music is great art, when music could be less about the artist's paycheck, and more about the music.
B000646MNE|5.0|I finally have all of the SATC dvds!!  This is one of the best series to ever appear on tv.  I do agree with the previous writer who stated that WAY too much attention is given to Sara Jessica.  If I had to pick a favorite, it would be Kims performance as Samantha.  That character, more than any other, gave us the \\"Oh my God\\" moments that made us love SATC so much.  It was her fearlesness as an actress that made this show what it is today.  Also, for the price they are demanding, there should be way more special features.  I was excited to put in the bonus features dvd for season 6 part 2, and to see a notation that there were deleted scenes from each season.  Unfortunately, there were only 1 or 2 scenes from each season, not much to get excited about.  Also, I don't think there were any audio commentaries until season 5, and then for a couple of episodes on each season.  With so many producers offering so many extras with dvds, this series extras are a little bit of a let down.  But even without the extras, it is worth it just to have the series that was ended way before it's time.  Anyone for the \\"Samantha Jones show\\"?

B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta is easily the greatest band of 2004, and \\"De-loused In The Comatorium\\" maybe the best album I've heard in years. As everyone knows by now \\"The Mars Volta\\" was formed my ex- ATDI (That's \\"At The Drive-In\\" for you new comers) guitarist and vocalist Omar Rodriguez and Cedric Bixler. With \\"The Mars Volta\\" Omar and Cedric have taken the energy of \\"ATDI\\" and expanded on it by adding elements of Jazz, punk, salsa and phychedelic rock. I find the driving force of the album to be Omar's guitar playing. He was a great guitarist for ATDI but here he seems to have taken his playing to new levels of excellence. If you're a fan of inovative, artistic and beautiful music then your long search ends here with this album. If you're a ATDI fan then I'm sure you alreadly own this. If not, pick it up. It just may be the most important album of the decade.

Oh yeah and what an amazing group of characters without a doubt the most chemistery to ever happen in movie history.  And such a deep plot, watching it once just isn't enough.

B0006399FS|2.0|There are, it seems, two kinds of U2 fans.  <br /> <br />On the one hand, there are those who prefer the band's earthy, earnest emotional arena-rock. On the other hand, there are those who favour their esoteric, ethereal experiments. Which is to say: No matter what kind of an album Bono and co. make, somebody always seems to end up bummed.  <br /> <br />To their credit, though, U2 are good enough to give each side a decade to call their own. The rockers got to lay claim to the '80s, when Bono lit The Unfogettable Fire and waved the white flag for Sunday Bloody Sunday.  <br /> <br />The avant guardians had their way for the '90s, when the boys played dressup and went from iconic to ironic with Achtung Baby and Pop. With the coming of 2000, the tide expectedly returned to the heartfelt simplicity and no-frills rock of All That You Can't Leave Behind.  <br /> <br />And if you think U2 are going to leave all that behind one album later, you haven't been paying attention.  <br /> <br />If their last album was the sound of a band rediscovering their roots and reconnecting with their past, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, their 11th studio release, is the sound of a band hitting their stride and heading into their comfort zone.  <br /> <br />For the 11 songs on this 49-minute disc, the band stuck to the game plan that worked so well four years ago: Never mind all the bells and whistles; just crank it up, belt out the chorus and get on with it. The Edge's chiming arpeggios and scritchy licks; the rhythm section's solidly unfussy grooves; Bono's soaring vocals and philosophical odes to love and hope and birth and death and war and peace -- it's all straight out of the U2 101 textbook. Just dust off the white flag, assemble the heart-shaped stage and Bono's ready for the stadium tour.  <br /> <br />But of course, that's also the biggest problem with How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. It's U2 by the numbers -- safe, familiar, predictable and, ultimately, somewhat uninspired anduninspiring. Naturally, there are a few standout tracks.  <br /> <br />But even these cuts don't have quite the same spark, the same punch, the same sense of wide-eyed exhilaration and rejuvenation as, say, Elevation, Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of, Beautiful Day and Walk On. The fact that a few of the titles are so similar-sounding doesn't help dispel that feeling of musical deja vu.  <br /> <br />Don't misunderstand. It's not that How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb isn't a good album. It is. At times, it's very good. But it's simply not a great U2 album. No matter what kind of a fan you are.  <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|I don't care if ya'll like or hate John Legend or not, but when I saw the video for \\"Used to Love U\\" produced by my favorite rapper Kanye West, I was amazed, I mean MORE shocked! This could be an inspiration to me when I pick it up ASAP. Nobody should live w/o this except for those that are missing out real good music. I 'specially recommend u check out Keyshia Cole who's on Kanye's label G.O.O.D. imprint. For those that are in2 so many many legends like the '70s or whatever y'know from Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Barry White, The Temptations, Angela Bofill, Will Downing, Lisa Stansfield, Bobby Caldwell, James Brown, Kool and the Gang, James Ingram, Michael McDonald, Brian McKnight, Boyz II Men, Donny Hathaway, Roberta Flack, Phyllis Hyman, Rachelle Ferrell, The Ohio Players, Earth, Wind & Fire, Usher, Monica, Brandy, and many other I suggest, should have this album, lemme say don't consider this a classic album or a hip-hop album but a more kinda R&B/Neo-Soul look alike album w/ more flavor, more spiritual, and more gospel-sound behind the notes and rhythm.
B00005JN2Z|1.0|I don't even know why I watched this movie. I didn't entertain me, it didn't move me, it didn't teach me anything. Wasted time.
B0002X314C|3.0|Some print sources (Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone) have proclaimed Mr. John Stephens the second coming, a purveyor of soul that can move beyond the ordinariness that much of modern R&B has yielded.  The man is indeed talented, but in my humble opinion, I believe that the laudable marks his album has received thus far are more a product of potential than of actual output.  For an artist capable of conjuring up some of the most urbane, emotive soul, a la Roberta Flack, in recent memory, the artist suffers from a temporary, albeit notable problem of inconsistency.      The strongest track, \\"Ordinary People,\\"  is an exqusite account of pragmatic love in which the artist eschews the cheezy endings in movies and trite love songs in favor of the real work to be done and the difficult questions to answer in relationships.  The realistic, almost plaintive lyrics here are accented by a movingly stripped-down piano accompaniment.  \\"Stay With You,\\" a track reminscent of the Gospel-tinged Soul of Curtis Mayfield with its sweeping organ, is an airy feel-good song about fidelity and commitment.  \\"Live it Up,\\" the album's final track ends the full-length debut on a good note, with a refreshing, restrained cameo from the sometimes annoyingly overpowering Miri Ben-Ari, the \\"hip hop violinist\\".     The CD, however, is marred by its unevenness as the artist tries, unsuccessfully, to satisfy traditional R&B audiences and Hip Hop audiences at the same time.  While \\"She Don't Have to Know\\" (an older track) is a fresh flippant tale of a continuing infidelity, \\"Number 1\\" suffers because of its exagerrated attempts to indulge the player mentality/aesthetic.  And many of the other songs, the title track included, feel like album filler, as the artist recyles stale parallels between marijuana/ spirituality with the love and affection of a woman.        All is not lost.  This cd is a quality addition to any R&B fan's catalogue, if only for the uniqueness of this newcomer's sound.  Next time around, maybe he'll make a firmer decision about which audience he hopes to entertain.  While human nature is contradictory in itself, John's biggest problem is that he tries too hard to present them both, sacrificing authenticity along the way.
0780625129|5.0|I won't write a long narrative on this film. However, I will say that if you are sensitive, DO NOT watch this movie. The language and violence are very graphic and shocking. It realistically depicts both the overt and covert racism that still plagues our nation. It really forces each of us to examine how we view those who are different from us. It also shows that hatred can be defeated individually as well. I must say that at the begining of the film, I hated both Dereck and Danny with a passion, but at the end of the film, I not only repected them, but felt sad that  Danny was gunned down after deciding to walk a different path.  Ed Norton, Avery Brooks and Stacey Keach do a remarkable job in this film.
044024157X|4.0|A John Grisham novel, where the courtroom drama is minimal - it ends in the first few pages itself. It is so different from \\"The Client\\" or the \\"Runaway Jury\\". The author has managed to sprinkle humor at several places - jus to quote - the Ivy league \\"Syracuse\\" and Will being rechristened as Willie.<br /><br />There are times when the story wanders off and it is difficult to understand what the author wants to convey thro those narrations.<br /><br />The story is a nail-biter. However, it is so not because you wanna know \\"What happens next ?\\" but want to know \\"what the author is taking you with this ?\\".<br /><br />I read this on my loooong flight from San Jose to Cincinnati. It was a worthy read !
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This movie is great.  There is so much going on that is funny that you are not going to catch in the one liners.   <br />this movie was advertised as some sort of slap shtick humor but I saw it much more as dark humor.  If you really think about it Napoleon has a really sad life but that's what we laugh at.  If you're looking for a movie that is going to force the jokes in your face and use fart humor to succeed then this is not the movie for you.  If you want a movie that says something about real life while giving you a chance to laugh at it rent Napoleon Dynamite! <br />
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Sadly I have to give this film a 1-star rating, but it truly deserves nothing. I detest this film and that's the only reason I'm taking the time to write a review; I feel that passionately about it. It's not clever and it's not funny. I regret wasting precious time watching a film that should never have been made at all. How it attracted anyone's attention is a comlete mystery, but having said that, Napoleon Dynamite suggests there is hope for any aspiring screenplay writers out there.
B00061QK02|5.0|There's no way that a cast which includes some of the funniest comedic actors of the new century could fail.  That's not just Will Ferrell, but Christina Appelgate, Fred Willard  and Steve Corell from Comedy Central's Daily Show.  Separately, they've each made their own success in past roles but here in Anchorman they're a comic force ad libbing their way through a script that sets an already impressive foundation.  I nearly cracked in half a few times. <br /> <br />The premise is, what was it like that historic day in the `70s when the first woman went in front of the camera, not as a cheesecake weather girl but as a serious reporter?  The all-male news team reacts with the predictable; attempts to sabotage her with innuendo and psychological warfare, seduction, immature jokes.  The sort of stuff that happens any time a woman \\"invades\\" a male-dominated field.  Only Veronica (the much-underrated Christina Applegate) handles it all with a bemused tolerance and class.  Nothing could bring her down, that is, until the impossible happened...she falls for Ron Burgundy.  Ron, the living stereotype of chauvinism and a Jr. High Schoolboy mentality, is lonely underneath all of his unqualified success as a tv news anchor.  Can love temper their differences and bridge the gap between the sexes? <br /> <br />I think that what makes Anchorman work is an underlying glee at lampooning the self-important, phony airs put on by talking head all over the country.  In every well-modulated tone, every pretentious turn of phrase and every carefully choreographed inflection we can see the Channel Four News Team's hilarious, accurate mimicry. The entire cast has it down perfectly.  We instinctively recognize that it's a delicious send-up of the so-called journalists we are familiar with as a television audience.   <br /> <br />Then again, if you don't watch the news on television you probably won't get half of the in-jokes.  That would explain *some* people's reactions, but... <br /> <br />A niggling thought occurs:  could it be that Anchorman's detractors were uncomfortably reminded of their own behavior at times?  Really and truly folks, the film's message about `70s sexism was delivered with lightheartedness, gently, and with no righteous fury whatsoever.  And yet, some people may take even the lightest poke as a full frontal assault.  A case of a guilty conscience making for a sensitive viewer, perhaps? <br /> <br />In any case, I plead with you not to allow a few negative comments from other reviewers to keep you from seeing what I think may be the funniest film of 2004.   <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle. <br />
B00007LTIA|5.0|I first heard this album in its entirety live, back when I was but a wee lad of 12. <br /> <br />It completely blew me away.  Yet it's taken me 30 years to truly appreciate this flawed monstrosity. <br /> <br />There's an apocraphal story that some critic challanged Jon Anderson to make an album based on the Bible.  This was his answer.  The hype is that this album is based on the Hindu Shastric Scriptures.  In actuality, as these volumes demand years of study, it was based on Jon's cursory reading of a footnote in the book \\"Autobiography of a Yogi.\\"  According to the liner notes, the album was developed in by Jon and Steve in a series of late-night meetings by candlelight.  Jon's never been all that good at penning lyrics that directly resonate, and this is never more true than on \\"Tales.\\" <br /> <br />There's a reason why prog in general, and Yes in particular, is seen as pretentious and bombastic. <br /> <br />In spite of themselves, and most definitely in spite of a decided lack of enthusiasm for this project by Rick Wakeman, Yes crafted an extremely complex 4-part \\"symphony\\" that defies description.  Like many of prog's best (and, to its detractors, worst) moments, it is a completely singular work, like Genesis' \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,\\" King Crimson's \\"Red,\\" and Yes' own \\"Relayer.\\"  Or, for that matter, Beethoven's late string quartets.  It doesn't really reference anything before it, and seems to be a muscical \\"dead end,\\" as nothing after it really builds on it. <br /> <br />Being a huge fan of such \\"dead ends,\\" I think it rules, but that's just me. <br /> <br />The first movement, long-windedly titled \\"The Revealing Science of God,\\" is a testament to man's searching for truth in the spiritual realm.  Musically, it's stellar.  The reissue of \\"Tales\\" has an intro that builds up to the first vocals, which on the original seemed to appear from blackness.  The music builds on this idea, forming a tapestry of searching and release, ebbing and flowing and finally ending on a long chanting passage that sends the message back to the listener in the final \\"and you and you and you.\\" <br /> <br />Many people complain that the second movement, \\"The Remembering,\\" is repititous and \\"padded.\\"  I can't help but agreeing, but I don't know where it should be cut.  It is about man's personal memories, and how they relate to the Godhead.  Throughout the piece, the guitar and keyboards are pivotal, ebbing and flowing and engaging in a dialogue before coming to a resolution in the \\"Rainbows, sunlight\\" section at the end...truly one of the most inspirational moments in the Yes cannon.  After many years of listening, it never fails to bring a tear to my eye. <br /> <br />\\"The Ancient\\" is the most schitzophrenic movement, dealing with the \\"collective unconsciousness\\" and our genetic/racial memories of God.  This is the movement that took me 30 years to really understand and get into.  The first half is an almost antonal experiment, with a howling Steve Howe solo that alone is worth the price of admission to the initiated.  To most, it will probably really annoy.  The second half is a wonderful, amazing piece that was played live on its own and titled \\"Leaves of Green.\\"  I'm still not sure how it ties in with the rest of the album (although the lyrics here, less inscrutable than most of \\"Tales,\\" clearly do), but it's a mindblowing showcase of Steve Howe's classical guitar ability. <br /> <br />The final movement, \\"Ritual,\\" is either a searing indictment of religion or a tacit acknowledgement of its validity.  Only Jon knows for sure, and I doubt that even he could answer the question.  Anyway, it starts with a gorgous, almost hymnic paeon to God, which becomes edgier and edgier until, at the midpoint of the piece, there is a bizarre percussive interval.  According to Jon, it is suppposed to be \\"the battle between Good and Evil.\\"  Irregardless, it's jarring and difficult, and takes many repeated listens to really \\"get.\\"  The backside of the song contains one of the most amazingly beautiful Yes passages, complete with some of the best lyrics that Jon has ever written, starting with \\"Hold me my love, hold me today, call me round.\\"  The song plays itself out into an incredibly edgy finale that references the beginning of Tales, implying that faith and God is a circle. <br /> <br />This is not easy music.  Like I said, it's taken me over 30 years to really get into this music, particularly the third movement \\"The Ancient.\\"  I tend to listen to it in its entirety...if you're a fan of 3-5 minute radio-friendly songs, you will assuredly NOT like \\"Tales.\\"  If new to Yes, try \\"The Yes Album,\\" \\"Fragile,\\" and their brilliant \\"Close to the Edge\\" first, before venturing this far afield.  \\"Tales\\" is best listened to alone, in its entirety, preferably with headphones, and will take multiple listens to really get into. <br /> <br />However, it's worth the effort.  Bombastic, pretentious and self-indulgent?  Absolutely!  A great deal of difficult music is exactly that...but the payoff is huge. <br /> <br />A disclaimer...I am hardly a casual Yes fan, as I'm a moderator on the yesfans.com fan site.  So shoot me, I love this stuff.  Many longtime fans of Yes can't stand it.  But if you get it, it's some of the best music written in the 70s. <br /> <br />If you REALLY like it, try \\"Relayer\\" next.
B00020X88O|5.0|This VIP edition is fantastic. The film has a hilarious commentary that makes the whole thing work. SHOWGIRLS is the new BEYOND THE VALLEY OF HE DOLLS.
B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Down is unbelievable. Fast, heavy-hitting, thrashing, insane music, screaming, melodious vocals, political undertones, deep lyrics: all are here. When I first head their songs, System found a special place in my heart. Serj, the band's vocalist, is nothing short of insane, with his ear-rending screams and soft, melodious undertones. Daron, SOAD's guitarist, is unbelievable, with pounding, shockingly-fast riffs and beautiful solos. System's bassist, Shavo, has unequaled talent, as he pounds out heavy bass lines. John, the band's drummer, is also extremely talented, with his insane coordination and speed.  <br /> <br />System's debut album is nothing short of musical perfection. Each and every song is varied, fast, and so different from anything else you will have ever heard. Lyrics are deep and thought-provoking, and the musical quality is unheard of. If you're looking for variety, a differentiation from the cliche metal sound that is so prominent in today's market, look no further. System of a Down has put together a masterpiece, one that no music fan should miss out on.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I wanted to see this movie for a long time. I had remembered Sofia Coppola's performance in \\"Godfather 3\\" many years ago and enjoyed her earlier movie \\"The Virgin Suicides.\\"  I knew from what I had seen that this movie was not your run-of-the-mill movie.<br /><br />This movie about a beyond-his-prime American Movie Star visiting Tokyo because he got a hefty paycheck to promote Japanese Scotch...... could be seen as depressing.  It could be seen as having \\"no story\\"... it could be seen as boring.<br /><br />It is none of those.<br /><br />The pace of the movie allows you to find your own tempo alongside the movie's tempo.<br /><br />The humor is wry and understated.<br /><br />The relationships are real and the ending is another \\"non-Hollywood\\" ending.<br /><br />The acting tends towards subtle, nuanced and intelligent.  (I also found myself wondering what it would have been like if Scarlett Johansson had received the role in \\"Parent Trap\\" that went to Lindsey Lohan. Would she be a Disney Diva now? Shudder to think....)<br /><br />I loved the scenes of Bill Murray dealing with the Directors of the Scotch commercials. Very funny.<br /><br />There were also great \\"I don't fit here\\" sequences, wordless yet among the most strongly stated of the movie.<br /><br />One sort of fun-review-aside, I smiled when I watched a Bonus Feature of Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola hanging out in Rome, it looks like they are standing on a patio or something. The contrast between old-world Rome and neon flavored Tokyo was astonishing - and since I watched this bonus AFTER the movie, I was also reminded of how much Scarlett Johansson's performance seemed to echo Sofia Coppola, the writer-director herself.<br /><br />Both have soft voices, appear very present yet just a wee bit unattached... spend a lot of time just thinking (from all appearances) and doesn't show much emotion yet we somehow sense there is a lot of feeling going on in there... somewhere.<br /><br />In fact - that last paragraph is a passable description of the movie itself.fact - that last paragraph is a passable description of the movie itself. <br /> <br />
B0001GH7KY|4.0|This is a very underated film. When i first saw it i thought it was stupid and pointless. But then i saw it again a few years later and changed my mind.The story is ok and the acting is average and like most Lucio Fulci films is there is plenty of gore. If you are looking for a good horror film, this would be a good choice.
B00003CX96|5.0|This movie would be considered an \\"indie\\" movie today, with <br />it's low production budget, but hence lies its charm. <br />This movie is the cinimatic equivalent of John Cougar's <br />\\"small town\\". It delves into the absolute core of what it means <br />to grow up in a small american town, without patronizing <br />the characters. I grew up there around the same time and age of <br />the characters. That's how it really was. The movie <br />captures that ineffable, transient moment when our adolescent dreams haven't quite calcified into harsh reality yet. <br />It perfectly captures the precious few years we have when life is endless with possiblities and dreams, and the gravitas <br />of responsibilities and stream of disappointments hasn't hit us yet.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This movie is RIGHTEOUS and kicks [...] That says a lot coming from me, someone who usually isn't too interested in these types of movies. After seeing Troy, I would have to say that I will be seriously disappointed if Brad Pitt doesn't win an Academy Award for this film, it is truly his best movie ever! If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it. And if you are a big Brad Pitt fan like I am, you will definately enjoy this one because he is very HOT in this movie! Watch it today!
B0002O06N0|4.0|Proving that white boy hard rock blues does not have to be derivative of anything but the core of the soul.  Big riffs and sweaty, ballsy vocals, the White Stripes comparisons are totally off base in that these guys are drenched in a hybrid of soul and sex and the blues, striving for a Stevie Ray hierarchy and landing there.  My grade: A
B000002J2B|5.0|It gets off to a rousing start with 'Eleventh Earl Of Mar' which is probably awesome but I can't really tell because of David Hentschel's murky, gray production.  In fact, the whole album seems to want to be pretty great but it's buried in a deep compression it cannot transcend which the remastering exacerbates beautifully and which suppresses any dynamics the band tries so hard to express.  Take a track like 'Blood On The Rooftops', for example, and gloss it with lots of echo and then remove all the lower frequencies; it'll probably sound great on the radio but elsewhere it only frustrates close listening.  And Genesis can quote Emily Bronte all they want for song titles, and I'm sure she would have appreciated it, but where the heck is Steve Hackett?  Barely anywhere, that's where.  It's mostly Tony Banks' synth affair.  No wonder there were only three on the next go around.
B0006399FS|1.0|This is a three song album people. Vertigo, All Because of You, and Crumbs from your Table.  The critics just continue to think this band can do no wrong. The rest is Bono whining about something.  Bono seems to have writer block on some lyrics, uses \\"down on knees\\" in a couple songs.  Do we still believe he can have the hots for a cocktail server in \\"Vertigo\\".  Lyrics seem childish in spots \\"do as I say, and no one gets hurt\\"  WOW very orginally stuff there. Guitar work is brillant in spots, but overall the guitar riffs are not worthy of remembering after six months of this release.  I challenge you all.  Will you be playing this cd in a year from now?
068987474X|4.0|You may not like what you read.  But the authors make a lot of sense.  I bought this for 2 girlfriends -- and they should read it carefully.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|My family and I have a kind of sick love for really, really stupid movies, so we thought we were good to go with this one.  But actually, it was very funny, very smart.  The basic premise, that the dead are walking and attacking the living is certainly not original, but the reactions of the clueless hero and his slacker sidekick are just wonderful.  They argue over which records to use to immobilize the zombies, which I found amusing.  But the best is in the end, which I will not give away except to say that for some of the characters, being a zombie isn't much different from being alive...<br /><br />I recommend this movie to all who like zaney humor.
B00000JGHM|4.0|Who could resist the chance to bring Pacino and de Niro together?  And what other scenario but confrontation would be fitting?  And what might be added to the inevitable clash to give it broader interest?  Family life!  Relationships!  Kids!  Never mind that this was done in The Godfather.  Michael Mann wants to update all that and pull it away from The Mob in New York.  He transplants it to Los Angeles where de Niro heads a \\"gang of four\\".  He's clearly the brains of the team which uses the latest technology, the most precise co-ordination, and the most meticulous timing to hit [literally!] an armoured car in a heist.  They then spend drawn-out minutes sorting through stacks of packages to retrieve a set of bearer bonds!  Then more minutes wasting the deafened armoured car crew who can't possibly identify them!<br /><br />Just to show this isn't another film of \\"gratuitous violence\\" we follow the hit team through their domestic distranquilities.  Val Kilmer, de Niro's Number Two, has a lovely wife [Ashley Judd] and child.  He rages at her supposed infidelities, but strikes neither wife nor child [the house takes a beating, though].  The others, except de Niro, have wives or partners - some semblance of family, at any rate.  They dine together, party together, stand by one another in times of crises.  Then they set off to rob a bank.<br /><br />To counter this latest endeavour, LAPD copper Al Pacino tries to lay traps or otherwise discourage the \\"score\\" from taking place.  He's a professional with much experience and has many resources to tap.  One of those is his long-suffering third wife - along with her daughter.  His extended hours on the job bring tension - but Diane Verona objects to being a \\"leftover\\".  She isn't repelled by his tales of microwaved babies or slaughtered street girls.  As a loving wife, she wants more of her husband.  Pacino, however, is a driven man.  Besides, he has to meet de Niro for coffee and a self-revelation session.  Which, predictably, is the high point of the film - although you can relate the dialogue before it's heard.  Still, it's better these two confront over spilled java than spilled blood.<br /><br />When the bank job finally occurs, it slings more lead than the My Lai Massacre.  The LAPD are far outclassed by de Niro's team of thugs.  As they strive to escape, the trio [one is being dogged by the LAPD] shatter cars, buildings and bodies.  The inevitable hostage is taken.  Laden with dollar bags [a less sanguine version of the body bag] they manage to elude the forces of good - for a bit.  After all, the final confrontation remains to be filmed.<br /><br />In making a good action film, it's necessary to ignore the implausible.  In realistic terms, this film falls flat.  For edge-of-seat action, it's almost peerless.  Either Pacino or de Niro can make a film worth watching.  Together as adversaries, they achieve a kind of narrative critical mass.  To offset the rough diamonds these two display, are the grace of Diane Verona and Ashley Judd.  Both of these sterling actresses should have been given more footage.  The domestic tension could have had much more impact.  As an escapist adventure, this film is hard to surpass.  Worth watching once, but repetition would be mind-numbing.

It is not even worth 1 cent let alone (...). If you want a horiable movie that has not a nanogram of humor or replay value, buy this. This movie should come with a knive so you could stab yourself insted of watching it. I would have given this movie negitive satrs if I could. Conclusion: Not funny, Not cute, Not worth (...).
B0002I831S|5.0|I own all of the episodes on VHS and eagerly awaited the DVDs.  When I saw that the industry was moving toward the boxed set format I held off buying the disks one at a time.  This year my girlfriend bought me the first two seasons on DVD and I am thrilled to have it! I have a surround sound system and it works great with the new sound they have done for this set. \\"Where no man has gone before\\" has an excellent documentary to go with the episode and I highly recomment having your pause button handy while watching the comments. Some big names are in this set; Robert Bloch, Harlan Ellison, Robert Matheson..... all worth the time to watch.  Some people claim that this was one of the hokiest TV series of all time. I would offer back to nay sayers that if they can name another series that has had 4 (yes four) spin-offs from a series that lasted only 3 seasons AND is as popular almost 40 years later to try, just try! <br /> <br />Excellent and worth every penny.  Buy it.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|When my singing instructor suggested \\"Wicked\\" for audition pieces, I had no idea what she was talking about. She taped \\"I'm Not That Girl\\" and \\"No Good Deed\\" for me, and the addiction began. I'm now the proud owner of the CD and it's on constant rotation in my car. <br /> <br />The vocal talent combined with a captivating score make the incredible story of Wicked compelling and heart wrenching. \\"Defying Gravity\\" takes my breath away every time. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!
068987474X|2.0|This book gets a 5 for entertainment value, a 1 or 2 stars for life value. First, if you need to read chapters about what to do with married or cheating guys, you need a self esteem or self improvement book, not a dating book.  You shouldn't even be dating, really. I pretty much skimmed those chapters. If relationships could be boiled down into so simple a litmus test as he or she's \\"just not that into you\\", then there'd be zero relationship books out there. We don't see books on the simple task of gum chewing, do we? At any rate, it was a fun read, but over my education and life experience, the more I know men AND women, the more I despise any relationship book focused solely on gender - because I am finding the core of people tend to be the same.  It's the societal, cultural and gender differences that show up on the surface and often those signals get misinterpreted. Also, though there are simpletons out there, most people are fairly complex. I can't even know myself some of the things that have influenced my behaviors and why I do what I do. How can I really expect a guy to just interpret everything I do/say and decide if I'm into him or not? Family and upbringing plays a HUGE - HUGE - HUGE factor in how people act in relationships and unfortunately, most people do not see it or address it... so our adult relationships are effected by it. Greg & whats her face wrote an amusing book, and certainly has created a very easy read for a cold night in, but please don't take this book literally.  Think about it - male or female - have you ever wanted something/someone and was afraid to act? We function on a very hard wired flight or fight basis - add emotions... don't tell me every single guy that liked a gal never had fear win. Ever? Gimme a break. Every single day, minute to minute, second to second we change - men and women. A book like this, with the uh, 10 ? men Greg \\"researched\\" can't possibly cover the territory. Communication is the key, boys and gals. Make youractions match your words and that's about the easiest generality I'm gonna buy. And that gem was free! If you still must buy a dating book, try The Girlfriend Test by Wendy Walsh, Date or Soulmate by Neil Patrick Warren or check out John Gottman. Find out the traits of what makes relationships successful, not the gender biased crap thats out there and you have no idea which man to use it on... cos each person is different. So that means... the long way to success - just like anything else that's worth having, it takes work. And sometimes that means facing fears or fighting. Sorry, no magic bullets in relationships.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|This isn't the best movie of 2004, but it's quite good. Michael Mann uses a variety of camera angles and alternates between quiet and loud to create a level of tension approximating what Jamie Foxx's character must feel as he drives Tom Cruise around town to perform his duties as a hired gun. The reasons behind this night of bloodshed are artfully revealed as the film proceeds, with clues neatly interspersed. Some of the action may seem random, but while the film contains the coincidences necessary to make it work, it plays out realistically... <br /> <br />Until the end. In the last 30 minutes or so, Tom Cruise's character undergoes a metamorphosis, transforming from the interesting sociopath he was at the start of the cab ride into an almost Terminator-like figure, hopping on the back of a train and reacting to gunshot wounds like you or I would react to a slap in the face. <br /> <br />Despite the ending, however, \\"Collateral\\" is well worth your time. Probably not your money, though, at least not to buy it.
B000068PQ0|4.0|I have to say that I forgot about the Flaming Lips until this album came out, only known to me by their alternative hit \\"She Dont Use Jelly\\" I was stunned to see them back in full force on a television commercial performing \\"Do You Realize\\"   This album is amazing, and the Lips need credit just for attempting to make something like this in a time where crappy music clogs MTV and radio stations.  The soft melodies and soaring backgrounds owe much to the eary Pink Floyd  and Moody Blues.  Psychedelic, fun and easy to immediately slip into andenjoy.  Ive seen them live twice since this CD came out and they are even more fun on stage.  The only reason I didnt give a full 5 stars is because the highest rating must be preserved for those classic albums which need no introduction anymore, the Dark Side of the Moon's and Nevermind's and Sgt. Pepper's.  Perhaps in time Yoshimi will prove just as influencial as the records and bands which seem to have influenced it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Let me start off by telling you this - EVANESCENCE IS NOT GOTH. <br /> <br />anyways, I'll rate each of the songs. <br /> <br />Going Under - 9/10. Very interesting beginning. <br />Bring Me To Life - 9/10. The fact that someone besides Amy Lee is singing in this just annoys me. <br />Everybody's Fool- 10/10. It's even better as a music video. <br />Haunted - 10/10. My second favorite on this CD. <br />Tourniquet - 9/10. This song, at least to me, seems to prove that Evanescence is not goth. Though it is depressiong, it is also religious. <br />Imaginary - 9/10. Dunno what to say. <br />Taking Over Me - 10/10. My third favorite song on this CD <br />Hello - 10/10. My favorite song. It makes me depressed, though. <br />My Last Breath - 8/10. Not as good as other songs on this CD. <br />Whisper - 9/10. Sort of long and a little weird. <br /> <br />The main problem with Evanescence music is that it gets too depressing. <br /> <br />Just a suggestion to Evanescence - don't let anyone other than Amy Lee sing. It's a waste of good talent if they do.

B000002LEU|4.0|Though I hate to use the term \\"sampler\\" in reference to this album, I have to admit that it is quite accurate in terms of content. The body of work that Joy Division accumulated in their short history has been strained through, and the pulp is on \\"Substance.\\" I will use a simple metaphor to assist you in your decision-making: If you are looking into the pool of Joy Division and want to get your feet wet, or even dive in, this album is perfect. I'm pretty sure that's a metaphor. It has the essentials. \\"Warsaw\\" is a perfect intro (which was later covered by the Black Halos--it's fantastic), and their most famous song, \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\", is also on the tracklist. After this, you can segu&eacute; into new wave and New Order without any problems.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Wow this was a great documentary after watching movies by  Michael Moore I thought he was the only that could present  topics like these but was I wrong. Errol Morris won an Oscar for his work in this movie and it shows.    Its just stunning imaginative, and hard hitting. There are no  lies in the film, no ramblings of a Republican spewing out  propaganda just cold hard fact. Morris interviews  Robert McNamara, the former Secretary of Defense in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and in great interview fashion McNamara  essentially bares his soul to the viewer.    Its not just a documentary buts its a reprieve of sorts for the  guy who has lead and participated in some of the most notorious  coverups and shames in American history from Vietnam to   the Cuban Missile Crisis to World War II.    Morris uses audio tapes captured from then President Lyndon  Johnson and McNamara to show us the sham that was Vietnam.    It wasnt about fighting the cold war people, it was about imposing our colonial ideals on a weaker nation. Just like  we did with the Soviet Union and left that nation in poverty,  there was never any proof they were going to attack us with  Castro, these are just the paranoid beliefs of one President  to the other.    McNamara tells us what we already know, there was no planning  for Vietnam It was a huge mistake that was financed merely  for profit. We were not liberating the Vietnamese, in fact  the Vietnamese did not want our presence.    He mentions the poor military technology that often made  mistakes such as when enemies attacked when they didnt.    He mentions that all his doings have been wrong and it took  many years as it usually does for a narrow minded individual  to wake up to the truth.    The 1995 meeting he had with a former Prime Minister sums  it up \\"We were not fighting Communism, he says we were  fighting for our Independence\\".    This is just an awesome film like \\"FAHRENHEIT 911\\" that has  to been and seen with a large gatheringof people so we can  learn from our mistakes so we dont repeat them.
B00005JMXX|4.0|Movies aren't what they're all cracked up to be. Take 'Day After Tommorow', instead of plotting action blockbusters over nothing the world has seen, it describes the disasters the Earth can witstand because of the polar ice caps melting. I ain't going to brag about how this movie is genuine, but if you're really looking for a movie that illustrates authentic happenings on Earth rather that fictional occurences being awarded because of the tense drama it displays to get across the feared people of today, Don't forget to pick this movie up, although i think everybody watched this by now. Special Effects are used alot in this movie, but it all came out perfect, breathtaking and scarily true.   <br /> <br />Take my word for it, if there's any movie i would recommend, pick up American History X, Shawshank Redemption or Training Day.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash simply epitomize the meaning of the genre \\"punk\\" better than almost everyone, and the Sex Pistols are the only band that is  even considered an equal. This album is one of the biggest and best of the last 30 years. Enough said.
B000006XSD|3.0|Originally released in 1977, as this was the follow-up to Cooper's pathetic '... Goes To Hell' lp (see my review). Now, 'Lace & Whiskey' is quite different than Uncle Alice's previous pieces of work - in the sense that out of the ten tracks here, the Detroit rocker fuses mid-tempo songs from the late '50's with the early '70's classic rock sound. In my humble opinion, the formula seemed to have worked out decently well. I've known several long-time Coop fans and followers that absolutely hate this album. I always thought that this platter had, like five (5) tunes that made it worth it to hang onto. I still have my vinyl copy. Tracks that happen to find most appealing were \\"It's Hot Tonight\\", the title cut \\"Lace & Whiskey\\", \\"Road Rats\\" (I remember him playing this song out on his 'Clones' tour), the old Chas Underwood boogie / rockabilly cover \\"Ubangi Stomp\\" (has sort of an Elvis vibe to it) and the lp's closer - the choir-like \\"My God\\". Alice's back-up for this lp: Dick Wagner - guitar & vocals, Steve Hunter - guitar, Babbit - bass, Bob Ezrin - keyboards and Allen Schwartzberg - drums. I remember when he toured in support of 'Lace & Whiskey' - his live show featured six-feet tall machine gun carrying chickens, a giant TV screen with knobs showing bogus commercials and the return of the (notorious) guillotine. A fun time was had by all (if not, most) who had witnessed the mayhem. Not a bad catalog title of Cooper's lengthy repertoire.
B00004YKSD|4.0|I just watched this movie again a few days ago, and the photography sticks in my mind.  There are more special effects in The Doors than in Star Wars.  I think this movie represents a change in Oliver Stone's career.  I didn't like some of his earlier films as much as other people.  The most interesting films to me were the ones where he used a lot of special photography to convey the message like JFK, Nixon, Any Given Sunday, even Natural Born Killers (although I think Killers hits a doorstop in the prison scenes).  There are scenes in Killers that have the kind of visual exuberance and improvisations inherent in the message, almost like a fairy tale.<br /><br />The Doors uses cinema the way Apocalypse Now uses cinema.  What I mean by that is the montages, the feeling of immersion, the adult manner in which the cinema handles the plot.  It pulls out the stops and goes as deep as the mental state it portrays without being too \\"preachy\\".  Those are Stone's preferable qualities to me.  The Oliver Stone films lacking those presentation techniques I speak of were shot so gritty to the extent of degrading the moral, and they had little beauty or gloss in them, which are the things that were put into The Doors and the above few I mentioned.<br /><br />Stone's better films are the ones like this one that treats his subjects as fairy tales for adults.  They are the ones that take me on a colorful ride and display what those things look like in one's imagination, and then plays with them like fairy tales.  They should be vivid and colorful.  They should not make me hate the world, but have me make better choices in the world.<br /><br />If you are interested in Oliver Stone in the same manner, you may also want to read his book, A Child's Night Dream.

Will Shaun's attempt to get friends, family and ex-girlfriend to safety triumph? Will he and Ed still have time to have a pint?  My friend, watch the DVD.  You will not regret it  :  )

B0006399FS|1.0|Unlike all preceding U2 albums until Pop ( 1997 ), this one lacked originality, sophistication, seriousness and intelligence. This is a very safe and simple minded album, geared to the general masses and some airplay on FM channels, as ATYCLB was.   Not even close to their best albums, this is really terrible to listen, and the current hype of this album have ruined it.    Yet they have been many articles published about this by the time and immediately after and it became apparent to anyone reading these that the U2 name was simply a pawn to be used to make the record company, Bono , and U2s managment richer.     No regrets, this is their Worst attempt at music ever. Artistic, U2 is going down and down, but they dont even notice about that ( do they even care about bad reviews worldwide both from fans and press ? ), because some mindless fans are still supporting any new U2 stuff, no matter how bad it is. Its their worst album ever. Its so boring. The lyrics and music would impress only a 5 years old. Moreover, this \\"music\\" is something weve been listening since 2000. Like ATYLCB, its a desperate attempt to try to copy earlier recordings.     This album is named as \\"U2\\" though I have my doubts as to Larry and Adam's actual involvment with this band, except on tour and when it comes to collecting the bucks.    Overall: it's just that for the fan that used to like U2 because they were U2 and nobody else, the cup runneth empty on that aspect of their music.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|I saw Troy in the theatre. I thought the production was ok, but I couldn't handle Brad Pitt.

B0001I561E|5.0|I just finished writing two horrible reviews and had to write a good one.  What better movie to write about than Aladdin?!?!  This is one of my all time favorite Disney movies.  The animation is incredible.  The actors top notch.  The music wonderful & addictive!  Can't tell you how many times 'A Whole New World' pops into my head.  I don't think there's anything bad you could say about this movie.  It's fun, exciting and hillarious.  What more could you ask for??
B00007BHOE|5.0|Now band DVDs are supposed to suck usually, right? Well this one by far takes the cake as the BEST band DVD ever created. Some people here have praised Joey's drum solo which is insanely great I admit but my favorite was Sid's solo on the turntables. Both before gently and after. It was just the best peice of DJing I have ever seen next to hip hop. I recomend this DVD for all my fellow maggots and those who wnat to know what a live Slipknot experience is like. By it now.

B00005JNEI|5.0|I've never much liked Moore's work. It's usually clear that he's trying to make some point in his \\"documentaries,\\" but he never clearly states a point and defends it with evidence. He prefers to crash gates and rattle people and use the awkwardness of the situations to make the subjects look bad rather than arguing a point or smartly dissecting an issue. <br /> <br />In \\"Fahrenheit 9/11,\\" however, Moore produces his most journalistic piece of work to date. Yes, there are plenty of moments in which he has injected his bias, his commentary. But there are plenty of facts -- evidence, anecdotes, quotations, records, first-person accounts, etc. You might not always agree with Moore's tone or how he has pieced together things, but you will be hard-pressed to challenge the facts he has presented in F911. And that's what it's all about, anyway -- putting forward more facts than are typically given by the mainstream media, who, quite frankly, are fearful of losing their access to the White House and who, like the general action-movie-going public, really do enjoy the excitement of explosions and battles and sexy news. <br /> <br />Moore gives us more. And he does it in more than the 20 seconds you might get from TV news while not going overboard or muddying the waters with information that is not relevant to the core story. The core story is that that invasion of Iraq was not about Sept. 11. You're still left free to draw your own conclusions, too. <br /> <br />Even when you do think Moore might have set someone up or taken something out of context, you still must remember that he uses multiple sources. OK, assume that the comments from the tank soldiers were stretched a little -- maybe a little out of context. Dismiss them entirely if you like, because they are just one example in a string of examples that Moore uses to show the humanity (or lack of humanity) with which the war was conducted -- in response to Rummy's on-the-record comments on the war's humaneness.  <br /> <br />Again, Moore gives you more than one example for every point he addresses. If you don't like one of the examples, there are plenty more. It doesn't make the whole work without merit. (Remember, it IS still a work designed with a message in mind. It's not totally neutral -- but then the movie itself even gives strong evidence to show that mainstream reporters are not reporting the war in a neutral matter.)  <br /> <br />So don't throw out the baby with the bathwater here. Recognize a fact when you see it. Dismiss the tone if you don't like it. But do think for yourself. Keep an open mind. I did, and it changed my perspective on a lot of things.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Stanley Kubrick spent the last years of his life working on this film. And by the time Eyes Wide Shut went into general release in the United States, the director was already deceased, giving his final project the cachet of a farewell gesture-or perhaps a Last Judgment, since the Dies Irae from the Mozart Requiem can be heard at one point on the soundtrack. Yet its long awaited appearance turned out to be something of an anticlimax when most of the pre-release gossip turned out to be unjustified. No dazzling spectacle in the vein of 2001: A Space Odyssey nor even A Clockwork Orange, Eyes Wide Shut (made available here as part of Warner Home Video's excellent set of Kubrick's films) was first of all a fable for the approaching millennium, directed with a breathtaking dsinvolture that still seems astonishing several years later. One day, I hope, Eyes Wide Shut will be recognized as one of the most beautiful works in the history of the cinema.   Only in bad works of art or the artifacts of pop culture is it possible to make a facile distinction between the periphery of a work and its core. In an imaginative creation like Kubrick's last film, the limits of the core extend to its furthermost boundaries just as what could at first glance seem peripheral penetrates to its innermost recesses. Already, the opening shots of the Harfords in their stylish apartment getting ready to go out for a soiree go far beyond simply establishing a setting. The least that could be said about these powerfully iridescent, Ophulsian compositions set to music by Shostakovitch is how much more than functional they are: rather than simply establishing a particular locale, they serve to introduce us to a perversely enchanted world. The mise en scne is incantatory, but the spirits it is calling up are those of high-tech consumerism.   In these images, the dcor glows with a maleficent radiance, making of the Harfords themselves little more than the props of their own property. Small wonder thatsuch a culture finds the culmination of its most refined pleasures in the celebration of a Black Mass at a mansion on Long Island--movie trivia buffs will not fail to notice a visual allusion to Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest--attended by the crme de la crme of the rich, famous, and powerful, a ritual which blasphemously travesties the Christmas festivities taking place at the same moment and which has striking parallels to the events of de Sade's The 120 Days of Sodom in both its literary version and its much later screen adaptation by Pier Paolo Pasolini, Sal o le 120 giornati di Sodoma (1975).  In the milieu in which the Harfords move, reified to the last degree, success is all a matter of remaining on the surface of things, and Bill Harford has thoroughly mastered that skill. But the surface begins to crack open one evening when his wife relates a fantasy about sleeping with a Naval officer they had briefly glimpsed at a resort. Bill reacts violently to this confession, insisting that he has never had similar fantasies of his own. But he cannot exorcise the images she has planted in his mind and they soon begin to take shape on the screen. Moreover, this fantasy which increasingly obsesses Harford opens up to a larger world of collective desires underlying the beautiful realm of surfaces in which Bill wishes to remain happily imprisoned. Forced to confront that underworld by series of encounters involving the daughter of a patient, a prostitute, and ultimately a Satanist coven, he can only reject it as a mystery.     The phrase \\"eyes wide shut\\" is virtually an etymological gloss on the word \\"mystery.\\" In the words of Carl Kernyi (in his essay \\"The Mysteries of the Kabeiroi\\"), \\"The source of the term 'Mysteria'--as also of 'mystes' and 'mystikos'--consists in a verb whose ritual significance is 'to initiate' (&#965;e&#912;&#957;), developed from the verb &#973;e&#953;&#957;, 'to close the eyes or mouth.'\\" He goes on to add, \\"the Mysteria begin for the mystes when, as sufferer of the event (&#965;&#959;&#973;e&#957;&#959;&#962;), he closes his eyes, falls back as it were into his own darkness, enters into the darkness.\\" And is there anything less enigmatic about an audience sitting in a darkened theater, an audience which also could be said to fall back as it were into its own darkness, to enter its darkness--to borrow Kerenyi's formulation--watching this spectacle being enacted on screen?  It is Bill's friend, the musician Nick Nightingale who tells him of playing at an event whose specifics are unclear to him, since he has to play blindfolded. Nevertheless, the few details he has been able to spy upon after the blindfold slightly fell from his eyes the last time he performed rouse Bill's interest, and he demands to go along to the event. When Harford, the non-initiate, violates this mystery, he not only disrupts its performance, but commits a crime which can only be atoned for by a human sacrifice--that of the young woman whom Harford has previously rescued from a drug overdose at the fancy party the evening before.   Yet there is little mystery about this mystery, which continues in a perhaps more explicit vein the theme of archaic regression that recurs throughout Kubrick's work--perhaps most arrestingly in 2001: A Space Odyssey, in which modern technology is presented as an outgrowth of the anthropoids' fetishization of the black obelisk which has descended to them from the heavens like the stone given by Gabriel to Abraham enshrined in the Kaaba. Civilization is constantly haunted by the specter of the barbaric past it has never been able to overcome, and the cult in Eyes Wide Shut is only a final incarnation of this key motif which Kubrick employed here for last time. After that death had the final word: Acta est fabula!

B0002BO0AS|3.0|Unearth.  They just don't really impress me all that much.  I'll admit, they got some catchy riffs and breakdowns, but it's all been done before.  Also their music is pretty predictiable; I was able to call the breakdowns about 10 seconds before each one on the first listen. <br /> <br />This is just an average release.  You'll like it if you're an average person who likes average music. <br /> <br />However, if you want to hear some extraordinary stuff that is a bit less known, check out: <br /> <br />- The Number Twelve Looks Like You (I don't think amazon.com has them) <br />- Circle Takes The Square <br />- SkyCameFalling <br />- Every Time I Die
B000055Y0X|4.0|This film is one of my all-time favorites.  This DVD, though, is representative of the big scam in media marketing and in the DVD industry in particular.  That is, release one edition, and then, one or two years later, release a new edition with like 3 more extra features, call it the \\"Super-Mega-Ultra-Wonderful-Incredible Edition\\" and make everyone go out and buy it again.  How many editions of Dr. Strangelove are there already?  Now there's a 2-disc anniversary edition, which I guess trumps this edition, which is the one that I have.  So if you are considering purchasing this film, I guess it's just a question of how much you want to spend, for how many extra features.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Moderately entertaining, disturbing and sensational film that is no less deceptive than the lines of BS we are fed every day from the government. Why does the film evoke more ire and cynicism than the average lie we are told by so-called reliable sources? Conservative 'sheeple' who want to squelch this movie remind me of what is so important about movies like this: they provide a much-needed litmus test for how well we actually deal with our own inalienable rights. Those far more stupid than Michael Moore should remember this.<br /><br />Hoorah for the chubby normal guy who became a hero in America!
B00004RJ74|4.0|This movie made me laugh harder than I have in a long time. It is the perfect combination of Hollywood camp and vampire horror. Tarantino is his usual glib self while Clooney is the great-looking tough guy. The addition of Salma Hayek as the snake-dancing leader of the vampires is classic casting, and the smaller appearances by ex-NFL Fred Williamson, Cheech Marin, and other names and faces that you will recognize adds just the right Hollywood flair. With the nudity and violence, this is definitely not a film for youngsters but grownups with a slightly offbeat sense of humor will appreciate the often tongue-in-cheek dialogue and acting.
B0002SROSQ|4.0|I just bought it, and like most really good music, it takes a while for it to really soak in, so I can't comment fully. All I want to say is when the apocalyptic strains of \\"There is a war coming!\\" burst out of my car speakers as I pulled up to my apartment I thought the stars would begin to explode in the sky. I believed it. <br />I think I have a lot to look forward to here.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I almost did not buy into this series after completing my STNG collection. I, grudgingly, bought season one because I figured I'd give the series ONE chance to hook me. First, let me say, I could never seem to get into any of the shows, when they were originally airing; I looked nothing like STNG and I didn't like that. And that Ferengie...JUST could not stomach that character. I must say that once the Dominion thread started to take hold later on in the DS9 run, lookout, it takes OFF!!! Let me put this all in a nutshell. Buy the entire series....all seasons and prepare to have your loyalty to STNG CHALLENGED. I'm very serious. DS9, when watched in series will change how you think about the other shows. Better yet...just get season one and prove me wrong.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Although I have always been a Beatle's fan, when i got this as a gift and listen to it, i found my self in a difficult position, i couldn't made my mind if i'd love it or hate it, because the \\"let it be..naked\\" is a terrorist attack to the beatles sacred discography . WHY?, well , the name its self tells it all, the origianl \\"let it be\\" pressed in 1970 is the way the beatles wanted it to be, period,  or if i can correct my self, the way the album was meant to be; the  modern people in the present hasn't let the album be as it was really meant to be. Were they in the studio, sharing J, P ,G and R's  opinion? <br /> <br />Songs like magie mae, or dig it, are missing in this modern and profane version of \\"let it be\\", don't let me down is included... (a hard to find piece?!!!!) but some funny sayings or things like \\"I dig a pigmee..\\" by john in \\"two of us\\" are missing too    <br />The mastering and the mixing is excellent through all the disc, but the second disc is useless for the average listener, not even hardcore fans find it rewarding, and the booklet is a bit gray and pale, with a lot words and less pictures. <br /> <br />Remember that let it be was originally a movie for the poeple have the chance get the beatles in rehearsal, but it all came down becuase of internal problems, but that's how let it be came out, originally, so if you don't mind listening to the fab four in a odd an unique (but not original)  way, you should get this album, cause  nothing's new on it. <br />
B000005RSW|5.0|there's one thing you must never forget while hearing this album. it was the early 80s ,new wave,mike jackson,durran durran.bands like manowar saved music for people like me.\\"sign of the hammer\\"is not your run of mill thrash album. infact a lot of it is'nt very thrashy at all .early manowar is kinda like kiss w/balls,talent & less sex appeal.\\"mountain\\" is awsome .begenning as a midevil fantasy type ballad then bursting into a massive peice.this song could be called mountain w/ no lyrics & i would understand why.songs like \\"animal\\"&\\"all men play on 10\\" are radio friendly songs w/ teeth.others like \\"thor\\", the title track & the \\"oath\\" are manowar doing what they do best.\\"thunderpick\\"is de maios bass solo ...ssssooooo awsome & the perfect intro to \\"guyana\\" manowars take on the mass suicide of a cult in s. america back in the seventies \\"our lifless bodies forming a line\\". eric adams gives us a good sence of how brainwashed these people were. but enough already ,BUY IT IT JAMS !!!!!!!!!

B00009UW0N|5.0|If you take an audience that never seen either Psycho or Halloween and had them watch both films, let's see how many screams per each film there are. Halloween like Psycho has a believible storyline where both characters could really exist. It wasn't until after the first film where Michael gets shot about a hundred times and still lives that the character isn't plauseable anymore. But, the pure terror that is given off by this faceless killer relentlessly stalking his victim is chilling, that when you leave the theater and get in your car to go home, you have to check the back seat to make sure Michael isn't there. Now that's what I call scary!
B00005JNLY|3.0|Spanglish is about a life-shaping incident in the life of one Hispanic girl, where her mom goes to work, and temporarily lives with the American family.  The family that they are saying with though is rather dysfunctional though, and the narrator's mother's Hispanic heritage adds just another difficulty to this already hectic family life.    Overall this movie was okay, and, for those readers, rather reminiscent of Sandra Cisnero's novels.  Overall, there is a touch of dysfunction, a touch of Hispanic American culture clash, and a touch of romance.    The only reason this was not too pleasurable was that the sub-plots took too long to interconnect.  Whether it was Adam Sandler's (American dad) family or the Hispanic family the movie was about their troubles but there was nothing being accomplished.    Like I said though, overall it was ok and Adam Sandler played a particularly strong role as the chef/father/nucleus of the hectic family unit.  Check it out for a simple yet slightly deep film, temporary amusement if nothing else.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|I didn't watch this to see Homer.  Many people I spoke with felt that this is what the Trojan war \\"could\\" have been, without the supernatural elements such as the gods and goddesses.  This is fair enough for a movie, as opposed to a lesson in Homer, so I felt it probably wasn't as bad as the reviews I had read.  Let it be noted however, that the story in the film is primarily Homer's story, but I'll not to go into details such as who died and shouldn't have, who lived and shouldn't have, who was omitted and shouldn't have been, etc..., I'll leave it to other reviewers to pick through the story.    I watched it with certain expectations of my own, namely that historically it \\"could\\" have happened, with emphasis on things like accuracy in warfare, costumes, cultural aspects and so on, and I must say this disappointed my most open-minded expectations.  Homer wrote about a war that can't be supported archeologically (the details), so a lot in the Iliad is actually based more on Homers current culture, than history.  Essentially Wolfgang Peterson had an end product that isn't the Iliad, AND can't be supported historically.    To begin with, neither the Mycenaeans (Greeks) nor the Trojans had a cavalry (and it is unlikely that they rode horses -my husband and I disagree as to whether the Trojans could ride horses.  In the Iliad, Hector is mentioned as \\"breaker of horses\\", but I'm not sure that meant he could ride them, not that Homer would have known.  The Trojans would have been more exposed to the eastern cultures, who were beginning to develop riding skills, so it's possible.).  Donkeys were generally used for riding and horses for pulling things such as, oh, say, CHARIOTS, which were the \\"war machine\\" of choice for the nobles/war lords.  The first \\"real\\" evidence of mounted cavalry came from the Assyrians a bit latter in time, however there is a case to be made that the Amazons were the first to use cavalry, which they used in the Trojan war.  In any event there wouldhave been chariot battles, and Achilles (and his lover Patroclus) would have utilized this more than their feet (- picture a young rich guy with a nice car hoofing it around town).  The Amazons would have made a striking contrast to everybody else and I was sorry they weren't used.  Otherwise, weapons were generally typical at the time and I was unable to identify the weapon used by Greater Ajax, nor am I familiar with the two weapon approach so popular in movies today.  I can gloss over the weapons (barely), but can somebody tell me what's with the giant burning balls of yarn??  Furthermore, the turtle or a variation of it is not really associated with this era (i.e. a group of soldiers advancing under cover of their shields in a tight group).  That's not to say it couldn't have been used in a singular instance by a creative commander, but again this is not something that became the norm at that time, nor the warfare we associate with the Trojan war.    The women's clothing is typically misrepresented by the \\"they all wore togas\\" crowd.  The Mycenaeans closely followed the Minoan (earlier Greeks) dress; i.e. tight upper bodice, with a wide flowing lower portion.   The Minoan fashion was such that the bodice hooked under the [...], leaving them exposed.  With the Mycenaeans they were either exposed or covered.  We have this information from the artwork, mostly pottery of the time, and it's not difficult to look up for someone with a Hollywood budget.  The drapey, flowing clothing Helen wore in the film, surfaced during or after the \\"Greek dark ages\\", sometime before Homer's time.  I do not know how the Trojan women would have dressed, but this may have been an east meets west situation (the Assyrians to the east were draped and veiled, with Troy geographically in between , but closer to Greece) - of course this is probably easy to look up as well.  The priests, and priestesses would probably have been similar to the Mycenaeans, due to their shared religious beliefs.      As to the cultural aspects, the old sand and sandals epics were by far less prudish.  There was always hinting and innuendo, and the scripts were clever and well written.  They may not have been a match in eye candy, but they tried harder to create a more realistic impression.  The Achilles/Patroclus \\"relationship\\" (one might kill to avenge one's best friend, or cousin - but the desecration of a body goes beyond that kind of relationship - especially with an experienced warrior), and the costumes are an example of this.  As to cremation, it was common enough during Homer's time, however Mycenaean culture entombed their dead in a similar way to the Egyptians.  Maybe in battlefield instances the dead would be quickly cremated (cremation wasn't unheard of) in order to dispose of them, but kings and leaders would be disposed of in a way that befitted them according to their own culture.  The little I have read about the excavations at Troy also indicate burial on the Trojan side.  -  All in all, a very disappointing movie.
B0006399FS|4.0|I very much enjoy this album.  I would agree with some that it is good background music.  It doesn't overwhelm you.  It is a quieter album, with the exception of Vertigo.  The Edge's guitar has some brilliant moments as does Bono's voice (though definitely taking on a matured tone).  I recommend it.  If you like the older albums, you will like this one.
0618526412|3.0|I bought this paperback to occupy me when I was knocked off my feet, and was glad to find it so entertaining. I was very impressed with McCullers' keen observation of people and found myself laughing out loud more than once.  Reading something written in the thirties and noticing what has changed and what hasn't was interesting.  However, I mistakenly waited to find out \\"the point\\" to it all.  When I reached the end of the book, I found there was no point.  I don't believe, as some do, that this book is about communism (though one of the characters is certainly all about communism.) McCullers is an extremely talented writer, but be prepared to read to the end and think, \\"That's it?\\"  (Or just stop reading at any convenient point prior to the ending.)<br />On a side note, if you are looking for a feel-good book or a happy ending, keep looking.

0375751513|5.0|When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an `immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.<br /><br />The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a `spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.<br /><br />The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.<br /><br />The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.<br /><br />I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray.s a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian.

B0002F6BRE|4.0|Elf is what I would consider the perfect family holiday movie. <br /> It is often next to impossible for my brother, mom, dad, and me to agree on a movie to watch, and Elf was just what we had been looking for.  Will Ferrell's portrayal of a human elf was excellent.  My family and I found ourselves laughing out loud throughout the entire movie. <br /> Elf is the comical story of a human baby, Buddy, who grows up among elves in the North Pole.  As Buddy grows older, he begins to notice that he doesn't quite fit in, literally.  The house Buddy lives in with his \\"Papa Elf,\\" (Bob Newhart) is about three feet too small in height, and his long, human-sized arms and legs hang over the edges of his elf-sized bed.  When Buddy finally discovers he is a human and not an elf, he is on a mission: to find his real dad. <br /> Buddy's dad, (James Caan), lives in New York City, and the Big Apple poses as an incredible eye-opener for the naive elf from the small and comfortable world of the North Pole. <br /> Even the most reluctant parents of \\"childish humor\\" will fall in love with Buddy the elf.  The story is simple enough that younger children will enjoy its' hilarious plot, but at the same time, the movie did a wonderful job of accommodating what it takes to make teenagers and adults laugh, too. <br /> Elf is one of the funniest and best all around feel-good movies of the year. <br /> <br />
B00004SZWB|4.0|I'll be the first to admit that it took me a solid 4 or 5 times of listening too it before I really liked it.  This album is very much \\"80's\\" and is quite different from Wonder's previous masterpieces.  It took me a while to get used to this new style Stevie was using, but after that it stands in my mind as a truly great album. <br /> <br />One thing about any of his albums is that they do not lack any depth lyrically, Hotter than July is no exception.  He's on point as ever with \\"Rocket Love\\" & \\"Cash In Your Face\\".  Musically this album is more fast paced and jams more so than his previous efforts.  \\"Did I Hear You Say You Love Me\\", is a great groove and \\"I Ain't Gonna Stand For It\\" is a quite impressive track with the inclusion of country elements.  \\"Do Like You\\" is a solid track, and perhaps the only one I skip is \\"As if You Read My Mind\\" (You might not though). What makes this album work more than any other factor is musical gems found on here.  \\"All I Do\\" & \\"Master Blaster\\" are both classics in his catalogue & of course \\"Lately\\" is one of his finest (both musically and lyrically).  \\"Happy Birthday\\" is also essential if only because of its historical value.  Despite the strength of some individual tracks it does lack the overall as an album that we've previously come to expect with Wonder.  But, what you have is a 45 min run time album that is just full of solid tracks.  It's truly a testament to Stevie Wonder that, while many great artists of the 70's collapsed when they tried to adapt to the 80's style (look no further than Led Zeppelin), he was able to still convey his musical genius. <br /> <br />This album is definitely not a masterpiece, nor close to touching the genius of his previous albums.  Perhaps it's not his best, but does that take away from it?  Are we just too spoiled by his previous efforts?  Bottom line:  It's still simply a great album and only further adds on to Wonder's legacy.  One of the best albums released from the 80's era.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|The directors and writers of this unbelievable series do NOT tell the viewer what \\"they\\" think the Trilogy means.

This DVD series is for smart people who enjoy Socratic dialog and regular people who like Kung Fu and stuff blowing up!
B0002WYS6S|5.0|It is amazing to see Dream Theater live for the first time. What's awesome about this DVD is that the camera focuses in on Petrucci during his solos so the viewer can see just how incredible his solos are, and also how he can make them look so easy. One thing about this performance that is both good and bad is that the songs aren't that much different than the studio version. This is bad because what seperates live albums from studio albums is the energetic performance and the extended solos from the musicians, but with DT you get that all in a studio album. This is also good, depending how you look at it, because it attests to how talented each of the members are. For example, the harmonized guitar parts are still done live, which I have never seen before. Every other guitarist that I have seen just plays one of the guitar parts, but Petrucci plays both parts to create the same harmony heard in the studio version. The biggest problem with this album is the track selection. It was a smart idea to only include their newer songs since the older ones can be found on one of their other live DVD's. I just think that their new albums could have been represented better. They should have included \\"Fatal Tragedy\\" and \\"Blind Faith.\\" It also would have been incredible to see \\"The Glass Prison\\" live, I am furious that they did not include that. But that is just a small complaint because the majority of the songs are good, especially \\"Instrumedley\\" which combines all of their instrumentals along with two from their Liquid Tension Experiment albums. Also, musicians will love the extras where Petrucci and Rudesss show off all of their gear. A must have for any DT fan or musician, (I'm not a musician and I loved this) especially since it is such a low price.
6300182452|4.0|Obviously this was produced before the age of feminist political correctness.  The anti-hero with no name--Clint Eastwood, of course, a throwback to his days making spaghetti westerns in Italy with Sergio Leone--comes riding tall in the saddle down into a valley with a mining town by a lake.  (The movie was shot around the Mono Lake area of California.)  Particularly effective in this unforgettable opening scene is the music sounding like the high whine of the wind off of the desert.  This town would be \\"Lago\\" later to be renamed \\"Hell\\" by Eastwood's character who is identified in the titles as \\"The Stranger.\\"<br /><br />The stranger really just wants a shave and a bath and something to drink and eat and place to lay his head for the night.  What he gets is a bad time from some roughnecks and a woman (Callie Travers, played by Marianna Hill) who has attraction/avoidance feelings for him.  He shoots the three guys and rapes the woman before the movie is twenty minutes old.  What I mean by this not being politically correct is that, despite herself, she likes it!  That sort of thing is not done in cinema these days.  The idea that a woman might be turned on by being raped would not play before today's audiences, nor would a Hollywood producer make such a film.<br /><br />I won't go any further into the plot but suffice it to say that Eastwood is just beginning to kick tail.  It seems that everybody in town is cowardly and without the will to protect themselves from the bad guys, especially the three who just got out of jail and are headed their way.  How Eastwood, who directed from a script by Ernest Tidyman (The French Connection [1971]; Shaft [1971] etc.), handles the familar revenge theme is interesting.<br /><br />First it is no accident that Eastwood's protagonist is named \\"the Stranger.\\"  That is the English title of a famous novel by Albert Camus that surely influenced Eastwood.  Camus's stranger is an existential anti-hero, a kind of benign sociopath who really doesn't feel anything for others except as they affect his life.  But he is not particularly violent and just lives from one day to the next without any direction or goal.  He just \\"exists.\\"<br /><br />Eastwood's stranger does more than just exist.  He takes action, and he is very good at it.  Indeed, I can't recall a western movie in which a gunman could draw faster or shot straighter, or any movie hero who was less afraid of putting his life on the line.  So, in a sense what Eastwood has added to Camus's stranger is Nietzsche's superman.  And herein lies, I think, the underpinning of Eastwood's philosophy and his \\"message.\\"  Note that the people in the town to a man are cowardly.  The only exception is Sarah Belding (Verna Bloom) who, like the aforementioned Callie Travers, can't resist the stranger's forceful charm, and falls in love with him.  This somehow inspires her to leave the corrupt town.<br /><br />Yes, the town, like most of human society is corrupt.  And yes the average man in the street is cowardly and without the will to defend himself.  It is only the ubermensch, that rare breed celebrated in the works of the German philosopher, who has the skill, the strength and the will to bend events to his liking and to take on those who would use violence to achieve their ends.<br /><br />So what Eastwood does here in his second directorial effort (following Play Misty for Me, 1971) is to diverge from Leone's formula.  While there is some very funny and intentionally ridiculous dialogue in such films as, for example,  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966), or For a Few Dollars More (1965) or A Fistful of Dollars (1964), there is little that is funny, intentionally or otherwise in High Plains Drifter.  Furthermore, whereas Leone just wanted to make a buck and saw that tough-minded heroes or anti-heroes involved in action-filled revenge plots was a good way to do it, Eastwood is interested in also making a philosophic (and perhaps political) statement.  We are degenerate, we humans, he is saying, except for those rare individuals who take the law into their own hands, make their own rules, and through superior skill and bravery, make their own luck and create their own reality, as does his stranger.<br /><br />In this film there is also an element of the supernatural, or so it would appear.  The stranger \\"sees\\" in his head the whipping of a past sheriff of the town.  Perhaps it comes from the mind of the dwarf Mordecai (very well played by Billy Curtis, by the way) who witnessed the tortured death while hiding under the saloon.  At any rate, the stranger shows that he is just as handy with the whip himself as he is with his six-gun.<br /><br />By all means see this for an early look at the work of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.  You will not be bored I can assure you.  But don't invite the girl friend over.  If there was ever an anti-\\"chickflick,\\" this is it.tatement.

0786915749|2.0|I first read the Dragonlance Chronicles when I was a Dungeons and Dragons-playing teenager.  Back then I would have said this was an excellent series, but I was looking at it through the biased eyes of a D&D fan. <br /> <br />Twenty years later, I have read them again for purely literary pleasure, and I have to say, these books stink.  As others have pointed out, it isn't really the plot, nor the setting that fails, but the writing and the characterization.   <br /> <br />If you are a fan of cliches and overdramatic dialogue, this series is for you.  I write this review to agree with what others have said in complaint of this series.  I suspect that those who rated this book 4 or 5 stars have never read Tolkien, M.Z. Bradley, or Tad Williams. <br /> <br />If you are a D&D fan and want some light reading or background to a Dragonlance campaign, then read these books. <br /> <br />If you are looking for serious and well-written fantasy, pass over this series.
B000000Y27|5.0|Wes Montgomery. The world's greatest jazz guitarist. Many copied his octive style that made him so unique. He played all of this, even at killer tempos, and only used his thumb!  <br /> <br />In my opinion, this was Wes Montgomery's first real important album. He displays everything here. His big swinging sense, his thumb technique and the beautiful octive sound.  <br /> <br />This is the epitome of great jazz guitar. Wes, himself, the virtososo he was, played all of these tunes with such ease. If he was alive today, and was making these wonderful recordings, I'd be out getting all those great albums.  <br /> <br />Wes does a great job covering Sonny Rollins' Airegin, my favorite Sonny Rollins composition of all. Wes even does a great job at Gone With The Wind. Perhaps only Dave Brubeck's version can compare.  <br /> <br />There is no irony in the title of this album. And if anyone has any doubt about that, just listen to this album. Wes displays it all here.
0156029065|4.0|This is a book for the lover of literary fiction.  For one who can appreciate an alternative story for an historical event, as well as fantastical stories about faraway lands, and creatures whose faces are in their torsos.  Eco is likely one of the most learned of contemporary writers and the encyclopedic historical detail he puts into his novels and non-fiction prose bears witness to this fact.  In Baudolino, a self-professed liar tells the story of his life in a burning city.  Raised by King Frederick; educated in France; pilgram to the kingdom of Prester John, Baudolino tells his story such that we want it all to be true. But we are sure it is not. <br /> <br />That's all i have to say.  Enjoy.
B000005H7D|5.0|This is the classic recording by tenor saxophonist, legend, John Coltrane. The one that put him on the map. He had a couple of good session dates before this one, but it wasn't until Trane released Blue Train, that people saw that, after being a vitol member in the Miles Davis Quintet, he could go out on his own, and make pivitol recordings.  <br /> <br />He beautifully demonstrates his big huge warm style here, and with the help of his cohorts, Lee Morgan, a growing trumpet figure, on trumpet, Curtis Fuller, on trombone, the underrated Kenny Drew, on piano, one of the most recorded jazz bassits of all time, Paul Chambers, and the legendary Philly Joe Jones, on the drums.  <br /> <br />The cd, of course, opens up with the classic, Blue Train. Trane arranged all the horn parts pretty well, as every horn man is playing in a different key. Good harmonies!!! Moments Notice, is such a beautiful song, and Lazy Bird is great.  <br /> <br />Coltrane plays great with Lee Morgan and Curtis Fuller. They all blend and match eachother beautifully. This was a classic recording 45 years ago, and it still is today. Coltrane will go down in the book, for being one of the most important saxophone figures, in jazz, of all time!
B000050X31|1.0|It is my firm belief that `opera' is an artistic medium that combines the arts: music, literature, theatre, dance, architecture, etc. In this respect one should be careful not to underestimate any of these components that make up a good performance. Now everything what we see (the movement, the costumes, the stage settings, etc.) is equally as important as what we hear. This is the nature of opera. If you go to the opera merely to \\"see\\", than you are a theatre-lover, if you go merely to \\"listen\\", than you are a music-lover. Enjoying \\"opera\\" is in fact, enjoying both. <br /> <br />Most of these reviews at Amazon tend to focus at the musical aspect of the performance and I partly concur with much of what has been said in this regard. The quality of the singers is first rate and their interpretations show great quality. I am not a big fan of Levine (his Mozart is to broad, almost like Wagner, and the choice of his tempi is far too slow), but one cannot say that this man (although called \\"The Conducting Swine\\") is not a great musician. His approach is not a historical one (like e.g. Harnoncourt) and Mozart might not recognize his own musical intentions in this performance, but that is Levine's choice and I'm willing to leave it as what it is.  <br /> <br />So, musically, this performance is all right (though not `splendid'). Theatrically, however, this performance rates below zero. This is the reason why I won't give it more than one star. The Metropolitan tried to make a conservative Die Zauberflte and so they followed Schikaneder's (E. Schikaneder wrote the text-book of this opera) stage-directions to the letter. I don't know why. If you don't try to make a historical recreation of the opera in the music, you shouldn't try so hard to do it on stage. From a theatrical point of view this performance is un-inspirational, unimaginative, dull and banal, even laughable. Let me illustrate this point by giving two examples. <br /> <br />The very first scne shows us a tackystage, with a few make-belief tries and rocks and a small temple in the middle. Tamino runs on stage and hides behind one of the rocks. Than the snake - although here it seems to be some sort of dragon - comes up. This is by far the most embarrassing snake I have ever seen. You can actually see the guy inside this suit. How can anyone be afraid of that, I shall never know. And the smoke coming out of his nostrils was way over the top.  <br /> <br />Another example is the scne where the Queen of the night sings her second aria (Die Hlle Rach). The acting performance of K. Battle kills the entire moment, even though she is not singing. In the role of Pamina, she is supposed to be listening to the words of her mother (The Queen) She makes a few funny faces and some stupid gestures and repeats them over and over again. Either she is the worst actress ever, or she hasn't been properly coached by the director. Being a good singer is not an excuse for being a bad actress. If she cannot act, she shouldn't perform on stage. She could do recordings, concerts, recitals, etc. but not a fully staged production of an opera. What we see is just as important as what we hear.  <br /> <br />This production put too much emphasis on the fairy-tale-aspect of this opera; and I don't mean the eighteenth-century-German fairy-tale tradition (Wieland, Gellert, etc.), but the childish one, that could only have been done by an American opera Company. The philosophy of the Enlightenment, inherent in this opera, is nowhere taken seriously and the Masonic truths (Mozart and Schikaneder were masons) who were an undeniable source for the opera were left undeveloped.  <br /> <br />In conclusion: The production by The Metropolitan is a very childish approach to Die Zauberflte and nothing more.
0316096199|4.0|\\"Lucky\\" is a stunning, grueling account of the rape Sebold experienced as a college freshman. Sebold spares herself and us no detail in describing the rape and its devastating aftermath on her and everyone she knew. It is an incredibly courageous and honest piece of work, and, in my view, vastly superior to the much-lauded \\"Lovely Bones,\\" which I thought spun out of control in the second half. Sebold is unsparing of herself and her dysfunctional family, but the one area she leaves unexplored is the end of an important friendship with a college classmate who is also raped, probably in retaliation for Sebold's decision to press charges against her attacker. This is a minor issue in a work that is a must-read.
B0000DZ3IG|1.0|If you are looking for the fresh, bouncy, cheerful music that you heard in the movie, this isn't it!  Instead of a \\"soundtrack\\" this is a retread.  Even the extras by Billy Mack and Joanna Anderson don't have the life that you heard in the movie.  Don't buy this CD!!!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|When it first came out in the theaters, I saw a few commercials, but honestly, I thought it was just a joke movie. I was skeptical about the whole plot and humor it was talking about. The first time I watched it, I only saw about one half of it, the second time I only saw about one half of it again, but the third time I watched it all the way through. The part where he dances in front of the whole auditorium is priceless. My friends and I laugh hysterically everytime. Everyday, we recite lines from it on a regular basis. I even suggested the theme of our winter semi-formal to be Napoleon Dynamite, but nobody took me seriously, so now we're having one of our spirit days be ND and 80's Day. Anyways, the movie had a lot of funny parts in it and NOT just the part where they're riding on a bike and when the kid slams him into a locker. If you watch the deleted scenes, the kickball scene is the BEST. It's so hilarious, you won't be able to NOT laugh. It has a plot, even if it is very faint, and the music is funny in its own way. Next time I'm at the store, there's no doubt that I'm going to be buying Napoleon Dynamite. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE to anyone ready for a good laugh and a good time with friends.

B0000025RI|5.0|As weird as Michael Jackson has become and all the allegations aimed at him. This is a brilliant album. Slick production and unusual lyrics from an r&b singer. BILLIE JEAN is the standout track with its heavy rhythm & MOODY Sound. Beat It is very catchy and Thriller is well produced and great to dance to. Will Michael Jackson ever recover from his tarnished reputation? Who knows, but this was his finest hour. And its still the worlds best selling record.
B000005JA8|5.0|Probably the most difficult \\"pop\\" album ever released, Trout Mask Replica is an incredible experience. In my opinion, some moments are merely grating (such as Pena), but the incredible musicianship, fantastic songs, and the Captain's vision ultimately triumphs.<br /><br />Several of the tracks are among the most impressive rock-oriented music ever. Ella Guru, Hair Pies 1 and 2, Moonlight On Vermont, Pachuco Cadaver, My Human Gets Me Blues, Sweet Sweet Bulbs, Dali's Car, Dachau Blues, When Big Joan Sets Up, Hobo  Chang Ba, The Blimp, and Steal Softly Thru Snow are quite simply the best rock music ever. Had these been released with the a cappella \\"The Dust Blows Forward...\\" and \\"Orange Claw Hammer\\" as a single disc album, it would easily be the most powerfully sustained artistic statement in rock history. Easily.<br />That's certainly not to slight the other tunes included on Trout. It's just that, to my ears, they don't have the same oceanic force of inspiration that the ones listed above do.<br /><br />Not to sound elitist, but if you mostly listen to radio fare, you will almost certainly hate Trout Mask Replica on the first listen. Trout is unique in that it is essentially the vision of a visual artist realized by some incredible musicians. In other words, it's by and large not \\"musical\\" in the traditional sense; i.e., the guitars are rarely in the same key, the bass is played like a lead guitar, and the drums are a force of nature.<br /><br />Despite first appearances, however, there is an incredible amount of discipline here. Listen to the incredibly tight playing on Ella Guru and Steal Softly Thru Snow, for instance. The interlocking brilliance of Bill Harkleroad's and Jeff Cotton's guitars on Pachuco Cadaver, Moonlight On Vermont, Dali's Car, and Hair Pie Bake 2. Harkleroad's playing on Hair Pie Bake 2 is stunning! There's also Mark Boston's brilliantly eccentric bass playing on Sweet Sweet Bulbs, which sounds like McCartney on steroids. And to top it all off is John French's stunning drumming. He is an absolute dynamo throughout, and rock music's most underrated drummer.<br /><br />Of course, this wouldn't have been possible without Captain Don, and although I think that the Magic Band was essential in realizing the arrangements of the music, this album crystallizes the essence of Don Van Vliet's artistic vision. Needless to say, as a singer he has no peers. He is simply modern music's best vocalist, as well as rock's only worthy Dada lyricist.<br /><br />High marks also for the best album cover in the history of the world!<br /><br />If you're new to Beefheart, this is probably not the best place to start. Safe As Milk and Clear Spot are much more approachable, yet still have that wild streak of brilliance that belonged to Captain Don. You'd be best served, probably, to check those out first.

B000002U82|1.0|I don't know what was happening with music fans in 1973, but there must've been a low point in music history going on or something. Pink Floyd are without question the most overatted band EVER. I have listened to this album several times and tried to like it. But I can't, it stinks to be frank. Even the supposedly classic song \\"Money\\". Is very annoying to listen to more than once, maybe its that unbearable sax solo or the off-key rhythm section and cash register sounds. But to me this album is very poor and vastly overatted

B000001F2X|5.0|Yep' I had this on vinyl when it came out -70's? SO long ago!! and as previous reviewer says , there is no Katy Kool Lady track on  c.d. version .. but a mystery track  good tho' it is! . so where IS Katy Kool Lady?  All Cale stuff of this period is absolutely fantastic . Cale Fan . DB .
B00005221M|5.0|I would like to thank James Luckard, one of the previous reviewers, for mentioning that the uncut, theatrical version of this film is available from amazon.co.uk.    This is one of a handful of films of which I cannot get enough.  I was glad to buy the director's cut and get the extra scenes, but I was very disappointed that some of my favorite lines were removed, and could not figure out why Michael Mann would want to tinker with this masterpiece.    My VHS tape has been watched many times, and won't last forever, but thanks to Mr Luckard I no longer have to concern myself with that.  We have multisystem VCR's and DVD players because we buy a lot of British and French material, so I have ordered another copy of this wonderful film, and will now have the best of both worlds.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Not that there's anything wrong with Friends or Frasier, but finally the 1990s flagship show of NBC - Seinfeld - has made it to the immortality of DVD! Yes! I kid you not, my friend!<br /><br />Seasons 1-3 are now available (and Season 4 and the rest of the Nutty 9 are also soon on the way), and besides some behind the scenes stuff, they even also threw in some audio commentary by the cast and producers, plus even more extras! And all this sheer heaven is presented in stunning remastered stereo and even HIGH DEFINITION digital video! Holy fancy Moses!<br /><br />Now that this monumental decade-long epic has arrived, it's doubtful that there will ever be anything of this magnitude to report here again. EVER!
B00003CXRM|5.0|What a wonderful film. The cast, setting, and story was executed to perfection. This film has humor, historical context, great cinimatography, and an awesome cast. Very enjoyable from begining to end. One of my personal favorites. A must see.
0783226063|5.0|Yes, yes... I'm a huge fan of the books.  Yes, yes... this is not a perfect adaptation.  Yes, yes... the special effects are not fantastic, in fact, they are quite laughable.  However, given that this movie was made in 1984 and the spirit of the book is still present, I'm still going to give this a 5 star rating. <br /> <br />For those who have no read the book(s):  There are going to be a lot of things you are not going to understand.  Reading the book would be helpful.  Otherwise, I can understand why some might find the movie confusing and even a little bit boring.  Alas, it is the fine points of the book that makes the story interesting and fascinating.  The movie gives those small details no justice.  I would highly suggest watching it with somebody who has read the books so they could point out a couple of these details to you, fill in missing aspects from the book, and answer your questions.  If you have no such person among your collection of friends, I would actually recommend you skip the movie and read the book(s) first yourself. <br /> <br />To those who have read the book:  A lot is left out.  I would have loved to have seen Patrick Steward take a knife to the neck of Paul's mother.  The stilsuits are not complete as a lot of moisture would be permitted to leave the body with what is depicted in this movie.  Even the emphasis on the preciousness of water is barely focused on (no shocking scene of Stilgar spitting at Duke Leto or the shock of the Freman at Paul giving up water to the dead for Jamis).  However, as I stated earlier, the spirit of the book is still there.  It is still fun to watch even after reading the books.  There are a few changes made (for instance, it is completely different how Paul takes the water of life) but those changes are kept to a minimum (thank goodness). <br /> <br />Boy, I could list many, many things that I wish could have been there.  I'm going to watch the newer (4.5 hour) version and I'm sure much will still be missing.  However, I think it would take a 10 hour movie to get it all in there and then it would just come across as being extremely boring.  So, for a 2 hour long movie I think this did a good bit of justice to the book.
B000002UB3|5.0|When you attack an album like this, it is not the album that is on trial, but the attacker. I'm 22, and not a teen, but I'm still a kid, for all intensive purposes.  I don't give many albums 5 stars, but this album works hard to earn just that. This album is one of my favorites, not only because of the sentimental value the album had in my musical upbringing, but because I later learned why it had been referenced so often.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra once called \\"Something\\" one of the most perfect love songs ever written. Music teachers (like my first) teach \\"Octopus's Garden\\" to children because of the simple, but effcient, melody exercise it provides. The album itelf is a collage of varied and diverse material, all providing enough cohesion to fit on what would be the last Beatles' recording. Paul McCartney actually played the drums on \\"Come together\\", one of the most innovative and immediately identifiable drum parts in rock's recording history. The cover of this album has been emulated countless times.  These songs shine for their sweet simplicity, and yet their complex musical value has made them musically valid for decades. Aside from being one of the most influential albums of the 20th centruy, this album, like many Beatles albums, broke new ground and made a lush contribution to the music world. Much of what we can love about today's music owes a great debt to albums such as Abbey Road. Dozens of artists, like Muddy Waters, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Jimi Hendrix, Pavement, Smashing Pumpkins, just to name a meager few, have all cited the Beatles as some of their biggest influences. If you haven't heard this album, or experienced it in its entirety, I invite you to. It's an investment, and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />If an album has been praised for a long time, you should afford it a listen. It's fine to dislike something and say so, but to insult what you don't understand, and then claim your generation doesn't appreciate it, is only revealing to everyone what a pissant you are. Age doesn't matter, this is an album for all times, for all ages.to everyone what a pissant you are. Age doesn't matter, this is an album for all times, for all ages.
B0002OERI0|5.0|As an adult listener, I agree with the others who don't give a damn whether or not some 13-year old considers Green Day punk or not, or whose Mom or Dad don't approve of the band's political opinions. This is a great CD with some amazing songs -- the first few in particular, and some of the others as well.  Jesus of Suburbia might bring to mind memories of The WHO, the Clash, maybe even Queen -- but this is better.  It's more sophisticated than the band's earlier releases, but still edgy (even more so) and just great to listen to LOUD.  And what a pleasure to hear some great guitar on the radio again, and bass, and drums -- Highly recommended -- give it a try.
0393312836|5.0|I have a peculiar trait of not reading what i am told to read. When the teacher tells us to read sheakspeare for homework, that is the one thing i dont do. I read quite often, and I DO IT FOR PLEASURE AND ENJOYMENT.  This book was one of those books that I would pick up apposed to doing my calc. I enjoyed this book very much, It tickled my mind more than whatever I wasnt reading in school would have, I guarentee it. This book brought to the light issues of free will, governemnt, humanity, and morals, or lack there-of. Kindof funny isnt it. Morals. I read this around election time and morals seem to be the hot topic, especially with the right wingers. People seem to think government can improve peoples morals, what a load. Lets take a look at alex's world. His government is the epitomy of controlling ones feeling and morals, but lo and behold is Alex a nice person? What about his droogies? NO. Even with alex's transformation at the end he is miles from what we would call acceptable today. Let us not forget that the goal of being \\"moral\\" is to provide an enviornment where an alex must change, not to change an alex. I think we are forgetting that, and this book is a good reminder. And if you disagree with me then you are wrong.
B0002X314C|2.0|I was very upset when I got this cd I was so happy that finally  after being heard all over kanye west's cd he had a cd. His voice is so great but the songs didn't match his voice they were too slow and boring. Even if he kept the songs at a slow pace they should have had more soul to it. I suggest to everyone if they want to hear a good new artist to purchase Teedra Moses new cd.
0312995423|1.0|I am not a fan of Dan Brown, but I picked this book up at the airport for a quick read on the plane. It was more than disappointing. Anyone who has any kind of knowledge about the history of cryptography or mathematics will know from the start that the premise is bogus. The writing reminds me of a TV show. You can practically hear the music swell at a tense or touching moment. I found the characters to be thin and unbelievable ... charactures rather than characters.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for escapism and don't want to think too hard about what you're reading, then you'll enjoy this. But if you have any type of science or literary background, you probably won't enjoy this book.
0679720200|4.0|This French classic strikes a refreshing chord with a new generation. Mr. Mersault encounters the horrors of life with a malaise of the unconscious. Camus brings together the complexities of life with simplicity and crisp language use (now seen by American eyes with recent better translations). The Stranger is an important work for the open, introspective reader. While Mersault comes across as pathetic, empty and lifeless, the listening reader will find himself in its pages.
0385335482|4.0|I too was thinking this book would not live up to the hype.  One third of the way into the book I was hoping there would be more to the book than someone charging her credit card every 10 minutes. Two thirds of the way into the book I was thinking this is cute, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over 33. And in the final third I was hooked.  I have bought two others from the Shopaholic series and can't put them down.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I have.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I agree, it's becoming overrated but Napolean Dynamite is still a fantasticly funny flick.  The guy that said Dodgeball was better than this must be high on something, because this movie kills it.  Sure it's simple, and doesn't really have a plot, but it's random humor and hilarious characters make up for it.  Napolean Dynamite is looking to be a cult classic just weeks after its DVD release and once you see it, you'll know why.

B00008CLOA|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever made period.  It is without a doubt Pink Floyd's best work and will forever be a masterpiece.

B00061QK20|5.0|I have read many reviews of this film on internet forums. I am sad, but not surprised, to find that numerous reviewers have labeled \\"senseless plot\\" and \\"poor character development\\" as major faults of this film. I believe this is where the cultural gap came into play. It is often difficult to translate select elements and dialogues of an Asian film in a manner that Western audience would understand. (Try reading a book of traditional chinese poetry translated into English! Yikes!)  <br />The subtitles for this film have done a decent job doing this. Still many things don't appear crystal clear. I highly recommend watching this movie twice before you complain of its plot problems.  <br /> <br />Also, I have read quite a few reviews criticizing the scenes of fighting on bamboo and on top of the water in both this movie and Crouching. I would like to add that these are very traditional fighting sequences in Chinese Kung-Fu movies. Supposedly they demonstrate the power of a warrior's Kung to step atop anything, even ridiculously soft and yielding substances.  <br />It may not appeal to your logic (why on earth would they fight atop trees when they can do it on the ground?), nevertheless, it is an essential element that allevates the magic power of Kung-Fu masters as presented on films. You really are missing the point if you are fussing over the logical explaination behind these scnes, for much of Kung-Fu is defying our logical perception of physical limitations.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|It's painfully obvious that the last page of 5 star reviews were written by the same loser, who kept getting new screen names and writting stupid 2 line reviews.  Here's the truth though.  Van Helsing sucks.  It's terrible.  It's no Mummy, or even Scorpion King.  This movie is so bad that you have to question the sanity of the people who created it.  On the upside some things that were supposed to be serious came out so cheesy and stupid that you had to laugh.  (Like when Van Helsing turns into a warewolf and howls.) <br /> <br />Overall, steer clear of this garbage.  It's 2 hours that you can never have back.

B00013RC8O|5.0|This is a must for any racing collector ! <br />I have been looking for it for for years and found it here and scooped it up! <br />I'll never sell it, now that I have in my collection!
1400032717|1.0|This book is very very very boring. The greatest thing about the book is the way the author shows you how the boy thinks. However, the characters, plot, and ending all make you want to fall asleep in the middle of the book. <br />
B00006879E|5.0|I can't believe that anyone into this music genre could possibly think that this is a less than awesome album. I had medium feelings about \\"Harder to Breath,\\" the very first single they put out, thinking it was probably a one-hit wonder song. But after getting the entire album I realized how good Maroon 5 really is. I love that I can just put this disc in the player and not have to skip around. I love the whole thing. If you're into pop rock, you'll love \\"Songs About Jane.\\" If you're not, then why even write a review? Five stars most definitely.
0064400557|5.0|This is one of the best books of all time.  It is so touching and a classic story of friendship.  I read it to my youngest girl when she was three.  Now she is twelve and has read it about fifteen times.  She loves it as much as I do.  Highly recommended for everyone.
0446677450|3.0|This book was by and large a waste of money. It is very poorly written and extremely repetitive. It makes a big deal out of repeating the idea that the way to get rich is not through going to school, studying hard, getting a good job, and working. It presents the idea that the way to wealth is somehow through leaving the job and work behind, and thinking and investing as if one were rich. It does not however tell people how to build a stake large enough to begin investing with. It does not tell you what to do if you are not born rich to begin with.<br /><br />There are principles laid down on how to act in order to become rich. It does not by the way occur to the authors that there might be some other goals in life beside wanting to be rich. They do not discuss that issue at all.<br /><br />They speak about the importance of knowing accounting, investing, of knowing how to read an income statement and balance sheet. I believe that this is a good point and it would be wise for most of us to know how to do this. They caution against the kind of high- living and excess spending which means the person is permanently in a rat - race to keep their head above water. This too makes sense. Very common sense.<br /><br />They do not in any way take into consideration the possibility that there are different kinds of characters who might need different kinds of financial paths and advice. For them everyone is someone who first and above all wants to be very rich.<br /><br />I found this book an insult to not only my intelligence but to my basic sense of what is important in life. I know the book will make its already rich co-authors more rich. I doubt if it will enrich anyone else.<br /><br />Had I known the bottom line on this book before I read it I would probably have never bought it.
0375422307|2.0|Persepolis follows the life of the author as she is growing up in Iran amid wars and uprisings. Told in graphic novel form, it reminded me a lot of Maus, the only other graphic novel I had read before. Personally, I liked Maus better, but this could be because I read both parts of Maus, while I have yet to get my hands on the second volume of Persepolis. In its own right, it did teach me lots about Iran that I didn't know before, and I was interested enough to want to pick up the follow-up. Maybe I'll like it more after I get the whole story. <br />
B0002IU988|3.0|As you probably know, this is the original Creed line-up minus Scott Stapp, the lead singer. I love the new singer. I was getting tired of Stapp's messianic style. Anyway, as for Alter Bridge, I really wanted to like this album. I love \\"Open Your Eyes.\\" I think it was the best rock single of 2004. However, the rest of the album is a bunch of generic metal riffs that get really old, really quick. I don't understand...Open Your Eyes is sooooo good -- the guitar, the vocals, the melody, the chemistry of the band -- all perfect. The rest of the album is mediocre at best. The good news is that there's real potential with this band, and I hope to see it in the next album. They just need to be more creative and more inspiring. This just isn't an album that I would play again and again in the future. However, I am glad to see a band with four men who act and look like men (as opposed to a lot of the emo bands today). There's something refreshing about the Open Your Eyes music video...no whining, no crybaby lyrics, no effeminate gestures, no complaining about responsibility. Go to the Alter Bridge official site and see the video if you haven't.
0698119347|5.0|This book review is for Stormbreaker by Anthony Horowitz. This book is 192 pages long and is a Mystery book. Stormbreaker won a Rebecca Caudill award in 2001. I think this book is an awesome book. I enjoyed it a lot.  <br />This story is about a boy named Alex Rider who is 14 and lived with his uncle, Ian Rider until he found out he died in a car accident. But when he found his uncle's car in a junkyard, he saw bullet holes in the windshield and on the headrests of the driver's seat. He knew now that it was no accident and that someone murdered him. After the funeral, Alex follows a man that he met at the funeral to where his uncle worked. His uncle worked at a bank. Then Alex realizes that it wasn't a bank. Alex met the man from the funeral and found out his name was Alan Blunt. Blunt told him all about his uncle being a secret agent for M16 and that his uncle died in a top secret mission. So Blunt convinces Alex to be apart of M16. Then Alex trains with other agents in survival courses. After a few weeks Blunt tells him to go on a mission going undercover as a boy named Felix and see what's happening. Alex then meets a woman named Mrs. Jones. Mrs. Jones introduces him to a man named Smithers, who makes gadgets for missions and so he gives some to Alex. When he gets to the place for the mission, he meets Herod Sayle, Mr. Grin, and Nadia Vole. They let him try the Stormbreaker, a computer program with any subject in it like Math, Science, French, etc. After that, he heard that something important was coming at 1:30am. So he snuck out at midnight and made it to the back of a truck that was going to the place with the important thing. He saw a submarine and Yassen Gregorovich, the Russian contract killer who murdered his uncle. Then Alex found out that they put a smallpox virus in it so when the prime minister starts the Stormbreaker, it will kill thousands of schoolchildren. Alex makes it on time and stops the prime minister from clicking it. But Herod Sayle isnowhere to be seen. After getting congratulated by Blunt and Mrs. Jones, he gets out of the building. Then a car pulls over right in front of him.  Herod Sayle comes out and points a gun at Alex. He tells Alex to get in the car. He took him to the rooftop of a building, a helicopter came. Herod Sayle pointed the gun at Alex. Then there were two gunshots. Then...... You have to read the book to see what happens next. <br />The author's ideas were great. Like all the gadgets he made up. I liked the Game Boy Color gadget. That was awesome. It can find things and send things. If you put in He had other cool gadgets. <br />The settings were great. Horowitz put a lot of detail in them. You could easily paint a picture in you head of these places.  <br />This book was one of the best books I've read. It was spectacular! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. I know they would enjoy it.  <br />
B0002ZDVF4|5.0|Matt Damon (Gerry, the upcoming Brothers Grimm) returns as  Jason Bourne once again and this time he is being called out of hiding by a new enemy. When his girlfriend, played by Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), gets killed, he takes matters into his own hands and hunts down the people who want him and who are responsible for her death. Twists and excellent action scenes take this one to the max. Paul Greengrass knows how to create a good actioner and yes we all know the books are better but give it a rest will ya, this is a great ride. Joan Allen (The Contender, The Crucible), Brian Cox (Troy, Adaptation), Marton Cskostas (Triple X), Julia Stiles (Down To You, Save The Last Dance) and Karl Urban (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, Ghost Ship) are among the great cast. Urban plays the evil assassin who killed Damon's woman. Favorite scene would be the last action scene with Damon and Urban in the cool car chase scene. This is one Damon fans wont be dissapointed with. Hey at least he's having a better career then Ben Affleck..anyway I recommend you go see it, it's better then Van Helsing. There's shades of Chris Cooper (Adaptation, Seabiscuit) in this movie <br />
B0000AQVCL|1.0|Listening to wholly derivative albums like this one depresses me.  I get into this funk in which I keep thinking, \\"Are there no genuinely new, exciting, worthwhile ideas in popular music anymore?\\"      New ideas -- and most importantly, new ideas that are actually worth listening to -- seem to be woefully few and far between these days.  Jet has none.  They are the music equivalent of a Xerox machine:  They scan all the originals, copy them, and the copies always come out more faded and less perfect than the originals.    I had a thought the other day about how today's bands continue to cop from '60s and '70s classic rock, aping (or worse, simply directly sampling) the originals, bludgeoning them in the process.  And I thought, how interesting that today's bands copy from music that was new 30 to 40 years ago.  But back in the '60 and '70s, were pop bands copying from music of the '20s and '30s?  Of course not.  Heck, even within the same decade, there were vast musical changes -- the popular music of '68 is oceans away from that of '60, or even that of '64.  Conclusion?  These people were CREATING.    Advice to new bands:  Absorb all of your influences, go ahead and use them as foundations, but then BUILD something genuinely new and unique from there.
B0006B29WA|5.0|I was originally going to give this album four stars, but then I listened to the bonus disc.  Believe me, the material on the bonus disc is better than much of the album material.  It's less produced and more raw, and gives you a better feel for the actual talents of the band. <br />The album itself is a cute and fun collection of some of the best pop music I've heard in a long time.  It's got a unique sound, it's got a beat and you can dance to it.  Yes, the album does sound like it is one really long song, but it's a good song. <br />Stand-out tracks are \\"Auf Achse\\", \\"Darts of Pleasure\\", \\"40'\\" and of course the singles. <br />But really, the album doesn't do this band justice.  It's good, but the bonus material really makes you believe they're more than just a shallow pop band.  And I personally think they are.

B000002UAR|5.0|Coming between Rubber soul, the first album in which they started to change their style, and Sergeant Pepper, this album was very important in the Beatles' career. It included three great songs (Taxman, Love you to, I want to tell you) by George Harrison, showing his progress as a songwriter. Even so, all the really important songs here are by John Lennon and Paul McCartney.<br /><br />Unlike some Beatles albums, this one actually includes a hit single - the double-sided Yellow submarine / Eleanor Rigby, which topped the UK charts. This was somewhat unusual at the time, since singles were the big sellers and were usually left off albums. Got to get you into my life was a UK top ten hit for Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers, for whom the song was written. None of the other tracks became big UK hits at the time but several of the songs have been covered frequently, especially Here there and everywhere. Emmylou Harris had a minor UK hit with it in the seventies - she also covered For no one and Doctor Robert, two other songs here<br /><br />Of the remaining songs, my favorite is Good day sunshine, but I'm only sleeping, She said she said, And your bird can sing and Tomorrow never knows are all of a high quality.<br /><br />If you are a Beatles fan, this album ought to be in your collection. It's a classic

It's actually worse than King Arthur and Alexander. Shame on you. Run away.<br /><br />Not only is Orlando Bloom the worst new actor of his generation, but Brad needs to lay off the Botox.

B000696PWC|5.0|The first CD contains Kylie's hits from her time with Stock, Aitken and Waterman while the second CD shows how Kylie has progressed since then, up to and including her last UK hit of 2004 (I believe in you), which made number two (behind Band Aid 20's re-recording of Do they know it's Christmas) in the UK chart.<br /><br />On the first CD, you can hear Kylie's UK chart-topping duet with Jason Donovan, Especially for you, as well as her many solo hits from the period such as I should be so lucky (the kind of song you either love or hate - I love it),  Je ne sais pas porqoui (an English language song despite it's chorus line), Got to be certain, Hand on your heart, Better the devil you know and Wouldn't change a thing. There are a few covers and it was two of these - Locomotion (the Little Eva sixties classic) and Tears on my pillow (the Little Anthony fifties classic) - that originally aroused my interest in Kylie's music. They are both brilliant - indeed, Locomotion provided Kylie with her only huge American hit during this period. As to Tears on my pillow, I've heard several versions. Kylie should be proud of her cover, which gave her another huge hit. Give me just a little more time and Celebration (Kool and the gang) provide further evidence of Kylie's ability to revive oldies and take them high up the charts.<br /><br />The oldest major UK hit on the second CD is Confide in me, a brilliant song that Kylie took to number two in the UK charts. However, subsequent releases were somewhat less successful until the release of the album Light years (but see later for my comments about Where the wild roses grow). By now her style of music had evolved somewhat. Kylie returned to the big time with four hits beginning with Spinning around, which topped the UK charts, and continuing with On a night like this, Kids and Please stay.<br /><br />With her next album, Fever, Kylie made an effort to promote her music in America so her first hit from the album, Can't get you out of my head, became a big hit in America as well as in the UK and her other traditional markets. Like its predecessor, Fever yielded four major UK hits, the others being In your eyes, Come into my world and Love at first sight. The next album, Body language, also yielded four UK hits - Slow, Red blooded woman, Chocolate and Can't start giving you up. It was the last original album prior to this compilation and the single, I believe in you, which completes the compilation.<br /><br />While many will continue to dismiss Kylie (especially her early hits), she is much better than many of the singers she is sometimes compared to, and has proved it by lasting longer than any of her critics thought possible.<br /><br />The most surprising track here is Where the wild roses grow, a duet with Nick Cave in which Kylie sings in an almost whispery style. The song (about a death pact) is typical of Nick's music but very different from Kylie's normal style.

B000000OQF|5.0|What can I say? It's a great album, the first GNR album I listened to. After Led Zeppelin, I didn't think any band could rock as hard as they did. Well, Guns N' Roses came and took an important place in my musical likes. I really liked the evilish My Michelle, the nostalgic Sweet Child O' Mine, and the energetic Rocket Queen. There are great guitar solos and riffs, I mean, it's music at its best, Slash is an amazing guitarrist. Axl has a powerful interpretation in most of the lyrics (there are exceptions). This is one of those CDs that stay tattooed in your mind and you can't stop listening to it. Highly recommended.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Yes, I know the band totally sold out. Mixing the Swedish/Gothenburg-styled melodic guitars into American hardcore is nothing new...except the new trend. And Unearth jumped on it big time, right?    No.    If anyone cared to listen to The Stings Of Conscience, they would have noticed the clear attempts at melody and Gothenburg flair to them. Unearth have been doing this for a while. It just became more pronounced...after a tour with Killswitch Engage and Shadows Fall. God Forbid were also on that tour, and their attempts to incorporate melody landed them flat on their faces. Unearth should be commended for succeeding, among other things.    The other things are that they've crafted a solid album here. Chock full of beautiful guitar melodies, savage vocals, and ridiculous breakdowns upon breakdowns which threaten to shatter your speaker cones, this album is a piece of craftwork. \\"Black Hearts Now Reign\\" was the first single, and has all of the above, plus a call-response tag line which is a perfect hook. \\"False Idols\\" boasts a strong thrash influence, and the groove riff in its center is to die for. \\"Zombie Autopilot\\" sounds like In Flames resurrected, and \\"Endless\\" is a heavier remake of the track off the Endless EP. \\"Aries\\" is a stunning piano/clean guitar piece with whispered screams overlaid to create a longing atmosphere that other bands could only dream to create in the same manner. \\"The Great Dividers\\" and \\"Failure\\" contain great breakdowns.    The album is just packed with amazing songs, and my only complaint is that they sound a little samey, but for an American hardcore group giving the Swedish sound, it's not half bad. And that's pretty good.

This song sends chills down my spine every time I hear the chorus, also very catchy. <br />The End Is Here - 9/10. Solid Ending. <br /> <br />Overall great CD, If you liked Creed, or even if you didn't check this one out. <br />
B00006BNDI|5.0|For the record, Varg Vikernes is a fool. I can't stand him or his beliefs. Luckily, it's his music under examination on here, and not him. He's locked away in a safe place now, and no matter how many times he tells his mother he plans to flee, he can't do it anymore. <br /> <br />This album gets five stars. One for each track, and one for the cover. \\"Det Som Engang Var\\" is a 15-minute work of artistic genius. A majestic epic of melody and wonder, with riffs that can only be described as grim. And the the tortured screams over top? Oh, God...what an effective way of scaring someone off to church to confess! Varg was a unique vocalist, to say the least, who has been imitated to no end to this day. No one will ever match his voice's power or the immense pinnacle of this track. The title track and \\"Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen\\" are minimalist semi-epics, working off a framework of repeating a few riffs or tones at high speed for droning periods to create a hypnotic effect, much akin to minimalist classical music, i.e. Philip Glass. \\"Tomhet\\" is an epic electronic track which mixes the sweep of \\"Det Som...\\" and the simpkistic hypnotism of the second and third tracks. <br /> <br />The album cover is one of the most geniunely chilling pieces of art to ever adorn an album cover. A lonely path curves around a bend where a corpse lays. The crows once pecking at its decaying flesh are scattered. A closer look proves the ingenuity of the cover. The crows are flying away from something, seemingly from some...creature or whatnot which has appeared. The view is from the eyes of what has arrived and spooked the crows. That is art right there. It sums up the mood of the album so exactly it's quite ridiculous. <br /> <br />How could one man conceive such a concept and a work of music? I suppose now the world may never know. Regardless of his political/philosophical silliness, arson, and cold murder. The man sure could create art... <br /> <br />
B000189WO6|5.0|To be true, it needs at least a few listens. But I thought the same about OK Computer, not sure at first but it grows with every listen and turns out to be a sublime classic. <br /> <br />The drums are up front in the mix and this can be off-putting, but try to get past that and listen to the superb guitar and bass work with the vocal range exceptional. <br /> <br />All the best albums tweak your curiosity with the first listen enough to play them again and this is no exception. <br /> <br />Style: Unique, hispanic influences, wierd (unlike most everything else, except their previous work), jamming and full-blown rock-out. <br /> <br />If you are a serious collector of music, this needs to be in your collection, it's in mine ! <br /> <br /> <br />
B00015TOCY|5.0|This was my first ENO recording. While I like \\"Warm Jets...\\" a little better, this one's no slouch...5 stars. Brilliant.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I would like to start off by saying WTF is this! Now I have slipknot's first two cds ok. Now let say there first cd with road runner was great. Next they put there 2nd almost all the songs on there are good. Now slipknot comes out with this one! My friend went out and got. He took it over to my house after he called me up and said it sucks. I told him to bring it over. We sat down and lissioned to it. Just as fast as we put it in we took a knife to it and started to hack it into pieces then burned holes in it. After that we had to put on real music to cleans us from MTV pop stars. You know what next Cory is going to be a gust on TRL and all the members of the BSB. Thats right slipknot is on the same plane as BSB. Don't hate me hate this band for selling out to MTV. Look at bands that have made money by not selling out. Cannibal Corpse's cd bloodtrust was number on the top 200 with no radio or mtv help wow! Slayer has been doing it over 21 years and still havn't sold out. They tried dif thing but you know what Slayer has never sold out! The list could go on.  <br /> <br />Just to end it here don't waste your money on this. If happen to buy it then throw it away or take it back or just do like me or it could be a new dog toy thats about all it's good for. If you don't like what I had to say well thats just too bad! E mail me I don't give a F@#$ it's on my pro. So now for all you people who like this cd then hope your happy that you have just sold your soul to mtv!
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I make a point at avoiding all those big budget Hollywood movies. But after walking through my local video store I decided to give Troy a try.  And I was not disappointed.  The acting was excellent and Eric Bana stood out and at least deserves an Oscar nomination if not a win.  Troy is now one of my favorite movies.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This movie was one I overlooked because of the hype and after seeing \\"Alexander the Great\\", which I felt was a horrible waste of time, I wasn't in a hurry to watch it.  After seeing it on DVD, I was very surprised how great a movie this was.  Everything was very entertaining.  The pace of the movie kept you interested and you didn't feel the time as you did with \\"Alexander\\".  This movie won't be a dissapointment.
B0006A9FMI|2.0|I was anxiously awaiting a sequel to Ghost in the Shell. And when I heard the the long awaited sequel was on its way I could not wait to get my mits on it.<br />But I find that this Movie really falls short of what its predecessor was. And at times is reaching/streaching to be something that it is not. <br />Ghost in the Shell though short was an amazing movie that left a serious imprint on all of its viewers and not only caused as humans to tunr the lookin glass on ourselves and the direction that our technology has taken us.<br />Though Ghost in the Shell 2, has the leangth of a feature film the writing and at times pointless philisophical conversations have the relevance of stoners ramblings. Viewrs could have been spared the metaphorical, and at times painfull mental gymnastics. <br />and though there are many breathtaking scenes that meld both digital animation and traditional animaton into one. There just aren't enough of those Jaw dropping action sequences that had us all watching GITS1 over and over again.<br />the two action scenes in this movie are great but they are so far between and there is so much pointless BS you have to read through between them that chances are you will loose interest and shut this dvd off.<br />This could and should have been a classic instead its only a sequel, and a bad one at that. Though there are several shinging moments the picture is one that is dull and lacks luster overall
B0000A118M|5.0|This is one of those albums that you just gotta have -- whether you are a jazz fan or not, you MUST own Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\". John Coltrane is one of history's greatest saxophonists, and this is arguably his finest moment.    Granted, the sound of this will immediately turn many people off - of the album's 4 \\"parts,\\" the middle 2 are high-energy and may come off as noise if merely heard as background music. The first and last cuts are slower, but not necessarily more accessible.    This is not a jazz album to set the mood at a party or after a date, this is an intense listening experience, but anyone who has been there will surely recommend it.
B000001FTD|5.0|By far - the best album of the Belladonna age. This album hits you in the head and has you begging for more. About all I can add is that `ADI / Horror of it All' is my dark-horse fav. Everyone always talks about the first 5 songs but ADI freaking rules as well.<br /><br />Go buy this album NOW!
B000002MUW|4.0|A subtler and more mature side of Madonna emerged in her 1994 album \\"Bedtime Stories\\".  While several massive radio hits were spawned from the subdued collection of tunes, sadly \\"Bedtime Stories\\" is one of Madonna's weaker efforts.  Without the harshness of \\"Erotica\\" and lacking the lush dance beats of \\"Ray of Light\\", this album falls somewhere in the R&B meets catchy pop category.  Many of the songs here are somewhat unimpressive, and leave much to be desired.  However, the memorable tunes \\"Secret\\" and \\"Take a Bow\\" more than make up for the lackluster of other tracks.   <br /> <br />Despite the fact that this album doesn't offer much inspiration, as a whole it flows very well.  From the opening number to the last note, its musical statement (though sometimes dull and filler) is clear.  Most of the songs on \\"Bedtime Stories\\" deal with the topic of love: longing for it, specifically.  Madonna's emotional conviction is very real here as well.  Her neediness is welcome among such sedated and romantic music.   <br /> <br />Survival: Opening with a catchy bass beat and gentle rhythms, I have always enjoyed the groove of this song.  It's one of the more inspirational tunes on the album, and Madonna's lyrics are heartfelt and honest.  Sadly, this is one of Madonna's weaker opening numbers for an album, though it still has plenty to offer as an individual song.  The accompanying vocals throughout this song will stick in your head for hours. 4/5 <br /> <br />Secret: I can still remember when I heard this song on the radio for the first time.  It's slinky guitars and strong drumbeats make this one of the most mysterious, sexiest and strongest Madonna songs ever.  A very memorable tune, it's simple but effective string arrangement will have you humming along.  Vocally, Madonna sounds superb here: she sounds very natural. 5/5 <br /> <br />I'd Rather Be Your Lover: Musically, this song sounds very similar to the previous track.  Yes, it has a catchy guitar riff and a groovy bass.  But unfortunately, this is one of the many `filler' songs on the album.  Madonna's vocals aren't particularly good here, and for some reason, after about the first two minutes, I find myself growing tired of the rhythm patterns.  It's not quite fast enough to dance to, but not slow enough to really lounge to.  The lyrics make sense, but they sound somewhat desperate. 3/5 <br /> <br />Don't Stop: I'm a big dance remix fan, so I actually liked this song.  It's very repetitive, but more fun than the previous tracks.  This would have made a great remix single.  The topic of this song is simple; get your groove on.  It's very much a good-timey pop tune, with layered drumbeats and light guitars.  Madonna's vocals are sweet and cute, sung with the usual amount of flair and enthusiasm.  Strangely enough, there are many similarities between this song and track 3, but somehow I find this much more appealing.  Go figure. 5/5 <br /> <br />Inside of Me: Given the topic of many of Madonna's songs from her \\"Erotica\\" album, after reading the title for this track, I began to wonder what she had come up with this time.  Especially after hearing her long sighs in the beginning, I got even more curious.  But despite the suggestive title, this song is actually very innocent compared to Madonna's past works.  Again, soft electronic chords and a strong drumbeat carry the tune along.  Madonna's sensitivity here is actually somewhat touching, and although her vocals sound a little breathy, I admire her for showing a softer side. 4/5 <br /> <br />Human Nature: If you are in a sour mood, particularly because of a man, this song is absolutely fabulous to sing along to.  It's almost silly in its crudeness, but at the same time it's very enjoyable.  It's the most hip-hop of all the songs here, with a rolling bass and distorted high pitches, and shows a side of Madonna not really seen before.  She cusses quite a bit, so be warned.  Vocally, there's nothing too impressive here, but Madonna's lyrics are very clever and will hook you. 4/5 <br /> <br />Forbidden Love: Much slower, darker and sexier than the previous tracks, the echoing saxophone and spooky organ will catch your attention here.  Babyface himself accompanies Madonna as she sings longingly.  This is a very romantic song, with a hint of obsession and danger.  The music and lyrics compliment each other very well, and while I myself found nothing too interesting here, the song is extremely well done. 4/5 <br /> <br />Love Tried To Welcome Me: With a Latin feel and swaying strings, musically this is perfect for a candlelit dinner, although the lyrics aren't exactly inviting.  Madonna sings of uncertainty in a relationship, and it's very real.  Her sadness is extremely evident and she sounds beautiful in her lower range.  The entire arrangement of this song is simply divine: the oboe featured throughout the tune is a wonderful addition. 4/5 <br /> <br />Sanctuary: I have always adored this song.  Its mystery, darkness, hollowness; it casts a spell.  Madonna's metaphorical lyrics are thought provoking and exquisitely sung.  With this song, we get a taste of what was to come with her album \\"Ray of Light\\": rich chords and deeper lyrics.  This is a very sensual tune, complete with lazy beats and gentle pulsing electronic instruments.  In a way, this reminds me of \\"Skin\\" from \\"Ray of Light\\".  It's much slower, but seems to have similarities in topic and music style.  It's very much a cross between \\"Skin\\" and \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\" actually. 5/5 <br /> <br />Bedtime Stories: Madonna co-wrote this with one of my favorite artists Bjork, and it's definitely the most interesting song here.  As the chords of \\"Sanctuary\\" gently fade out, the pulsating synth beats of this song pump in, accompanied by syncopated echoes and Madonna's dark vocals.  This is the only real dance track on this album, and is simply stunning.  This has always been my favorite song from \\"Bedtime Stories\\": I can't get enough of the persistent instruments or Madonna's convincing vocals, and the sudden ending is just fantastic.  This reminds me of \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" from \\"Ray of Light\\". 5/5 <br /> <br />Take A Bow: This is one of Madonna's most memorable ballads, and for good reason.  Another song possessing the `Babyface' style of relaxing beats and luscious strings, Madonna gained new fans with this beautiful piece of work.  It's one of the sweetest breakup songs ever, comparing roles in a relationship to roles in a stage production.  The unusual chord arrangements in this song are to be commended, and add a nice amount of unpredictability to a more-often-than-not predictable album. 5/5 <br /> <br />Though there are moments of charm and beauty here, I simply wasn't entirely moved with \\"Bedtime Stories\\".  I'm not saying it's a horrible album; it is far from awful.  It should be included in everyone's Madonna collection, and I would recommend it to anyone that loves sweet R&B grooves or lazy-day music.  But if you crave dance tracks get \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"Music\\", and if you just can't live without classic 1980s pop, get \\"Like a Virgin\\". <br /> <br />Also, if you are nuts over the song \\"Bedtime Stories\\" like I am, I highly recommend checking out Bjork's works!
B0000028M7|5.0|On one hand the power and emotion of this album destroys all notions of metal or heavy music, and creates a uniqueness not found before. On the other hand the searing lyrics and vocals tear up your mind as you bare witness to the mental anguish of this band. This record is unapologetic with its first hand account of drug abuse and the disarray it creates. However, the songs are unquestionably a success because they are so raw, genuine, and intense.<br /><br />Anyone who loves heavy music needs to own this album. Some songs are so powerful, you wonder how the sound doesn't tear through your speakers. Seriously, there are some moments in music history that change things forever. Black Sabbath did it with Master of Reality and Alice in Chains does it here.<br /><br />The first time I heard this album, my brain was obliterated by its intense focus on HEAVY. Not spastic or noise or hardcore - just freaking beautiful. Sweltering guitar, blazing vocals. The emotion of this record is one of those rare achievements in heavy music.<br /><br />It can and will change your life permanently. RIP Layne.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This is the worst film I have seen in a long time and has nothing to recommend it. Pretentious & filled with contempt for it's 'characters' it invites the viewer to mock those it deems beneath them. People treat Napoleon with indifference or hatred, which is the only option he really gives them. Put me in the hate camp.<br />For a better treatment of the same issues see 'Welcome to the Dollhouse\\"
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|\\"Troy\\" is the latest Hollywood effort to bring the epic tale of the Trojan War, which legend places around 1200 B.C., to the screen. Screenwriter David Benioff claims Homer's \\"The Iliad\\" as inspiration, but \\"Troy\\" actually incorporates details from several ancient sources, including \\"The Odyssey\\" and probably the \\"Little Iliad\\" or \\"Sack of Ilion\\", both written a little later. \\"The Iliad\\" only covers a short period of time in the Trojan War, and begins a decade into the conflict. \\"Troy\\" reduces the war to what seems like only a few weeks, keeps most of \\"The Iliad\\"'s principle characters, but changes some of their actions and motivations.<br /><br />\\"Troy\\" maintains the traditional cause of the Trojan War: While on a diplomatic visit to Sparta, in Greece, young Prince Paris of Troy (Orlando Bloom) falls in love with King Menalaus' wife, the lovely Helen (Diane Kruger), who incites the wrath of her husband (Brendan Gleeson) by accompanying Paris back to Troy, across the sea. King Menalaus of Sparta implores his brother, King Agamemnon (Brian Cox), an ambitious and ruthless military leader who has managed to force all of the Greek city-states into a loose confederation under his rule, to raise a Greek army to attack Troy. Agamemnon is only too happy to have an excuse to conquer Troy, but needs Greek's greatest warrior, Achilles (Brad Pitt) to commit to the war. Achilles hates Agamemnon, but when his friend Odysseus (Sean Bean), the clever King of Ithaca, appeals to his vanity, Achilles cannot refuse the  opportunity for immortality that the great war will bring its heroes. In Troy, King Priam (Peter O'Toole) is confident that his city walls will withstand a Greek attack. His eldest son, the great warrior Hector (Eric Bana) is contemptuous of Paris' reckless action, but committed to his family and country all the same. He prepares the army to fight, but fears the worst.<br /><br />Every writer who has told the story of the Trojan War since ancient times has had to invent rationale to explain why all of the Greek city-states would go to war for one cuckolded king, why the Trojans don't just send Helen back to Greece, and why the great warrior Achilles withdraws from the conflict and then changes his mind. \\"Troy\\" changes some of the interactions between the characters and creates its own line of reasoning that makes sense -or as much sense as is necessary- within its own narrative. The character of Briseis (Rose Byrne), a Trojan priestess of the Temple of Apollo who is abducted by the Greeks, is a composite of \\"The Iliad\\"'s Briseis and Chryseis, Achilles' mistress and Agamemnon's captive, respectively. Combining the two women turns out to be a good idea, as she can exacerbate the conflict between Achilles and Agamemnon, provide both men with opportunity to demonstrate their character, and make mercenary, vain Achilles sympathetic. Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund) is another altered character. Traditionally Achilles' close companion, in \\"Troy\\" Patroclus is his young cousin whose eagerness proves fateful.<br /><br />Some viewers will be appalled to see an epic poem turned into epic fluff. \\"Troy\\" is 2 1/2 hours of epic fluff, occasionally bordering on cheese.

The trouble is that, in condensing thousands of written pages into pivotal events and characters only, much of the substance is lost.

1400032717|5.0|<br />The genius of Mark Haddon's book lies in the simplicity of his prose. This is a sophisticated tale by a sophisticated writer yet the story is rendered in such a plain, no-nonsense, deadpan style that you become utterly caught up in a world that you know is not really like that.  <br />   Christopher, the narrator, lives a life free of emotional inflection. There is no double-speak or hidden motives or irony. He lives in a universe that is all surface. The brilliance of the novel lies disparity between what he sees, and what we as readers deduce is going on. Christopher believes that he is trying to solve a mystery. But in fact, it's we the readers who are. It's a double-bluff. A conceit within a conceit. And, nmost importantly, a gripping and wonderful read.  <br />
B00005JN2Z|1.0|There is a lot of justified praise here for this movie.  The acting is good, the plot is interesting, the dialogue is interesting and funny, the music is good, and the film looks great.   <br /> <br />The ending sucks.  I mean, it REALLY sucks bad.  The ending to your average Die Hard movie is harder to predict than this.  This ending is so cheesy, so cliched, and so out of step with the rest of the fils that it flushes the first, quality hour or so right down the toilet.  I was furious, and I strongly reccommend leaving this one on the shelf.

0783225849|5.0|Hitchcock's masterpeice is by far the best mystery film ever made and one of the best movies of all time period. It is superb in every aspect. The score is haunting and suspenseful, one of the best ever recorded. The acting hits dead on. Anthony Perkins is brilliant as Norman Bates; he makes you care about the character and be terrified by him at the same time. His performance brings acting to a whole new level. Janet Leigh is also terrific, as are John Gavin, Vera Miles and the rest of the cast. Joseph Stefano's script is very smart and occasionally witty, and John Russell's cinematography is extraordinary. This film also contains the best story twist ever in a movie, (Marion's death),which is also one of the best deaths on screen ever. All of the great acting, dialogue, and direction lead up to an ending that is still amazing, shocking, and scary 40 years after the film's initial release. The special features are interesting and very insightful. This DVD is an essential addition to any serious movie fan's collection. <br />
B0002DB52M|1.0|It is as if some college freshman said,\\" Hey, I got fifty bucks. Let's make a movie!\\" Don't waste your money! Don't waste your time! This incredibly boring piece of dog crap pretends to be an avant garde, cutting edge, artsy film commenting on the human condition which is being loved by pseudo intellectuals impressed by their own pretentious sophistication. Their attitude is, \\"If you aint smart enough, you won't get it.\\" The fact is, the truly intelligent will see this movie and say the truth. The emperor has no clothes on at all.  <br /> <br />
B000002UAR|5.0|On the eve of the full-fledged psychedelic era, The Beatles released in 1966 the LP Revolver--what was to be their creative peak as the Fab Four (--1967 and beyond wasn't necessarily \\"Fab\\" in the innocuous way the label had been used). The last song of the LP signals what was intended to come in rock music (though perhaps never fully realized), a trippy mantra based on the \\"Tibetian Book of the Dead\\" called \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" It's ironic that the Beatles chose this title as they were probably the central cultural force at the time (perhaps only comparable to Dylan). Yet it was probably the audience such a title was directed--rarely has anything like it been heard before. Only a mere three years earlier Fabian and Brill Building pop was the primary fare to popular audiences. Rock and roll was barely ten years old.    However, 1966 was probably the best year of rock n roll due to the friendly rivalry that existed among the top bands at the time. Revolver was the Beatles answer to Beach Boys \\"Pet Sounds,\\" The Byrds \\"Fifth Dimension,\\" the Stones \\"Aftermath,\\" Love's \\"Da Capo,\\" and Dylan in general. Often the players involved in these various projects showed up at other bands' studios, mapping out paths of distinction. As \\"Pet Sounds\\" is known for its novel use of orchestration, \\"5D\\" is for its Coltrane guitar intensity. Stones fared with Brian Jones' many-faceted instrumentation, Love for its weirdness, and Dylan for his poetry. \\"Revolver\\" is distinguished by its use of backward guitar loops, used on such rockers as \\"She Said, She Said\\" and \\"And Your Bird Can Sing,\\" among others. Revolver also contains rock 'n' roll's first full-fledged raga, \\"Love You To\\"--and, probably one of rock's finest examples of this genre.    Overall, though, unlike the other LPs mentioned here released during rock's top year, the Beatles were unmatched for their ability to supply variety to the fans (though the Lovin Spoonful attempted to match them at this). Besides the songs already mentioned, Revolver also doles out in completely original fashion: music hall (\\"Eleanor Rigby\\"), novelty (\\"Yellow Submarine\\"), ballads (\\"Here There and Everywhere\\" and \\"For No One\\"), social commentary (\\"Taxman\\" and \\"Dr. Robert\\"), and soul (\\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\").    After Revolver, nobody knew what was to come with tomorrow (as nobody ever knows), \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" was the result. Whether the coming years was to live up to the promise of 1966 is debatable. Personally, I believe rock n roll hasn't really progressed since 1968 (except for rap, synth dance, and trends), the nascent year of heavy metal (Punk was already in existence at least in attitude). The peer rivalry that existed in popular music ended with the pulling prior to release of the Beach Boys \\"Smile\\" LP. Well, the finished product of the latter was finally released this year as a Brian Wilson solo project. Compare that with \\"Sgt. Peppers,\\" and imagine what tomorrow may still bring (NOTE: the latter remark is directed at all bandleaders out there). BTW: If you're interested in new sounds of this era, McGuinn, leader of the Byrds, also recently released a solo album of new output similar to the 60s sound of \\"Fifth Dimension,\\" \\"Limited Edition.\\"
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|I don't think there has been another artist with more compilations from various reputable labels then Donna Summer.  There's On The Radio (1979), The Donna Summer Anthology (1993), Endless Summer (1994), and the Journey (2003) in addition to budget compilations like the Millennium Collection, also a recent release.   <br /> <br />So, here's yet another compilation, but, as a Donna Summer fan I highly recommend it if you are looking to replace the previous ones.  First of all, it's a two-disc compilation that is as good, if not better, than the Anthology, except that it loses two of Donna's top 40 hits, 'Cold Love' and 'Who Do You Think You're Foolin'', which, granted, are missed, but you get recent club hits like 'I Will Follow Love' and 'You're So Beautiful', and also 'Love's About To Change My Heart', a 1989 track that rarely gets included on Donna compilations.   <br /> <br />The version of 'Love to Love You Baby' is not the truncated version featured on most compilations, but the 4:57 minute version that brilliantly uses the backing vocals.  The photos included in the liner notes are excellent and the remastering is superb.   <br /> <br />If you are a big Donna fan, I highly recommend this.  And the price is comparable to the single disc compilations so even the casual fan would not only find this affordable but enjoyable.   <br /> <br />
B00005JN2Z|1.0|The final sequence in this movie transforms it from a cool Mann crime movie into a dumb action movie.  I like dumb action movies, sometimes, like all those old bruce willis movies or even steven segal.  However, the endings are all the same: stupid.  That's OK on those movies, cause they were trash from the beginning, and you take them for what they are. This movie starts off to be a really cool, thoughtful, interesting movie.  Then, near the end, you hear the flushing sound, and realize that this movie is just a big loaf, being flushed along with the $3 you spent to rent it.  What a waste.
B000002UQJ|4.0|Now if you ask me, and a lot of folks interested in albums featuring cover photos of bare feet do now and again, this here McCartney album is not his worst... not by a long shot. This one wasn't a big seller, but then again he done released so many albums over the years that it is pretty difficult to always come out with a Band on the Run .  before you go to criticizing this here album, keep in mind that by this point he had released 24 post-Beatle albums. So, this here 25th post-Beatle release marks a score and five albums what he done did without JohnGeorgeRingo at his side and that is pretty impressive. <br /> <br />Junior just loves this one due to the cover art. See, he likes to crawl up in that big ole' naugahide bean bag chair we got and commence to inspecting the album cover every time we put this one on the hi fi player. He likes to peer at the toes and count the number of feet (there are a dozen feet) and consider how many individual people that represents. He has narrowed it down to either five, or six, or possibly seven... but he ain't sure. That boy is as dumb as a sack of hammers, but don't go tellin' his Mama I said that or she will have my hide. <br /> <br />I like this here album plenty good and give it half the traditional Huckabee 17 thumbs up, so it comes out with a 8.5 thumbs up or maybe eight thumbs and one pinkie finger.
B00006NSGX|2.0|The man is a master, doubts there, but this CD was really not the best Clapton I've ever heard.  Everything was a huge production and I can understand that for concert goers, but frankly it ruined some really great classics; especially Claptons blues covers and his signature Layla.  I was really hoping for some great tunes from this CD but I think I'm better off listening to some of the past works Mr. Slow Hand has done.
B0006B2A42|4.0|The film adaptation of Alistair MacLean's best-seller ICE STATION ZEBRA (1968) is one of the movies Howard Hughes watched hundreds, maybe thousands, of times in seclusion when he was going bonkers.<br /><br />On the surface, this cold (no pun intended) war espionage suspenser starring Rock Hudson, Ernest Borgnine and Jim Brown is about the submarine rescue mission of Drift Ice Station Zebra, a North Pole weather station team. But everything changes when the sub is ordered to take on mysterious British agent Patrick McGoohan.<br /><br />The film's plot is dated, but even with the fake sets and Hudson, something weird happens when watching it that makes it strangely compelling. It's hard to explain.<br /><br />It's nice to see this oddity in such a crisp, widescreen transfer, but I fear that it's hypnotic power will only be increased.  So be careful.  I liked the vintage making-of featurette \\"The Man Who Makes the Difference.\\"<br /><br />I give it four stars only because it has a Hughes connection and a proven power to take over (damaged?) minds.
B00004BZ16|5.0|For those with open minds; that is, open to variety of musical <br />styles, I have to say that Sandanista! is the best Clash CD. <br />The key, of course, is to PROGRAM THE SONGS YOU LIKE BEST. <br />Not only does this album contain some beautifully mind-bending <br />melodic experiments, it also has some of the rootsiest killer <br />dub/reggae tracks of all Clash CD's.  Regarding the children's chorus for Career Opportunities: it is by far my favorite version...the fact that children are singing it increases the song's poignance...as if these kids are street-wise before their time...it is extremely effective. <br />THEN...the next best Clash CD is London Calling...again, program <br />the songs you like best.  Super great & fantastic CD. <br />THEN...the British version of \\"The Clash,\\" but transplant that <br />CD to a double-case and add \\"The Singles\\" CD, because it has <br />far better productions of those tracks only on the American version. <br />GIVE 'EM ENOUGH ROPE is worth buying for Tommy Gun especially, as <br />well as about four other tracks...discover them for yourself. <br />COMBAT ROCK: I can't understand why anyone would say anything <br />negative about the opening track, KNOW YOUR RIGHTS.  That song <br />is utterly fantastic, powerful, haunting, even a little funny... <br />Also Straight to Hell is beautiful...and Ghetto Defendant has the great Allen Ginsberg reciting!!! <br />SUPER BLACK MARKET -- While containing B-sides and tracks left <br />off albums, it's still WELL worth buying...even though you can <br />kind of tell that, over all, it's slightly weaker than the other <br />CDS (especially relative to Sandanista) but it still has some <br />killer dub and that instrumental Blondie used for Rapture. <br />The Live Clash CD is quite good as well, but if you have all <br />the other CDs...it's probably the one I would not buy if I had <br />to not-choose one. <br />In conclusion, THE CLASH were WAY, WAY, WAY AHEAD OF THEIR TIME... <br />togenuine genius level.
0316168815|4.0|In my opinion, The Lovely Bones was a good use of imagination and originality. Sebold captured the reader from the very first paragraph, and kept their attention throughout the entire book. Though the ending was a bit of a stretch, she tied it in to the rest of the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes original/emotional books. 4 stars.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|If you like the guitar then you will simply love this wonderful DVD. The audio is very good and the video is very clear. The audience are not too intrusive and the camera work appears to be right-on-the-button. <br /> <br />It doesn't matter if you play the guitar or not, you will be treated to a MASTER CLASS of guitar wizardry. <br /> <br />I have listened to the two DVD's approx. four times now and can honestly say there is not one performance that I didn't enjoy. <br /> <br />These guys can truly play. <br /> <br />I was going to list my favourites but it seems pointless as they are all just too compelling. <br /> <br />Just one regret. I wish Muddy Waters could have been there but that's life. No one is immortal in the physical life but he will continue to live on every time I hear the Blues. <br /> <br />Enough said. Just buy it.
B000067CPX|4.0|I love this album! its so great, they have matured in the sound, and it is a good easy listen. An absolute MUST for RHCP fans!
B00005RHGK|1.0|I love horror movies. I can't get enough of them. For me and this is my opinion, this has to be one of the worst horror flicks in recent years, along with Cabin Fever. My husband and I were left staring at the screen in awe of how bad it was. I seriously felt my brain cells possibly melting away with every minute I watched it.     I try not to write bad reviews, because everyone tastes are so different, but nothing about this movie was great. The acting left much to be desired. The filmed lacked intensity. While the plot wasn't terrible, it could have been been delivered in a much more entertaining way. While it had plenty of gore, it was missing the \\"sitting at the edge of your seat\\" feeling. Instead of biting my nails, I was scratching my head wondering what the heck were they thinking.    All in all, I was bored out of my mind. I would rather kick back and watch classics like The Thing, Halloween, or Poltergiest. For me The Exorcist is the scariest movie of all time. If you want to be freaked out, that one will do it for ya.     I would save your money on this one, and just rent it if you are curious to see it at all. Again, everyone has there taste in horror flicks. Those of my friends and family members who watched this all agree that it would have been better to leave it on the shelf.
068987474X|5.0|Where oh where has this book been all my life? Not to mention the lives of so many other women (and men, for that matter) who have clung to people who are clearly not into them.  Funny but I can take all of these scenarios and examples and say \\"Wow, that happened to so-and-so, and things didn't turn out well!\\" Sometimes the so-and-so was me.   <br />This is a great book!
B0002Y4T92|4.0|What a great tribute to the guitar and its players. Not surprisingly, the set focuses on blues and rock which is fine with me. But you have to love J McClaughlin's(?)brilliance and Larry Carlton is a monster player also. I think Metheny is overrated but I still would have liked to have seen him on  <br />this disk. Leaving out Jeff Bck is a huge mistake. Mayer is OK, but cut him and incluce Beck. The Vai, with Sheehan on bass,  thing is a helluva lot of fun. Its fun to watch the shredders. He has very fast fingres but plays with emotion to boot.  <br /> <br />To P Dummy(Duffy), Billy Gibbons is probably the most underrated player in the whole genre. If you cannot recognize  that you have your ears up your posterior or you havn't really  <br />listend to that \\"Little 'ol Band from Texas.\\" Listen to the  <br />ZZ Top sixpack which focuses on all their great 70's stuff. <br /> <br />There a lot of guys that could have been on this disk. I wonder if Warren Haynes was invited?   <br /> <br />Eric Johnson is awesome. Go see him live. Incredible. <br /> <br />I'm a huge Buddy Guy fan. I love Clapton and all those guys, but to me Buddy is just the S**T. I've seen him 6 or 7 times <br />here in Atlanta, over the last ten years and man he smokes. If you haven't seen Buddy live, do it! Watch Sweet Home Chicago. Buddy is toying with those guys. They are all under his thumb. To me , he is the greates bluesman alive today(with huge respect for BB King...different styles). <br /> <br />My 2nd disk also had the same problem the earlier reviewer had. The last four songs were not there. When I tried to get to <br />them the disk went to Santana and Bramhall performances  <br />from the first disk. <br /> <br />I went to Best Buy and swapped it. The new one is OK.  <br /> <br />Very enjoyable set. I'll be watching this one for a long time.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMYI|5.0|First viewing...3.5 stars <br />Talked the movie over with friends, said a few quotes <br />Second viewing...4.5 stars <br />Third viewing...5 stars <br /> <br />Will Ferrell has a great line for every occasion in this movie.  Brick is the funniest character ever.   <br /> <br />Terriffic Terriffic movie. <br /> <br />Stay Classy San Diego!
B00009V7P8|5.0|I lay on the floor, Grado headphones plugged-in, and listen to this CD repeatedly.  No other CD exists for me, and none will for quite a while. When you find a good woman, you don't want to be parted for long.  This CD is a good woman.
B00005JCAA|4.0|I absolutely adore this movie.  Some have complained that it is too long, but it certainly is not.  The movie is beautifully paced, allowing the viewer to feel every nuance of the characters.  Anthony Hopkins is brilliant, as always, and Brad Pitt's portrayal of Death was excellent.  The supporting parts were perfectly cast; the soundtrack by Thomas Newman is haunting, yet beautiful.    Don't let the length of this movie scare you off.  It's a very nice way to spend 3 hours.
B0006399FS|5.0|F**k you all who say this album stinks. This album is AMAZING!
B00009V7T2|4.0|I give this albumn four stars simply as a matter of personal taste... It definately has five star quality though. <br /> <br />As an At the Drive In fan, I was interested in what Mars Volta was about so bought the albumn on faith alone. As a matter of  taste, I have found that I liked AtDI's rock edge that Sparta adapted better, however - this albumn is still awesome.  <br /> <br />Everyone should hear this album at least once... if it appeals to you, I can almost guarentee that you will never stop listening to it. It has that sort of quality. The vocals are really bizarre and intriguing, the guitar is like nothing I have ever heard, and the flow of the album makes it more like one long song with a bunch of movements than a lineup of individual tracks. This is probably the most original act I have heard in the past decade. Not everyone will like this (as I can account for), but even so, there is no denying that this is darn original, unique, and quite good.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I rented this movie just for fun.  I didnt know anything about it beforehand either.  I absolutely  loved it.  Laughed so hard I nearly cried a few times.  Mostly because I can remember kids just like Napoleon in school and he played the part so perfectly.  This movie is better with a group of people however.  Laughter is contagious.  Since I rented it, My hubby got it for me for Christmas and I have been asked by everyone I work with to borrow it and most everybody thinks it's stupid, but funny.  Good way to describe it.  Stupid, but funny.  I hope they make a Napoleon Part 2.  Lucky.
B000001FS3|5.0|In 1987, one of the greatest albums of all time was released, U2's \\"The Joshua Tree\\".  It feels like a meditation in the world of interesting and occasionally overblown 1980's rock.  It mixes the earlier U2 sound with influences of American Blues, Country and Rock.  It starts out with \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\", a great start to an album that indicates the desire to escape life's trappings.  \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" and \\"With Or Without You\\" are the best known songs ever by U2 and indicate a longing for something more than what we have.  \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\" is one of the most interesting U2 songs I have ever heard.  The Edge on guitar just blows me away.  I love how it addresses our hypocrisy in dealing with the world.  \\"Running to Stand Still\\" is about a drug addict and her inability to escape it.  \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" is a great song that is about a southwestern mining town. (obviously).  \\"In God's Country\\" is another song about America and the contradictions of it in the 1980's.  \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" is one of the best love songs ever written.  \\"One Tree Hill\\" is a great uptempo U2 song.  \\"Exit\\" starts out where \\"One Tree Hill\\" left off but then takes a much darker direction that is a prelude to what alternative rock would become.  \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\" is the closer and ends this album on a melancholy note about mothers who have lost their sons in senseless wars. <br /> <br />This is a great album that I have not done justice to in my description of.  But it is hard to imagine how anyone could do justice to this album.  It needs to be heard.  It speaks to so many moods.  It can also be very theraputic.  Highly recommended.
B0000019PA|2.0|I first listened to this album a few years ago and wasn't very impressed.  Every now and then I give it a spin since so many people seem to think it's godly.  To this day I still can't get into it.  I can see why someone might though.  They have a cool sound here with lush acoustics and marchingband trumpets and a few nice woshes and such adding texture to the songs.  Unfortuanety it can't hide the bland, dull arrangements and cliched melodies that plague most of the album.  I give it two stars though because there are a few gems(the first one and Communist Daughter stick out), but not enough to make up for headache inducing, dull as a rock type of songs like Oh, Comely, Two Headed Boy, and Hollad, 1945.  If all the hype has you curious, proceed with caution.  Download a few songs first before forking over the $.
B0002SROT0|5.0|This album, as a whole, is very remarkable. The beginning with \\"Coast to Coast\\" is catchy and well written, thus drawing you in from the start. I don't think there is a weak spot; I can listen from beginning to end over and over again and I never tire of it.<br /><br />Elliott Smith's lyrics are amazing. Yes, they were hauntingly depressing and about suicide...but the songs are not morbid, they are sad and beautiful.<br /><br />For me the stand out track is \\"King's Crossing\\". This has become my new favourite song. I like the overall feel of the song, but if you listen to the lyrics, it's just WOW. Powerful, powerful stuff. This one song has produced so much emotion for me, I would have gotten the entire album just to hear it.<br /><br />Well worth the money of buying this CD. RIP Elliott. Your talents will not be forgotten.
B000003TAR|3.0|Yeah, I do own this album and have owned this album since i was 10, when it first came out.  No, Nirvana was not overrated, and no, this is not their best album.  \\"Nevermind\\" was so popular for a reason so that should be everyone's first Nirvana album.  Now I'm writing this review cuase I was just flipping through old reviews and came across one that actually made me mad.  Scroll down and read <br />-- \\"If you want TRU grunge, stick with the inventors, like Puddle Of Pudd, Creed, Shinedown, Seether, Chevelle, Godsmack, Default, The Calling, Green Day and the brutal Good Charlotte!! For more godly sounds check into Linkin Park (gods of melodic metal), Disturbed and KoRn (gods of death metal) and Limp Bizkit (gods of all music!!) Peace out grunge wanna be's!!\\" <br />-- <br />First of all, none of those bands are actually \\"grunge\\".  There's some pop rock, and some punk rock.  Disturbed and Korn aren't death metal, so don't be fooled, they're just regualar old heavy metal.  And Limp Bizkit couldn't make a good song if their life depended on it.  Plus, if  you're gunna call them the inventors of something, make sure they at least go back to 86.  Jeez the furthest back any of those group's albums go is early 90s... I mean Nirvana did come out with \\"Bleach\\" (also a good album) in '89.  And no, Nirvana did't \\"invent\\" grunge, but they did bring grunge to the popular mainstream.  They did open doors for the bands previously mentioned.
B00003CXFV|4.0|I think there are two aspects that are present all along the film. One of them is, of course, Julia Roberts. Her acting could be somewhat annoying as she is in almost every scene: her bad-temperament, her mini-clothes and lots of her clichs are present in the more than two hour length of the film. <br /> <br />The second aspect is the horrible hot and yellowish tone of all scenes, even when at night. When the movie finished I thought I have been watching some documental in the desert or the African savannah! <br /> <br />Well, the movie is well oriented. It is easy to have a real testimony to make your film and watching the extras (which alone would be rated 5) you find the film is a lovely story of struggle and desperation with a more-than-happy ending. If the story was not true, it was almost impossible to believe attorney Ed Masry had a great heart and a good eye to keep with Erin Brockovich. <br /> <br />Albert Finney is rescued from the past. It's more than 40 years he made a success with Tom Jones and in the last few years had only made several TV film appearances. Good job and great similarity to the real Masry! <br /> <br />Roberts makes a good acting but the movie is worth to watch for the story itself.
B0006399FS|1.0|I'm usually pretty open minded... it should be noted, but this crap is unexcusable. <br /> <br />The childish lyrics, the lame vocals, the lack of music talent, the same ATYCLB cocktail, etc. U2 fooled us all.  <br /> <br />What does happen when a band say that is going back to their roots with their new album ? Usually it means it's going to suck. \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" is no exception and it sucks too. And this is not a return to their old sound. I hope I could put 0 stars because this crappy album deserve none. I admire bands that try new things, push the envelope, experiment, but the songs, the music, the lyrics, the arrangements, the production here are so bad it's embarrassing. I don't know what these guys were thinking when they released this piece of crap. A bunch of 10 year olds could write better songs than these. The lyrics are so lame.   <br /> <br />I don't know what these guys were thinking when they released this peice of crap. A bunch of 10 year olds could write better songs than these. The music is so lame. Nowhere near what old U2 was <br /> <br />
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Leaving behing the much publicized issues of who writes the lyrics, who composes the music, who plys the guitar, her childish behavior and teen punk prinecess reputation, I can say that I was pleasantly surprised by this album.  <br /> <br />The first two singles - Don't tell me and My happy ending - are decent but other songs such as Noboody's home, Together, Take me away and Forgotten are even better. These songs exibit  commendable musical maturity and complexity.
0812550706|5.0|This is one of those books you burn through in the first read, then  pick it up again several months later to reread it at a slightly slower pace. Each time, you pick up a little more nuance and a broader overall picture of the story.  Ender's Game is easily one of my top 5 reads!
0684833395|5.0|A mark of real brilliance is an author who manages to add words to our common language, like Heller with \\"catch-22\\" or Orwell with \\"doublespeak\\".   Simply put, this book is absolutely brilliant. It reflects the crazy, upside down world where insane is sane, incompetence rules, and one (or, as it turns out, two) person stands alone and upholds his sanity.  A few highlights:   the chapter on milo's syndicate is an economic masterpiece. Not only is it hysterical but it is a perfect example of a modern market economy based on absolutely nothing.   chaplain trappman's interrogation at the hands of the CID is another example of english writing at its best. Remember, the CID man has had latin training so he knows the chaplain is \\"not a baptist.\\"  I find myself quoting this book constantly. Anyone who can't recognize the quote \\"O sont les Neigedens d'antan?\\" needs to read more American literature.
B00005ASHM|5.0|album of all times, I just can say: \\"Don't throw pearls to the swines\\". Don't doubt it. This is for sure the best album of all. Pop masterpiece, Arthur Rubinstein, one of the most important musician of the XX century considered Brian Wilson one of the greatest composers of modern times. Do you think Rubinstein had in mind the \\"Beach, sand, surf\\" records. NO, he had in mind Pet Sounds. <br /> <br />If you can't get what's all the fuzz about this album is because you think that a vanguardist album should sound like Autechre or Radiohead. You've got no idea about what vanguard is. We are talking about 1968, got it? 1968, for God's sake. Wilson made this album with a crappy studio compared to today wonders. And he succeed! All the harmonies are perfect. Some people said that the instrumental track 'Let's go away for a while' is a bad tune, messy, amorph... Geez, I think they are possesed by the spirit of Mike Love. He is just the summun of the musical misunderstanding. While he's still around under the moniker of the \\"Beach Boys\\", pathetically singing with a band that has just ONE Beach Boy, and not the crucial one, indeed, while all of this is happening, Wilson has released his finally accomplished masterpiece \\"Smile\\" to public acclaim. Wilson is a genius, and I'm happy to read reviews that \\"don't get it\\" or say this work is \\"overated\\", because that means that, as Brian prophetically said, He, and this album, \\"wasn't made for these times\\". <br /> <br />What I dislike of this Mono/Stereo edition is that misses 'Trombone Dixie', and some session takes that were awesome.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is simply a fantastic film.  It is smart, compelling, interesting, and deeply emotive.  It is brilliantly put together and has a richness of texture that can only be appreciated on multiple viewings. <br /> <br />It is a love story told in an unfamiliar way - the possibility of memory erasure.  The pain of a just-ended relationship with Kate Winslet leads Jim Carrey to choose a unique method to ameliorate his despair - to take advantage of a medical technique that promises to erase from his brain all memories of his former lover.  It sounds strange because it is.   <br /> <br />The story continues on via Carrey's character reliving the memories of this woman while they are being erased in his sleep.  He is in a dream-state as he confuses memories, mixes things up, and discovers while inside his dream a powerful human lesson about life and love.  The acting is absolutely superb, as it boasts an amazing cast of Carrey, Winslet (a brilliant performance that surprised me), Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Tom Wilkinson.  All of them are extraordinary.   <br /> <br />If you like intelligent, thought-provoking films that also happen to pull at your emotional heart-strings, you will love this film.  It is a heavy script with multiple meanings, and one can examine it on several different levels.  The power, inconsistency, and unreliability of memory, the psychological and philosophical reality of memory and the possibility of its erasure or creation, the brilliant, discontinuous script, the dynamic direction, the able and highly competent acting.  How the resilience of human personality is greater than discrete collections of memory instances.  And how no matter how or what you may try, it is neither possible nor wise to completely erase any significant and remembered instance of human experience, especially in love.   <br /> <br />The film makes you think and makes you cry at the same time.  Powerful and brilliant.  I can't recommend it enough. <br /> <br />
B00005JNLY|5.0|The reason so many people talk down this movie is due to seeing what we take for granted.  People saw Sandler in the previews, they thought they were going in for a few chuckles and sat through it saying 'what is this'.  It was way over their heads, the movie was an absolute work of art encapsulating the deepest and most significanty fundamental ideas of giving up that which we love, or which we yearn to become for the sake of our children. This explicit message is carried through the entire film until the very end where it becomes another mother-daughter spinoff. The overall illustration is the personal sacrafice one must make when raising a child.
B003Y5H59C|5.0|The movie can only be described as a black comedy, indie, Rom-Com. The film deals with very serious issues in a respectful manner. There are many moments that probably shouldn’t be funny, but they are. Lastly, there are moments that are so adorable and quirky that you can do nothing but smile.<br /><br />The film opens with Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) getting out of a mental hospital. The same situation that landed her in the hospital is still happening, so she takes a typing class and starts looking for work. She becomes a receptionist for E. Edward Grey (James Spader). Mr. Grey is demanding and controlling when it comes to his business. However, he likes BDSM which causes him distress throughout the movie. He isn’t using BDSM as a coping mechanism nor does he want to harm his partner; he just likes BDSM.  Lee is a complete doormat, but she gets better.<br /><br />The only thing Lee and Grey seem to have in common is how closed off they are. Thus, the relationship that they have with each other allows both parties to open up and accept who they are. Grey becomes more content and honest. Lee becomes more assertive and confident.<br /><br />I’d really recommend this over many romantic books and films about BDSM. This movie shows power exchange, and what that means in a D/s relationship. Plus, it’s enjoyable and not overextended like some other recent movies and books.

B00026W82U|4.0|When I first played Quiet is the New Loud for a dance-loving friend, I had to admonish her. \\"You do not groove to Kings of Convenience; you listen to them and have sad sex or receive your last rites.\\" Though I meant this as a huge compliment to the earnest sounds of the Norwegian duo, the same cannot be said of Riot on an Empty Street. The new album does beautifully echo their former melancholy in many places, but this album also displays many moments of emotional strength. I think of the album's collective mood as one of a person in transition, trying to make sense of some long passed disaster after the numbness and horror have faded. Naturally the process of repair will be an effort, but there's the aural suggestion that a change for the better is coming. Excellent, excellent work.
B0006399FS|1.0|Without all that awful marketing, probably this album would have been better.  These extremely rich businessmen ( former musicians ) are back just for money. Paradoxically U2 became famous due their varied musical expressions, linked with honesty and fighting for causes like environment, human rights and end of poverty.    Those days have gone. The well-known and overhyped band use their fame to get commercial agreements with iPod and Apple Tunes, revealing how greedy cynical are they now.    For worse, they're campaining for U.S goverment, the same who deny basic human rights ( life, food, care, health, etc ) in many countries around the whole globe because of their globalization. Any Bush action ( no matter how butcher is it ) is good for Bono, the former ambassador of the truth and justice. \\"Money is more important than anything else\\" they seem to think.  We have been ignored by U2. Perhaps because of this recent lack of interaction with fans hopes and feelings, this album is getting worse every day, and more fans are feeling out of love with these iPod men.    These songs comes from businessmen minds, not from musicians minds.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban is such an amazing singer. His voice is huge and so beautiful to listen to. You should definately buy this CD. It is one of my favorites. He is only 23 and he has so much potential. These songs are beautifully written and sung. I love him and his voice.

0670033375|4.0|Diamond uses a five point model to examine societies that have declined and collapsed and those that have thrived due to change. Examining the Mayan culture, the people of Easter Island and others, Diamond presents a thoughtful anaylsis as to how these very different cultures (one isolated with no enemies but a rich land and culture badly overtaxed the other a rich culture that that had many contacts and enemies to complicate their lives)to present models that we can use today to deal with these issues regarding the environment, social pressure and others that face our culture.<br /><br />Diamond's approach argues that none of these cultures were inferior and that they face the same ecological, environmental and, ultimately, social stressors as we do in our world today. He also takes a look at modern societies (including China and Australia)and how they are faring with the 12 modern types of environmental problems. In another section he looks at the good and bad that big business have contributed to the ecology. It's pretty fair balanced overall.<br /><br />Diamond suggests that societies ultimately choose to fail or succeed based on their problem solving skills, ability to be flexible and change prior to crisis mode. Essentially we can either be victims or lead the charge for change. I didn't feel that an examination of past cultures was a flaw like some reviewers; he examines them in more depth because we already know the outcome and can more clearly trace the evoltionary path that led to their undoing. That path shows up again when examining our modern world and the ways that we are both feeding choas and living with the resources we have as a nation and world. His point about how important it is to understand all of this in a globalized culture seems valid; there are too many interconnected countires now (unlike the Easter Island situation where they were, essentially, isolated and didn't have an impact on other cultures when they finally fell)and if one falls, ultimately, it will have a domino effect on other countries as well putting our world at peril and not just one or two countries.<br /><br />A warning about Diamond's book seems appropriate. It can be read by the lay person but the dense material might be daunting for some people. Skimming the book may give you can idea of the content but it won't have the same profound impact on your view of the world as reading it from cover to cover. I agree with Diamond's viewpoint on a single important point--change and flexibility will help a society thrive and a society that remains static, denies what occurs around it will fail.alls, ultimately, it will have a domino effect on other countries as well putting our world at peril and not just one or two countries.  <br /> <br />A warning about Diamond's book seems appropriate.

B000002HJD|4.0|...and certainly ignore the \\"official\\" review. I think people who criticise Jim for being pretentious just don't \\"get it\\". This naturally doesn't get the playtime other Doors albums get but it is certainly enjoyable.
B0000A4GAK|4.0|And I am/was plesantly surprised.  The vocal appearance of Greg Allman was unexpected in this otherwise instrumental effort.  This is no typical offering;  it belies catagorization, just like I like it.  Somewhere between jazz/rock fusion and blues there is the Derek Trucks Band.  Derek has a real gift in using the slide; it sounds smooth and unforced.  Just glides along...  A very good effort.
B00005ATQD|1.0|Being a big Stanley Kubrick fan, I was very dissappointed w/ this, his last & final movie.    It's too bad, because I was definately looking forward to it at the time it came out. <br /> <br />Definately rent it before deciding whether or not to purchase it.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Tom Cruise is good in this movie and his role as a hit-man is a real departure - he is convincing as a ruthless killer.  Jamie Foxx is REAL good in this movie and in a few scenes he shows the acting ability that took him from playing comic roles to his show-stopper as Ray Charles.<br /><br />I'm going to take as a given that you've heard a thumbnail of the plot: Foxx is a taxi driver with unrealized dreams, Cruise gets into the cab in the second scene and forces Foxx to drive him around to a series of hits during the night.<br /><br />In one brilliant scene Foxx is forced to enter a den of hardened criminals and pretend to be \\"Vincent\\" the hit-man.  He is initially terrified - realistically - but as he realizes his very life depends on his ability to seem a callous assassin he undergoes a remarkable transformation in a few moments.  Foxx steals this scene: the best in the movie.<br /><br />Until the final act there is not a flaw in the movie.  The first hour and fifteen minutes are good and compel you to the ending, but once you arrive there a few formulas kick in.  When Foxx is forced to accompany the killer I was reminded of Ethan Hawke as Denzel Washington's \\"good cop\\" partner in \\"Training Day\\".  In both of these films you suspect that the ethical character is going to be brought to a situation where not only his life is threatened, but also his ability to \\"stand up\\" and \\"do the right thing.\\"  If Collateral had stuck to this track and realistically resolved the conflict I'd have awarded 5 stars.  I don't want to give away the ending, but Cruise's character survives an unseatbelted tumble in a flipping high-speed taxi crash, then a shot to the head, and keeps coming as if he were \\"The Terminator\\".  \\"Fargo\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\" made getting a shot to the head look like a painful, bloody thing.  \\"Collateral\\" makes it look like a good boxing punch.  Still, worth seeing, and Foxx probably deserves a \\"Best Supporting Actor\\" nomination for this film as well as \\"Best Actor\\" for \\"Ray\\".
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|\\"Troy\\" was a fun action flick that focused on Achilles.  His personality was softened, and he has a romance (that being essential to modern war-movies).  On the whole, the plot was true to the theme \\"the fall of Troy\\".  Many different people were well developped.  The fight between Achilles and Hector is the best done fight I've ever seen in a movie -- truly, the whole thing is worth seeing just for that.  Helene appears beautiful, just as she ought.  The director did an excellent job, and no expense was spared on the sets.  To my fellow ladies, let me say that there are plenty of handsome young men to admire.  All told, I can sympathise with those of you who loved this movie.  <br /> <br />However.  \\"Troy\\" was long, a bit slow, and went to rediculous extremes to avoid nudity.  The script writers took one of the greatest tragedies ever written and turned it into a decent war movie with an ending that was almost happy.  What is the point in seeing a Greek tragedy without the tragedy?  In my opinion, way too much care was taken not to offend the viewer's sensibilities, thus loosing the essiantial flavor.  Also, the romance between Helene and Paris was too bland -- this is supposed to be one of history's most famous romances, but the actors didn't do a convincing job of acting passionately in love.  For example, Helene's distress over her marriage and the war to get her back were all well portrayed, but she didn't appear affectionate toward Paris. <br /> <br />So, in summary, I enjoyed \\"Troy\\" and would recommend this movie to you, but personally I wanted something slightly different.
B000000NN1|4.0|I bought this album when it was first released in the 70's. Heaven and Hell was hot item and passed through my senior school from ear to ear amongst 'those kids in the know' in much the same way that a joint would these days. The movements build on a theme throughout the work and reflect the care that went into creating some classical overtures. Only later in life could I get the similarities to Carl Orf and Khachaturian. This is a real masterpiece and a snapshot in time of when Prog really was prog. Listen to it in full and then catalogue alongside Camel's 'The Snow Goose', the original 'Tubular Bells' by MIke Oldfield, 'Brain Salad Surgery' by ELP and finally ' Snowflakes are dancing' by Tomita.  Please dont compare this work to the keybored pop, I chose my spelling, of the 1980's If you enjoy Vangelis, as I do, you might also want to listen to the compositions of Ennio Morricone, he is the man who wrote that great music that follows Clint Eastwood in the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|\\"Troy\\" opened at the box office to mixed reviews, and complaints by purists and high school humanities teachers that it strayed too far from Homer's epic tale. Well, OK, \\"The Illiad\\" it's not, but as good, old style, big-screen costume drama it's just fine. The cast is a mix of oldies-but-goodies and youthful hotties; some of the CG effects--the walls and city of Troy for example--aren't bad; and even if the scenery lacks variety--sand, sand everywhere--the battles that take place on all that sand are for the most part well choreographed. Brad Pitt, whose legendary good looks are seen to great advantage both in armor and in his birthday suit, offers up a nice portrayal of that nasty-tempered, fame-seeking Achilles. If his sullen, uncompromising Greek hero seems more 21st century than Bronze Age, he is still impressive in the role (in spite of critics' quibbles about his elocution), and in the fight scenes he is simply a pleasure to watch. Director Wolfgang Petersen sidesteps the issue of Achilles' bisexuality (pretty much the norm for many great men of ancient Greece), and turns Patroclus--played by Gerrett Hedlund--into a convenient cousin. Eric Bana does an excellent job as the steady, far more emotionally balanced Trojan warrior Hector. The great Peter O'Toole makes a welcome appearance as King Priam; as frail and misty-eyed as he seems, he can still wow an audience. Far too little use is made of Sean Bean as Odysseus (how about a sequel--\\"The Odyssey\\"?) Brian Cox has a hammy old time as Agammemnon, scowling, sneering, and cheerfully dining on whatever scenery is available. Saffron Burrows, as Hector's wife Andromache, is lovely to see but is given rather little to do. Finally, as pretty as Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom may be, they don't add much to the film in terms of acting power, but they look nice in their beautifully-designed costumes. <br /> <br />Forget the critics' muttering and suspend any scholarly expectations, sit down with 2 1/2 hours worth of popcorn, and you'll probably find plenty to enjoy in \\"Troy.\\"  <br /> <br />[Note: This is my second Amazon review of \\"Troy\\"; my first was after the film opened in theatres, well before the release of the DVD.]
0385336810|4.0|I just loved this book.  I couldn't stop grinning through the whole thing.  I read it while stuck at an airport over the holidays, and it made time just fly by. <br />Hightly recommend for the light hearted & looking for love crowd.  It just made me smile. <br /> <br />I didn't really like her shopaholic character, but loved this one!  Glad I chose it.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I purchased this DVD because of Queen and Adam Ant.  The Queen set was perfect and the Adam Ant song was an interesting look at him in a live performance.  I also enjoyed the Judas Priest set, U2, Bob Geldof, David Bowie, Dire Straits, Hall & Oates with Eddie Kendricks & David Ruffin from the Temptations, Ultravox, Paul Young, Patti Labelle and Teddy Pendergrass.  The highlights for me were Bob Geldof singing \\"I Don't Like Mondays\\", Freddie Mercury and Brian May performing \\"Is This The World We Created?\\", David Bowie singing \\"Heroes\\", the appearance of Teddy Pendergrass, and the confrontation between Bob Geldof and Margaret Thatcher(I'll never think of her again without remembering this footage).  For these moments alone, I am perfectly happy with my purchase.  There are many performances that I will probably always skip; but the good on this DVD far outweighs any of these mediocre performances.
0060392886|5.0|It's interesting to note, when reading other reviews of this book, that almost all who have reviewed it have given it the full 5 stars. <br /> <br />The reason, I think, for this is the brutal honesty of the writing. The author has shown great intelligence in looking at the history from the individual viewpoint of each band-member and taken that viewpoint to gain an honesty that would probably be missing where this taken collectively and it's this honesty of this story which makes the book virtually unputdownable (I read cover to cover in the time it took to fly from London to Melbourne...and it seemed a fraction of the time). Full credit to the author. <br /> <br />The material itself is shocking. These men have lived up to their rock star reputations and then some. Some of the things these people got up to, and to a certain extent got away with is simply incredible.  Nikki, Vince and Tommy-Lee should have killed themselves twice over from drugs or AIDS but have somehow managed to come through it. <br /> <br />The reality of the piece is the sorry tale of Vince's daughter and his open-hearted honesty is a revelation of this man's soul. <br /> <br />Anyone with the remotest interest in the nature of man should read this book, it's worth the effort.
0759598029|4.0|Overall this book deserved four stars, even though it was interesting when concluded... certain details bored me and didn't make sense, it was extremely long it took me a month to finish it and nothin exciting ever happens, I mean all she does is sit in heaven and just watch her family, how interesting huh? and the thing that made me mad is that they still didn't find her bones. Good things, I liked her view of heaven it waas so different for everyone else. I like the way the author uses a creative imagination in good use and that helped make the story a lot more interesting. <br />
B00065JTBA|4.0|As a long-time Bon Jovi fan, I have been waiting for a box set or some kind of unreleased song collection since I was in Jr. High. I'm so happy that Bon Jovi decided to give fans an almost completely fresh set of music in this collection. Songs like The Radio Saved my Life Tonight, Taking it Back, and Thief of Hearts sink into me the same way their classic stuff has. In many of these cases, I wonder why the songs haven't made any of their albums. While the set was designed so every disc is easy to listen to on its own, a lot of the included material is purely released for interest value and not quality. An example of this is Tico Torres singing the song Only in My Dreams. The crackle of his voice sounds like something that would only be in my nightmares.  Alternate versions of songs like Always and Someday I'll be Saturday Night vary enough from their final versions to keep the interest there. On the other hand, I really don't understand why they decided to include The Last Man Standing, a track planned for inclusion on their next studio album. Being that this set was created for die hard fans, it is only assumed this was included as a promotional gimmick for their next product. They have so many great B-Sides that didn't make this set, it's hard for me to give it a 5 star rating, considering some of the flops that were included. Overall I'm really happy to have this set. The majority of songs were explained in detail within the included booklet. Fan quotes are a nice added touch. For the most part, the studio discussion of songs on the DVD was the same as that included in the booklet, so I wouldn't really rank it highly as a stand-alone product. If you have the majority of Bon Jovi's other albums, this set is for you. Don't hesitate. Just buy it. There is enough great material in here to keep you entertained for awhile. If you're looking for something by Bon Jovi and are not sure what to buy, I suggest looking at Slippery When Wet (most popular), New Jersey, Keep the Faith, or Crush..maybe all of them..
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|THIS MOVIE WAS VERY SLOW AND BORING TO WATCH. THE ACTORS EVEN SEEMED BORED. THE MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER. I WAS VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED I GIVE IT 1 STAR. THE STAR THAT I HAVE GIVEN IS FOR THE SCENERY. THE DIALOGUE IN THE MOVE WAS TERRIBLE, PERHAPS THAT IS THE REASON WHY THE ACTORS WERE SO MISERABLE
0060594888|5.0|As an Author, Coach, and Motivational Speaker I read a lot of books about people, their motivations, and their relationships. The Success Principles is an outstanding example of an educational, inspirational, and motivational guide to success. I love the stories of the people Jack and Janet chose to interview to model the principles. The Success Principles is an excellent book and I give it an A+.<br /><br />The Success Principles is broken down into six sections that help you chart your path. Here are the sections and selected principles from each section that are making a difference for me.<br /><br />The first 24 principles are labeled the Fundamentals of Success. Sample principles include:<br /><br />Take 100% responsibility for your life<br /><br />Decide what you want<br /><br />Believe it's possible<br /><br />Success leaves clues<br /><br />Feel the fear and do it anyway<br /><br />Ask, ask, ask<br /><br />Keep score for success<br /><br />Practice persistence<br /><br />The next 14 principles are labeled Transform Yourself for Success and focus inward.

Sample principles include:<br /><br />Build a powerful support team and delegate to them<br /><br />Hire a personal coach<br /><br />Mastermind your way to success<br /><br />Section IV is Create Successful Relationships. I'm focusing on all of these eight principles since this is my core competency and I want to grow, expand, and solidify my knowledge in this area. The principles in this section are:<br /><br />Be hear now<br /><br />Have a heart talk<br /><br />Tell the truth faster<br /><br />Speak with impeccability<br /><br />When in doubt, check it out<br /><br />Practice uncommon appreciation<br /><br />Keep your agreements<br /><br />Be a class act<br /><br />The next seven principles focus on Success and Money.

0060594888|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I first opened Jack Canfield's book.  The thickness of the book was a little intimidating at first especially when I was doing my own research as well as celebrating the holidays.  But I am grateful that I took the time to read it.  His information is not only inspiring, but it is empowering.  He does what every author tries desperately to do:  To touch the reader on a deep level.  He touched me right where I was.  Sometimes I was saying \\"Amen\\" and sometimes I was saying \\"Ouch!\\" (smile)  Job well done!
0425163407|2.0|I haven't read a Kay Scarpetta novel since 'The Body Farm' as I was getting sick of all the gore/body parts.  When I found this book in the book swap bin at work I thought it would at least pass the time - something a bit gross maybe but a fast paced exciting read.  How wrong I was - I admit it did pass the time but I had to force myself to plod my way through it.  The story focuses far too much on Kay's personal life, on different forensic procedures on government organisations and their sophisticated equipment - all at the expense of the story.  Despite all the gross-out descriptions of dead bodies/horrible diseases the whole thing left me curiously unmoved. Perhaps because all the characters apart from Kay have become one-dimensional cutouts. The ending is a total damp squib - she just seems to have picked a minor character out at random to be the killer - and lots of plot points - such as the Lucy storyline are left totally unresolved - probably to sucker the reader into buying the next book in the series!  However for me the major problem for me was that Kay had become a character I disliked intensely - she was so rude and arrogant to everyone - so neurotic and set in her ways that quite honestly I didn't care if she got smallpox - in fact I was hoping that Cornwall would just kill her off, as I think she's really sick of writing about this character now - and it shows ...
B0000DZ3IG|3.0|Thanks to the other poster who warned about the difference between UK and US versions of the CD.  I ordered mine from Amazon.co.uk to get the songs I didn't see listed in the US version. <br /> <br />I don't understand why there are multiple versions of a soundtrack to begin with.  If the song was in the movie, put it on the soundtrack.  Why is this a difficult concept??
B000002HH9|3.0|This album has some Cure songs that are my most loved, and some that are my most hated.  Some are just so intensely sad, and some that are ridiculously jump-on-your-bed happy.  In my opinion, it's worth the buy (if it's cheap -- and it's always in a mark-down bin), especially if you're going to burn your own compilation of sad Cure songs. <br /> <br /> <br />I hope that someone will play \\"Treaure\\" at my funeral. <br />(Was that gawth enough for you?) <br />;)
B00005JMCW|5.0|This movie is so funny I watched it for at least two weeks.  Everytime anyone came over I made them watch it.  Some people may find the characters over the top but that just makes them funnier.  They are outrageous to make you laugh.  I think that Lindsay and Jamie Lee do justice to this movie.  And the man who plays grandpa with the earthquake omg funny.  Jamie Lee does a great job as playing a kid she shines in this movie and will make you laugh from begining to end.  Expeciall with Anna's (the daughter whose body she takes over) boy troubles.  Just an all around funny movie!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Definetly a newer 'big band' sound from the SoCal Trio. Overall I am extremely happy that Green Day is changing rock back into an evolving entity rather than a regressing monotony. (Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, Bowling For Soup) Not to say these bands aren't good in their own respects, but they're not evolving they're just playing the same power chord driven verse-bridge-chorus pop-punk stereotype for a few more million $. Because they are already obscenely rich and respected, veterans Green Day can afford to take  chances wihtout worrying too much about a fickle consumer market. The whole CD is very good with songs varying in tempo and focus. Highlights include the combo songs when multiple songs are linked to one another. It provides almost a punk rock opera of sorts, changing tempos and vocal intensity throughout. Overall this is a great rock album. Drop the sub category and the elitist BS and just leave it as rock. Or just call it good music, because it is. I'm sure they will make alot of people angry with their anti-Bush sentiment but the people who refuse to buy a Green Day album for the rest of their lives because Billie Joe doesn't have the same point of view as they do are just fueling the fire of seperatism that is tearing this country apart. <br /> <br />-GuyintheTV <br />'All Judgements Are Final'
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Picasso was such a draftsman he could draw like a fresh child. Clapton knows Johnson so well from the inside out that he can reinterpret with a smile. He has sung a whole lot worse and a lot more agonized. Here he's a master having fun with another master's work -- maybe like Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grapelli jamming, with the difference being they were both alive at the time. Anyone with the skill and courage to do 32-20 as a sprightly ditty has earned the right to do so. And a true fan might learn something by playing Rollin' and Tumblin' from Fresh Cream before and after If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day.
B0002X314C|5.0|This album is a striking masterpiece. There are no other words to describe it. This WILL definitely be one of best albums released in 2005. I know real talent when I hear it. And no mistaking, John Legend's got the right name. Don't let the 1 and 2 stars fool you. There hasn't been a male R&B singer like this since forever. People WILL be talking about this album in 10 years. If Mr. Legend wanted to grab our attention and make an impression, he's doing it. With this album, Kanye West masterfully illustrates why he's the apt artist/producer that he is. \\"Get Lifted\\" was no fluke, and they're both light-years ahead of many of their counterparts. It's truly remarkable. <br /> <br />John Legend scores points with me because he takes every song with his voice and energy to a new level. I've never heard an album just rocket into the stratosphere the way this one does. The CD is called \\"Get Lifted\\" and that's how I feel when I'm done listening. Hard to believe, but with one album John Legend has already transformed the R&B landscape forever. He's raised the bar to a new high. When he says, \\"I know you're getting' tired of the same ol' thing/Well I'ma break the rules, gonna change the game/You'll be screamin' my name,\\" he's not blowing smoke. This guy is the real thing.  You'll be very sad if you overlook this one. <br /> <br />\\"Get Lifted\\" is a modern R&B Classic waiting to be discovered. I would highly recommend it. <br />
B00005JNDX|3.0|Did this movie really need to be made? The first movie was fresh, funny and cute.  The sequel however, is annoying, not funny and lacks charm.  No longer is Bridget funny and charming, she is just an embarrassment to watch.   <br /> <br />The sequel starts out ok, but quickly relies on subplot after subplot to keep the viewer interested.  This actually made the film rather annoying as you constantly had to focus on yet another storyline happening.  Perhaps the director could tell the film wasn't working and wrote in more subplots. <br /> <br />To me, the main problem with the film is that Bridget is no longer funny. You can only stretch the fat jokes so far. Also, the scene where she stormed into Darcy's chambers with a wet dress and hair was just too far fetched and not credible.  It was supposed to be funny, but ended up being a poor attempt by the Director to make us believe that a man of Darcy's calibre would be interested in a woman who storms in when he is in a meeting with his colleagues.  A similar scene occurs in the first ten minutes of the film. <br /> <br />Hugh Grant's brief appearance in the film was an attempt to recapture the magic of the first. It failed. He was annoying in this film because he didn't fit in this time around. <br /> <br />Overall, 2004's most eagerly awaited film turned out to be 2004's most disappointing film.  Please, do not make a third installment.
B00006CXSS|5.0|If ever there were a moment when the Oscars seemed unworthy it would be this.  The fact that an epic of this magnitude couldn't qualify the highest honors in cinema is tragic. <br /> <br />Band Of Brothers follows Easy Company through its campaigns in the European theatre during World War II.  There are no punches pulled in this series.  The action is spectacular and horrific at the same time.  The acting is second to none.  You will be drawn into the lives and deaths of the Men of Easy Company.  The violence and war is as realistic in this series as it was in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".  The difference being that you won't just be sad as a member of the company dies.  You'll feel as though you have experienced a true loss.   <br /> <br />Spielberg and Hanks do an incredible job bringing real life hero's to life on the screen, but the true gem of the series is the accounts of what it was like by the surviving men of Easy Company themselves.  Seeing them on screen and hearing them speak makes you feel the sorrow and the pride all the more. <br /> <br />Block out some time to really get into this series, as it is best experienced in one sitting.  It will emotionally drain you, but at the same time it will make you wish that you could shake the hand of every man in Easy Company and every other company that has fought on behalf of all of us.  It will also make you appreciate the country that we live in even more. <br />

B0006HXXBA|5.0|Enemy of God is by far the best cd ever released by Kreator.  Not a single sub-par, filler, or even slightly weak track on the album.  The songs are more or less a combination of all the different Kreator sounds from their entire career.  Everything from the aggression and technical aspects of the early work, to the more experimental sounds of Outcast and Endorama.  I bought this cd after I heard the title track, and although it is still my favorite, the others are just as good. <br /> <br />Enemy of God (12/10)  -  In my opinion, the best song on the cd.  A fantastic opener that never lets up.  Great song to sing along with.  It feels like it has three choruses, but really only one.  A very epic sound, and great solos and lyrics. <br /> <br />Impossible Brutality (10/10)  -  This song reminds me alot of the Violent Revolution album.  Mid-paced song with a great chorus and intelligent lyrics. <br /> <br />Suicide Terrorist (9/10)  -  This one will grow on you quickly.  Direct and to the point.  No fat whatsoever. <br /> <br />World Anarchy (9/10)  -  I would give this 10/10, but it reminds me a bit too much of the title track.  A great, fast song with, again, very good lyrics. <br /> <br />Dystopia (10/10)  -  A perfect example of why Kreator is the greatest thrash band around.  The chorus reminds me of the work on Outcast.  One of my favorites on the cd. <br /> <br />Voices of the Dead (11/10)  -  Mille tries something a little different on this song and it sounds great.  Extremely catchy.  Not poppy, mind you, by any means, just catchy.  \\"Tonight I hear you whisper deep inside my head!\\"  Just a great song... <br /> <br />Murder Fantasies (10/10)  -  Sounds like Extreme Aggression!  Features a guest guitar solo from Michael Ammott (Arch Enemy, Carcass).  Enough said. <br /> <br />When Death Makes It's Dominion (8/10)  -  Another mid-paced thrasher similar to Impossible Brutality.  I love the breakdown before the chorus.  <br /> <br />One Evil Comes, A Million Follow (9/10)  -  Again, very much reminds me of Outcast.  Think Phobia, but more melodic. <br /> <br />Dying Race Apocalypse (12/10)  -  Just a hair behind Enemy of God as my favorite song on the album.  Awsome acoustic guitar intro followed by the heaviest, most lyrically intense song on the cd.   <br /> <br />Under a Total Blackened Sky (10/10)  -  Save some of the best for last.  An amazing piece of thrash brutality. <br /> <br />The Ancient Plague (11/10)  -  This song also has a very epic feel to it.  Great lyrics, leads, riffs...everything perfect.  There are spoken word parts that add an infinite amount of depth to the song.  \\"A savior appears, in a red mask in front of me...  And Satan is his name!\\"  <br /> <br />Overall, this is one of the most amazing albums I've heard in a really long time.  Great musicianship, lyrics, structure and perfect production (Andy Sneap).  Get the digipak version with the bonus DVD.  It includes making of footage and interviews for both the album and the Impossible Brutality video, as well as live footage of Phobia, Violent Revolution and the video clip for Impossible Brutality.  Oh, the packaging and artwork are both great as well.  With this release, Kreator has just crushed all the pathetic bands that are trying to market their watered-down MtV metal to unsuspecting victims (Slipknot, LoG, KsE, etc.)  Kreator once again shows everyone how real metal is done.  If anyone surpases this release in 2005, better yet in the next 5 years, I'll be extremely impressed. <br />
B0002G2B2M|2.0|don't believe the hype. this is a very tedious movie to sit through. the actors are all good but the story's ridiculous. and  worse than the ridiculous story is the boring way it's told, in never ending memory flashbacks (before they're erased). the movie bombed at the box office so you decide who's right. the critics who love it or the money paying movie goers who didn't. one other thing, what's the point of this movie? that if dopey little creeps (human beings) came into possession of miraculous technology they'd probably misuse it? that's the point of almost every science fiction novel written in the last 50 years. or is it that in love or life you must take the good with the bad. there's no new ground being mined here.

B000002KOY|4.0|It's a shame more people don't know about this album, a nearly forgotten treasure recorded in late 1970. Other reviewers on this site describe it well, so I won't add much detail, except to say that Carolay is a fantastic track with almost a Phil Specter-like sound and a very catchy melody. Had it been released as a single, it would have had top-10 potential. You never hear this song, or any of the songs here, on the radio today, which is too bad because they're better than most of the garbage that passes for classic rock on so many stations. <br /> <br />Many of the album's other songs are also memorable and enjoyable, and the guitars sound wonderful. I give the album four stars rather than five because a couple tracks aren't quite as good as the rest, but these don't detract much from the overall package.  <br /> <br />It's a shame that lead singer and guitarist Danny Whitten destroyed himself with heroin (he died at age 29 about a year after the album was released). Whitten, a former singing and guitar partner of Neil Young's (listen to Young's Everybody Knows This is Nowhere album from 1969 to hear how well the two sang and played together), had a fine voice, played a fantastic guitar and most significantly, possessed tremendous song-writing ability (I Don't Want To Talk About It, Downtown, Look At All the Things, etc.) that's really on display here. Had he lived, he might have become a big name in music. Young's Tonight's The Night album, released in 1975, was inspired by the life and tragic death of Whitten.
0767812387|4.0|I bought this DVD at a clearance sale and let it set in my entertainment center for months until one Sunday afternoon when I had nothing better to do, I popped it in the player. What happened to me next would surprise even my closest friend...I found myself spinning and gyrating around my living room with a fantasy partner, fully inspired to recharge my dance roots. Dance With Me ignited the passion for Latin dance that I'd buried long ago!  I replayed scenes over and over again.  I am now searching for a great dance class and purchased 3 Latin-saturated CDs, including the soundtrack to the motion picture \\"Salsa\\" (some of you may remember that from the 80's).      The trailer for this movie promises a steamy and sensual love story.  While sensual, I don't think I would use the word `steamy'.  It is mildly sensual with a touch of innocence.  Vanessa L. Williams (Ruby) and Chayanne (Rafael) do a great job playing off of one another.  I couldn't have hand-picked a better pair myself.  Much of the story line is predictable, but all in all, a very light-hearted romance with a bit of humor thrown in for good measure. A good watch; at least rent it.     You'd be surprised the things you will find when you have nothing better to do!
0345451325|3.0|I do have some issues with the way it was written. I'm also an English major, so some of my comments are tilted more towards the actual structure and grammar used, rather than the story (I'll comment on that too.)    1.  Stilted sentence structure.  Nylund could have done a better job with sentence structure.  There isn't a real flow with the sentences.  Nylund seems to stick with the same short sentences when describing something in detail.  This is something that bothered me, as it ruins the flow during already-slower times in the book.    2.  Detail.  Not enough detail is given to the inside of the Covenant ships and alien worlds.  For those who have played Halo, we get that vision in our head.  Those who haven't however, don't get a real vision as to what the Covenant look like.  We assume Reach looks like earth, we assume Sigma Octamus (sorry, writing this review at work, away from the book) looks like earth.  What if it doesn't?  Nylund could have done a better job with the details.    3.  More combat situations with the Covenant.  We see MC later on with tons of military medals (before the finale) and yet, we only get a glimpse of some of those battles.  Years and years passed by between the end of the first book and when the Covenant showed up, and all we get is near the end.      4.  I never got a real sense of the regular soldiers holding the Spartans in such a heroic status.  This could almost go back to #3.  We don't get a sense of growing appreciation and admiration of the Spartans by the regular soldiers.  By showing the Spartans whomping Covenant [...] early on, we would have a better understanding for the heroic status of the Spartan team.      Now, the positives.    1.  The story.  It is nice to see a human aspect to MC, and to see other Spartans as well.  Seeing the Covenant destroying everything in their path is also fascinating, as it shows the growing desperation of the human race to save themselves from complete and utter destruction.      2.Combat detail.  Nylund did do a good job describing combat situations.      3.  Dialogue.  I really enjoyed the dialogue from nearly everyone in the story.  Nylund did an admirable job with the dialogue.      Like I said, most of my negative comments have more to do with nitpicking, rather than overall story.  I did enjoy the story, but as an English student, I was disappointed with sentence structure and environmental detail.      Is it worth buying?  Probably.  Seeing the Master Chief before he was a glorified action hero is interesting.  Seeing other Spartans is interesting.  Seeing the war before Halo showed up is interesting.      I'm glad I bought it, but I do have reservations about it.  Hopefully the second book will be better.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Visuals, visuals, visuals, baby!  That's all I can say.  I immensely enjoyed this futuristic action/drama about how the effects of a technology-driven society can lead to the decline of basic human need.  Out to prove otherwise, Will Smith did a good job in his role as detective Del Spooner.  He maintained his humorous roots, but also let us sample a slice of his more serious and dark side.  That being said, I've seen him do better.  The script could have been juiced up a bit as well; some scenes were pretty predictable.  Graphically speaking, there aren't many other action movies out there that can compare. <br /> <br />It is a thrill ride indeed and I highly recommend its introduction to your ever-growing DVD collection.  Hint: Get the widescreen edition if at all possible.  Enjoy! <br /> <br />WILDFLOWER has spoken! (Smile just a little :-})

B00012L786|5.0|Pickpocket, b-girl and pinko nabbed in bizarre love triangle<br /><br />According to the Inspector, they \\"wasn't good and they wasn't smart.\\"  After the cannon grifted the dame on the train, he was hot.  The law wanted to pinch the booster on a fourth offence and send him up for good.  The muffin wanted to make happy her pinko boychik, who was just in it for the glory of Uncle Joe.  The stool pigeon wanted to make enough bingo to keep out of Potter's Field.<br /><br />  Okay, enough of that silliness.  Listening to filmster Samuel Fuller on the extras on PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET makes you want to speak in slang and punch in some yellow journalism touches (Fuller started out working for a yellow rag, one of the text specials tells us.)  This is the second Fuller film I've seen and the first one I could tolerate.  The characters here - Richard Widmark's  pickpocket, Jean Peter's b-girl, Richard Kiley, Thelma Ritter, are all living on the edge of society and emotions.<br /><br />  PICKUP is one of those convergence-of-the-stars movies where just about everything works at a high level.  Widmark and Ritter are brilliant and the rest of the cast is excellent.  The plot is smart and uncluttered and Fuller's direction is driving and emotional.  Highly recommended.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I give the movie 3.5 stars out of 5.  Overall it was pretty good.  I'm not sure it deserved all the Oscar hype though.  There is no glitz, glamour, or glory in this film, its just about two people (oddly at very different points in their lives) who connect while in a foreign country.  Bill Murray is pretty funny.  I guess you'd have to like him to like this film, which I did.  The movie made Japan seem very interesting and mysterious, it made me want to go there.
B000000OAN|5.0|A Night At The Opera tries, and succeeds, at being not just another hard rock album. From it's headbanging moments, like 'Prophet's Song', 'Death On Two Legs', and 'Sweet Lady, to to folk-influenced bizarre moments like 'Seaside Rendezvous' and 'Lazin' On A Sunday Afternoon'. And who could forget the three-piece rock epic 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. The song starts out as a rock ballad, with a strong piano line, but a driving beat. Then it strangely morphs into some sort of quasi-opera melodramatic section. And then it goes into full-on metal mode, with grinding guitars, thumping drums, and howling vocals. That song is probably the best song released in the 1970's and every fan of rock or metal should own some album with it on it. However, this would be your best bet. Go get this work of art right away.
B00014K5TQ|3.0|Whether the fault of the script, acting, direction or a combination of all three, I found myself equally irritated as some other viewers, wanting to turn the movie off before it even really got started. Much of the dialogue and character interaction was very simplistic, void of dimension. I felt the whole of the story would have been better set on stage than the big screen. <br /> <br />However, I do agree with other reviews that while the performances may seem plastic, that is exactly what the lifestyle is and was about. In that way, the movie is right on target. From the perspective of someone who has seen the inside of the club-kid world and known people like Alig and James St. James, it was actually somewhat disturbing. I had much the same feeling the first time I saw Spun.  <br /> <br />Would I watch it again, NO!...though I will buy the soundtrack. <br /> <br />Bottom line, if you want to get a good idea of what the club-kid scene and lifestyle is all about, rent, don't buy the movie. If you are hoping for any sort of meaning, depth or even a detailed how and why of the actual murder...get the shockumentary or read the book.
0790732203|1.0|I sometimes think that I'm the only person in the world that hates this film, but I detest it thoroughly. I had no idea what I was in for when I saw it during its theatrical run. One of my main objections is that the film minimizes, if not glamorizes, the impacts of prostitution. Prostitution is a very ugly, exploitative scene in real life, not the lighthearted fun that the film portrays. Not the best moral message, to be sure. <br /> <br />Aside from that, the other problem I have is with the characters. EVERYONE is a jerk in this movie. Nobody is appealing or likeable. Not even Cruise's Joel, who I found to be as much of a self-centered @#$%&*/ as everyone else. Unfortunately, he followed up by playing the same kind of obnoxious characters (\\"Top Gun\\", \\"Days of Thunder\\"). It took \\"Jerry Maguire\\" and \\"Rain Man\\" for me to gain any respect for him. <br /> <br />Anyway, the combination of a creepy, amoral theme and obnoxious characters in what is supposed to be a comedy is a total turn-off. Keep the kids away! <br />
B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater keeps making beautifull music. This album is a clear testament to that fact. They are the one band out there that is in the front lines, fighting to keep true progressive music fresh and alive.<br /><br />Scenes from a Memory shows their great growth as musicians. They just keep getting better and better with each new piece of work. Im glad that they dont try to make music just to sell records like so many bands do. Dream Theater makes the kind of music that they like, period. That's the reason why they have lasted so long. And that's why they will always be around.

B0006399FS|5.0|U2 is at a point in their career where it is very hard for them to please all of the fans that they have acumulated over the years. People want them to record another Joshua Tree or another Achtung Baby or another War. But the reality is that the magic of those albums can't be replicated.<br /><br />You can't ever expect a true artist to paint the same masterpiece over and over again. A genius artist has to keep exloring new horizons in order to grow. So if you are a true fan of U2, listen to the album without prejudice. You will be surprise how great this new album is. The songs and the music have the same great U2 quality that made them legendary musicians. I am glad and gratefull that they are still around and making REAL music.
B0000029DD|5.0|For some reason unknown to me I think this album has changed a lot about myself. Its influencive in a certain divine yet unknown way.<br /><br />I hadn't heard anything by Jeff Buckley before I heard this album. Now I am a very lazy person and for me to actually go and buy this record was an achievement in itself. I've been telling my friends about \\"Grace\\" and what it has done.<br /><br />It easily surpasses the endless number of albums I own. Its not the best. Its different and I think I hear an ocean of overwhelming melody charging at me each time I hear it.<br /><br />My favourite songs on the disc -<br /><br />\\"Mojo Pin\\" - This song can give the legendary \\"kashmir\\" a run for its harmony in sound. \\"Lilac Wine\\" I suggest this song to anyone who wants to know how deep emotions can be and how rotted a human mind can be. This is not music. Its a human's soul singing.\\"So Real\\"  is my favourite song of the album. \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" Honestly I have no idea wht this is about but its just so touching in grief that I feel I'm flying when I listen to it. \\"Grace\\" is a moody rocker. I thought he wasnt capable of this but it certainly will bring a smile or two to your face. Amazing song.<br /><br />Last but not the least \\"Eternal Life\\" Now this is the song I'd turn up and dance the F*ck out because it is just the most alive song in the whole album. Its the kind of a song that makes everything seem achieved. Its a drug , its a thought of unending considerations. Just when I think the album is over and i've heard it all ETERNAL LIFE smashes me into bits with its foot tapping,headbanging, wind chasing sound.I think it simply emphasises its groovy melody. It overrides any mood whatsoever and takes you in its control. I turned this up each time I'm driving to my girl's dismay. She knows how much I love Grace. I'll be gifting a copy to her soon.<br /><br />Respect for Jeff Buckley , thats all.
B0000028P8|4.0|This Mariah's 3rd album, a live album so the public can see that she is really the one singing in her albums and to justify why until that moment she hasn't had a national tour, she hits every can on known note and the public respond very weel to them.  <br />The album has only 7 songs: 2 from the Album Mariah Carey, 4 from her Emotions album and 1 extra, a cover from the Jackson 5 hit, I'll be there which she sinhs with her back up singer Troy Lorenz. <br /> <br />1. Emotions.- Great vocal, sounds great live. 10/10 <br />2. If it's over.- Not a single but one of her favorite songs, great voice. 9/10 <br />3. Someday.- Great use of her back up vocals, the rap sound very nice, very fun song. 10/10 <br />4. Vision of love.- Her trade mark song, she demostrates here the power of her voice, she reaches very high notes and the song sounds incredible. 10/10 <br />5. Make it happen.- Her latter single up to that date, lot of back up vocals. 9/10 <br />6. I'll be there.- The \\"new song\\" in this set, a remake from the Jackson 5 song, this one sounds so good, her voice has a melancholic tone that I really like, perfect. 10/10 <br />7. Can't let go.- Nice ballad, nice performance. 9/10 <br /> <br />Boy, she can really sing....
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I bought this record after asking the guy at the shop for &quot;something that rocks, and doesn't suck.&quot;  This CD completely fit the bill.  It's the kind of album that you can listen to over and over again, the hooks become like friends, and you hear them in your head when you're not even listening to the music.<br />Don't listen to the guys who think they are too cool for this disc.  Once more then 5 other people like the same band they consider them sellouts.  Listen to the album, judge for yourself.  <br />If you like the kind of music that rarely gets made anymore, something with a soul, something with a hook, then you will love this one.
B000148KK2|2.0|Like most of the reviewers, I have all of the CDs she made, my personal favourite being 'When I look in your eyes'. The next, 'The Look of Love' I found to be a bit contrived,clinical and just too slick. With the 'Other Room', she has done a complete 180 degree turn. I'm not sure if either she or her fans are quite ready for it. <br />Her musicianship cannot be questioned, her sidemen are top-notch, and the production is excellent. The problem that I have is the content. Although full of wonderfully complex chordwork, she seems to have lost the most important part...melody. It seems that the team decided to show off how well they could play, even though the songs take a lot more listening to than her previous material. <br />I understand the need for a change of direction sometimes, but with this collection, I reckon the signposts must have been aligned wrongly. Her 'Live in Paris' collection had her version of Joni Mitchell's 'A Case of You', a song that I never found particularly pleasing, and this latest offering from Ms Krall seems to be somewhat of an extension of this mood. <br />I'm not saying that she should go back to doing standard covers, but I would suggest she looks a bit further afield when choosing the material for her next offering, the songs she chose here are just not strong enough for mainstream play. <br />I didn't buy this CD, it was given as a gift...after listening to it for three weeks, I passed it on to a pal of mine who happens to be a jazz drummer. Hopefully he'll get something out of it that I missed....
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Of late, every movie featuring Tom Cruise seems poorly constructed, his characters flat. And until Jamie Foxx's appearance in Collateral and Ray, he was known almost strictly as a comedian. But the premise of the movie intrigued me. One night. Five hits. <br /> <br />I expected a mindless action flick, a B movie with cool stunts and fight scenes. Instead, I was rewarded with a real piece of cinematic genius, a character study of intriguing and odd personalities. Max is a middle class cab driver. He's never been exposed to violence except for the little he's witnessed in his cab. He's stagnant, afraid to follow his dreams or change anything, afraid of failure. This is the night he will truly come alive. <br /> <br />Vincent, on the other hand, came from a broken family. His father was an alcoholic, his childhood probably one spent sheltered in foster homes. This would have been in the seventies, and he would have faced ridicule and degradation from peers. His life is about control. He has to manage his environment, even Max. He uses public transportation to keep his anonymity. What's one taxi in the middle of a giant city? Indistinguishable. He's skilled, highly trained, ex-Special Forces. This is the night the armor he's so carefully constructed will fall apart. <br /> <br />Every time I watch this movie, I discover something new. And every time I watch, it delights me how cleverly directed and seamless the plot truly is. Michael Mann succeeds in providing major details about his characters without intense exposition or flashbacks. Clues to his characters' backgrounds can be found in the little comments and gestures they make. And there are enough twists in this drama to keep you one your seat all night.

B000002UAX|5.0|4 solo albums grudgingly packed onto one sprawling double LP. Dark? Yes, it's dark. The cover is misleading. I quite like this different, adversarial Beatles, that little bit of anger, that tension, just beneath the surface, unlike Sgt. Pepper, where they all got along and threw in every idea that they all agreed on.  <br /> <br />And so what if they were on drugs? It's great music. Naysayers, go back to your music-hospitals where you can play your sanitised substance-free music, nicely smile to your nice neighbour as you listen to The Corrs, Borrowed Heaven, and relax, safe in the knowledge that your minds wont be expanded and that this is all you will ever feel.
B0002XDODU|3.0|I have travelled 2200 miles round trip to one rammstein concert and 1700 another time. I am their biggest fan. <br /> <br />I expected a little style deviation in this album, however, and got it. I saw an interview with Flake, and he was saying he would rather write ballads - if you want to hear Rammstein listen to the first three albums. So I was very apprehensive about this album. <br /> <br />It is musically very good, no problem there. But I liked old Rammstein - crunching, scathing, heavy music. This album is heavy, but is mostly connected power cords without the crunch crunch. This is typical for any band, I guess, but typically for me I like their old stuff better. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I don't know if I missed something from the movie, but I didn't find it that great. Yes, I laughed a little bit, some scenes were very fun... but... the guy is so dumb that instead of laughing I was getting upset. I'm kind of dissapointed. Maybe I heard too many good comments about this film that I was expecting too much. My husband bought the DVD without watching it first based on the good reviews. We both watched it together and then we both regret the purchase, so if you are planing to buy this DVD without checking the movie first, I recommend you to rent it and then decide if you really want to buy it.  I guess 'Napoleon Dynamite' is not a movie that everyone will enjoy.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|OK. Loved the short film this was based on. And perhaps its brevity was the soul of its humor. Dunno. Napoleon Dynamite, however, seems to have traded in its precursor's chuckle and spark for little more than ironic elbowing and guffaws. This feature length version felt so heavily forced and the gags n setups so mean-spirited, I think my one true-felt moment of ironic laughter was seeing the MTV Films logo float by. (Wha??? MTV would bankroll something as aesthetically, culturally, morally, bankrupt as this film? Gasp!) No, audience sympathy isn't asked for till far into the picture, but Anti-hero comedy this aint. The film is marketed as and initially presents itself as a \\"Hooray for the Underdog\\" or \\"High-5 for Geek Culture\\" flick, but within the first 10 minutes, this pretense is shed and all we're left with is a chance to point and chuckle, and many chances to hope that, in our youth, at our worst, we were still so much cooler that that guy. Now, even by MTV standards, that's some pretty cheap comedy.

He reflects how much he misses her, how he hates coming here, and that her last words dealt with finding vanilla as she was making pancakes when she stroked to death.  With nothing to keep him here, John abruptly decides to join the Colonial Defense Force struggling to defend or annex other worlds in deadly competition with alien races for control of the few hospitable planets.<br /><br />As a recruit, John receives standard gear to include a much younger healthier body that is beyond the ability of most non government citizens to buy except the affluent.  Like his brothers and sisters in arms, he bonds with them as they are his family and his hope to survive one skirmish after another in many cases against superior aliens.  As his comrades die and collateral damage devastate civilian population, John begins questioning the worth war that enables a few to economically gain a lot at the cost of others even as he begins to ponder whether he is still human.<br /><br />Paying homage to Heinlein (Starship Trooper the book not the movie), John Scalzi provides a tense anti-war military science fiction thriller that will leave fans pondering what is war good for.  Readers will also wonder about who benefits from scientific advances and military operations and what actually a human is as science changes Homo sapiens.  The story line is action-packed once John enlists as the audience get inside his head while he goes from \\"youthful\\" awe to experienced cynic.  OLD MAN'S WAR is a terrific tale of a belligerent future in space.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00005KB9R|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Bob Marley. But outside of Jamaica, it seems like all anyone knows of reggae is Bob Marley. With \\"Burnin'\\" we get The Wailers, with Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer comprising the band. I always prefer bands to solo acts, and though Bob kept the Wailers name alive after he split with Tosh and Bunny, it was really just Bob and a backing group. With the Wailers, you get different voices (literally and figuratively) and different perspectives. And I always preferred male backing vocals for reggae (as opposed to Bob's later use of female vocals). <br /> <br />But as for the album -- the songs are great. \\"Put It On,\\" \\"Small Axe,\\" \\"Duppy Conqueror\\" and \\"Rastaman Chant\\" are all favorites of mine, and for those who like the bigger hits, you'll find \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" and \\"Get Up Stand Up\\" on there as well. The album is simply a classic, and anyone who claims to like reggae needs this CD in their collection (and should probably branch out from the Marley tree and check out other reggae acts like Jimmy Cliff, Toots and the Maytals, Desmond Dekker, et al.). If you don't have this one, buy it!
B0006399FS|1.0|Oh, dear, another bomb has been dropped.......I have to agree with the general feeling of being ripped off. Too Christian, too overdubbed, too right to be true is this album. Too many credits, too, for a band which 'returns to their origins'. The names of old haven't compensated for the coming of age of ideas. Now that I'm too old to rock and roll, I'd rather have Coldplay.......fresher and less predictable.

B0002DKCMG|3.0|The \\"Eurotrip\\" DVD has a Nude Scene Index as a special feature, which tells you what the makers of the film think is the strength of this 2004 comedy, to wit, the jokes might not work and the characters might not be interesting, but we have naked people.  More importantly, them have made them easily accessible for your viewing pleasure, so what more could you really ask for in a movie?  Oh, do not get me started on that score.<br /><br />The movie starts off as Scott Thomas (Scott Mechlowicz) has a really bad graduation day.  His girl friend, Fiona (Kristin Kreuk) dumps him and shows up at a party with her boyfriend, Donny (Matt Damon), whose not only in the band but has written a infectious new song called \\"Scotty Doesn't Know\\" that explains how in the dark our hero has been (there is both a sing along and a music video for this song by Lustra in the special features).  Then, to add insult to injury, he breaks off his e-mail relationship with Mieke, because he is convinced by his friend Cooper Harris (Jacob Pitts) that Mieke is a gay German guy who is just trying to hit on him.  Then his little brother Bert (Nial Iskhakov) explains that \\"Mieke\\" is not the German short version of Michael but rather of Michelle.  So Mieke is a hot young German blond woman who thinks that Scotty could be \\"the one,\\" and Scotty has just blown her off.  Apparently there is a lot that Scott doesn't know, including basic German.<br /><br />This turn of events explains why Mieke has blocked Scotty's e-mail and why he decides that the most important thing in the world is getting to Berlin to meet Mieke in the flesh, so to speak.  Cooper finds a way to get Scotty to England and comes along for the trip.  Since Europe is a fairly small \\"country,\\" they manage to hook up with their friends, the twins, brother Jamie (Travis Wester), who carries around the Frommer travel guide even though he has committed it to memory, and sister Jenny (Michelle Trachtenberg), who is considered one of the guys for some long that we are supposed to believe nobody (i.e., Cooper) has noticed she is a girl.<br /><br />At this point it becomes clear that the idea of this movie is to send the quartet to a recognizable European city and have them get a taste of the local culture and still get out of town alive.  But the big problem with this movie is that most of their problems have to do with sexual deviance.  That means the creepy Italian guy (Fred Armisen) who likes to wait for the train to go through a tunnel so he can sexually assault strangers and Madame Vandersexx (Lucy Lawless) at a S&M club (bring a flyer, get a free t-shirt).  Apparently the idea is that if people go to Europe to have sex rather than see museums, then they deserve to be punished by having horrible things happen to them, and while that sounds like a worthwhile position to take in these troubled times, it is not really that funny.  Neither is the idea that being homophobic is a necessary survival skill for daily living.<br /><br />Unfortunately \\"Eurotrip\\" saves the draw-droppingly bad part of the film for the climax, which I am sure seemed like a good idea at the time.  It takes place at the Vatican, which is a strange enough location to pick for our hero to finally catch up with the woman he loves, but as soon as a tour guide points out that the fancy rope behind the glass door is attached to bell that is only rung to announce the death of the Pope, you know things are not going to go well.  The fact that the chimney in the Sistine Chapel is not connected to a fireplace in St. Peter's Basilica certainly bothered me and while there may well be confessionals in the Vatican I have a hard time believing they would be used for such secular purposes.<br /><br />Another problem is that teenage girls have been played by young women in their 20s for so long that when you have an actual 18-year-old actress playing an 18-year-old character like Michelle Trachtenberg does in this movie, she still seems like a kid sister.  Besides, she also seems too smart to end up making the choice she ends up making just to have a European sexual experience (By the end of the film the lesson seems to be that those who cannot have sex in Europe only deserve to have sex with others who could not have sex in Europe, like it was an attempt to weed out a regressive gene or something).  After \\"Just Married\\" it was obvious that the only way for comedies about Americans traveling through Europe to go would have to be up, but who expected such a small incremental step like this movie?  But then 2004 was a really wretched year for comedies, especially at those aimed at the pocketbooks of the youth of America.<br /><br />There are some decent extras on this one, and not just because it takes a while to get to the point where you have heard \\"Scotty Doesn't Know\\" too much.  However, I have to admit I was disappointed that they only had a few scenes from the bootlegged version of \\"Eurotrip\\" that the writers found in New York City three months before the official DVD release (I have found memories of the bootlegged version of \\"Return of the Jedi,\\" with the camera trying to keep up with the talking heads being on the left and then the right in the final scene between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker).  In addition to being able to go directly to the nude scenes you can do the same for the unrated scenes (yes, there actually is a difference with regards to one or two of those).like a kid sister.

B00004RYZT|4.0|As other reviewers have stated, the Amazon review has INCORRECT translations of German.  \\"You hate\\" is NOT spelled \\"Du Hast\\" but rather \\"Du hasst\\" (or hat).  \\"Heirate Mich\\" means \\"marry me\\", not \\"worship me\\".  Anyone in a beginner's German course could translate the lyrics and understand the context, or barring that, use some minor effort to look up English translations of the songs on the internet.  Not only that, but the Amazon review focuses on rather old news of controversy rather than the merits of the music and performances.  The current Amazon review is not only dated, but seems to attempt to associate Rammstein's leanings with that of the Columbine killers.  Anyone familiar with R.'s music and interviews would know that they are quite \\"Left\\".  The Amazon review doesn't tell potential buyers enough about the Rammstein DVD, but it does rather illuminate the ignorance of that particular author.  Amazon needs to replace that review with something more apropos.  Considering the number of folks who have called Amazon on these errors, why hasn't the review been updated?  Shame on you, Amazon.com!    Oh BTW, I did very much enjoy the DVD.  However, I would recommend the Lichtspielhaus DVD as far superior.  I'd never even heard of Rammstein until a friend told me about them and loaned me the DVDs.  Sure, they're not everyone's cup of tea, but don't let phrases like \\"industrial metal\\" (or whatever lame label people use) scare you off.  I generally do NOT like \\"metal\\", but these guys are something else!  It's very richly textured music, very distinctive, thematic (and sometimes near-Operatic) and I also think the lyrics are worth the effort to understand.  (HINT HINT AMAZON.COM!)
B0002IQJUK|4.0|In this case, the hype is on-target: this was a fantastic record.  The songwriting is excellent and his voice and delivery are a match for the songs.  GREAT STUFF.
0671027387|1.0|I, like a large number of people have been introduced to Dan Brown via his marvelous The Da Vinci Code.  On finishing this, I read and enjoyed almost as much Angels and Deamons.  On the back of these two books, I decided to continue on, as I'm sure many other people have done with other novels he had written.<br /><br />What did concern me was the fact that his other books went by pretty much un-noticed until the success of The Da vinci Code.  Why?  Because they are increadibly poor.  I have just finished reading Deception Point, and I have to admit, I breathed a huge sigh of relief that I could finally move on to something else after enduring nearly 600 pages.  The storyline was thin, and the further into the book you go, the more ridiculous it becomes.  Far to often, it becomes too difficult to picture in your own mind what is happening as the description of action scenes is just so far fetched.<br /><br />My advice is enjoy and leave Dan Brown well alone after reading The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons.
6300273199|5.0|It's a great show - spine-tingling, but it REALLY REALLY needs to be released in dvd format so it can be truly appreciated. <br />Let's get this to happen people!!!
B000148KK2|5.0|There isn't much to say that others haven't already, but I think this may be Diana Krall's best effort to date. I have several of her other albums, and after listening to this one, it seems to find its way into my DVD player more often than the others. Her smoky voice and smooth piano make her far more than just another girl singer, and she deserves all the accolades she gets.This review is based on the Dual Disc version of this album. For those not in the know, the Dual Disc is a two-sided disc, one side which plays in most standard CD players, the other side being a DVD with the complete album in 5.1 surround sound and high resolution stereo. There are also two music videos there, as well. I listened to both sides, but the surround mix on the DVD side brings Diana and her trio right into your living room. Listening in surround makes the experience more intimate, as if she's singing only for you. Diana's voice is firmly anchored in center front, while her band wraps around you like a boa. There are textures in the music which are lost in the stereo mix. If you have a good home theatre system, you owe it to yourself to seek this one out. If your DVD player supports DVD-Audio, the experience will be that much better. But the Dolby Digital surround track is also surprisingly good, considering the compression used there. In any event, you need this Dual Disc! Waste no time!
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I went to my first funeral recently and of course afterwards I was wondering what my own would be like.  Apparently you have input in a few areas and one of them is music, and if I had my druthers I would like \\"Battle Without Honor or Humanity\\" by Tomoyasu Hotei playing as the casket is brought into the church.  It would be nice if my eldest daughter dressed up like Gogo Yubari, but that would probably be a bit much.  But right now that particular song has been playing on a continual loop in my mind and you can only play Chapter 13 of the \\"Kill Bill, Volume 1\\" DVD (which gives you Al Hirt's \\"Green Hornet\\" along with \\"Battle Without Honor or Humanity) so often and just listening to the little bit of the song on the main menu, after a bit of \\"Twisted Nerve\\" to set the stage, is sheer madness.  But the real reason I picked up the soundtrack for \\"Kill Bill, Volume 1\\" is so that I can play my song of the moment whenever I get into the car.<br /><br />Now, to be clear, while I am hooked on that one particular song and happy to discover that the song actually goes for a whole 2:28, it is not the only primo track in the collection.  The epic is a 10:30 version of \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\"/\\"Esmeralda Suite\\" by Santa Esmeralda starring Leroy Gomez.  There there is Luis Bacalov's \\"The Grand Duel\\" and then James Last & Gheorghe Zamfir and his pan flute for \\"The Lonely Shepherd\\" (4:20).  Then for short bursts of fun there is Charlie Feathers' \\"That Certain Female,\\" the whistling of Bernard Herrmann's \\"Twisted Nerve,\\" Al Hirt's \\"Green Hornet,\\" The 5,6,7,8's \\"Woo Hoo,\\" and an excerpt from Quincy Jones' theme for \\"Ironside.\\"  Then we can mention that the whole thing starts with Nancy Sinatra doing the Sonny Bono song, \\"Bang, Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down).\\"<br /><br />For my money that is ten prime tracks, which for a soundtrack albums is absolutely outstanding.  The only ones I have are, of course, Nancy Sinatra (my favorite female vocalist from the Sixties if you must know), and the theme from \\"Ironside\\" (I have a lot of CDs of television themes).  Since this is a Quentin Tarantino film there are a few audio excerpts from the film, O-Ren Ishi's speech as \\"Queen of the Crime Council\\" and most of the final dialogue of the film when the Bride tells Sofie Fatale \\"You're My Wicked Life\\" (which you will probably find ends too soon for your tastes).  But \\"Kill Bill\\" is about stunning visuals and great music rather than unforgettable dialogue in the tradition of \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"  In fact, if they had ditched the dialogue and added the two little bits of music that come at the start of the film before Nancy starts singing I would have been happier (being nostalgic over the \\"Feature Presentation\\" music is what happens when you get old).ow), and the theme from \\"Ironside\\" (I have a lot of CDs of television themes).

B00064X3FE|5.0|This album is Elton and Bernie's first attempt at a biographial concept of who they are and how they got there.  The work is amazing.  The songs are sculpted beautifully, with even richer vocals and orchestrations than those on Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.  This is absolutely Elton at his vocalistic best, evey song is a gem of wit and powerful emotion.  And is there a better EJ song than &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot;, sugar bear?  I think not!  An absolute must for any true fan of Reg and Bernie.
B00000IMTG|4.0|I'll keep it short.  I was a Rainbow fan before a Purple fan (my age is to blame).  RISING, LONG LIVE ROCKnROLL, and even DOWN TO EARTH rank as great records years later, at least in my book.  I ignored On Stage all those years; I heard it once and didn't appreciate it.  Now, listening to it cranked LOUD, I realize this is an AMAZING record. The performance is white hot, and is best appreciated in context: LOUD!!!  A great record.

B00005JMYI|4.0|Comic superstar Will Ferrell (Old School & Elf) delivers the top news stories like no other in the laugh-out-loud comedy \\"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\\". In the 1970s, chauvinistic news anchorman Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) and his cocky Channel 4 buddies are the most popular news team in San Diego. When competent news journalist Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) becomes the station's first female co-anchor, Burgundy plots to get rid of his new coworker at all cost. \\"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\\" is a marvelously entertaining comedy with great comic talent. The fun-filled summer comedy has a likable story, hilarious characters and some wildly amusing laughs. Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate have great onscreen comic chemistry. \\"Anchorman\\" also features a great supporting cast including Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Steve Carell, Fred Willard and Vince Vaughn, and funny appearances by Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and Jack Black.<br /><br />If you can't get enough of Will Ferrell, then \\"Anchorman\\" Extended Edition is right for you. The enjoyable comedy is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD has an enjoyable video transfer with good resolution, and a pleasant Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. This extended edition contains a decent audio commentary, numerous deleted scenes, funny outtakes, a short behind-the-scenes documentary and some side-splitting featurettes like \\"Ron Burgundy's MTV Music Awards Interviews\\" and \\"Ron Burgundy's ESPN Audition\\". With its very funny supplements and fine presentation, \\"Anchorman\\" gets a \\"B+\\".
B00005JN2Z|2.0|I originally rated this movie 3 stars, but after reading some of the other bad reviews, it reminded me of how this movie downward spiraled, so I now want to lower my rating to 2 stars.  The ONLY reason I am now giving it 2 stars is because of the song being played during the coyote scene.  Cool song, dumb movie.  Thanks reviewers for inspiring me to tell the REAL truth!
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Let me preface this by saying that it would be impossible to put Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson all in the same film and not have it be entertaining.  That said, \\"Love Actually\\" suffers from excess romantic contrivance and from having crucial character development hit the cutting room floor.   <br /> <br />Romantic sappiness is just plain funny and ridiculous to observe.  \\"Love\\" doesn't take maximum advantage of that angle as \\"Four Weddings and A Funeral\\" did, and this film suffers as result.  Still, there are genuinely funny moments, but their impact is blunted by the Gordian Knot of storylines.   <br /> <br />The women are limited to idealized stereotypes. This is clearly a film driven by the romantic urgency of the male characters.  Only Emma Thompson hints at characterization depth, but it appears that key elements of that story line got cut, so we don't see really her as anything but every-mom faced with aging and pilandering. The potential for Laura Linney's character is never realized.    <br />  <br />This film is worth investing a pleasant evening in, but \\"Love Actually\\" desperately needed a consult with the \\"Sex and the City\\" writers.  It turns out to be less than the sum of its parts.
B000002HD5|5.0|incredible album, honest, dark, open, willing, dwelling,haunting,sad,passionate,hard rocking. I will Never get over the opening track............................................
B00000IMTF|5.0|Another 5 star performance by Dio and Blackmore.  The best album that Blackmore performed on, though his best solo was yet to come on the next album, \\"Long Live Rock n Roll\\" on the song \\"Gates of Babylon.\\" <br />It opens with some great keyboards by Toney Carey.  It could only be described as classical psychadelic.  This rips into some mean guitar by Blackmore and Dio sings of the horror he finds when dealing with the \\"Tarot Woman.\\" <br />\\"Run With The Wolf\\" is another mean one with some wicked vocals by Dio and a mean riff by Blackmore.  Blackmore's soloing is extraordinary on this and the first song, but the best is still to come. <br />\\"Starstruck\\" and \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\" are good songs with the second a bit poppy with a simple hard riff and no solo.  \\"Starstruck\\" is about the horror of having someone overly infatuated with Dio.  \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\" more of a love song. <br />\\"Stargazer\\" is epic.  The singing among the best of Dio's career.  The mood is dark and dreary and it is about slaves building a tower for a wizard who wants to fly.  It opens up in the middle into a classical escapade with a long solo by Blackmore.  It nears the ending with the line \\"No sound as he falls istead of rising.  Time standing still then theres blood on the sand.\\"  Those who built the tower had believed in him and it ends with a vocal solo by Dio dealing with his despair and hope. <br />\\"A Light in the Black\\" is another epic song.  \\"I'm going home\\" is the main theme of the song.  \\"Did he really let us go\\" is another line from the song.  The soloing is even longer in the center of this song giving both Blackmore and Tony Carey time to do their stuff.  A very classically inspired song from beginning to end. <br />To sum it up.  Blackmore is on fire on this LP.  This is the best album he has ever performed on.  In addition to this I recommend, Machine Head, Burn!, Blackmore's Rainbow, and Long Live Rock 'n' Roll.  These are the albums where Blackmore shines, but this one tops them all. <br />Dio as he always did in the 70s and 80s gives us extraordinary gutsy vocals.  He clearly was the best vocalist of the 70s and 80s in any type of music. <br />.................................................................................................................................. <br />If you don't know the early history of Dio in the 50s and 60s, I have a So You'd Like to Know Guide that has a complete discography of all the recordings Dio did in the 50s and 60s.   There was about 40 songs and as of yet none of them has been released on CD.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I just got this album, and I have a message for all of you who say that Green Day has lost their edge. I haven't heard a lot of their early stuff, but I have heard enough to know that they have grown as musicians. Any half-rate garage band can slam on power chords all day, but it takes a band as good as these guys to make the music poetic. Please stop trying to label this as mainstream or punk and just enjoy this good music like you should.
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|I watched this movie with no expectations. I hadn't read the classic novel it was taken from nor am I some great literature expert. I like to be entertained..taken away from my regular old day-to-day grind..nothing more..nothing less. This movie did that for me. The action scenes were great and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I loved watching Peter O'Toole scenes, especially since he has always been a favorite of mine. His character's unquestionable love for his sons, no matter what decisions they made, was heartwarming to me. It was a great escape epic.
0060977493|1.0|I had one question after finishing this book:  Why?   <br /> <br />I picked up Roy's first novel after hearing and seeing it lauded everywhere as the most recent \\"Must Read\\".  Well, I was unimpressed. <br /> <br />First of all, I found Roy's writing style to be very choppy and unenjoyable.  It is written in the tone and speech patterns, I think, of an 8-year-old child, probably the main character when she was younger.  This was not charming or endearing; it was annoying and choppy.  Instead of getting a mature observation, opinion, or commentary on social values/life, I was left to anticipate with dread the random repetitions, and Capitalized Insignificant Non-comments (such as \\"An Ammu Shaped Hole in the Universe\\") that Roy uses throughout her book.  Surely such a life altering event is worthy of a more profound, or even just more thoughtful, observation. <br /> <br />Secondly, I found the story to be enormously depressing.  Not only does one event destroy their childhood, but we find in the last few chapters that their adult lives, their family, and their hometown has suffered also. <br /> <br />And most of all, I found the use of profanity by the voice of an 8-year-old narrator to be extremely disturbing. In the same breath as \\"An Ammu Shaped Hole...\\" this child is using some really bad language.  I read classics to escape everyday life, not return to it.  Had Roy not stooped to using this language, I might have been more forgiving of the other flaws in her book. <br /> <br />I did not particularly enjoy this read and I probably won't recommend it to anyone.  That said, this is Roy's first novel, and I do still have hope for more enjoyable novels in the future from her.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|Ok, I know the disc may have cut some tricks from the original mixes, but this is an INCREDIBLE album. <br />Please, beyond the looks and hype, these guys are a band that made a classic album. It holds up to time and harks back to a time when the world was fun, dark, dangerous  and deep. <br />a classic album that I have on vinyl on my wall behind Me. <br />Beautiful album cover, dark and deep songs with a beat to follow!
068987474X|3.0|I bought this book after my ex-boyfriend that I had been 'messing around' with (an \\"in the gray\\" relationship) 'broke up' with me (I wouldn't know the term for a guy that is your ex that you're messing around with breaking up with you!) Anyway, I was saddened, and looked to this book for some comfort in knowledge (knowledge is power). So I bought it, and read it.  <br />The main author \\"Greg\\" pokes constant fun at himself and it's pretty corny. I kind of got tired of his predictable corny writing style. In the end, it helped me sort out how I want to be from now on with romantic situations, so I guess you could say this book was worth it. I was kind of distracted throughout the book though with the cheeseball jokes.
B00005JKG5|5.0|I first saw this movie back in 1983 when I was just fifteen years old.  I think just about every teen age male had a SEVERE CRUSH on Jennifer Beals at that time , including myself.  In fact , I am still enamored by how good she looks to this present day.  She is now I think 42 and really has not changed at all from the pictures I saw when I went to [...] I just recently reviewed the film again a few days ago which makes it only the second time I saw it.  I found it to be very illuminating and it transported me back in time.  I got the same enjoyment as I did back then. True , a bit corny in some segments of the film , but what the heck , it was the 80's and thats the way it was.  Although J.Beals did participate in some of the dancing scenes , the majority of the dance scenes were done by a French dancer by the name of Marine Jahan (some people do not know this).  Initially , when I found out some years ago , I was a little disappointed to say the least. Make no mistake , this is an awesome film and I am still a fan of J.Beals. I have just witnessed some of her other low budget films and was impressed by her acting talents.  Unfortunately , she will always be labeled with the antiquated stereotype of Alex Owens in Flashdance.  I can live with that.  Also , I have just recently read that she is doing a series called the L Word on Showtime.  I'll have to check it out one day.  Without going into to much detail , the whole thesis of the movie is built around Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals) who is afraid of her ultimate dream which is to be accepted by a prestige dance acedemy in Pittsburgh.  Scared to audition , she is then prompted by her boyfriend and she finally auditions and is accepted.  Even if you did NOT grow up in the 80's , you will inherit some enlightment after watching this film.  Finally , I think that the film exhibited a moral code of ethics to the viewers as well. Rather than dancing in some sleeze nudity bar , the main character (Alex Owens) decides not to be influenced by some other bar owner to come and dance for him.  Out of all the 80's dance films that were out during the 80's decade (and there were some dumb ones), this is by far my top pick.  This movie will indeed give you a little adrenaline rush after you watch it. Set a few hours aside and judge for yourself , I dont think you will be disappointed.
B00065EB22|4.0|Apollo 10 is an excellent material, we're used to it with Spacecraftfilms. Dramatical pictures from low above the surface evoke the temptation the astronauts must have felt being so close and not being \\"allowed\\" to make it.<br /><br />Very interesting is the sequence from ascent/descent LM separation when the ascent stage went wild - I never knew it took actually only few seconds and astronauts managed to have it fully back under controll again. I always thought the incident took much longer ...<br /><br />I have, however, again a comment related to the landing footage. In my opinion there should be always used the film material where available, it creates the value added - TV landing footage is usually not very good. In this Apollo 10 case the film is used but the landing and recovery is cut to the minimum which is a pity - from the short sequencies it is obvious that the good quality material is available. And the landing/splashdown is one of the dramatical parts of the flight. It may be my personal opinion only but I would always welcome full film coverage of landing and recovery, I have never enough. It is simply different to the current runway touchdowns, the view of any spaceship coming back under the chutes is majestic.<br /><br />Another thing I find - say - uncomfortable is the \\"double deck\\" packaging, I do not think it's practical.<br /><br />Othervise excellent material, I give four stars for the short and incomplete landing and recovery part. It's definitely worth to have it.<br /><br />Laurenc Svitok, Bratislava, Slovakia
0446677450|2.0|There's been so many reviews that I feel that everything that needs saying has been said. Still I feel a strong need to give my take on this book. <br /> <br />The book does have many valid points which basically boils down to \\"maximize cash flow (assets)\\", \\"minimize expenses(liabilities)\\". It seems common sense but the book does point out that many things seen as assets, especially homes are also liabilites since they cost you money to own (mortgage payments upkeep, etc) that people overlook. The book also makes a point of looking at everything you own and spend in these simple terms which is a good thing. <br /> <br />But the problem is that from there, much of the book can easily mislead readers into believing that there exist some way to essentially earn money by acquiring high return income producing \\"assets\\" which requires little money, little risk and little effort that only \\"the rich\\" know but us employee wage-earning and money-saving suckers don't. But what are these assets? Kiyosaki might make you believe real-estate is such an asset. The fact is that real-estate investment is high risk, requires a lot of money and if you don't want to be eaten-alive and taken advantage of, a lot of homework and hardwork. Think you can just buy an apartment building and just sit back and rake in the dough? Think again. <br /> <br />The truth is that Kiyosaki, and those like him, can make far more money selling you their \\"proven methods\\" than they ever could employing those methods themselves. The only available evidence leads one to believe that Kiyosaki has amassed whatever wealth he has by selling his methods, as opposed to employing them. And despite Kiyosaki's disdain for making money by actually working (either as an employee or even self-employed), and saying you should \\"own businesses and have others run it for you\\" what is he doing but working himself running his RDPD business, writing books, running seminars, making infomercials, etc while charging insane amounts.Why didn't Kiyosaki retire and live off of so-called \\"passive income\\" himself? <br /> <br />(Unless you are gullible and think he does it for charity or because he just enjoys running his RDPD enterprise as a recreational hobby). <br /> <br />If the book leads you to get your house in order and do your homework on getting a plan together to gain finacial security and independence eventually (or come as close to it as possible), then it has some value. But if you get from the book the idea that you need to spend more money on Kiyosaki's books and seminars because he has the key for your financial future then indeed it is dangerous and will only make Kiyosaki richer and you poorer.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|The violence in this movie (including sexual violence) overshadows many valuable elements of the film.  The themes could have been conveyed and the characters could have been developed without showing every graphic detail of gore.   <br /> <br />We are, of course, supposed to learn that life during the Civil War, especially in the South, was horrific.  Depravity was rampant.  People turned against their friends and neighbors.  When the patriotic, well meaning, men were out fighting in the war, their families faced great peril at the hands of the enemy from the North and the enemies from next door.  Furthermore, the evils of American slavery had weakened Southern society accross the generations. This made it that much easier to translate anger and fear into violence and murder.  People did whatever they thought would help them to survive, and their methods were often cruel and animalistic.   <br /> <br />So, I got it.  The messages of the movie are clear.  The story is   riveting.  The characters are deep and fascinating.  The acting is superb.  So, why lean on the crutch of graphically portrayed carnage?  In 1939, \\"Gone With the Wind\\" (GWTW)was able to convey the horror of the time without displaying minute by minute violence.  There is a reason that, 65 years later, GWTW is still one of the best movies in existence.  I doubt that \\"Cold Mountain\\" will come close to standing the test of time.  <br /> <br />This is a disturbing movie that should be avoided by children and sensitive viewers.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is absolutely fabulous.. It is so funny I almost died. Some people will watch this and not get it because the character are too real. Nepoleon does not look and act like every other hollywood 'nerd' who is just a rich super model looking guy dressed down a little. This guy 'is' that guy from high school in the late 80s. If you didn't get this movie, you were probably a jock or a goody goody who never experienced the lifestyle of people like napoleon and his friends. That would be unfortunate for your character!

B0000CAXIC|5.0|this is one of the first foo fighters albums i ever heard and even after hearing more of there albums and buying the dvd. this is the best work they've done.this album has more of an agressive feel than thier other works.the only problem i have with the album is that some of the slow songs are a little too mellow.
0553212737|5.0|I confess:  I often read Jane Austen as an exercise in self-discipline.  However, caution should be exercised in reading her books.  Little surprises turn up which force a certain circumspection of all characters and events.  In \\"Emma\\", we meet with the practice of \\"giving up\\" children, illegitimacy and the concomitant existence of, and suspicion of, extra-marital sex, flirting clergymen who, naturally, view courtship as a Machiavellian enterprise, egotism, snobbery, hypochondria and maybe even a little attention deficit disorder--heroes, heroines, villains alike.  It is a great tour de force.  Austen draws her characters well--who hasn't met a Miss Bates or a Mrs. Elton in their lifetime?  Finally, also watch out for those little dollops of wisdom interspersed throughout--they pop up, wake you up and then are gone, leaving you in the midst of the question of just what is the best way to prepare a piglet's leg.
B000059MEK|5.0|This is one incredible album. I love the way that this album doesn't just include one style of techno and has a wide range of diffrent music. Some of my favorite songs from the album are; <br /> <br />One More Time- 9/10 The first single that came out. No complaints. Very catchy single with an incredible beat. does get a titchy bit boring after the 10,000th time you hear it...but the 9,999th other times are all great! <br /> <br />Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger- 10/10 Yes!! one of the best songs on the album i love the way they change their voice and the beat rocks everything. This is the song you listen to when you get ready to get back on the field for sports or if you like drama, when you get ready to take the stage, Very powerful. <br /> <br />Something about us-100000/10 My favorite song on the entire album and one of my top 3 songs ever!. This song is slow and the lyrics are short but very very very very very very sweet. The lyrics are so dern simple yet very beautiful. Even if you take out all the other great songs in this album, except this one I would still buy it. It really is a great song, and I reccomend it to everyones. <br /> <br />Discovery Album (the album itself)-10/10 this album is great because it doesn't have just 2 or 3 songs that are the only \\"singles\\".. this whole album just flows when you listen to the album at once. If you love the album go and check out the Story of the Secret Star System DVD, which is the whole entire album played with a japanese cartoon which is equally beautiful.!
B0006FO9J2|5.0|DON'T PAY OUTRAGEOUS PRICES, GO TO A REGULAR RECORD/VIDEO STORE AND GET IT FOR $20 OR UNDER....IT'S WORTH IT!!! I must say, I've been a fan for a long time (like everyone else). THIS IS DEFINETLY A MUST...it tells the WHOLE ENTIRE story up until 1983. How they came up with Eddie, how everyone got kicked out of the band, how they joined, how this, that, everything!!! Interviews with past members, Old school shows...JUST GET IT!!!

0440234743|4.0|I just finished reading this book and I have to say it kept me on my feet. I enjoyed reading this book though before I even started the book I thought it wasn't going to be that great but since it was a Grisham book I gave it a chance and I am very happy that I did. It was adventurous it went from the courtroom to a search in Brazil. I recommend this book.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|This DVD is incredible, it matches the great synth of Daft Punk with beautiful japanese animation. If you love the Discovery Album by Daft Punk you will be knocked off your feet when you watch this dvd because it places the music so in sync with the movie which makes it flow very nicely. <br /> <br />Reccomended for anyone who loves Daft Punk or Japanimation in general.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|The first time I watched this movie, I laughed so hard I almost thought I was going to wet my pants, but I also thought it was incredibly dumb.  There's just something about it, though, that just draws you to it over and over again.  Each time I watch it, I like it more and more.  I think this has to do with getting the little jokes that you missed all the times before that.  Plus it has some of the best quotes in the world.  Would I watch this movie again? Heck, yes!!
B000002N25|5.0|Avant d'couter cet album, j'aimais beaucoup la musique de Mark Knopfler. Maintenant, je ne peux plus m'en passer. <BR>La prcision et la richesses de ses sons de guitare, la varit de ses rythmes, la beaut de ses mlodies, tout y est! Il explore aussi de nouvelles voies (ou revient tout simplement  ses racines) avec des arrangements exceptionnels jous par de non moins exceptionnels musiciens irlandais. Le son du bouzouki, de la flute irlandaise, de l'accordon et du violon se fondent merveilleusement bien  celui des guitares magiques et de la voix unique de Mark Knopfler.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie represents 89 minunits of my life that I can never get back.  The charactar looks funny, but isn't.  Some of the antics are almost funny, but aren't. <br />I think that this movie is so bad, that people who like bad movies will like it.
B0000AOV85|5.0|After watching this documentary on the making of the Dark Side of the Moon, one question kept popping into my mind: Why can't these two legendary musicians (Waters & Gilmour) put aside their differences and reconcile? It has been over 20 years since the bitter split of Pink Floyd, yet we, the fans are left with little to no hope of ever seeing this band reform and play their classic music just one last time. Alas, I digress, the DVD itself is a fascinating look into the making of the Dark Side of the Moon album, track by track. All four members are featured in extended interviews giving their memories of making what would become one of (if not THE) greatest rock albums ever recorded. Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright look like old men, wait a minute, they ARE old men; nevertheless it is shocking to see the then and now pictures of the band. Roger Waters has some very lucid memories concerning the meaning of his lyrics for Time, Brain Damage and Money. David Gilmour not only speaks of the recording and mixing of the album, but he also plugs in and plays some classic Dark Side tunes. Richard Wright, as well, plays some of The Great Gig in the Sky and Us and Them while opining about how he discovered the chord progressions that would become history. Nick Mason is scattered throughout the film but certainly states that this was the best that the band had ever gotten along. Was this the creative apex of Pink Floyd? It certainly was the most democratically made Pink Floyd album with all four members getting their ideas through, as opposed to the later years (The Wall and The Final Cut) where Waters basically ran the show. Some other points of interest include an extended interview with Alan Parsons who was the session engineer and mixed the album almost perfectly. Throughout the film, Waters speaks of the duality of man and of empathy and how the world is sorely lacking it today. Mr. Waters, why can't you show some empathy for your former band mates and legions of fans around the world and put the Floyd to bed properly? Highly Recommended to any classic rock fan, but an absolute must for Pink Floyd diehards.es and legions of fans around the world and put the Floyd to bed properly?

B00005LOUS|1.0|The original Dr. Seuss Story on How The Grinch Stole Christmas was a mere half hour cartoon.  The original cartoon version kept it simple without any extended sidebars and remains more successful.<br /><br />Ron Howard tries to exaggerate this story and more or less fails quite miserably.  Jim Carrey tries his best but even he comes up short with his over-exaggerated antics.  The other actors and actresses in Whoville just sit there and take up space.  They just all look like a bunch of wierdos without adding an ounce of humor in this attempt at making a childhood story into an adult oriented comedy.  Truthfully I wonder if this movie should have ever been made.  Its not a children's tale with its crass language and scenes.  And the humor is so cheap that any normal adult would find it sophmoric if not downright stupid.<br /><br />If you like a good Christmas fable, seek out the original cartoon.  This mess of a movie just does not cut the mustard.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|First off, i just want to say that i have never seen a movie recieve as much attention as Napoleon has. The word of mouth that kept it in the theaters for five months is unheard of, and it is in the top ten favorite movies that i have. Napoleon Dynamite is an unlikey hero, but in Preston Idaho, anything is possible. With is best friend Pedro, and his girl interest Deb, the slapstick humor, and off the wall bantor is hilarious, and the randomness will keep you laughing all the way to the second viewing. I believe that if you like randomness and people making Sweet moolah! you will love this movie. Ignore reviews that cite this as trash, and a waste of time, their taste in humor isn't refined enough to appreciate this movie anyways.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|to watch this and know that no more will be coming out. I had never heard of firefly at all until is was already off the air, and recently borrowed a friends dvd set to watch. My wife and I watched a dvd per day and blew through all of them in no time, and even had to turn to the dreaded bonus features just to get one last taste of firefly! We immediately bought a set of dvds for ourselves so we can watch it over and over again...  <br /> <br />I'm really glad they are making a movie to follow on, but a movie is only like 2 episodes and the stories you can develop in a movie are just not up to those that can be told in a good tv series. I'm going out of my mind knowing that it was cancelled with all the other garbage out on tv sticking around for multiple seasons. I really wish it could be resurrected, but lets face facts people, I've never heard of a show being brought back after cancellation years in the past. Nothing to do but pull our hair out, grit our teeth, and rewatch the dvds until our eyes are bleary. Damn!
B00004XONN|5.0|On \\"Kid A\\", Radiohead abandon their guitar-heavy epics in favor of claustrophobic electronica. So, out with guitars (for the most part), in with keyboards. Compared to past efforts like \\"The Bends\\", it's extremely cold and distant.     The chilling \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" establishes an uneasy mood right off the bat between the eerie chord progression and the cut up vocals. It's very sterile and uninviting.     Songs like the title track and \\"Treefingers\\" are the most ambient things on here. The former has a toy-like piano melody, making the whole thing sound like some perverse, alien nursery rhyme. The latter is purely instrumental (think Brian Eno).    The sweeping, atmospheric \\"Optimistic\\" is the most rocking thing on here, and it has the most immediate hook (by far). The production is absolutely glorious. As is \\"The National Anthem\\", whose throbbing bass leads into a cacophonous blast of horns.     \\"How To Disappear Completely\\" features gentle accoustic guitars, synthesized strings, and heartbreaking lyrics; immensely melancholy, yet beautiful.     Other highlights include the shifting, volatile \\"In Limbo\\", the wistful, gorgeous \\"Morning Bell\\", the lo-fi ballad \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" (the moment where the harp comes in on the latter is the most beautiful moment in a Radiohead song), and \\"Idioteque\\", which is dance music ala Radiohead.    The truth is, if you could appreciate \\"OK Computer\\" (not a straightforward album by any means), you *should* be able to appreciate \\"Kid A\\". It just may take a lot of listens and a lot of patience.     Best Songs: Kid A, Morning Bell, In Limbo, Optimistic, Everything In Its Right Place.
B000002JS8|4.0|Whereas I am not a revvered fan of AC/DC, this CD rates as their best to my ears.  These hard rocking aussies still pack plenty of slam bam razors edge hard rock on this recording.  However, many of the tunes have a catchy yet slick arrangement which sticks in your ear.<br /><br />The first four songs are truly excellent.  The opening riff on Highway To Hell is very captivating and the song stays very focused throughout.  Girls Got Rhythm is a another super driving tune that hooks the listener.  Walk All Over You and Touch Too Much keep the pace going.<br /><br />The other tunes are certainly not bad.  Love Hungry Man actually goes at a different pace than the rest of the tunes. And there are some good ellabroate gutiar solos that kick off Beating Around The Bush But the final track, Night Prowler closes the CD on a very high note.  That tune certainly sets a scary note between the crunching gutiars and Bon Scott's gritty scary vocals.  At least old Bon went out on a high note with his last recording.<br /><br />You really have to like your rock n roll good and hard to appreciate AC/DC.  However, its the focused tunes coupled with the clever arrangements by John \\"Mutt\\" Lange trell me that this is the AC/DC record to start with.
B00005JMYI|5.0|I watched Anchorman for the second time the other day after buying the unrated DVD edition. I really enjoyed it both times, the humor is on, and i believe this is will ferrell's best film to date. From subtle humor, to flat out crude humor, Anchorman will keep you laughing the whole time. Brick Tamland cracks me up everytime i hear him say \\"I love lamp\\". You too will be quoting lines til the end of the day. I really liked this movie, and will ferrell is the hottest comedic actor on the planet right now. Thanks for reading, and be sure to check this movie out if you haven't.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Treat yourself now so when the movie comes out you'll be able to say \\"I was in on the ground floor of this\\"  You will be the envy of all of your friends when the movie comes out (and is HUGE) and you already know more than any of them while heading to the movie theater.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|i love when albums have a theme throughout and muse has created one of the most perfect albums with this idea. <br />the music is very different, and though many europeans love it, most of america doesn't really listen to or even seem to know who muse is. <br />it's a bit of techno, new wave, hard rock, mixture.  hard to explain, but just soooo good.
B0000541AM|1.0|I expected SO much more from this. I was very excited when i saw that my favourite film \\"The Warriors\\"  was being released finally on DVD format. But when i finally saw it.  the disappointment was huge. The movie itself is a gem. but the special features were lacking to say the least. In fact, the  DVD offfers very little aside from the movie,  They include the trailer at least. but as someone who  had 3 or 4 versions on VHS(most of them edited for tv versions)  the TV versions would show additional footage not seen in the original VHS release. Scenes such as  the Gang meeting on the Boardwalk  at the films opening  were not included as \\"Deleted scenes\\" or as \\"Extra Footage\\" and  these scenes bring a whole new outlook  to the film , especially as they were some  of the very  few daytime scenes. I guess its good enough for now that it is finally out on DVD, but lets hope they release a proper anniversary or special edition DVD which gives this film the respect it deserves. be  looking good!!
0743216458|3.0|First of all, I was very entertained by the Band of Brothers miniseries on HBO a couple of years ago, and my interest in that show encouraged me to buy the book upon which it is based. <br /> <br />While I enjoyed this book (I especially enjoyed reading about what the men of Easy Company did after the war, though I felt this section of the book was far too skimpy and brief) I also felt that it did a bit of disservice to other fighting units for the sake of praising Easy Company. <br /> <br />I especially took offense to Ambrose's quote of an Easy Company soldier (Major Winters himself) referring to USAAF men as \\"air force slobs.\\" I will concede and praise Easy company for their heroics, however to refer to air force crew as \\"slobs\\" is utterly insulting. Ambrose wrote \\"Wile Blue,\\" about B-24 bomber units, so he himself should have known of the absolutely catastrophic death rate for air force crew even into 1945, when the 3rd Reich was on its last legs. He needs only to take one look at the list of bomber crew who successfully completed the 24 mission (later lengthened to even more missions) tour of duty to see how relatively few managed to do it before getting blasted to pieces by flak, having 30mm cannon shells from Fw190s crashing into their bodies, or the depressing horror (before late 1944) of watching fighter escort turn for home and leaving the bombers alone to the enemy fighters for the rest of the trip. The frosbite suffered by easy company on one campaign was a constant companion for all air crew. Ask any former B-17 pilot what it was like to come home with dead crew, wounded crew, many of whom were just high school boys, and it is clear how close the crew of any bomber became in combat.  <br /> <br />I also felt is was unfair of Ambrose to praise the 506th easy company regiment at the expense of other divisions of the airborne (17th and 82nd) and even at the expense of other units of the 101st. Naturally men from any unit will think highly of themselves (and deservedly so), and this IS a book only about E company, however Ambrose sort of gives the impression (I know he didn't mean to, but that's how he came off to me) that the American army was just so-so and the men of easy company were better than them all. Really? I think the men of the 82nd might have something to say about that. Or the ranger battallions. Or men of the Coldstream Guards. Or the men of Liebstandarte Adolf Hitler and Das Reich at Kharkov 1943, or Colonel Student's paratroopers at Crete 1941. Or men of the 3rd Army. Or the men of the Eight Air Force. If it weren't for the air force crippling the Luftwaffe I highly doubt Easy Company could have succeeded as they did. German fighters would have eaten the Normandy drop for dinner, and strafed everything in sight. That they did not is a tribute to the \\"air force slobs.\\" <br /> <br />
B000001FYL|3.0|I first heard this record in 1991, when my older sister had posters of Jon Bon Jovi all over her bedroom walls and, naturally, owned almost every Bon Jovi record ever released. To my thirteen year-old ears, this record sounded very heartfelt, moving, and grand, in an Old West kind'a way. I thought it was the perfect companion to Young Guns II, although I was a bit disappointed at the fact that Jon Bon Jovi's first solo outing had been tied to a movie's theme, as opposed to his own ideas. I was also pretty disappointed with the lack of Ritchie Sambora, and wanted desperately for Jeff Beck to disappear.  <br /> <br />Almost fourteen years later, I now find this record just a little bit cheesy. The melodies are quite catchy, though, and not all that different from past and subsequent Bon Jovi records [particularly its immediate predecessor, New Jersey]. The oddest thing for me is that I am now a bigger fan of Jeff Beck than Ritchie Sambora. So, ironically enough, it's Jeff Beck's contributions that bring me back to the record. Are they worth it? Not really, no. Beck has done much better work.  <br /> <br />I guess that sense of \\"could've been better\\" is my ultimate verdict on this record: It's pretty decent, but nothing truly groundbreaking or innovative. I would've preferred a Jon Bon Jovi solo were he explored new ground, stretched a bit [my favourite track, for example, is \\"You Really Got Me Now,\\" the one track that sounds more like Light Blues than Light Pop Rock]. For what it's worth, though, it could've been a lot worse.
B0002X314C|5.0|In a generation where we do not have \\"true\\" talent, this album shines and then you realize that all hope is not lost for \\"real\\" music. As we cling to Alicia Keys & Jill Scott to provide us with what we need, holding on for dear life as our ears are screaming for real music, here comes John Legend....and not a minute too soon!! Ahhhh it's like a cold drink for my thirsty soul. John has soulful melodies that old and young alike will appreciate. In a world full of hateful and ungodly music, music that misguides anyone that listens to a corrupt world of drugs, violence and mayhem, I am thankful that John Legend has been blessed with a god given talent that he is eager to share with the world!
0156027321|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone in college or higher who yearns for a deeper understanding of religion, who searches for inner meaning, who contemplates the ends of raw emotion.  This may even be appropriate reading for \\"deep\\" teens. <br /> <br />This book touches on character - whether a man is defined when he is in the social arena or defined during his solitude.  It provides a look at survival - survival of dogma and human behavior and animal behavior.  It examines true emotions - anger, hate, longing, despeartion, agape, friendship - and led me to review my own emotions. <br /> <br />This is not a book for general audiences.  You must put your stomach aside while diving into the character.  Becoming PI will both starve you and fill you with life's abundance. <br /> <br />
B0000TLA9G|4.0|I am the former, and not the latter, and I have this album just to add to my GNR collection. A GNR Greatest Hits album wasn't really neccessary. You either love GNR or you don't. Plain and simple. Most people I know fall into either one of these categories...The only people I know who just like a few GNR songs are girls...I don't intend to sound sexist, that just seems to be the way it is. I'm sure it's not always the case, but just that case in my experiences. So just to make this easy, here's reasons why you should, or should not, buy this album: <br /> <br />REASONS YOU SHOULD: <br />-You are a completist and want to have every official album released by the band or label. <br />-You buy this for \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" while not the best cover they've done, but now you can find it on a GNR CD instead of searching out the soundtrack to Interview with the Vampire. <br />-You only like/know the hit songs and don't ever feel the need to own the original albums <br /> <br />REASONS YOU SHOULDNT: <br />-You have all the original offical albums and don't need a CD that has the exact same songs on it <br />-You don't care much for \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" and don't feel the need to shell out cash just to get it on here <br />-It has no rareities or other treats, and a few tracks are edits <br /> <br />That is my biggest pet peeve is that there are a couple of edited songs on here, but, then again, if you own the originals, this matters not. Buy this to complete your GNR collection or just to grab all the casual songs you need. Otherwise, you can save a few bucks and just leave this. Could have been a bit better.  14/14* <br /> <br />*full rating for quality songs but 4/5 stars for lack of more material
B0000AFX64|3.0|Saw this for no good reason when it came out in theatres. Series had actually been on TV already (like with Buck Rogers), but ad promoted film in 'SENSAROUND'! Ooooohhhh...<br /><br />Besides making the theatre vibrate, the only thing different/better about the film is Baltar gets beheaded. Which makes it hilarious when he's back the next week on the series.<br /><br />Good times.

B0002ZDVF4|5.0|don't try to understand it except in the most superficial manner. Bourne, the supposed rogue agent that, because of his robotic training as a government killer has amnesia and is rtying hard to hide in the hiterlands of a small beach village in India no less. Well, like his old CIA handlers have said when you are a rogue killer, even with amnesia, there's nowhere in the world you can really hide, sooner or later they'll find you.....  <br /> <br /> <br />And so they do, but instead of killing Bourne they kill his girlfriend forcing Bourne to face his demons and try to backtrack his amnesia plagued memory to find who is trying to get him killed.  <br /> <br /> <br />The movie is an action flick with a capital 'A' as we move from India to Italy, Germany and then Russia.  It's one of the better easy going entertaining films around today ....

I can't watch it on TV, and if I make it to the seven-inning-stretch of a live game it is due to a combination of free tickets and a good conversationalist in the next seat. <br /> <br />That said, I've enjoyed Michael Lewis' \\"Liar's Poker,\\" \\"Next,\\" and \\"The New New Thing.\\"  So I gave it a shot. <br /> <br />Michael Lewis manages to make the economics of baseball interesting entertaining by following Billy Bean's management of the Oakland A's, winning a tough division despite a cripplingly low budget for player's salaries.  Economics itself is a difficult subject to make compelling prose of, but Lewis proved he could do that from his first book.   <br /> <br />For someone who finds himself disgusted, not so much with the amount of money in professional sports, but the inscrutable way that money is distributed among owners and players, it is exciting to read about a guy doing what EVERYONE in pro sports says is impossible.  It's not David and Goliath with some sort of divine intervention or freakish streak of luck: it's David beating Goliath by being willing to look at the problem a different way. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book for anyone who is fascinated with the debunking of conventional wisdom, or who loves seeing someone make the unjustly wealthy look flat-out stupid. <br /> <br />If you're a baseball fan, especially one who roots for an underdog or small-market team, I can only imagine that the book would be that much better.   <br />
0064407667|5.0|I've read several reviews knocking this book. So, here is an opinion from a 5th grade teacher who reads this book to her class every year.  <br /> <br />First of all: it is NOT Harry Potter, nor is this novel trying to be. Yes, the books are dark. But, to those who say they are inappropriate for kids, look in the news. Most children don't live a sunny, happy existence. Kids who have tough lives can relate to this novel and it will not do any damage to kids who come from happy homes. <br /> <br />Second of all, I feel the novels are fantastically written for a 4th/5th grade level. Snickett does explain word definitions. This is not dumbing down since the one thing most kids struggle with is reading comprehension. If they can't understand it, you won't enjoy it. <br /> <br />Lastly, this is one of the only books that I read aloud that my class shows any interest in. They laugh at Count Olaf, they gasp when he slaps Klaus. If The Bad Beginning grabs children's interest and causes them to read the whole series, think of how much the kids are reading. The only way to be a better reader is to read! <br /> <br />I would thoroughly recommend this book.
0451526295|3.0|It's hard to review this book in the way that I prefer to: subjectively and unselfconsciously. I don't want to be particularly conscious of the fact that I'll be reviewing a book while I'm reading it - the reading should be for its own sake. Moreover since I'm not writing under any commission or compunction I should be unconcerned about reactions. I don't have the time for lots of rewrites, and if most of the point of the exercise is personal pleasure it's absurd if I'm writing as a chore.<br /><br />However ... I can't shake the knowledge of approaching Austen as part of the canon of English Literature. Her sacrosanct words have been praised and pored over unreservedly for centuries and her fans are legion (a sister of mine could virtually site you chapter and verse of any sentence you read her). Offering an opinion of anything she's written places you in the sights of a whole genre - as opposed to, say, mentioning that you didn't enjoy the last Clancy thriller. It's like that old line about responding to a da Vinci: it's not the painting that's being judged.<br /><br />So with all that baggage, onto the review.<br /><br />It was refreshing to spend some time in a book so different to most others I read. Once you've got your 19th century language `sea-legs' (something that generally settles after a few chapters) the novelty is no longer an obstacle to enjoyment - quite the opposite. Moreover the structure of the book felt different: Austen has no problem having major characters suddenly virtually disappear, as with the Miss Bertrams. Also there's the usual pleasure of stepping outside the assumed values of your own century - there's nothing that quite highlights your own assumptions as reading those contrary ones of different times.<br /><br />That being said, this book is quite didactic, stiflingly so in the first half where I was growing weary of the sheer volume of gratification I was supposed to gather by the constant belabouring of Mrs Norris' abundant shortcomings - or rather of her single, if major, shortcoming. I wasn't at all clear on whether we were meant to wryly smile at (the now unfortunately named) Fanny's naïve blanket moral condemnations of just about everyone except Edmund, or rather to similarly look down upon the characters with the assured condescension of the author herself. Did Austen so blithely judge, rank and dismiss those of her own acquaintance with the regal arrogance she did with these fictional characters? The right way to interact with society it appears is to almost instantly decide the quality of the character of the person you meet, and to not be swayed from your initial assessment: Fanny's severe and almost universal moral condemnations are utterly vindicated at the novel's unambiguous conclusion.<br /><br />I suppose I found the ubiquitous censure uncomfortable: Wodehouse could poke fun at languid, self-indulgent aristocrats without requiring our contempt. To relish this Austen I feel you have to relish your smug superiority over most everyone.<br /><br />Yeah, I suppose it's the smugness that dilutes the pleasure of this highly developed morality tale. Along the way we get an ably narrated window on two lifestyles of the early 19th Century. For all of Austen's theme that virtue overrides wealth (and, indeed, that wealth and indolence are a great danger for the young), class is massive: probably the first thing you need to know about a person, even before you know their character, is what they're worth. Have we changed all that much since then? I suspect so: at least now it's somewhat bad form to inquire about and discuss the relative incomes of your friends and acquaintances - here it's the very first thing that must be established.<br /><br />Interesting to have as your heroine a shy, relatively inarticulate girl whose only assets are her high moral standards and personal integrity (oh, and she looks OK - but by no means the belle). Others fall by the wayside who show much greater sparkle, wit, verve, passion, good humour, talent, beauty or wealth. Austen really hammers home the condemnation of shallow worldliness, the nominalism that plays at virtue as merely an aspect of social point scoring. That being said, there's no room for Scarlet Letter development of personality or awareness of hypocrisy: you make one mistake of a publicly sexual nature and you are rightly tagged for life; you maintain your marriage - on whatever terms - and you're essentially OK.<br /><br />The conclusion of the novel felt pretty sudden, and I was surprised, along with the rest of the characters, to find that young uncompromising Fanny was right to dismiss the charming Mr Crawford all along (always an actor). It's a fairy tale for good girls, and she gets her man, despite all circumstances and the fact that she never had the pride to seriously hope for him. Holier-than-thou squares are more commonly a target for fiction, even if, as in other Austens, they may only be affectionately pilloried. Here we don't get to smirk at her unconscious jealousy of Miss Crawford: when it came down to it, Edmund was being a fool after all.<br /><br />I did love the single sentence where Austen pops in personally, as authors were far more prone to do back then:<br /><br />\\"Let other pens dwell on guilt an misery. I quit such odious subjects as soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody, not greatly in fault themselves, to tolerable comfort, and to have done with the rest.\\"<br /><br />It's like your little DVD extra, where the author explains their approach. Not to be overused, likewise I liked Lodge popping in just for a few words in 'How Far Can You Go'.<br /><br />So, an interesting and non-formulaic read, but without a lot of the humour and wit that established Austen's popularity. Austen herself said of it:<br /><br />\\"I hope on the credit of P. & P. [it] will sell well, tho' not half so entertaining.\\"<br /><br />My sister tells me that it's not the Austen she'd recommend anyone start with., wit, verve, passion, good humour, talent, beauty or wealth.

B0000029GA|5.0|Do I really need to say anymore? Do I really need to tell you the history of \\"Illmatic?\\" First of all \\"Illmatic\\" has to be the most creative title for an album of all time. I mean really, who thinks of that? A lot of people criticize Nas now for not penning similar releases that mirror the classic of \\"Illmatic.\\" But lets face the facts. There will be only one \\"Illmatic.\\" Nas cannot recreate that magic again no matter how much we want him to. It's unfair as we as fans to put that much pressure on him. Nas was signed by Columbia Records around 1993 after one verse he said on \\"Live at the Barbecue\\" by Main Source. Here is a snippet:    \\"Street's disciple, my raps are trifle  I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle  Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split  Play Mr. Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone s***  Verbal assassin, my architect pleases  When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin Jesus\\"    And that was just the first lines Nasir Jones ever spit on wax. \\"Illmatic\\" is dubbed a classic for lots of reasons. Whenever your first single (\\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\") is the LAST song on the album, you know the album has to be hard. Whenever Pete Rock and Large Professor are in charge in production, it is penned for success. Whenever you don't have any guest appearances, which gives you about 40 minutes to just spit, makes it \\"ill\\" as Nas proclaims.    Album Overview:  1. The Genesis - This really isn't a song but it deserves comment. What you'll notice that in the background you can hear lines from \\"Live at the Barbecue\\" by Main Source with Nas's verse playing (see above).   2. N.Y. State of Mind - Man.....this has to be one of the most hardcore rap s*** I've ever heard. This song will knock you off your feet and the third verse is worth purchasing this album alone. Just keep rewinding it and rewinding it.  3. Life's a B**** - AZ has never been known to say anything that shocks you, but he surprisingly brings his A game to this L.E.S. track. Nas's verse iseven more excellent. Also, this has probably been reinterated, but Nas's father Olu Dara plays the trumpet at the end.  4. The World Is Yours - Whether you saw the video when it came out around 1994, or you heard it while playing Tony Hawk's Underground, you realized this was a gem. The title reflects rappers' obsession with the movie \\"Scarface\\" which featured a \\"The World Is Yours\\" sign in the movie. If you've been impressed so far, you ain't heard nothin' yet.  5. Halftime - This is one of Nas's early songs that was featured on the \\"Zebrahead\\" soundtrack. You can definitely hear his emotions pour out in the songs.  6. Memory Lane (Sittin' in da Park) - Nice slow down track by the point in the album. Primo put the track down nicely.  7. One Love - Nas gives a bunch of shout outs to comrades in jail by a track produced by Q-Tip. The longest song on the entire LP. Peep the video and see how young Nasty Nas was.  8. One Time 4 Your Mind - The last 3 tracks on this album are absolutely bangers. Large Professor knows his beats and Nas knows how to use them effectively.  9. Represent - Man, the second verse on this song is absolutely legendary, hands down. It's really hard to find any type of flaws in anything on this album.  10. It Ain't Hard To Tell - First-ever single that Nas ever released. The Large Professor track features a great sample from Micheal Jackson's \\"Human Nature\\" and is grimey as you can get.    After \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\" fades to black, you are left with wanting more from Nas's \\"Illmatic.\\" Even though his future releases probably be dubbed as classics (Street's Disciple was real close if he would made it a single disc) because of the comparison to \\"Illmatic,\\" Nas penned a rap release that makes people sit down and think. And that is what Nas stands for. Classic material. If you're a hip-hop head and don't own this album, you can't be a hip-hop fan. Nas doesn't have to glorify violence in his rhymes, he just spits poetry that will set you free.
B000003C4K|5.0|this album should've came out a lot closer to the same time as \\"kill em all\\"but got tied up in red tape.this, not long after losing satrianis' protage kirk hammond to metallica.exodus were hailed at one time as the kings of thrash until metallica swooped down from l.a. & stole their guitar player.if it were not for this, things may have been a lot different now a days.there's a lot of similarities in the style of this & \\"kill em.\\"but \\"bonded ..\\"is more of a mosh (slamdancing back then) song collection.by the time this came out, exodus had already evolved but had to tour & could'nt record another album.durring this time paul baloff was fired from the band & replaced by ex testament front man steve souza .he's featured on the two bonus live tracks but i always stop it after track 8.a classic,track 6  <br />\\"piranha\\"is one of my favorite thrash songs of all time.RIP paul baloff.
B0002KQNZO|5.0|Damn! When it comes to the messengers it's all amazing. I can sit hear and listen to the title track all day and never get even the slightest hint of boredom. Blakey and Silver might have though up hard bop but is was essentially blakey who proved the meaning to be true. This is the best messengers album, Shorters melting solo on the title track deserves five stars itself. This album is a great example of how Blakey could be so thunderous and volcanic. His drumming sounds like a tanker full of H bombs going off, so does Elvin Jones but his tanker goes off more slowly. Just awsome Hard Bop, if you don't have this, you don't know the meaning of jazz.
B00004WKII|5.0|I'm a big Hendrix fan, and when I first heard of this box set, my expectations were huge.  I waited months for it to come out, the anticipation growing so high it seemed impossible for anything to fullfill it.  Then it finally was released and I bought it. <br /> <br />On just the first look at the outside of the box, you already know it's gonna be great.  It's covered in some kind of rich, purple velvet that looks and feels fantastic.  Inside is an 80 page booklet with an essay by Dave Marsh, tons of photos, handwritten lyrics, and at least a paragraph about every song.  Each of the four CD's come in it's own CD case. <br /> <br />The music on this set is a treasure trove for any Hendrix fan.  Lots of great live tracks, but what steals the show are the amazing alternate takes and never before heard songs.  The tracklisting goes pretty much in order from 1967 to Jimi's last recorded song, \\"Slow Blues\\", in 1970.  Which only reminds you of how much Jimi did in so little time. <br /> <br />Highlights: <br /> <br />Disc One.  Outtake of \\"Third Stone from the Sun\\".  You can hear Jimi and Chas Chandler coming up with the spoken intro, as well as the rest of the song.  First ever recording of \\"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\\" with Jimi working out the harpsichord part.  Live covers of \\"Rock Me Baby\\" and \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" are also fantastic. <br /> <br />Disc Two.  Instrumental live in the studio \\"Little Wing\\".  Live cover of \\"Gloria\\".  Long never before heard blues song \\"It's Too Bad\\".  And the live in-studio instrumental \\"Bold as Love\\", which to me is the best I've ever heard Jimi play.  This track alone is worth the price of the set.  I can listen to it on repeat all day.  Disc two is the one you'll come back to the most along with... <br /> <br />Disc Three.  This disc is all live.  It feature the best live recordings of \\"I Don't Live Today\\", \\"Roomful of Mirrors\\", and \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" ever.  As well as a \\"Red House\\" that is up there too. <br /> <br />Disc Four is where the nonstop greatness falters a little...a VERY little.  Highlights are a live \\"Hey Baby/In from the Storm\\" medley, some live covers, and all the extremely rarely heard studio recordings of Jimi trying to work out songs for his fourth album. <br /> <br />Overall this box set is nothing short of revelatory to any Hendrix buff.  It not only groups together great rare live performances, but shows Jimi's inner working of songs in studio and offers a few original songs never before heard.  All thrown into a great box which really isn't expensive as box sets go.  You'll be delving through this stuff for a long time.  Here's hoping Experience Hendrix continue with their line of quality releases.  Now if only Pink Floyd were to give us something like this...
B0000C23DO|5.0|That it doesn't contain 'Mountains Of The Moon' or the lovely 'Weather Report Suite' are my only complaints.  That it does contain the wryly ironic 'Touch Of Grey' and spans the bands entire career - - a monumental attempt if ever there were one - - makes it essential for anyone with any kind of musical and historical sense.  The inclusion of only one live track (of a song originally on Bob Weir's solo album ACE) makes sense, really.  It's true that many of the Dead's finest moments were in their live performances but being ephemeral as such performances are, and given the Dead's propensity for the search of the Ultimate Jam, such inclusion would require a multi-disc set.  Beautiful in life, even beautifuler Dead.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is not for everyone.  But as one reviewer mentioned, it's bits of randomness, as well as some memorable dialogue have made Napoleon Dynamite an unforgettable cult classic.  Those who do get it, love this movie, and those who don't, never will.  I recommend that you at least rent this movie, as I thought it was gonna be total crap, but to my surprise, I loved it.
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|even if it was 1979 this album would be mediocre. but it ain't 1979 fellas.  disco-punk is dead, and retro stinks.  can we stop the recycling of past rock styles right now, please? if we see another album from these guys i'll be surprised.  i love the lispy accent the guy fakes on the track \\"michael.\\"  i can't figure out if he's trying to sound gay, or german.  how, asexual! the only good song worth any stars is \\"darts of pleasure.\\"  albums like this have an inherently limited life span.  the funny thing is, the lyrics are worse than the music.  if you're young and like to rock out, do yourself a favour and skip this. go buy some \\"gang of four.\\"  trendy artists like this fail to accurately reproduce, nor enhance rock styles of the past.
0767903374|1.0|The highly sensitive person, a creature undefined in this text and rooted nowhere in the realms of psychology or sociology, deserves much better than being pandered to and infantilized. Rather than teach coping mechanisms and skills for interpreting interpersonal communication, Aron's advice encourages narcissistic behavior and serves to convince the reader that they are fundamentally different from others in an undefined way, incapable of functioning on a basic social level, and rudderless without her help.<br /><br />The section on relationships, which advocates arguing by dodging valid questions, should be particularly ignored.<br /><br />I never leave negative reviews on this site, but I feel I should warn prospective buyers. Avoid this book.
B000065PUE|5.0|Not only is this the Pixies' best album (I don't say \\"without a question their best\\" because Surfer Rosa is so great), but Debaser is the best rock song written in the 1980's, if not ever. The album is almost perfect, but this song is flawless. A must have for any fan of rock music. Actually, it's a must have for anyone who likes any kind of music.
B000002AOD|5.0|This album is a true masterwork . Michael Camilo was extremely inspired . From the soft ballade The Resolution to the best rack of the CD Caribe loaded with latin taste in a fest session with Paquito d' Rivera and Giovanni Hidalgo in Congas . One more  once , Why not? , The Suite Sandrine and Just Kidding are the peaks in this monumental and overwhelming work.<br /><br />To my mind one of the ten best fusion jazz albums in that year.
B00000J8EK|4.0|Okay, Exit Planet Dust is hands down the best from this Big Beat duo, but that this album has been bashed in comparison to its predecessor (Dig Your Own Hole) is unfair. Unlike eevryone else, I think the album is far more interesting than Hole because none of the songs sound alike. If you like techno, Under the Influence is perfect; if you want chill, Sunshine Underneath and Asleep from Day deliver. Plus, Hey Boy, Hey Girl has to be the best dance song ever. Due to song number 4 being a bore, I can't give this album 5 stars. However, don't believe all the hype - this album is amazing.
0316031070|5.0|As much as I enjoyed this book when I was a girl, I still enjoy it now.  It's a wonderfully warm tale of family love.  There is tragedy, but from that tragedy comes hope.  Real family values are taught by this book.  It is a story about four sisters and their mother.  Life deals them a series of blows, and the story is how each of these remarkable women persevered, and how they actually got the better of life.  Miss Alcott has a real knack for characterization, and each of her characters in this story are so very real.  If you've read this book before, but not for awhile, I strongly suggest that you take it up again.  There are unlimited surprises in store, not the least of which is how much you'll enjoy reading this book again.
0780622553|3.0|First, I LOVE the sets and the visual effects - superb. <br /> <br />Second, Rufus Sewell and Kiefer Sutherland gave first class performances. <br /> <br />The wardrobe, sets, and makeup had a lot of potential for horror but it just didn't come out that way. <br />Several scenes were disturbing but nothing really shocking. <br />Certainly no horror moments in this movie - feel free to watch it with the lights out and a lightening storm outside. <br /> <br />NOT a scarry movie - too bad, could have been a good one.
B0002OERI0|5.0|A concept album by a so called \\"punk rock\\" band?? well, I was never much of a GD fan. I bought Dookie when it first came out, and liked it, but not enough to buy the other albums they came out with until I heard \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\"... I couldn't believe they could write a song with so many chord/tempo changes and to top it off, the song just kicks A**! I went out and bought the CD that day and didn't look back. to sum up, the whole album is quite simply, amazing... buy it!
B0000E6I1J|4.0|I can't possibly add more to the other reviewers expressing love and admiration of George Harrison and his music.  The concert was great with all of the guest musicians doing a simply fantastic job.  You could feel the love for George.  I would recommend you buy the complete DVD version of the concert rather than the CD.  Not only is the music mixed better (in my opinion), but there is a huge omission on the CD.  Jools Holland & Sam Brown!  They did \\"Lead a Horse to Water\\" and Sam stole the show.  The CD is not complete without it!
1400032717|2.0|This is another book that becomes the darling of book clubs around the country and turns out to be a big disappointment for me. Yes, it reads fast and yes, it's interesting to be in the mind of a person with autism. But I didn't need 200+ pages of it. I think the plot is simple and it's solved halfway through the book. The rest of the book, mostly the main character's train trip to London, I found boring and frustrating (which might be a point the author was trying to make: autism is indeed very frustrating for those who are close to the patient) after just a few pages. Maybe it's not a great thing that I'm not especially interested in autism and the troubles it causes for those who suffer from it and their close ones, but that must be why I didn't care too much for the book as a whole. Too much of a good thing, even if it was only 220 pages long.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Well, for me I didn't watch this movie in the theatres because I read that it was just ok and wasn't all that great but when I watched it for myself I was so surprised like everyone else here how good it was.  I really liked how Brad Pitt played Achilles.  He was so athletic on screen and believed he was the great fighter.  This movie is now one of my favourites.  It's well acted too and oh lots of beautiful women on this film.  Plus they all acted well including Diane Kruger who played Helen who is just drop dead beautiful which I think Petersen chose the right person to play her.  And last but not least I'd like to own this movie for the quotes and the lines.  It's priceless and timeless.  It still applies today and asks why men go to war?  What drives them.  Oh yes...the great Peter O'toole and Julie Christie are also in this film!  That just almost automatically makes it an epic with those two and a classic I think..
0140288503|4.0|Black Hawk Down is one of the greatest examples of the strengh of the American Soldier ever! If you want to read about how the US military soldiers overcome struggles this is the book. The book has some errors in it but that is understandable with the time period between its publication and the battle. I would highly recomend reading through the book at least five times before watching the movie. <br /> <br />George Lask
0763619612|5.0|This book is amazing!  Total encouragement to young and old alike that there is nothing you can't do if you look at it the right way.  Fabulous!
6303114946|5.0|I have just seen this movie for the first time and I love this film. Josh has fantastic chess-playing talent, but he is not another Bobby Fischer. He has a balanced full life and even offered a draw to his opponent when he knew he had the win wrapped up.<br /><br />Searching For Bobby Fischer is a wonderful movie with solid acting performances. This movie should capture you imagination. It is a very dramatic story and the scenes of the chess playing are amazingly dramatic.
B000060P79|4.0|Sometimes this gets annoying but it's really awesome to just hang out to, the lyrics are a bit simple sometimes but still fun. You wouldn't want to listen to this for 4 hours straight but once in a while it's a good CD. Is it punk? I don't know but it's good and I hope that's what matters!
B0002KQNUO|3.0|Despite the interesting and colorful jacket, the music is very disappointing.  Most of the music sounds the same. This would not be a CD that I would recommend to others.
B000005IU2|5.0|What separates the Stooges from almost every rock band before them or after them is the sheer self-destructive nature of the band and its music. <br /> <br />I can't imagine a band like the Stooges being signed to a major recording label in 2005.  The major labels are run by suits who only care about the bottom line.  Back in the '60's and early '70's you still had a few labels, like Elektra, that were willing to take a chance on a band as raw and explosive as the Stooges.  Thank god!  \\"Fun House\\" is the most raw and explosive album the band ever recorded.  It can be argued that it's the most raw and explosive album EVER recorded! <br /> <br />The key to the Stooges appeal was the self-destructiveness of the band and its music.  You went to a Stooges concert back in the early '70's never knowing what you would see or what you would hear.  Iggy did the most amazing stunts ever performed on a rock 'n' roll stage.  The songs would stretch out indefinitely as Iggy went on the rampage.  It's surprising that Iggy has lived into his 50's.  Dave Alexander, the bassist on \\"Fun House,\\" passed on many years ago. <br /> <br />Let's praise \\"Fun House\\" for the monument it is- a monument to the amazing power and grace of Iggy Pop, Ron & Scott Ashton,and Dave Alexander.  These guys epitomized rock 'n' roll at its essence.  You'll NEVER see, or hear, anything like the Stooges again!
0064407667|3.0|Their father is reading this series to the grandkids (9 & nearly 6) before bed, so Mom, knowing how her father & I both love fantasy and science fiction, gave us the first two to read. The kids are loving these books. Nana, however, is halfway through the second and bored pretty stiff.  <br /> <br />I've read, and enjoyed, children's books by L'Engle, Rowling, C.S. Lewis, LeGuin, Andre Norton, Baum and others in my 30+ years of adulthood, so the problem is not that I don't like kids' books. The problem is that Handler's stories work just a bit too hard at being \\"precious\\" for my taste. At least two other reviewers here who identified themselves as elementary school teachers indicated that their students are enjoying the books and even finding the (to me, highly annoying) device of defining words to be helpful. So be it. Anything that gets children to read ... <br /> <br />I think the reviewers who are upset by the dark theme and \\"adult\\" story elements are reading too much into it. A child of 8, when confronted with the idea of Violet being forced to marry Olaf, is only going to think of how mean and greedy Olaf is, not about the wedding night. As for the fact that the kids are orphans and have bad things happen to them, so? Life has bad things sometimes. Isn't it better to deal with bad things in the safe environment of a book with Mom, Dad or a teacher to help talk about it if it's really scary? <br /> <br />As a read for adults: 1 star, it wasn't written for grownups  <br />As a read for children: 4 stars, the grandkids are loving these

B0000X61VE|5.0|I have owned the VHS version of this since it's release in the mid-90's and am so glad to see it offered on DVD. I've noticed a couple of poor reviews for the cheesy video production but it's really not all that bad- I've tried some that were a lot worse.  I think Crawford and her trainer offer a down-to-earth style that I can relate to and which makes the workout bearable.  It never fails, if I haven't done the workout for awhile and start it back up, I am sore everywhere for days.  But the effort is worth it.  After giving birth to my son, I was able to get a great body back!  The exercises target areas for excellent toning and don't add bulky muscles.  I recall not working out for quite some time and noticing that my [...] seemed to have gone completely flat.  A few months of this tape was like having a [...]-lift.  I've always thought the video was aptly named, \\"Shape Your Body,\\" delivers.
B000002I25|5.0|While I was in college in the early Eighties, there was a kind of \\"Doors Music Revival\\" of sorts.  Their singles were being played a lot on rock FM stations, and various \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums were being packaged and sold.  I never really got off the Doors based merely on these singles that I heard.  However, when I borrowed the Doors debut from a friend, it all kind of kicked in for me.  This is an amazing record to be the first recorded by the band!  It has a certain \\"feel\\" to it from start to finish, and exemplifies the \\"60's sound\\" without one hint of \\"flower power.\\"  The Doors were into a darker feel than the true hippie groups, and also had a different sound than the heavy guitar bands of the 60's.  The band weaves its instrumental magic around Jim's mystical lyricism and the result is a wonderful trip through California Dreamland.  I always thought that \\"End of the Night\\" would be a great mystery movie theme; it would also be great to listen to in a dark room illuminated by candles(please try it this way in lieu of enhancement by drugs or alcohol!).  I've listened to other Doors albums, but find that this one is the most consistent and the best of the bunch.  Listen to it and \\"Break On Through.\\"
6305388458|5.0|After the highly successful, or at least incredibly funny, Monty Python and the Holy Grail it seemed like it would be difficult for Monty Python to come up with anything near equal.  However, in The Life of Brian, the group does it again with another laugh riot. <br /> <br />The plot is simple, some high class running gags, parody the early story of Jesus by having a man named Brian accidentally picked as Savior, and then just have a whole good time with what the story gives you (and since they wrote it, they found a lot.) <br /> <br />Whether literal humor, or wit, the Life of Brian is a classic in many people's eyes.  I was worried that I had been built up by other's saying this film was great, including the Criterion Collection.  I did not want my hopes to fall, and thankfully they did not. <br /> <br />This is a classic Monty Python film, and really just a classic comedy.  The Criterion people added tons of good extras too, which will thrill the dedicated fan.  Like I said though, excellent humor like Monty Python does so well.
B000683VI4|5.0|I saw this movie 3 times in the theater. The first time I bawled like an idiot and had to sit in the theater for a few minutes after the show was over.. I was not alone.. The 2nd time I saw the movie I took a male friend and he even cried! This movie is for women who like \\"chic flicks\\" or a good romantic story. I will buy this DVD the day it comes out.
0465043550|4.0|This book is the author's challenge to the old financial orthodoxy (Efficient Market Hypotheis and its offsprings like CAPM, Efficient Frontier, Black-Scholes Model etc etc). In the author's own words in pg 23: This book will not make you rich...If it fits any genre, it is that of popular science...using common English, with as few formulae and as little mathematical jargon as possible - or at least, with no jargon unexplained...because I aim to stimulate broader debate about financial market modeling....that has hitherto been confined to the rarefied circles of economics-minded mathematicians or of mathematically inclined economists.<br /><br />To be honest, despite my CFA, MBA qualification with High School knowledge of Physics and Applied Maths., I can understand at most 80% of the author's message (definitely not the fractal geometry part and mostly the historical/statistical sections). I dont wanna frighten potential buyers/readers off. I am sure this is an excellent book. However, one should really consider his own ability and very non-trading/investment characteristics of the book.<br /><br />No matter what, I do appreciate much the author's own Ten Heresies of Finance:-<br /><br />1. Markets are turbulent<br />2. Markets are very, very risky - more risky than the standard theories imagine.<br />3. Market timing matters greatly. Big gains and losses concentrate into small packages of time.<br />4. Prices often leap, not glide. That adds to the risk.<br />5. In markets, time is flexible.<br />6. Markets in all places and ages work alike.<br />7. Markets are inherently uncertain, and bubbles are inevitable.<br />8. Markets are deceptive.<br />9.

B000092ZYX|5.0|I'm a newly initiated Radiohead fan compared to those who've had their noses to Thom's arse since since Pablo Honey, and I think my greenness gives me some \\"fresh\\" perspective that others on here don't seem to have. By and large, this is the best album Radiohead has managed. Absolutely the best. I liked it instantly, and each time I listened to it I noticed something new, either about Thom's inflection or how beautifully the music corresponds to the lyrics. This is no longer some imitation indie rock band with talent.  Radiohead consistently proves themselves to be the most innovative band...well, ever. Unlike other groups, whose latest efforts are nothing more than a regurgitation of past efforts, only staler, Radiohead pushes themselves to the limits of their ability. The result? Amazing. Never strained, simply delicious. <br /> <br />Listen to the words and the *music* simultaneously.  They say just as much with their instruments as with Thom's voice. Fantabulous.
B0006399FS|5.0|U2's newest album, \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb,\\" is the best album of 2004 by far. U2 rarely misses; I can't remember a weak album by them . . . and that says something. They're probably the best band of the times, and this album really shows it. <br />The album kicks off with the rock song \\"Vertigo,\\" dubbed the \\"ipod anthem\\" by some critics. Whatever it is, it's a great song that's getting a ton of airplay. The rest of the tracks are just as good. Here's the songs: <br />1. Vertigo: great rock song. 10/10 <br />2. Miracle Drug: another great. 10/10 <br />3. Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own: a deeply moving song, one of the best on the album. 10/10 <br />4. Love and Peace or Else: good message, but not as good as some of the other songs. 9/10 <br />5. City of Blinding Lights: my favorite track. Enjoy. 10/10 <br />6. All Because of You: a wonderfully catchy beat. 10/10 <br />7. Man and a Woman: my least favorite track. Kind of boring actually. 7/10 <br />8. Crumbs from Your Table: pretty good. 9/10 <br />9. One Step Closer: I'm not sure what Bono is singing about here, but I really liked it. 10/10 <br />10. Original of the Species: again, catchy but not spectacular. 8/10 <br />11. Yahweh: beautiful, well-crafted. 10/10 <br />There ya go. Sure, there are some weak tracks (\\"Man and a Woman\\") but \\"How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" is still a fabulous album. U2 have convinced me that rock isn't dead. They're probably the only great band still alive and kicking. I can't believe the critics that said this album was just a \\"rehash\\" of their popular stuff from the late 80's. What are they talking about? So what if it sounds similar? It's certainly better than most music out today. And The Edge is a great guitarist. Oh well. Buy this album.
B000274THQ|5.0|\\"Goodbye, Lenin\\" provides not only an entertaining story, but a glimpse into East Germany as it existed prior to unification.  The premise is straightforward: a woman slips into a coma a few days before the Berlin Wall comes down. We find out that she is a committed socialist who'd thrown herself into party work years before, after her husband had escaped to the West. While she is unconscious, everything changes, and changes rapidly.  We see through the eyes of her son, Alex, the new possibilities open to East Germans as they are free to travel and have access to consumer goods.  When Alex's mother wakes up, Alex is told that she must not be exposed to any shock.  Thus, he re-creates in their apartment East Germany as it existed until a few months before -- complete with created \\"news\\" programs played on a secret VCR, \\"Young Pioneers\\" serenading her on her birthday, East German interior design, and inferior products no longer available in supermarkets.<br /><br />Keeping this up, however, takes a lot of work and a lot of ever-more-complicated lies.  (O, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive!) As Alex continues this venture, he is drawn further and further into the socialist dream held by his mother.  While the film has been criticized for not showing the darker side of East German life, the bad is not ignored entirely: the Stasi make a brief appearance; the reasons for Alex's father's escape to the West are revealed; the circumstances surrounding mother's job are revealed; the shoddy construction of the apartment is apparent.  The point, though, is that Alex is constructing a fantasy world that is built on a lie.  And indeed, East Germany itself was built on a communist fantasy that was never realized.<br /><br />The film also provides a taste of the shock that all East Germans must have experienced as they moved abruptly from a socialist state to a free-market economy and, in less than one year, were unified with their former Cold War enemy.  The story is well-told and well-acted.  It is funny, poignant, and thought-provoking.  The ending is moving.  \\"Goodbye, Lenin\\" is an excellent film worth its five-star rating.ar enemy.

B000001DTM|5.0|It's really a toss-up between this and \\"The Joshua Tree.\\" I can't decide. Both albums are perfect. They're definitely some of my favorite stuff to listen to. I didn't want to skip any tracks, even if some were better than others . . . . <br />1. Zoo Station: good start. 9/10 <br />2. Even Better Than the Real Thing: 10/10 <br />3. One: U2's best song? It's debatable. 10/10 <br />4. Until the End of the World: another classic. 10/10 <br />5. Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses. another great! 10/10 <br />6. So Cruel: memorable, catchy, but not a classic. 9/10 <br />7. The Fly: a Top 40 hit for U2, it's a near-classic. 10/10 <br />8. Mysterious Ways: another hit, another great song. 10/10 <br />9. Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World: a good message here, but not as good as some of the others. 9/10 <br />10. Ultra Violet: the weakest song on the album is really a pretty good one. 8/10 <br />11. Acrobat: good track; not much to talk about though. 9/10 <br />12. Love is Blindness: the closer is sublime. 10/10 <br />\\"Achtung Baby\\" is arguably U2's finest album. As I said before, I can't choose. \\"One\\" is such a great song that it sounds like something the Beatles wrote. This was certainly a new sound for U2 at the time, but the new sound definitely paid off.
1592400876|4.0|Those who cringe at the widespread misuse of \\"its\\" and \\"it's\\" and signs like \\"Fresh 'Raspberries' For Sale\\" have a new advocate.  Truss is in a conspiracy with her readers to stamp out bad grammar, from the missing exclamation point in \\"Stop Children Crossing\\" to the unnecessary apostrophe in \\"Banana's For Sale.\\" The author helpfully and humorously clarifies the rules of punctuation.<br /><br />I am always on the lookout for books that will improve my grammar.  I certainly enjoyed reading this one.  Truss has a witty, breezy style that makes the book engaging and humorous.  I learned a few things, too.  Having said that, the book is not without its flaws.  First, sometimes Truss's humor comes across as condescension toward those who are not as grammar-obsessed as she (or those who have not had the opportunity to learn the subject.)  Second, the American version of the book really should have been revised to reflect American usage (although Truss does attempt to explain the differences.) Finally, someone who writes a book about punctation should ensure that her book is error-free. This book is not.  In addition to the haphazard use of the semicolon and the comma, Truss makes mistakes in parallelism; the book just contains too many errors.<br /><br />For those who really need to learn grammar, I recommend \\"Usage and Abusage,\\" by Eric Partridge. In the meantime, \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" is a good, but flawed, introduction to punctuation.
B00000I3JO|5.0|Anyone who's ever spent hours digging through record store bargain bins can tell you it's all worth it for the occasional great find.  This baby's only available as an import and goes for a few bucks more than a regular CD in America, but I got it for $1.99!!!  And having discovered it I would gladly have paid the import price if neccesary.<br /><br />I vaguely recalled these guys from various points in the 80's, and they hardly ever released anything so it was hard to tell if they were even still together for long years at a time.  I'd heard them described as \\"sophisticated pop,\\" and that's not normally my thing, but I found this CD so cheap, and had heard good things about it, that I took a chance.  And I got lucky, but this CD is a great find at any price.<br /><br />Hats came out in 1989 and reached number 12 on the British charts but made little impact in the States.  It has 7 tracks, most of which are a bit extended for pop songs, not in a neo-prog way but in a soul-record kind of way.  The sound is heavily synthesized but tastefully done and to be honest it's aged quite well compared to your standard synth pop. Vocals are excellent.  If I had to describe this CD, I'd say its like a more restrained Bono fronting Simply Red, sort-of.<br /><br />What's really amazing about Hats is that each of the tracks sounds like it's begging for a movie to be made around it-the sustained cinematic quality is really nice.  This is a really good, romantic night-time CD to pop in the player and just chill out to.  Very well done and recommended!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Alright, maybe I don't get it. Maybe I only didn't give the movie enough time to give me a response other than \\"I wonder how far this DVD will fly if I throw it?\\" Twenty minutes was all I could stand. Very disappointing after reading all of the great reviews.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I'm sick of it. I'm sick of people saying that they HATE this movie, people saying that it RUINED the first one for them. What is wrong with these people? Can they not get over the fact that it's not going to be as revolutionary as the Matrix was? Well if so, they're gonna be crying for a long time, for no movie in the near future is going to surpass the revolutionary Matrix movie.....even if Matrix Revolutions itself didn't. However, Reloaded came as close as it could to reaching this benchmark. So get out of the past and join the awesome ride that is the Matrix Reloaded. <br /> <br />(WARNING....SPOILERS AHEAD) <br /> <br />Let's start with the greatness. The special effects are absolutely amazing. Through the various memorable scenes, whether Neo be kicking 100 angry businessmen around or Trinity dodging oncoming semis on her motorcycle.....this action gives you a feeling that other movies can't seem to create.  <br /> <br />This movie also has a brain. It makes you think deep, and parallels can be dug up from the dialouge. However, this is also what angered many people about the trilogy. I guess this is their problem.....If they're not willing to take a break from the action, they get all worked up and decide to bash on the movie. Too bad for the people that walked out of the theater during the Merovingian's speech. They missed the best half of the movie, which leads to my next point. <br /> <br />The whole movie is great, but the first half of Reloaded lacks the pacing that the first Matrix had. The Matrix, in my opinion, had the best, most consistent pacing of any movie I had ever seen. However, Reloaded doesn't reach this level until the second half of the movie. This is probably the main reason why many people didn't like Reloaded. However, in these rather slow scenes in Reloaded there is key dialouge that, if taken seriously, can be taken to very deep philosophical level. <br /> <br />In the end, Reloaded isn't a 5-star movie. I gave it 4 because the firsthalf lacked the pacing of the second. But unlike MANY people, I was willing to listen to dialouge during these slow parts. So if you're one of the people that refuse to see the movie because of all the negative talk, mark my words, and mark them well. GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I've wanted to see this movie ever since I first heard about it. I grabbed it off the shelf the day it came onto video. I watched this movie and the almost-three hours flew by! I wanted to see more! Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom did a wonderful job, especially Brad Pitt and I'm not a Pitt fan either!! <br />right now I'm saving up to buy it! I thought this was a worthwhile movie and as of now, it is on my top five list of favorite movies I've EVER seen.
B0006399FS|1.0|Bad and getting worse. That's the only way I can describe U2's dwindling career, topped off by this miserable release.  <br /> <br />it's all been said with this horribly concieved product. a complete waste of time. U2 are so wrapped up in their isolated commercialist metal bubble that they can't see how irrelevant their sound and image have really become.  <br /> <br />This album is so bad that it does not merit a worthwhile review.  <br /> <br />By the way, this is definitely NOT the return to their former glory. This is a desperate attempt to regain credibility and more brianwashed fans that they had won upon the release of All That You Can't Leave Behind. <br /> <br />Please Bono, Edge, Adam and Larry -CHANGE YOUR NAME- you're disgracing the legendary status you worked so hard to get by putting out this freaked out, silly crap you call \\"U2\\".  <br /> <br />This album is dreadful and should be avoided at all costs, specially for the REAL U2 fans. <br />
6301658795|5.0|It is so nice to have a movie about, JAZZ! And with just preformances of some of the greatest jazz musicians in the world, how could you not resist?  <br /> <br />The video starts off with Monk playing his classic Blue Monk. Chico Hamilton then comes out and is playing a piece from his Spectacular album, in 1955. <br /> <br />That is just the beginning. Later on in the video, the night get's hotter. Even though Chuck Berry preforms on this video, I have to admit he had a lot to do with bringing the audience alive. Gerry Mulligan preforms some. Louis Armstrong comes out, and livens up the place.  <br /> <br />As happy I am as there being a movie about jazz, it is upseting, this is practically the only one. Mo' Better Blues was the second jazz movie in 40 years.
068987474X|5.0|For all the girls who said they didn't like the book are so far stuck in denile that they are still making excuses for the scummy guys who tossed them to the curb.  This book gives women the power to tell a guy \\"See YA\\" when he doesn't deserve her!  Why do guys think they can get away with using girls and making booty calls? Because we let them!  It's time women take a stand a say \\"I'm better than that. And I am better than the way you treat me!\\"  No one should have to wait for a phone call, if he was into you he would call and when he says he would! This book affirms that women are wonderful and that men just aren't.  Every woman who is in an unhappy relationship (or just being \\"the girl\\" the guy knows he can get!)should read this book! This book was very self-empowering and a total confidence booster.  Now when a guy is acting shady... and can tell my self', \\"Oh well, I can do way better... He's just not that into me!\\"
B00008MNYS|1.0|To compare him to Elton John(True KING OF POP) and George Michael(Pop Prince Of Yesteryear)is ridiculous! This is the BLANDEST recorded music from any artist...lackluster, no punch noise. Just because a guy strips naked and shows his privates doesn't make him a \\"musician\\". Williams is so lucky to have scored the mediocre \\"Angels\\" as any form a hit single in the U.S.A., period. So called 'singers' of his calibre are a dime a dozen here in America. Nick Lachey's \\"Soulo\\" album easily outshines any of Williams' recorded efforts on any level. And all you people wonder WHY America hasn't caught on to pseudoporn pinup Williams?
B0002JP4L4|3.0|This movie is OK.  I was personally a little uncomfortable watching it, but that might just be me.<br /><br />It's a great idea for a movie ... A town has outlawed dancing, and the teens, led by a newcomer, try to get it (dancing) back.<br /><br />The acting is good, and the music rocks, but the story (as it is played out) lacks believability.  There is one unrealistic scene after another ... depicting events that would never ever happen in real life ... and we are left saying \\"Oh come on.\\"<br /><br />The dancing is OK ... a little unnatural maybe, a little forced ... but fun to watch.  I had sort-of hoped it would be a great dancing movie, and so, was disappointed some.<br /><br />The female lead (the minister's daughter) is made to be quite promiscuous.  I am guessing this was aimed at the teenage males (the target audience) viewers.  If I was Kevin Bacon, I would have steered clear of her (he goes after her, of course).<br /><br />But it's a fun movie at heart, and Kevin Bacon does a good job.
B000002O96|3.0|This album is a follow up to the previously released album [[ASIN:B000002O94 Super Blues]].  The first album had Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley and Little Walter.  This album substitutes Howlin' Wolf for Little Walter.  The album features a jam session featuring the three stars, with legendary bluesmen Otis Spann, Hubert Sumlin, Buddy Guy and Clifton James lending support.  They run through some of their best known songs.  The performances are long and sloppy, but kind of fun.  These songs aren't nearly as good as the original versions, but it's fun hearing these legends work together (and make fun of each other).  This is by no means an essential blues album, but fans of these guys may want to get it anyway.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Hello everyone,  <br /> <br />If you like Rock N' Roll, you'll like this album. If anyone yells at you for enjoying something that supposedly copies from other artists' music, simply tell them they aren't being very original by considering others music when they listen to something else. The fact is that, originality is a fantasy. Originality has nothing to do with the quality of the music. There are more failing \\"original\\" artists out there than there are so-called unoriginal artists. That's because, some music just sounds better than other stuff! That's why it proliferates and becomes a top 10 record. That's a good thing- it is a testament of how good it is. Although, I think most rap is bad and corporate pop is mostly shizzy- but that is my personal taste talking.  Again, originality isn't practical when it comes to music. If it sounds good, it sounds good. If it sounds bad, it sounds bad. This reminds me of the whole punk scene. Some people truly do like the raw and rough puck sound. Others, (and in my view, most), like puck music for its \\"original\\" and raw/rough image. THESE PEOPLE ARE IN THEMSELVES, UNORIGINAL AND SAD. They aren't listening to music because they like it. They're listening to it because they like its premise and idea.   <br /> <br />I hope this review strikes a chord with a few of you. Until recently, I didn't realize that I had a tendency to draw away from music that was good, simply because I didn't like its image. For me, it was mainstream music that I ran away from. Liking stuff that everyone else likes sometimes feels bad. You feel unoriginal and banal- the opposite of a unique and original person we were all taught is what's best. That is bullsh**.  <br /> <br />I'm drooling on about popularism while forgetting what this article is actually about, which is originality. The album is, in itself, really good. I bought it on vinyl a couple of weeks ago and have since turned it quite a bit. If you didn't like it, talk about the fact that you thought it sounded bad. Saying it sounded like something else doesn't necessarily mean its poor music. Am I not right? Take care, Chauncey &lt;actingresidue@msn.com> <br />
0393312836|5.0|The first thing that should be known about this book is it's literary style.  The book is based in a british slang called nadast.  Don't be discouraged by this style of writing and decide not to read this book.  I know when i first picked up this book and i had read the first page i thought to myself, \\"man, this is one hard book to follow.\\"  At that point i had almost put the book down and planned on not reading it.  But, people telling me how good this book was kept me reading the book.  After a few pages into the book taking it slowly i started to make sense of this confusing text and now i'm use to it, and it's a wonderful book.  SO FROM ME TO YOU, IF U PLAN ON READING THIS BOOK DON'T PUT IT DOWN THE TEXT WILL MAKE SENSE THE FARTHER YOU GET INTO IT.  Hey, Maybe you'll even start talking like them, this being a very horrorshow (good) book. <br /> <br />As for the actual review of the story, i will start with the beginning but i dont plan on giving it all away (you can read someone elses if you want to spoil it for you.) Also im not good at reviews or writing in genral. <br /> <br />First off, the book starts with a young 15 year old boy named Alex, who is sort of a juvenile delinquent.  His average days consist of Hanging out with His Droogs(friends,also gang members) sitting at a milk bar (drugged up milk is drank here) and doing several delinquent acts such as rape,thievery and maybe even MURDER!  The first main thing to happen in this book is they take a little trip to a authors hows to have a little fun.  Alex using his charm to make the kind young lady open the door enough for them to run in and attack and rape his wife and him.  Later they return to the milk bar and a young lady starts to sing a little opera, when Dim (the dumbest and biggest of them)makes a very ignorant gesture/noise towards this women. Which results in a nice kiss to the face from the leader Alex.  This makes his droogs to conimplate betrayal and hatred towards there leader.  Then the droogs go off to another house to go for more vicous acts.  Alex leads in and is confronted by a older woman who puts up a terrible fight.  As Alex leaves the house he is confronted by his droogs to see that they have come to betray him.  They knock him to the ground which results in him getting caught by the cops. <br /> <br />Alex is then charged with murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison.  2 years in prison leads to a scientific discovery made by government officials to \\"brainwash criminals to be good\\" and Alex is \\"forced\\" into the program.  They give Alex a drug that inflicts pain on him which then they keep his eyes open as he watches disturbing videos; so as the drug co-insides with criminal acts triggering when he does wrong.   <br /> <br />There is more to this book but like i said early i am not about to give the book away thats pretty much to much info right there.  If you want to know what happens next then look at someone elses to find it, like i said im not giving it away.  Also Yes! there is a movie on it but i reccomend you should read the book instead or at least read it before it is certainly much better and more enjoyable then the movie. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMJ4|1.0|If you're the type that wants to show how cool you are, you'll probably love this movie, but if you're looking for something authentic, you won't find it here.  A vanity project of the worst kind, one that's pointless.  I really wanted to enjoy this.. but I couldn't, due to the lack of actual quality that is there.  It's poorly written and directed, and manages to take an interesting premise and flush it right down the toilet.
B00000294R|5.0|This is not just a stupid rapper cussing and saying mean things about people.Instead this is a guy talking about his real life tabloids of the Ghetto Lifestyle.And I mean Ghetto lifestyle.This is a bunch of street based rap that is on the real.The First song was Put it on and had a nice party groove as does the following song MVP.The next song he starts to spit at the haters and does not understand why his s*** wont even go wood.\\"8 iz enough\\" is a 1990's style Posse cut and sounds brutally honest to it's listeners.The Next song is All Black which I feel maybe my favorite one of the album.This one talks about brutal murders and his crazy sexcapades with the women.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|There is nothing to \\"get\\" or \\"not get\\" about this film. It is phenomenal in every possible way. A high school flick that never mentions sex or drugs and is still utterly entertaining. So well done. Jon Gries is absolutely outstanding. Buy it and laugh, laugh, laugh.
B000286RKW|5.0|the greatest thing about this new edition (besides that now it's an anamorphic master with better image, and you don't have to filp in the middle ofthe film like with the old DVD) is the commentary tracks.    now, track number one is with the crew and cast. very enjoyable, but still regular stuff.     what is so amazinng is track number 2: the cop and criminal commentary, with none other than Mr. Henry Hill himsself commenting on the film, which is his own life story.    Scorsese deliberatlely made this film in a tongue-and-cheek manner, very fast, very light, very funny (he says he was inspired from Truffaut's JULES ET JIM).    in the film people get wacked as if it were part of a gag. maybe because he thought that the way those guy lived, and maybe this was the only way to survive; never take any murder seriously, or at least you shouldn't show you're scared otherwise your partner will wack you next, as he may think you're unreliable.    well, Henry Hill says that was exactly how they lived, telling to himself in many occasion that now, he cannot believe how he could do that. so Scorsese was right, as Henry Hill himself confirms.    and to us, the commentary allow us to see the film, and the world it describes, in a new dimention. already at the film's nonchalant and shocking opening scene, Hill says he still sees that experience in his nightmares. and watching the movie with his commentary, we actually realize that, though on surface it's done in a rather comical way, it nevertheless does not miss the horror that the three main characters hide.    also kind of scary with this commentary is that...towards the second half of the film, a lot of real names are erased with a buzz sound. of course because these stuffs can be still dangerous, that many of the guys are still alive and you cannot tell the names in public.    the Henry Hill commentary confirm that as much absurd the universe of the film may seems to some, it's very authentic.    among the cast and crew interview and the making-of documentary, the most interesting comments come from Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's faithful editor and most important collaborator since RAGING BULL (she aleady worked on WHO'S THAT KNOCKING ON MY DOOR, their first film).
B000002IZM|5.0|Vangelis' \\"Blade Runner\\" soundtrack influenced so many movie composers that it may not seem as groundbreaking today as it did in 1982. Prior to \\"Blade Runner,\\" most Hollywood composers either entirely avoided synthesisers or used them as glorified noise-makers. Vangelis, along with Tangerine Dream, helped change this. Unlike many synth soundtracks, however, Vangelis' \\"Blade Runner\\" is grounded in a solid compositional tradition, which guarantees the listener a rewarding experience. I can't recommend it enough. It may not seem stunningly fresh if you've already enjoyed Ferry Corsten, the Orb, or even Zero Seven, but it's still enjoyable and challenging music.    This is the rare soundtrack CD that can be enjoyed even if you haven't seen the original motion picture. (Some of Vangelis' samples of \\"Blade Runner\\" dialogue might seem even more mysterious and ambient if you haven't seen the film!)    Most of the tones and song structures Vangelis used here are very close to space rock. \\"Blade Runner Blues,\\" for example, will remind you a little of mid-period Pink Floyd, and \\"Memories of Green\\" has a watery, phased piano similar to that used in Pink Floyd's \\"Echoes.\\" This isn't imitation; Vangelis was exploring similar musical territory as space rock bands. For this reason, \\"Blade Runner\\" might be a more accessible introduction to Vangelis's music than his later, more New Age material.    If you enjoy well-written film music with a touch of ambience, you'll like much of this CD. My only complaint is the truly awful artwork on the CD cover, but it's hardly Vangelis' fault; that was the original artwork for the \\"Blade Runner\\" movie poster.
B0000VD04M|5.0|In order to appreciate this film, I think you have to have some innate sensitivity to, and ability to laugh at, the absurdities of everyday life.  \\"Ed Wood\\" really resonates with many people, but leaves others totally mystified. I know many people for whom this film is an all-time favorite.  Others to whom I have recommended it, who I think will flip for it, find it strange or incomprehensible.  For me, however -- and I am speaking as a long-time resident of Poughkeepsie, mind -- I think that the fact that Edward D. Wood Jr., once acclaimed The Worst Film Director Of All Time, was a native of Poughkeepsie shows that the universe is operating correctly on some unseen fundamental level.    \\"Ed Wood\\" (the film, not the man) is presented much in the style of Ed Wood's (the man's) own movies: In black & white, and taking itself totally, absolutely seriously.  Nobody holds up a \\"LAUGHTER!\\" sign; you have to see the absurdity of the situations for yourself.  We see how it came to pass that the financing for Ed Wood's magnum cinematic opus \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" was put up by the Baptist Church; how most of the spoken dialogue in \\"Plan 9\\" ends up being given to a Swedish pro wrestler who can barely pronounce English; how actor Bunny Breckenridge (Bill Murray) went to Mexico for a sex-change operation and came back with a Mariachi band instead.    My favorite scene has to be: The cast arriving for the premiere of an earlier Ed Wood film (before Plan 9), at a theater in a very, very rough part of town. They are extremely late, and the audience is hostile.  Within minutes of their arrival, the audience becomes a full-blown murderous mob, and Ed and co. flee for their lives.  They emerge from the theater to find that their car has been stripped.  They save themselves by the leading lady literally throwing herself in front of a passing taxi to force it to stop.  They pile into the taxi and it peels off, bricks bouncing off the rear window.  Once they manage to catch their breath, Bela Lugosi deadpans, \\"Now THAT was a premiere.\\"    Lugosi -- played by Martin Landau, who deserved every ounce of that Oscar statue, he might as well have been channeling Lugosi's spirit, his portrayal is uncanny -- has a complex relationship with Ed Wood (Johnny Depp).  On the one hand, Ed has a genuine love and appreciation of Lugosi's work, at a time when the rest of Hollywood has written Lugosi off.  The two of them grow to become true friends and colleagues, with much mutual respect, and Ed cares for an ailing Lugosi and helps him overcome a debilitating drug addiction.  On the other hand, all of these positive vibes between the two have a twist added, one that colors their relationship as actor and director, which is that Ed Wood is a total idiot.    Other people who might find familiar territory in this film are those who have ever been involved in any kind of theater themselves.  Whenever I am with a community theater cast, gathered around our review in the local paper, I always think of Ed Wood's girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker) looking up from the newspaper to ask, \\"Do I really have a face like a horse?\\"    So, depending on your sense of the bizarre, you may or may not \\"get\\" this film, but unlike Ed Wood's real-life output, it is not for any lack of ability in the film.  The casting is superb, and the whole atmosphere of the film is perfect right from the word go, with The Great Criswell (Jeffrey Jones) rising from the coffin to deliver his classic, wonderfully overacted introductory remarks, followed by Howard Shore's brilliantly weird opening title music with the funky bongos and the eerily wailing theremin.    The very first time I unwrapped my own laserdisc copy of \\"Ed Wood\\" and heard the abovementioned Howard Shore bongo/theremin music, I was so weirded out by it that I called my best friend afterwards (at two in the morning, I might add) and played it for him over the phone, saying, \\"Isn't this the most bizarre thing you have ever heard?\\"  My friend forgave me.  I urge you, dear reader, to visit the world of the incomparable, almost unexplainable Ed Wood at least once, and I hope that you also forgive me.  --JMF
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|I really liked this movie.  The chase scenes and the fighting scenes are quite intense and really well-done.  This is a good sequel.  If you liked the Bourne Identity, you'll enjoy this one.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Nerd as everyman. Bit after wonderful bit of awkward teenage coming-to-grips-with-the-world. I appreciate the care taken with the characters - their lack of grace is funny but presented with heart and optimism.<br /><br />Interesting subtext to the movie: Black culture can set middle class white america free. Both brothers are moved to take a giant step outside of their small orbits by their relationship with La Fonda (and D-Qwon).
B000002UAF|5.0|I was always more of a late period Beatles fan, but I'm really starting to fall in love with this era. With the exception of two slight songs (Tell Me Why and When I Get Home), every song on here is a bona fide classic. I Should Have Known Better is probably the catchiest tune John Lennon ever wrote, and Anytime At All, If I Fell, the title track, I'll Be Back, and You Can't Do That are all darkly tinged Lennon classics.<br /><br />For some strange reason, Paul isn't highly represented here. The few Macca songs present are all classics, though. And I Love Her is incredibly beautiful, and Things We Said Today is one of my favorites of The Beatles.<br /><br />George was given a fairly slight number, but he does a great job with it. What's amazing is that this man's abilities would grow exponentially in one year; just listen to his Rubber Soul tunes, and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Ringo provides some of his finest drumming on Anytime At All and You Can't Do That, but, oddly enough, wasn't given a song to sing.<br /><br />Definitely the strongest early Beatles disc, and one of the great albums of all time.
B00005U2LM|3.0|Wu-Tang releasing a new album a year after their last release came as a shock to many. I can't beleive this album only went gold. Hmm, let me see. LOUD records was nearing their end as a hip-hop brand (only a few manths later in 2002, LOUD folded.) This album was hardly promoted. Many fans think this is better than The W, but not me. Although Iron Flag is not a bad album, I think The W is slightly better than Iron Flag. Sure, this time they recorded this one in New York instead of California (as in their previous two albums, Wu-Tang Forever and The W). But, somehow I can tell that each Wu-Tang MC used the \\"punch-in the clock\\" method to recording an album, meaning that I can tell that they didn't lay their verses down together, but seperately, thus resulting in Iron Flag lacking that chemistry of \\"we having fun while making this album\\" sound. It just sounds like \\"we just making an album\\". There are no skits where they trully bug out, and at times this feels like some left overs from The W (which I heard some songs are). Don't get me wrong, Iron Flag is not a bad album, I just feel like it's their worst to date. We need a new Wu-Tang Clan album soon to close the book. These labels (i.e. Universal Records) better be offering some good money. If not, RZA knows what to do. Take it the independent route (either KOCH Records or Sanctuary Records or Nature Sounds).
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Great music to dance to.  The songs are fun, energizing, playful and rich with sound.  I like the fact that they have 3 guitars in a beautiful harmony.  Alex has a nice voice, but the lyrics are shallow.  Sometimes they're obscure or don't make any sense!  On the other hand, they translate moods very well.  For example, \\"The Dark of the Matinee\\" makes me happy, and \\"Darts of Pleasure\\" is sultry, while \\"Michael\\" is full of angst and desire.  I bet you've heard \\"Take Me Out,\\" their hit single that I love to death but doesn't make much sense.
B000687M48|5.0|While passing through some very difficult times in Life, it happened that this album came to fit into the situation so well... <br /> <br />Amy Lee has one of the most powerful and emotionally charged voice I have ever heard and particularly in \\"My Immortal\\", she simply devastated my heart. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this album although there are some technical gotchas but they are all compensated by Amy Lee's strong voice and presence. <br /> <br />It is outstanding that Amy Lee was able to make the audience sing along \\"My Immortal\\" and getting a highly emotional response from them, considering the French being a little bit \\"hostile\\" to English language.
B0002858YS|5.0|I have listened to Hot Fuss 20 times in the last week, it gets better and better. <br /> <br />The Killers are the best band in the last 5, maybe 10 years.
B000002KIE|4.0|By all means go out and get this album.  It is solid punk and because of its stature in music history, no collection is complete without it.  If you already love punk, you already have this.  If you are first getting into punk, you might buy this and watch it sit on your shelf as you play the following superior albums into the ground: Ramones, Rocket to Russia, The Clash, Singles Going Steady, Inflammable Material, Los Angeles, Wild Gift, Germfree Adolescents, The Undertones, L.A.M.F., Damned Damned Damned, Machine Gun Etiquette, Crossing the Red Sea With the Adverts.  Of course, you COULD just go and get those albums first.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day rocks, they really do! <br /> <br />American Idiot is vintage Green Day.
B000646MNE|5.0|There is nothing better than four women, cosmos and sex.  This is a great set for any group of girls to watch all day and night long.  This has to be one of the best series ever and it will be worth the money that you spend to buy it!  The complete set is great and I think that every woman should own and laugh at it...
0783116934|4.0|Even though this is an interesting detective story, I wish it contained more forensic detail. Great acting. Supposed to be based on a true story, but I'm sure there is considerable poetic license here. If you are into mysteries and detective stories, I'd strongly recommend this one!
B0002XNSY0|5.0|Supposedly, Kubrick originally intended for this movie to be more \\"serious\\" rather than a comedy. But after about 2-3 minutes of some thinking, Kubrick finally settled for this movie to be a comedy. And Peter Sellers was originally supposed to play Major TJ \\"King\\" Kong, but the Cowboy accent was something Sellers was unsure of. So Kubrick casted Slim Pickens, but didn't tell him that this movie is a comedy. This was some lil' fun-fact trivia that I learned from first watching this movie on the Turner Classic Movies channel. Naturally, I think 90% of youse already knew this. But I found this info quite interesting, especially the first. <br /> <br />The Cold War years and Red Scare contributed mass fear into the American public. I wasn't born in those years, so I cannot imagine what the fear was like. With such political satires as Kubrick's \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" and \\"The Manchurian Candidate,\\" one can only imagine what the viewer then felt while viewing these movies. While \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" feared communists invading America, \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" feared nuclear holocaust... but in a humorous way. <br /> <br />The movie begins when a General named Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) orders an attack on Russia. Somehow, he thinks \\"commies\\" are poisoning \\"the purity and essence of our natural fluids.\\" The first thought that came to mind was, \\"What the-??\\" Even the other characters are puzzled by this statement. But I managed to laugh out loud. Ripper is obsessed with protecting our \\"precious bodily fluids\\" that basically he's gone mad. After ordering the unauthorized attack on Russia, he orders the base to go on red alert and kill anyone that dares to enter. He's also convinced that commies could be in disguise and look like any soldier or any other American. The base is on red alert, it's sealed off, the planes are flying to Russia to attack (thanks to a coded message called Plan R), and all telecommunications are cut off (both base and all planes). Ripper has a British companion named Mandrake (Peter Sellers) who tries to get the General to stop the planes. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, in the War Room at the Pentagon, President Muffley (Sellers again) is informed of what's going on and what's gonna happen by Gen. Turgidson (George C. Scott) and a large group of aides. Seeing Scott as Gen. Patton, I typically thought of him being in serious roles. \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" proved me wrong. This was something totally unexpected. I mean, George C. Scott's character is just downright wacky and seemingly maniacal. Truly, a major surprise. <br /> <br />Later on, the people in the War Room are shocked to discover that once the planes release a nuclear warhead, a \\"Doomsday\\" device of some sort will go off, killing all life on Earth and radiation will gradually permeate the entire planet, which will last for 90+ years. Dr. Strangelove (Sellers once again!) is a unique character. An ex-Nazi that now works as part of the president's aides. He offers advice on what to do and has trouble controlling his right hand, which has a life of its own once we see Dr. Strangelove struggling to gain control of it (and also preventing it from strangling himself). Dr. Strangelove deep down also retains his Nazi heritage by accidentally calling the president \\"Mein Fuhrer\\" and his right arm raised in a Nazi salute.  <br /> <br />Truly, Peter Sellers gave such great performances and it's hard to believe all three characters (Mandrake, Muggley, and Strangelove) are acted out by this lone man. He gives life to each character, which makes all three seem as if three different people acted out the roles. Seeing this movie, I'd like to see what other work Sellers has done. <br /> <br />I can't help but ponder that perhaps Steven Spielberg tried to make his own version of \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" with his underappreciated, slap-stick, comedic epic \\"1941,\\" with John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, and... wha-hey, Slim Pickens! Like how Kubrick's movie dealt with the fear of nuclear holocaust and communism, Spielberg's movie dealt with the fear of a pending Japanese or German attack on US soil (mass panic that erupted shortly after Pearl Harbor was attacked). It's no coincidence, right? But Spielberg was criticized for that movie. Kubrick's satire is hailed as \\"arguably the best political satire of the century\\" (Roger Ebert). <br /> <br />Although a comedy, it still seemed quite scary if such a \\"Doomsday\\" device existed and would wipe out mankind as we know it. Once the movie was about to begin, I knew I was in for a treat. And I wondered how Kubrick would be able to pull off a comedy. To my surprise, I ended up loving this movie. Dark and twisted humor interjected into the most frightening time of US history was probably the sigh of relief audiences back then needed... or were they? The movie as a whole is funny but also scary at the same time. Towards the end has Slim Pickens' memorable moment when he rides a nuclear warhead to his untimely demise. Are we supposed to laugh or be shocked? Once the movie ends, it's rather more of a down note once we see stock footage of nuclear blasts and mushroom clouds. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I ended up loving this movie and I dare call it Kubrick's best work.
B0002X314C|5.0|Number one, this man is a combination of Alicia Keys (Piano), D'angelo (The high-like voice) & Maxwell (With music of this time). The last couple of reviews I saw I was appalled. John Legend is an excellent musician.    01. PRELUDE (10/10) - John enters listeners into the album with a soft piano intro.    02. LET'S GET LIFTED (9/10) - Lead by his piano and the guitar, John sets it off with backgrounds of others.    03. USED TO LOVE U (9/10) - The first single. Another piano lead song with a different kind of beat.    04. ALRIGHT (9/10) - With the tuba leading, John talks about he's drunk and he's ready to leave with some other dudes' girl. Talking about he don't want it with him and John looks like he's about 99lbs. It's a good one though.    05. SHE DON'T HAVE TO KNOW (9/10) - With a Caribbean beat in the beginning then turning into some kind of jazz vibe, John sings about his girl not having to know he's cheating.    06. NUMBER ONE (8/10) - Strings are lead in this tale of John's relationship. He cheats but she's his number one.    07. I CAN CHANGE (8/10) - Snoop is in the house with John. It's a \\"there's gonna be trouble\\" piano vibe. He makes it known that he can change from his ways. It almost sounds like \\"Used To Love U\\" in the hook.    08. ORDINARY PEOPLE (10/10) - One of the best songs on the album. With just the sound of the piano, John sings with ease as he explains that love can be difficult but we're just ordinary people.    09. STAY WITH YOU (9/10) - Guitar, harmony and the organ does wonders for this love song. Just letting you know he's gonna stay with you.    10. LET'S GET LIFTED AGAIN (10/10) - The highlight of the album. Within this two minute song, John let's out his voice with high notes to an old western-like driving into the sunset type melody.    11. SO HIGH (8/10) - Another soft piano vibe song. Just saying his relationship is so high, basically touching God.    12. REFUGE (WHEN'S IT'S COLD OUTSIDE) (8/10) - Another guitar and piano duet. Whenit's cold outside, she keeps him warm. Very good love song.    13. IT DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE (8/10) - This is a do-wop/gospel type vibe that John explains that even though times get extremely hard, they're love don't have to change. Another beat-less song with just vocals.    14. LIVE IT UP (9/10) - The finale of the album is with strings and the piano followed by a slow like mellow hip-hop beat. About living life, living it up, no more stress.    This album gets my 5 stars and two thumbs up. John Legend is the fresh new sound that is blown gently into your face. Get this album!
B00005NTN5|4.0|When Andy and Larry Wachowski conceived of 'The Matrix' while writing the screenplay for 'Assassins,' the studio created an exercise for them to prove their chops.  Thus, 'Bound' was born as a strictly low-budget exercise to show the bigs that the brothers could skillfully helm a picture.<br /><br />Game, set and match to the Wachowskis.  Despite grossing about $4M at the domestic box office, 'Bound' has been a treasure trove for its owners due to its little to no marketing budget, its high DVS/VHS rental and ownership (the film has quickly attained cult status), and repeated showings on cable.<br /><br />'Bound' is probably the high point of Gina Gershon's career - she's terrific here.  All the more so when you see on IMDB that she was originally offered Jennifer Tilly's role, but decided to go with the decidedly less glamorous role of Corky.  A quick Internet search will tell you she made the right decision: that role has made her the object of some fairly fanatical devotion by a number of this film's fans.
B000005IKX|4.0|As most other reviewers have noted, this album is surely something very different for ABBA; it was obvious to me on the first listen (in those days of LP records, on \\"the first spin\\"). The Visitors, is indeed, a more mature album than anything that came before---although ABBA's lyrics were often far more accomplished than they were given credit for (Knowing Me, Knowing You; Fernando; One Man, One Woman, I'm A Marionette... none of them obscure, shocking or literary, but undeniably solid, adult pop lyrics). Still, with a new consistency, the songs on The Visitors clearly aim for, and usually strike, adult nerves. Ruminations on the power of music, the Cold War, raising kids, personal break-ups.. all very well done, the glaring exceptions being \\"Two For The Price Of One\\" which is at best, a trifle, both lyrically and melodically. \\"When All Is Said & Done\\" has a truly fine, insightful lyric, notwithstanding the rather gratuitous inclusion of the word \\"sex\\", which seems in retrospect a quaint but obvious move, part of the \\"adult\\" mood they were aiming for. Each song has something to say, and says it well. <br /> <br />The sounds, too, are somewhat different---though not unreservedly for the better. Like the lyrics, the melodies are often more subtle and complex than what ABBA were usually known for (too often described as \\"hook-filled\\" and \\"sing-song\\"). So here we get more melodic & rhythmic subtlety, but sometimes at the expense of that uncanny, positively joyful musical energy that seemed to inform every typical ABBA smash hit, from Waterloo to Dancing Queen to Super Trouper. One wants to love this album, like a last conversation with an old friend, but there's no denying that \\"Head Over Heels\\" or \\"Soldiers\\" simply do not make one want to jump up and shout the way their predecessors did. These melodies are by no means UNmelodic, or even less than VERY catchy. It's more fair to say that if their earlier songscapes were painted in bright, primary colors, Bjorn & Benny were now utilizing other, more subtle shadings. <br /> <br />The arrangements, are as always, rich, interesting and distinctive. Frida's and Agnetha's performances, consistent with everything else on the album, are more adult, personal and individual ---a far cry from the early days when it was often said that they sing in such perfect harmony, \\"you can hardly tell them apart\\". <br /> <br />The final verdict? Taken on its own terms, The Visitors is quite impressive. It's a more complex listen than their other stuff, both lyrically and melodically, and it highlights the impressive extent of ABBA's evolution over the scarcely ten years that we knew them (and this is not to diminish the wonder of their earlier work). Equally important, for all the talk of  more serious moods, Bjorn & Benny STILL had a way with a song, to drastically understate it. It's not like they did an album of minimalist jazz, or a suite of atonal gregorian chants. This is still ABBA music, and practically nobody in the pop world can do it like them: melodies you remember forever, flawless singing, intricate arrangements, accessible, yet meaningful lyrics. A fine, final album from a group whose music was always far more adult and technically accomplished than they're ever likely to be given credit for--even (or especially) with their newly hip \\"rehabilitated\\" status. Perhaps the final word on ABBA should be, Just because they wrote songs that were wonderfully catchy doesn't mean they didn't write great music. The Visitors underscores that.
B00061QK02|3.0|The power of parody can be strong when the story has been revealed and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy has a powerful effect on the audience as it's story of male chauvinism, sexual harassment, and male insecurity has been depicted.  The parody is frequently over the top, which is the purpose of the parody, and it enhances small things men do in order to be portrayed as strong males.  In Anchorman, the parody brings out Ron Burgundy's insecurities in regards to women and other men, which often are either clever or belly-achingly hilarious.<br /><br />The story highlights Ron Burgundy's (Will Ferrell) escapades as a news anchorman for a local TV station in San Diego at the beginning of the 1970s.  The time is before cable TV and channel surfing.  Before the film begins the audience is displayed a short statement informing the viewers that the film is based on a true story where the only thing that have been changed are the names, the location, and the events.  This throws in an interesting perspective as the film unfolds as there are several stories where male chauvinism and sexual harassment have taken place at the work place.<br /><br />Anchorman begins with a party after Ron and his cohorts have found out that their station KVWN is ranked number one in the city of San Diego.  During the party Ron and his three buddies Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Champ Kind (David Koechner), and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) entertain themselves with booze, women, and superficial conversations as Ron discovers a beautiful blond.  The blond woman is Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) whom Ron insults with sexual suggestions and later finds out that his new station has diversified by hiring Veronica as a part of the news group.  This raises an uprising among Ron and his men as they proclaim that women cannot do the work they are performing.  Instead the men begin to make crude sexual jokes in regards to Veronica and the sexual harassment has begun.<br /><br />Veronica is aware that the line of work that she has chosen is male dominated, yet she strives to accomplish her dream to become a news anchor.  The assignments that she receives are silly as they include cat fashion shows and alike.  The men at the news station persist in keeping her away from the real work, as she is a woman and in their perspective women cannot perform the same kind of work as men.  However, after an accident with a biker (Jack Black), Ron is held back due to emotional distress, and Veronica sees her moment of opportunity, which she seizes.  This is the beginning of the end for Ron as he is about to put the final nail in the coffin by saying a four letter word beginning with f in regards to the people of San Diego at the end of a show.<br /><br />There is a scene in the film where Ron and his friends end up in a street brawl with all kinds of gruesome weapons.  This scene is a culminating analogy with strong satirical suggestions in regards to male insecurities, which are often attempted to be hidden behind a large dose of aggressive behavior.  In the scene there are four other news stations that are represented by Wes Mantooth (Vince Vaughn), Frank Vitchard (Luke Wilson), a Public TV News Anchor (Tim Robbins), and a Hispanic TV News Anchor (Ben Stiller), and instead of trying to find a solution these men let testosterone flow as an arm is chopped off and a man on a horse is impaled by a trident.<br /><br />Anchorman has several interesting moments where the parody offers much laughter, yet there are moments when the humor does not work.  Despite the moments of lacking laughter Anchorman will provide a good cinematic experience as the film offers both humor, insight, and valuable lessons.  The parody,  as mentioned, comes together in the end as a powerful tool to depict an important lesson in regards to male chauvinism, sexual harassment, and male insecurity.  The humor might be necessary for some hardcore alpha-males as they might recognize themselves in the story, and it might otherwise be offensive for all viewers.  Nevertheless, Adam McKay and his cast put together a well-made comedy with a valuable message.selves in the story, and it might otherwise be offensive for all viewers.

1573300403|4.0|I bought the number ones dvd and the dangerous dvd as well as this dvd. Many of the videos are the same on all 3 disc however the long version of black or white on the number ones disc i beleive and the long version to \\"The Way You Make Me Feel is on the number ones dvd. Also the number ones goes up to 2000 with \\"You Rock My World\\" while History II goes up to 1991. You do get dirty diana on the number ones but the short version to Smooth Criminal on it. The long version to smooth criminal is  on this dvd. Many of the same videos from the 80's are on History I and II dvds which is why didnt get History I. I do however have the History Book I album. The volume II dvd also has the incomplete edited version to They dont care about us which I was disappointed in. However in the book I cd it is unedited which came out before the controversial part of the video. The video is longer also. I wish they would have put You Are Not Alone and Speed Demon on the disc. Speed Demon was animated with a rabbit with Mike on a motorcycle while Leave Me Alone had an amusement park ride Mike was riding in and he got up and the miniature roller coaster built on him fell apart. Really cool.I was expecting those songs to be on the History cd as well. Thats one of the greatest songs ever that i grew up with. The dangerous cd is one of the best because it has one repeatitive songs on it because its the whole dangeous album. The songs on it arent on any of the other dvds expect remember the time which is a great video with Eddie Murphy Emon and Magic Johnson. I love In the Closet with Niomi Campbell its about my favorite song on dangerous.
B000696PWC|5.0|I have never been a Kylie Minogue fan before, but I really am now. The first CD didn't really cut it for me, too old school, but her more recent songs on the second disc are just awesome. \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" has an awesome beat, and with classics like \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\"  and \\"Kids\\" brings you back to some great tunes. Even though its 2 CDs, the second CD alone is worth it, and there are some good songs on CD1. If you have never really been a fan of Kylie, i suggest you buy this CD now, and it just kicks ass.
B00005QIPH|5.0|At first I was scepticle of this CD because it doesn't have very many hit singles on it, save last night and someday. But after I got it I really liked it. It, surprisingly, has a very different sound to their newer CD Room on Fire. Where Room on Fire falls into the muddled genre of \\"alternative rock\\", Is This It defines itself as a rock album, pure and simple. The first thing i noticed about this CD is that it utilizs much more complex bass guitar lines than in any other album. For me, personally, this distinguishes the album immediately because it reflects the intrimental talent of the group. In most modern rock there is a lack of variation in the bass guitar lines which , consequently,detracts from the experience as a listener. Bass guitar is essentially the body of any song and without well balanced baselines the music loss substance. The Strokes also incorporate catchy and originaly guitar riffs which really allow you to get into the music. Where the music becomes highly subjective is Julian Casablancas' vocals. I enjoy them very much, but they are ery much distorted for the purposes of the album, giving them a scratchy faded tone. This is about the only portion of the music which also remains consistent with some of The Strokes' other albums although, due to instumental differences, the pace and style are faster and more upbeat. However, for those who like crisp and clear vocal recording, this CD does just the opposite, and strives to set a mood for the entire album.   <br />     Regardless, this album is essnetially is a good one. It has a fresh unique sound and musical depth that goes far beyond the chorus of each song. The Strokes prove, unlike other bands, that they can actually play their intruments, and superbly at that.
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|Another A plus album from Celine Dion .... generally, songs written by Jean-Jacques Goldman and sang by Celine Dion are utterly beyond description. My favorite was Des milliers de baisers ... so tenderly written and sung, and beautiful beyond compare. JJ Goldman and Celine, YOU ARE THE BEST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005UEAR|3.0|I lost a lot of faith in Dream Theater after the boring releases of Falling Into Infinity and Scenes From A Memory.  This album is actually pretty pleasing for the most part but has a lot of flaws in it. <br /> <br />I popped in the disc and was being blown away immediatly by The Glass Prison, the absolute highlight of the entire album.  I'd give this an almost perfect rating except for the idiotic ending lyrics.  The door wasn't open, the door wouldn't open, then the door is open.  That pretty much put me in awe.  They must've gotten bored and decided it would be best to go to the next track as quick as possible.  Other than that, 14 minutes of joy.  The first disc spirels downhill pretty quick.  Blind Faith has a great beat in it for the verses, nice and tender, but the chorus is really bland.  That's pretty much the only part of the song that is bad is the \\"desireable, able\\" bits.  The instrumental in the middle is a real joy.  Great organ and piano work.  Pretty meaningful.  Oh man, Misunderstood is just...boring.  This is a skipper track for sure, the vocals just go no where.  Forget about the end of it, this track is bad.  The Great Debate is a laughable stab at being political.  Not anywhere near \\"Boston's latest Corporate America\\" track, but still has embarrassing lyrics.  Has some nice musical moments in it, but \\"Life To Save Life,\\" 3 times in a row is hardly forgivable.  Also has bits of news cast on it.  Disappear is boring.  Pop in the 2nd disc immediatly. <br /> <br />The 2nd disc is supposed to be a 42 minute song, but it isnt, they are seperate songs.  So have no fear, it was only a bombast attempt to be super prog.  The opening track Overture is an interesting listen, although they call it overture to again be art rocky like in SFAM.  So it's going to be completely overblown as if they have something to say.  After one listen or so, you start skipping right over it.  About To Crash is a pretty nice rock/pop song, very pleasing.  Of course they have to slow it down at the end to make the chord transitions into the next song, War Inside My Head.  A nice track in the middle, it has an unnessecary opening instrumental, which is boring as heck.  The Test That Stumped Them All is way below average, pretty much a pointless instrumental, and a ridiculous little vocal bit in the middle.  Goodnight Kiss.....where do I start?  When LaBrie sings Mommies Love, you will be very tempted to turn it off because it's soooo stupid.  Keep it on, the instrumental at the end is very well written.  Solitary Shell is a great little number.  It has catchy hooks, and a memorable chorus.  The first 3:47 are joy.  It then turns into another instrumental that means nothing.  In fact when the acoustic guitar and piano comes in at the end, it sounds like elevator or restaurant music.  About To Crash (Reprise) starts off with a great little guitar lick that is brilliant.  The first few minutes of the song are the second track over again, but what's wrong with that?  Great tune.  But they fill in the last few minutes with a formulatic instrumental.  The Grand Finale is boring.  Figure that one out. <br /> <br />Half and half here.  Some great moments, then some formulatic Dream Theater riff raff.  A worthy addition.  Forget about their next release though.  The forumlatic riff raff gets even worse.
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 is the background music for many of my childhood memories. I was raised by parents who are big fans of music, particularly my dad. While many families have the television on frequently for background noise, my parents almost always had music playing. They were big U2 fans, and as I was growing up, U2 was often played in my house. I enjoyed it without being able to put a name on the band. However, when I was ten years old and in fifth grade in the year 2000, U2's second-latest CD, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", came out. I began listening to this CD a lot as soon as my parents purchased it, and grew to love it- which opened up my eyes to all of the U2 CDs that I had listened to for so many years without even knowing who they were. \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" is filled with inspirational and positive songs, which greatly influenced me at that time in my life and continue to today, particularly \\"Walk On\\", which has helped me overcome obstacles and let go of many grudges over the last couple of years. I also thoroughly enjoyed \\"Best of 1990-2000\\", which was very helpful to me as well. So since I have become such a big fan of U2, I was psyched to hear that they were coming out with a brand new CD last November. My dad surprised me with the CD, \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bond\\", right when it was released and I listened to it over and over right away, the same way as I had done several years before with \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\". Over the last couple of months, the new CD has become one of my all-time favorite CDs. U2 never fails to amaze me- they can say such great things so simply! Personally, I think that the best songs on the CD are \\"A Man And A Woman\\", \\"Original Of The Species\\", and \\"Yahweh\\", but they are all awesome. I know what it can be like to love a band and be disappointed when their new music doesn't compare to their beloved old stuff, but in my opinion, \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" is just as good if not better than all of U2's othermusic. I like it a lot, and I have already shared the CD with a couple of good friends, who enjoy it as well. I would strongly recommend purchasing it today!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Everyone comments on how strange this movie is.  However, my son and nephew assure me that this movie is not an exaggeration of how certain characters actually live.  After viewing this strange flick in more or less bewilderment, I thought about it.  I have come to believe that the strangeness of the flick is less the focus on some nerds than its treatment of them.  The movie doesn't make them the object of ridicule or irony.  And that is what is strange.  Whenever you see characters like these on the screen they are the butt of jokes, made ridiculous, or destroyed.<br /><br />Look, Napoleon and his family and friends are some of the weirdest people you will ever see on screen and maybe in real life as well.  You will find yourself mystified by their approach to their problems.  They seem to either not understand the way out of their situation or they lack the energy to get out.  Maybe it is both.  What you will love them for is that they do not knuckle under or accept the badge of loser that the \\"cool\\" kids want to impose on them.  My favorite scene involves Napoleon asking one of the bullies for one of Summer's campaign buttons and then heaving it down the hall.  Glory!<br /><br />Pedro is another great character.  Strange and great.  I mean, how could the desire to run for class president and the need to cut off one's hair because it is making you too hot reside in the same individual?<br /><br />The ending of the movie has more poetry in it than you might catch on first viewing.  Remember Pedro's campaign promise and then look closely at everything that happens as the movie ties things up.<br /><br />I recommend seeing this movie.  Just don't expect seeing anything like you have ever seen on screen before.  And if you find yourself rejecting the images at first, I encourage you to stick with it.  I think you will get it by the end.  Younger folks seem to get it easily.  A baby boomer like me has to work at it a bit, but I think it is worth it.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Number 2 of the Creed Trilogy was even better than the first. This CD has some emotion and darkness, but it also has hope, and it's a great listen. <br /> <br />Are You Ready - 8/10 - Very catchy opening song. <br />What If - 9/10 - Another good song, so far the CD has started out with a bang. <br />Beautiful - 7/10 - Solid song. <br />Say I - 7/10 - Another good song. Nice build towards the finish, a little darker side of Creed. <br />Wrong Way - 9/10 - Good build in the verses leading to a very catchy chorus. A great screaming song. <br />Faceless Man - 10/10 - Absolutly breathtaking song. It ranks at least top 5 Creed songs, and it's probably good it wasn't a single. The best part about this epic song, is the very ending, after an amazing build. \\"Next time I see this face, I'll say I choose to live for always, so won't you come inside and never go away...Again I stand, Lord I stand, against the Faceless Man.\\" - Classic <br />Never Die 8/10 - Very cool guitar chord played throught the song. <br />With Arms Wide Open - 10/10 - I couldn't imagine getting sick of this song, every thing about it is great. Scott Stapp shows his emotion in this one. <br />Higher - 8/10 - Another radio friendly song. Pretty solid. <br />Wash Away Those Years - 9/10 - I love the way this song builds up, much like others on this CD. I also like the pattented Creed guitar sound. <br />Inside Us All - 9/10 - \\"Theres a peace inside us all, Let it be your friend\\" This song offers up some hope, nice finish to the album. <br />To Whom It May Concern - 10/10 - This one wasn't released on the American version, but if you get a chance download it. It's a great song. <br /> <br />Overall, I think this was a slight improvement over the last Creed album, but Weathered still had the best yet to come.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Julia Roberts as Ms. Watson, an art history teacher at an all girls university (Wellesly) in the early 50's, gives a surprisingly good performance backed up by some of the top actresses in movies today!  Ms. Watson tries to change her students ideals as to why a woman should go to college.  Back then, no matter how well a woman excelled, she was expected to marry and be an ideal housewife.  Even though Ms. Watson becomes extremely popular with the students, the school's board doesn't see it that way and tries to impose restrictions on her.  Therefore, Ms. Watson can either conform and continue teaching or stick to her beliefs and be out of a job. <br /> <br /> <br />
159413023X|1.0|I found it so very hard to finish this book. It seemed to have a nice plot but the build up of the story and the characters was so ordinary. The novel being narrated by the dead girl, there is a subtle undertone of humor in the narration. Whereas, all the living characters have a sense of tragedy and loss enveloping them.  However the story failed to evoke any emotion and I felt like a dead reader not feeling anything. It was such a boring reading that I gave up and could never finish the book to the last page.
B0002S947K|4.0|I received my anxiously awaited Ray Lamontagne \\"Trouble\\" today, and it is fabulous!  I wish this guy had about 10 more albums, that's how much I love this one.  His voice is so rich, it's magical.  Many people have likened him to various of the greats, I believe Otis Redding was mentioned, my husband suggested Bob Dylan.  I don't really compare singers to one another, I think this guy is fantastic as himself.  This is the best CD I have gotten since my \\"Live\\" Jason Mraz and my long coveted John Mayer.  Buy it and love it! <br /> <br />The reason I did not give it 5 stars, is that as some have mentioned before, his later songs tend to sound alike.  Although, I believe the 1st three songs alone are enough to warrant buying this CD.
0553382179|5.0|Like many others, I have read a bunch of \\"how-to\\" books on getting organized, but this is the first one that I found really helpful.  \\"Sink Reflections\\" is written by Marcia Cilley, also known as the Flylady.  In the book, F.L.Y. stands for \\"Finally Loving Yourself\\".  Rather than try to fit you into a cookie cutter program, this book encourages you to make routines that work for you, and then stick to them.<br /><br />The author also gives a lot of really helpful advice, such as identifying hot spots in your home that constantly accumulate junk, and how to control these areas.<br /><br />This book was really supportive.  Many other organizational books assume that disorganized people are just failures, whereas this book points out that being organized is a leanred skill.  And the book is here to hold your hand and help you to learn.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book hihgly enough!  Thanks for helping me to FLY!!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|There are few if any words that I could possibly add to the veritable encyclopedias that have been written over the years about Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. Suffice it to say that it is the very first full length animated feature film ever made, that the gamble taken by Walt Disney paid off handsomely and the film in most respects was the catalyst for the expansion of his company into one of the biggest entertainment conglomerates in the world. The film spawned a whole new genre that has to a very large extent been the exclusive domain of the Walt Disney Company since 1937, and you only have to wander through the names of the memorable animated features that they have created to understand the impact they have had on family entertainment for the last sixty four years. Pinocchio, Bambi, Cinderella, Peter Pan, The Jungle Book, The Little Mermaid, Beauty And The Beast and The Lion King just to name a few of the many gems in their catalogue. And it all begin with Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. Somewhat pretentiously, the Walt Disney Company have always afforded the film the appellation of \\"masterpiece\\" for its infrequent theatrical and video releases, but if there is one film in their catalogue that does live up to that pretentious appellation then it is Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. <br /> <br />Like just about every reviewer in the world, I am not going to provide a plot synopsis, for the story is so well-known that there seems little point in rehashing it again. Suffice it to say that anyone of any age, other than those born since its last theatrical incarnation in 1993 and video release in 1994, is unlikely not to have seen the film or at the very least heard of the story. In our modern world, the story is incredibly simple and to some extent quite quaintly naive, but simplicity is often a wondrous thing, for it is that simplicity that keeps the crowds flocking back to see the film on its occasional theatrical releases and to add the video to the collectionon its infrequent video releases. <br /> <br />Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is a landmark film in every respect and is one of the true classics. Nothing more needs to be said other than to ask the question: has the DVD release done justice to the film? After eighteen hours of watching, listening and typing over six days, let me assure you that you are going to be buying one of the very best DVD packages we have ever seen, period.  <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I have never heard my sister laugh so hard in my life. This movie is simply hilarious. From start to finish you'll find yourself wondering why you get it, but you simply do. Perhaps it the nostalgia or the knowledge that we all have some Napoleon Dynamite in all of us, some more than others.
B000067G3C|4.0|It seems that some of the best and sometimes worst Directors come from being Cinematographers.  <br />With Jan De Bont I think I'm sitting on the fence here. He's a great Cinematographer see Die Hard, Hunt For Red October, Basic instinct, Lethal Weapon 3 or even this movie for instance. His Directing though leaves a lot to be desired. This movie as well as Twister are acceptable but then he made the travesty that is Speed 2 or more recently, The Hunting. <br /> <br />Speed is the story of Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) he is a disgruntled cop who has already been thwarted when he tried to get 2 million bucks from the city with an elevator bombing. Now he puts a bomb on a bus that will explode if it drops below 50MPH. Jack Travern (Keanu Reeves) is a cop with way too much testosterone who is the man who is trying to stop the bus form exploding. <br /> <br />The movie is filled with some great scenes BUT (and it's a big but) YOU MUST suspend you disbelief for 2 hours to really enjoy it.  <br />
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This film is fantastic!  It's a story about a man who travels a great distance on an old john deere lawnmower to see his brother that he's not seen in 10 years.  It's a wonderful family-oriented film that deals with lots of issues and is surprisingly deep for a Disney film.   <br /> <br />Originally I thought that this film might be kind of sappy and tha I might not like it, but I ended up loving it. Richard Farnsworth, usually seen as a stunt man, became the oldest man to receive a best actor academy award nomination for his work in this film.  (He lost to Kevin Spacey.) <br /> <br />This film has nothing offensive in it that I could find.  I don't think there's even any swearing. So if you're looking for a great film to watch with your children and your parents, this is a great one to consider!
0792164903|5.0|Sleepy Hollow is rather loosely based on the story of the same name by Washington Irving, about a small town haunted by the Headless Horseman. In Tim Burton's version of the story, the events take place in the isolated colony of Sleepy Hollow, where several townsfolk have been beheaded by what the people describe as a headless horseman. As the film begins, rebel constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to the isolated town for believing that his work should be governed by the facts rather than by insane beliefs. His reasons for believing in, as he says, \\"sense and justice\\" rather than a series of ghastly fairytales that pass for an ethical system, are explored in a series of dream sequences in which we see a seven-year-old version of Ichabod (Sam Fior) with the influences of his mother (Lisa Marie) and his father (Peter Guinness). In a way, these scenes make the science versus superstition subplot of the film what it is: fascinating rather than insulting. In any case, upon arriving in Sleepy Hollow, the adult Ichabod Crane is greeted by Katrina Anne Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) and her father, Baltus (Michael Gambon), whose initial reactions to the man are as opposite as their personalities. Baltus is a stuffy, superstitious man, a relic of the century that is about to be left behind (the film is set in the year 1799), while his daughter Katrina is an inquisitive, hopeful woman with an open mind to the investigative techniques employed by Crane. It is a credit to the actors that while we accept these methods as being a crude version of those we take for granted today, we also can accept the unhealthy scepticism with which they are greeted by most of the characters in this film, local coroner Doctor Thomas Lancaster (Ian McDiarmid), not least among them.  <br /> <br />Another credit to this film and its makers is the power of its characterizations. At first, I simply could not recognize the man playing Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien), in spite of the fact thatI had seen his face enough times in Starship Troopers to be able to recognize the actor out of costume at twenty paces. Another such character who comes across as a character rather than an actor playing a character would be Reverend Steenwyck (Jeffrey Jones), whom I would not have recognized if he had failed to remove his wig during the film. In fact, the only actor other than the two who are billed on the theatrical poster (which also serves as the front cover artwork) who is easily recognizable would be Christopher Walken, who plays the headless horseman before the decapitation, and after his skull is returned to him. Ray Park plays the horseman during most of the sword-swinging scenes, but his head is blue-screened out of the picture. Even the characters with minimal screentime and development, Brom among them, are so convincing that they quickly overshadow the somewhat hollow Shakespearean nature of the story. If there is a weak point in the film, it is only carried over from the story upon which Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay is based: the overstructured nature of the dialogue. The setting and nature of this film only serves to once again highlight the absurdity of the praise lumped upon William Shakespeare and his work: human beings, under normal circumstances, simply do not speak like this. Still, the strengths of this film far outweigh its negatives.  <br /> <br />A look at the film on the Internet Movie Database reveals that, like a lot of Tim Burton films, this movie divides opinion as thoroughly as the modern-day issue of whether we should clone new cells to turn dreaded illnesses of our modern era into relics of the past. The majority of the voters are in the same camp as myself, and praise the film for the quality of the set design, the acting, the characterizations, or all of the above and more. A small minority attack this film for its reported major deviance from the Washington Irving story, or describe this film as being nothing but gore from start to finish. The first of those two criticisms is perfectly valid, but I feel that if I wanted Washington Irving's story to be faithfully followed, I would have gone out and bought myself a copy of that story in printed form. Ian McDiarmid's performance during the autopsy scene makes a blatant joke out of the second criticism, with acting so convincing and strong that it reminded me of what the man has been doing in the sixteen years between this film and Return Of The Jedi (running a theatre company, for those who don't know). In a nutshell, if you want an intelligent film with well-developed characters and an almost flawless plot, then Sleepy Hollow is most certainly the one to look at. Quite why it only received one Academy Award for Art Direction when there are performances, special effects, and a script worthy of such recognition, in contrast to the films that actually won these awards, most notably The Matrix, is beyond me.  <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I have to say that when I sat down to watch this movie, I had no idea what I was in for. I won't go into plot detail - the amazon review of it describes it perfectly.  It's one of those movies you will either love and watch again and again, or detest. Suffice it to say, that only those with a capacity to appreciate subtle, abstract humor will appreciate it.  I am speculating that an artistic mind - writers, artists or the eccentric among us are going to appreciate this clever production.   Also noted are fun cinematography and hilarity from mundane experiences.  If you are simple, do not watch this flick - it'll bore you and prompt you to write a contradictory and ill-informed refiew.  If you want something different from the mindless crap that Hollywood has been dumping on us for a decade, go buy it. 'Nuf said.

Joseph Fiennes plays a young Shakespeare, struggling to make ends meet and suffering from a bad case of writer's block. Geoffrey Rush plays Henslow, the owner of the Rose theatre, also struggling to make ends meet. Shakespeare has promised Henslow a comedy - \\"Romeo and Ethel, The Pirate's Daughter\\", but the creative juices are stagnant.  <br /> <br />Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a young, affluent woman who loves the theatre dearly, and pines to be an actress. The problem is, in Elizabethan England, women were not allowed onto the theatrical stage as it was considered an act of public lewdness. Viola disguises herself as a man, Thomas Kent, and auditions for Romeo and Ethel. Shakespeare quickly recognizes a great actor when he hears her, and pursues her, not realizing just who she is. He arrives at her estate, and sneaks in. He sees Viola as herself, not recognizing her out of disguise, and is smitten with her beauty, falling head-over-heels in love. The only problem is that she is betrothed to Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), a man she does not love.  <br /> <br />For those of you who are in the least familiar with Romeo and Juliet, you will quickly begin to realize the basic premise of this movie. Shakespeare is a young, poor and fledgling writer with no particular reputation, writing plays based around his life experiences. It is an intriguing concept, and one which works wonderfully well on several levels. There is drama, comedy, passion and tragedy aplenty on offer here. This is deeply moving material, and movie-making at its very best, with wonderful production design, superb costuming, great music and wonderful cinematography. Like a fine red wine, this is a movie to be treasured and savoured.  <br />
B000002P5W|5.0|This is my all time favorite album tied with Sgt. Pepper's loney hearts club band by the Beatles. Every song is brilliant. Every one. don't even hesitate, buy this now!!!
B00005ASHM|5.0|No good album is immediately gratifying. instead, Pet Sounds is an album that is more beautiful, more profound, simpler, and more puzzling everytime i listen to it. Sound like a contradiction? Find out for yourself. You may not be as convinced as I am, but if you are, you'll have a gift to treasure for life.
0316172324|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell is one of the most brilliant non- fiction writers working today. He is a researcher and a thinker who looks into social phenomena and makes connections between diverse activities and areas of life in startling and interesting ways. While he is most known for the concept of ' the tipping point' I personally found his most remarkable essay to be on key figures in human social networks, and the way one individual may  connect hundreds of even thousands different kinds of people  together. In this present work which I have read the British edition of  he writes about what he calls 'adaptive unconscious' about processes of mind and decision that determine much of our action in life. He opens with a consideration of the Getty Museum's considering the purchase of what seemed to be a great new discovery, a statue of a certain kind called a 'kourous. The Getty went to the greatest experts in scientifically evaluating the materials of the statue and they come up with it as genuine. However when the Getty showed the stature to people who live in the world of art history most of them instinctively recoiled from it. They made the kind of ' blink' split - second decision which bypassed their consciousness. They proved to be right. Gladwell goes on to consider ' thin- slicing' decision making in other areas, that is decision-making which is based on a very small set of experience. In his second chapter he looks at the work of a psychologist John Gottman who has developed a method of predicting whether a couple will eventually divorce through noting certain qualities revealed in a fifteen - minute conversation between them. Stonewalling, criticizing are two of the factors attended to but the key one is the degree of contempt one of the partners may have for another. But for Gladwell the focus is on understanding that it does not take a prolonged process of consciously investigating and collecting data but rather a quick- thin- slice evaluation to get to the truth of the situation. Gladwell investigates other kinds of situations in which in one case a firefighter, in another a Vietnam War veteran and Marine officer show a kind of instinctive ' right action' which would not be possible had they talked or thought too much at the wrong time and confused themselves in the process. Gladwell writes of very interesting characters , finds people of extraordinary abilities even when it comes to selling cars or tasting food. He centers on non- conventional figures who have in one way or another extraordinary gifts in ordinary life. In one chapter he looks at the diagnosis of heart- attacks in emergency room and shows how a method a researcher tried to push and had rejected for years has enabled quick, life- saving diagnosis. In this situation too he shows how too much information, too much conscious rehashing of data can interfere with a kind of quick- decision making a kind of ' in a blink' judgment. Here however it should be pointed out that Gladwell insists that in many areas of life it is only because there has been prior training, study, rehearsal that such wise- snap judgment is possible. All in all this is a richly informative and highly interesting work, a very pleasurable read.<br /><br />It will take more than one blink to read, but it will be worth it.f the situation.

B00005A1PR|5.0|I finally got this CD - it is so beautiful.  Very mellow and relaxing.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Reasons to buy this album: <br /> <br />1.   This album is one of the greatest albums ever.  The greatest album of the 70's, and only behind The Beatles' \\"White Album\\" in terms of rock and roll, ever. <br /> <br /> <br />2.  The female vocals in \\"Great Gig in the Sky\\" are awesome. <br />    They rank along with the Stones' \\"Gimme Shelter\\" in terms of backup female vocals. <br /> <br />3. \\"Money\\"  TOne of the most recognizable songs by the Floyd.  <br /> <br />4. These tracks are soft and only loud on sparse occasions.  This album is very relaxing to listen to, and this makes it an album that one can even fall asleep due to the peacefulness and the poetic lyrics. <br /> <br />5. The 30th edition can only help but make the music much clearer and cleaner so that the listener can get his or her money's worth.  But, even the regular issues are great if you can't afford this one. <br /> <br />6. All these songs are timeless classics. <br /> <br />7. The album plays as one long song: a plus in concept. <br /> <br />Word of advice: Play this album with The Wizard of Oz (volume all the way down).  It's pretty cool.
B0000017CA|5.0|all that needs to be said, is that this is possibly the best album ever recorded
068987474X|5.0|This book, while masquerading as a dating \\"self help\\" book, is more about learning to respect yourself and less about how to find a boyfriend. <br /> <br />The bottom line of this book is to respect yourself enough to not just date \\"that guy\\" because it's easier than being single.
0064400018|5.0|I read this entire series (more than once or twice!) as a young girl and saved every book so that I could pass them on to my children.  (Alas, I have all boys!)  This would be a wonderful gift for any young girl.  I would even read them again as an adult.
B00005V9IL|4.0|I like this movie. I remember saying cool to myself several times when I originally saw it in the theaters. Now on DVD, it is still fun. The underwater scenes are very good. The tube of water scene is very cool. The suspense when the crane falls is very good. There are several very entertaining scenes. The relationships between the characters have nice touches as well. Some scenes have an emotional depth and are very touching.    The bad points are the plot. The plot meanders a little, which is not too bad, but the really bad part is the ending. In the theatrical release, the ending is aggressively editted leaving the ending confusing. In the extended edition, they add the deleted scenes. However, it puts the aliens in a sanctimonious light. The aliens are going to destroy us, because it hurts them to see us hurt ourselves. Huh? What about the pain suffering they would cause by drowning us? The aliens tell us that we need to grow up. Wow! What a revelation! War is wrong.    Despite the ending, the movie is original and fun. The acting is strong. Chris Elliot has a bit part and he is of course, very funny.
B000002UAX|5.0|This was recorded at a time when tensions within the group were really beginning to tell so many of the tracks are more like solo offerings from the individual members than Beatles tracks.<br /><br />The album opens in great style with Back in the USSR. The lyrics are not overtly political though they are out of date - the airline BOAC long ago became part of British Airways and the USSR eventually divided into its component parts. I wonder what John Lennon would think now if he were alive. Still, Back in the USSR is a great opening song for the album.<br /><br />The album maintains this high standard for the next three tracks. Dear Prudence is a superb ballad. Glass onion reminds us about earlier Beatles songs such as Strawberry fields forever, I am the walrus, Lady Madonna, Fool on the hill and Fixing a hole - the lyrics are very clever. Ob-la-di ob-la-da is a very catchy song about a happy couple, which became a huge international hit for Marmalade and topped the UK charts.<br /><br />After that, there is Wild honey pie, a short and somewhat meaningless piece that could have been omitted - it appears to be an outtake, recorded when they were trying to work out how to record Honey pie, the official version of which is on the second CD. The continuing story of Bungalow Bill is a great song, which I'm sure contains a message but haven't figured it out. Next comes a truly outstanding ballad written by George Harrison - While my guitar gently weeps. Nothing else on the remainder of the album is up to that standard although there is plenty of great music. I particularly like Martha my dear, I'm so tired, Blackbird, I will and Julia on the remainder of the first CD. On the second CD, my favorites are Sexy Sadie, Helter-skelter, Revolution 1, Honey pie, Savoy Truffle and Cry baby cry. Like the first CD, the second CD contains a meaningless piece - Revolution 9 - but this time it's a full-length track.<br /><br />This is different from any other Beatles album, which explains why people who don't normally like the Beatles sometimes enjoy this album, As a committed Beatles fan, I find this album to be interesting and entertaining in many ways but there are other Beatles albums that I play more frequently than this one.ich explains why people who don't normally like the Beatles sometimes enjoy this album, As a committed Beatles fan, I find this album to be interesting and entertaining in many ways but there are other Beatles albums that I play more frequently than this one.
0062502182|1.0|I think this book must have been written for ten year olds. The language and prose, (or the lack thereof), employed was so basic and stultfyingly simple, it bored me to tears. I couldn't get through more than half of it and that took me a great deal of effort. It was like reading Dr Seuss only not fun. I was only trying to read it because a friend had given it to me for Christmas. Are we supposed to believe in this character? Gets robbed of everything, but still, look on the bright side eh? I read about ten books a month, all fiction and mostly great but I just couldn't grasp the crassness of this novel. It reads like a Michael Jackson lyric - 'Let's all just hold hands and the world will be a better place' or what....ever. This one needs a minus star rating!
B000002W4V|5.0|This is absolutely one of, if not the, best live albums ever. It still stands up today as well as it did in 1973 when   it was recorded. With all due respect to Robert Quine & Fernando Saunders, this is the best band Lou ever assembled. I think Steve Hunter & Dick Wagner are the greatest guitar duo ever, PERIOD!!
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Visually this moving is everything your expect in a 2nd GITS, although a little short on action. The only thing that really stinks is that you cant enjoy the visuals becuase busy trying to read tiny subtitles and understand needlessly complex dialogue. Not to mention with the subtitles arent distracting your attention and there is a rare quiet scene in the move the close captioning kicks in, WTF? Watching it on my 52 LCD the subtitles are impossible large as well.<br /><br />But watching it a 2nd and 3rd and not turning on the subtitles this film is really visually breathtaking while staying true to the original.<br /><br />As one of the other reviewers stated there is some really uneeded mental gymnastics here, which I would not even mind so much if I didnt have to read them and watch the film at the same time.<br /><br />Thank goodness I checked this out on netflix first, Ill wait to buy the dubbed version.
B0002X314C|5.0|when I heard him on Chicago's radion staion B96, in the studio with the piano singing Ordinary People.  The CD was supposed to be released in November, early December but the release date was pushed back.  Anyone who can go into a radio station and literally sing his heart out like, Mr. Ledgend did, deserves all the kudos he is getting right now.  In the time of these NONE artists out here, here is someone who is a writer, musician and singer like Alicia Keys, making his mark.  He will be around for a very long time.  Good breakthrough start for Chi-Town's Kanye West's new label.
B000001E7V|5.0|this cd is in constant rotation with my huge collection.  i keep going back to this cd feeling like i haven't heard it enough or i might have missed something on it i hadn't heard before...yet i've heard it a million times, and with each time i hear it, it only gets better and better...this is an awesome album and leaves me speechless...i could say so much about this album, but i don't know where to stop or where to begin.  i highly recommend this album!!!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|This movie is totally awesome.  The way Leone puts it all together is totally sweet, and the music in it(by Ennio Morricone) is totally awesome as well!!  In fact I like all of Clint's so called- \\"Man with no name\\" spaghetti westerns. This one is memorable for Eli Wallach's portrayal of Tuco, the lovably dirty, and greedy(as well as often humorous) \\"Ugly\\". The sympathetic view of the Civil War is also memorable, and the character development for the Characters especially the main ones: \\"The Good\\", \\"The Bad\\" and \\"The Ugly\\" also make the movie sweet.  The additions in the special edition make the plot flow a little easier, and its pretty fun to watch in Italian(I still use subtitles, since I don't know Italian).  I haven't seen all the special features yet, but I'm sure there good too.
B000002UAX|5.0|Now before you go into a top-spin about how Sgt. Pepper or Revolver captured the public eye more than this one, let me plead my case: <br /> <br />With their poppiest ditz days AND their acid trips behind them, the Beatles finally looked inside themselves and wrote the very long White Album. It doesn't make you want to get up and dance like a lot of their earliest material. And it doesn't make you want to drink absinthe or go on a road trip with Timothy Leary or anything like that. Instead, the White Album is a lengthy and incredibly catchy (but still brilliant) set of songs that flash a light onto Paul, John, and George's songwriting ability like nothing else they ever did. There isn't a genre for this other than pop rock, and even that is somewhat generous - there isn't much \\"rock\\" persay; most of the White Album is simply a rock band playing some of the best pop songs ever written. <br /> <br />Only the Beatles could've gotten away with a double album this big, and they certainly did. The second disc is clearly not as strong as the first; if they had only released the first of the two albums, it would probably be considered by everyone as their best. Still, the second disc contains some important classics.  <br /> <br />Standouts include, but are not limited to: \\"Dear Prudence,\\" a less-known and more introspective peice, \\"Martha My Dear,\\" an uplifting track that jumps between chords like kids playing hop-scotch in the street, \\"Blackbird,\\" the classic song for baby-boomers learning guitar, \\"Julia,\\" a breezy and dreamy oceanic showcase of George's incredible guitar fingering, and \\"Revolution 1,\\" a true rocker with a pumped riff and charged vocals. <br /> <br />While \\"Revolution 9\\" is undoubtedly the worst Beatles song ever made and really the only track that doesn't fit in the White Album, it is still a primitive and interesting experiment with production techniques. <br /> <br />While it may not have carried the political overtones that other Beatles albums did, and while it may not have seemed as original at the time, the White Album (coming from a musician and music entrepreneur) contains the best pure songwriting of any Beatles record.
0790732254|5.0|Instantly my favorite movie.  Ten years later, still my favorite movie.  I have rented almost everything available from the beginning of film all the way to seeing 'Oceans 12' a couple days ago (a really dreadful movie).  All the actors had, or went on to have, brilliant acting careers; Wexler is an overlooked master of photography; Nichols never got any better as a director; Albee's play is stunning in any format--the dialogue and situations transcend everything; Alex North's music (as usual) is spot on, and still serves as the soundtrack for my overnight spells of insomnia. <br /> <br />For best results, invite your best friends over, sit up with a pot of coffee, and start viewing this around 2 a.m.  Two hours later, when it's all over, the exhaustion of the late night will coincide so cathartically with George and Martha's final exorcism that you will have experienced your own encounter with The Void. <br /> <br />And stripped of illusions, what meaning does one's life finally have?  It is perhaps the highest and most universal question modern art has ever asked.  Go ahead and work your trivial job, and buy your possessions, and coordinate your Saturday night orgies; it means nothing and is nothing. <br /> <br />I'm scared as hell of Virginia Woolf.
B0000027RL|5.0|The early 90s was the perfect time for grunge - most of American youth was sick of everything else, from music to politics to the baby boomers themselves. Then along came the Seattle music scene, out of which emerged a gritty, dirty, punkish, slow kind of raw rock 'n roll that we have all come to know as grunge. Out of grunge emerged a countless number of bands - many terrible but some fantastic. Along with Nirvana and Soundgarden (as well as Sonic Youth, Alice in Chains, and Stone Temple Pilots to some extent), Pearl Jam emerged as one of the most important grunge bands to hit the mainstream. <br /> <br />Ten was the album that exploded them onto the scene. At times it can spit in your face, kiss you on the forehead, and send you spinning into the clouds all at once. One of the few rock albums without a bad song, Ten is on a level all by itself. While Nirvana was the pop-punk side of grunge and Soundgarden was playing around with unorthodox guitar riffs, Ten was quite simply rock 'n roll (and grunge) at its best - pure, emotionally-driven hard rock with intense vocals and mesmerizing guitar solos (in particular the solo in \\"Alive,\\" in my opinion among the greatest of all time), and heavy, powerful bass and drums. <br /> <br />Eddie Vedder's long vocables and screams, such as those at the end of \\"Jeremy,\\" are just as haunting and poetic as the actual words, giving Ten more flavor, lyrically speaking, than anything else Pearl Jam has done. And the way the chords progress, like those in \\"Even Flow,\\" \\"Once,\\" and \\"Black\\" (which even uses piano), grind into your ears like an animate jackhammer. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most underrated track on the album, \\"Release,\\" is a beatiful ending that will send you spiraling into the ocean and rescue from drowning at the same time. <br /> <br />Setting all historic overtones aside, and disregarding the rest of Pearl Jam's long, up-and-down career, Ten is nothing but an amazing rock record.
B000687M48|2.0|I bought the CD because I had so much been waiting for a follow-up from Evanescence. Unfortunately, this live CD really does not deliver. The audio is just horrific and for the first half, the songs really douns like someone put a tape player on stage and had some dudes in the background play to it. Luckily, the second half is somewhat better. <br />If you're interested in the DVD that comes with it, though, this is much more interesting. Buy it for the DVD if you like, but almost all live versions will make you stop and reach for the originals on \\"Fallen\\".
B00008H2LB|5.0|I'ts actually really hard to get me to buy a cd for myself because i get bored easy. But gosh meteora by linkin park change all that it's definetly worth it i love all the songs it's well worth your money. I am a true fan of Linkin Park there true to their music.No other band can compare to them their unique!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|A portrayal of life in its beauty, harshness, it's pure form of reality. It's dark, haunting, and depressing. The little joys in life is something we all share, as well as the indifferent, and the evil. A brutal assault of images, scenes, and memories.    The definition of requiem is a mass for the dead, in this film's title, a mass for the death of dreams. Each character in this movie has their own desire.    We all have dreams, as do the characters in this film. Sara Goldfarb played amazingly by Ellen Burstyn, is the mother of Harry (Jay Leto). Now a elderly widow living on her own, she has nothing but infomercials as her companion. Harry is a drug addict, getting by on unknown monetary means, using what little money he does have for riding taxis and buying drugs. Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) plays his best friend and his girlfriend is played is Marion (Jennifer Connelly).    Sara gets a call that she is eligible to win for a spot on the show that she religiously watches. She belives she will get a chance to be on the show, something she is dreaming of. Wanting to fit into a dress, that she had worn years ago to her son's high school graduation, so that she may wear it on the show. She attempts to follow a diet to lose weight to no avail. The cravings are too strong and she resorts to taking advice from her friend: diet pills prescribed through a doctor. She wants nothing but to be on the show, to be loved by millions through telvision, to have them love her son, to love her husband. Being able to wear the dress to her is being young again, to be thin again, to regain the feeling she got from being with her husband. An escape from her lonely reality to one where all her wishes come true.    Harry, Tyrone, and Marion do drugs together and are dependant on them. Harry and Tyrone try to sell drugs to make more money. Marion is an artist and Harry wants to open a space for her drawings. He is attempting to make money to open the space so they may achieve this as well as betogether. Tyrone seems to only share one memory of his mother as a child that seems to plague him increasingly. Harry wants nothing but the ones he loves to be happy: his mother and his girlfriend. Tyrone longs for his mother's arms. Marion is detatched and has nothing but money.    With amazing director direction and cinematography, the story increases in its drama and intensity. A roller coaster of their lives, drugs and addictions, their individual dreams all leading into a fall that is inevitable-- that some might not be able to handle. Only turning for a requiem, for all their dreams.    So much emphasis put on drugs, though that is the vehicle on which their troubles ride, is not the entire movie. Whatever it is, is for you to see in this film.    It is traumatic to watch, yet fulfilling. Because of its highly graphic and extremely difficult content, it is only recommended for those who can handle it. The director's cut leaves nothing out, the full edit of constant scenes that lead to the group of character's downfalls and leaving you stunned and speechless. What we are willing to do for what we want and think we need-- and how far we will go to get it. Even if it means losing ourselves in the fury of it all.
B000001F7R|5.0|Yes, I too have been a Lep fan since Pyromania in the early 80's. If you know anything about the history of DL, you'll appreciate the sound of \\"On Through the Night\\" and the players in the band.  Elliot's voice is rough, but that's the beauty of it. They're just starting out, and they get better, but you have to love this first album. Believe it or not, my 3-1/2 yr old son plays Rock Brigade and Hello America while we cook in the kitchen. Even at that age they know good music when they hear it. Give it a chance, you'll love it!
B000062YAZ|5.0|You can not call yourself a true metal head without owning this CD. This album not only put Slayer on the map, But speed metal as a whole. The sheer brutality of this album stands on it's own. <br />I have been listining to Slayer for 15 years now and still love the classic in your face Slayer sound.
0800141660|5.0|This movie is so much fun. Back in the 70s, when I was the only geek girl in high school reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS and all titles by Jane Austen, little did I suspect that anyone would ever make hugely popular movies out of what (at that time) was fare for only the most devoted of bookworms.<br /><br />The adaptation of this classic author by actor/screenwriter Emma Thompson is superb. However, many of the other reviewers have praised Thompson's brilliance in detail, so instead I'll touch on another favorite feature of mine: the supporting cast.<br /><br />Remember Siegfried Farnon, the older, robust vet from ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL? His name is Robert Hardy and here he plays the kindly but rambunctious uncle. Somehow, somewhere they found an actress to play his mother who is so like Robert Hardy in looks and personality, you'd swear they were blood relatives. This lively, raucous pair gift the Dashwood sisters and their bereaved mother with a humble cottage when they're left homeless (or, rather, mansionless) by the death of their father. Generous deeds aside, if there's juicy gossip to be had, these two will be sure to \\"winkle it out of you.\\"<br /><br />There are too many wonderful supporting roles in this movie filled by excellent actors, so I'll mention just one more. Harriet Walter plays Fanny Dashwood to perfection - the stingy in-law who's gone power-drunk now that her husband has inherited the home and wealth his sisters have just lost. In one pivotal scene, Fanny coaxes the secretly engaged Lucy Steele to spill her romantic secret. \\"I'm as silent as the grave,\\" says the horrible Fanny, leaning in close to the unsuspecting girl. As she leans, you get the distinct impression she *is* the grave. And all from one look. Harriet Walter plays the villain with a sense of humor about herself that can only be described as delicious.<br /><br />The title of this story refers to the dispositions of the two older Dashwood sisters. \\"Sense\\" is the practical and commonsense Elinor, played by Emma Thompson - the ultra-responsible elder sister who appears not to give in to the longings of her heart. \\"Sensibility\\" refers to the demonstrative Miss Marianne, played by Kate Winslet, who wears her heart on her sleeve and pooh-poohs anyone who doesn't. Through a series of misunderstandings, plus a fine collection of hilarious and dramatic incidents, the tables are turned and the sisters walk a mile in one another's shoes.<br /><br />My husband enjoyed this one as much as I did. And I'm pleased to report that the movie is 100% worthy of the book.commonsense Elinor, played by Emma Thompson - the ultra-responsible elder sister who appears not to give in to the longings of her heart. \\"Sensibility\\" refers to the demonstrative Miss Marianne, played by Kate Winslet, who wears her heart on her sleeve and pooh-poohs anyone who doesn't.

B00005JN2Z|1.0|In the end on this movie... <br />- The bad guy gets shot in the face/neck then hops back up to resume the chase and perform such feats as leaping onto a moving train <br />- A cop has the good guy at gunpoint on his knees after discovering a body in the trunk, but the good buy casually flips him over and handcuffs the cop to a car easy as pie <br />- The good guy is able to see the bad guy in pursuit of his lady friend in an office building from the top of a parking garage, like watching an ant farm. <br />- Never fear, the good guy is miraculously able to cover the distance between the parking garage and the top of the office building JUST IN TIME (maybe he flew over) <br />- The bad guy, who NEVER hesitates at any other opint in the movie before killing someone, who easily and with blinding speed offed two guys who had him at gunpoint earlier in the film, takes a nice big dramatic pause when he has the good guy's girlfriend in his sights <br />- The bad guy, who had no trouble shooting several armed guards in a crowded nightclub while jumping and spinning around, fires an entire clip at the good guy from less than five feet away, missing with every shot <br />-  The good guy does the same, emptying his clip at VERY close range, but, luckily, only hits the bad guy in one special magical spot that allows him to make a dippy little speech before dying <br />- The girl, who hasn't been in the movie more than five minutes total, and that right at the opning credits, gets saved and falls in love with the hero just as the movie ends <br /> <br />And there's more.  The ending of this movie is formulaic, predictable, chiched, pat, tired, cheesy, and melodramatic.  Did other good stuff happen before this terrible ending?  Yes.  Does it matter?  No.  This ending is so bad it completely ruins the entire movie.
0393035158|5.0|Finally, a clear and unbiased overview of the present dangers of faith-based belief in a world where religious ideologies are clashing in a large scale arena strewn with weapons of catastrophic proportions.  As Sam Harris points out, all instances of local conflicts, massacres and genocide are the results of the adherents of two or more religious doctrines attempting to destroy each other.  People who rely on blind faith to ground their beliefs are incapable of true rational thought and the results of these belief systems are recorded in our brutal and vicious recent history.  In a world becoming smaller by the year we are witnessing that same clash in a global sense as the adherents of Islam attempt to destroy the \\"infidels\\" (the Christians and the Jews in this case). <br /> <br />Harris makes a powerful case for the complete irradication of faith based belief from our intellectual and cultural discourse. He first shows convincingly that the human actions taken on behalf of these types of belief systems are overwhelmingly atrocious and continue to be so (suicide bombers).  Harris also gives us alternatives with a glimpse into a possible source of ethics that would serve us better and has no cultural biases. <br /> <br />I particularly agreed with how Harris leaves no room for moderate Christian or Islamic believers, because ultimately his critique rests on the shortcomings of faith based irrationality, which even the moderates espouse. Harris dismisses Pacifism as a way to deal with religious fundamentalism and even goes so far as to suggest that some forms of torture are (unfortunately) the only way to realistically deal with irrational people. I found this position a bit too extreme, but I also agree with Harris in that there is no other possible way to have a logical and reasonable discussion with people who believe in an afterlife.  People who are convinced that they are going to Heaven/Paradise are not able to comprehend reasonable arguments of any kind. <br /> <br />All in all \\"The End of Faith\\" is a book that marks our present- day dilemmas with an unequivocal insight that is more revealing than Baron d'Holbach's \\"Ecce Homo!\\" (an Eighteenth Century rational examination of the life of Jesus).  Harris joins the select group of clear thinkers from our past such as Galileo, Swift, The French Philosophes, Whitman and other atheists who have contributed greatly to rational human discourse. What makes this book all the more relevant is that it speaks to today's issues in the clear and heartfelt light of reason.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended to skeptics and to believers alike.
B00006JSS8|4.0|This cd caught my eye and I remembered back to when I first heard any of his music with \\"I Just Called To Say I Love You\\" I couldn't of been older then 5 or so.  So I bought it basically for that track and a few others, but when I popped this in I was pleasantly surprised by how much I dig the sound of the rest of his songs like \\"Superstition\\", of course the classic \\"Sir Duke\\", \\"Overjoyed\\", my new fave \\"Part-Time Lover.\\"  But when the cd stopped I realized one of his tracks I love didn't play.  So I checked the track listing on the back jacket of the cd, frantically searching for \\"Isn't She Lovely\\".  So whoever put this track list together missed one of his best songs.  I'm not going to fault this whole cd for one omission, so I guess my rating would be more in the 4.95 star range.  Pop this in and happy Summer cruisin to ya you'll love it.
B000000OAL|5.0|I have been a Queen fan since 1984 (i was born in 1976)    It took awhile for me to discover this album. (my first few were the works and greatest hits 1, US VERSION) Keep Yourself Alive was on that hits record, so i bought its originating place. Queen 1. Here is a song run down from one of their biggest fans    Keep Yourself Alive: This was their first single and the first track on the album. A KILLER guitar solo and a drum solo compliment Freddie Mercurys vocals very well. I was blown away the first time i heard it. ANY song released as a single with this much energy should be a number one hit, but it failed to chart.    Doin Alright: This was also on the flip of the 45 of Liar. This one starts quiet and gets VERY LOUD towards the end. This is one of their better songs, very thoughtful lyrics.     Great King Rat: An epic song which amusingly the chorus goes to the tune of Old King Cole. The guitar solos demonstrate why Brian May was THE greatest guitarist to ever live.     My Fairy King: This is one of the precursors to Bohemian Rhapsody. Very similar sounding. The last minute or so is basically a musical orgasm. One of the standout tracks on this album.     Liar: A 6 and a half minute opus. Lots of epic guitarwork. This song kicks [...]. This was released in edited form in the USA and failed to chart. (I think the truncated version is why, this song can't be enjoyed at anything less than the full song. Hell, it takes them a minute and a half just to get to the vocals!)    The Night Comes Down: This is the original demo version. They didn't like the subsequent versions they recorded, so they fell back on the demo version. Some nice harmonizing vocals. One of the better songs on the album. (although the whole album is good)    Modern times Rock N Roll: A short, less than 2 minute heavy rock and roll song. Sung by drummer Roger Taylor, there is some killer guitarwork in this song too!    Son & Daughter: One of their gayest lyrics: \\"I want you to be a woman\\" Either that or they want to screw a minor and wish she'd age fast. I am proud to say that even though it sounds \\"gay\\" Freddie didn't write it, Brian May did. When it was performed live it had Brian May's echoplex solo attached to it. (Later put onto record as a part of Brighton Rock) This was also released on 45 as the flip side to Keep Yourself Alive) Not as good on the album but a fine song anyways.    Jesus: Early songs made me think they were a religious band. Not the best song they ever did, but the guitar break at the end has one of their heaviest solos on any of their songs.    Seven Seas Of Rhye: This is a short about 90 second instrumental \\"teaser\\" for Queen II. Not worth too much, they'd have been better off putting the next song on the original album....    BONUS TRACKS:    Mad The Swine: Another of the \\"Jesus\\" songs. Apparently they didnt agree with the original mixing of the song so left it off the album.     Keep Yourself Alive (Long Lost Retake): This and the last track, the Liar remix are poor excuses for bonus tracks. They would have been better off remastering live recordings or rare studio stuff. (Silver Salmon, Hangman, Polar Bear) Than making almost clone remixes of the original version. Later remixes are good (bicycle Race, We Will Rock You & Flash) but this is just space filler.    Other than the last 2 bonus tracks, this album is PERFECT!
B00005JLEX|5.0|Yes, future episodes shoot beyond the stratosphere in quality as characters are developed and the stories attain that \\"anything goes\\" weirdness, but don't let anyone tell you that these early episodes aren't a riot, either.  Because they are.  The stories and Jerry's stand-up are both hilarious, the DVD extras are lavish in their generosity, and the picture and sound are top-notch.  It's a no-brainer.  Get these.
B0000039QA|4.0|Biggie album Life After Death is a classic!! A must get 4 all hip hop fanz who know real hiphop when they hear it.. Biggie and Pac were the very best and the game just aint tha same. <br />Personally, i must say i'm a bigger 2Pac fan, howeva, i'm not taking anything away from BIG. The truth is it doesn't matter who u prefer or who u think is better, because they both were the best in their own way. BIGGIE had more rythm and flow than Pac, but Pac's music was more political, deeper and socially conscious. <br />Anyways, the album is a classic especially hypotnise..  <br />Hiphop will forever be blessed because of BIG and Pac and their memory will live forever especially with albums such as this. <br />R.I.P - One Love One Nation!!
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|Stylish direction and very good acting (especially by Halle Berry and Robert Downey, Jr.) are somewhat done in by an often obvious script.  If plot points and clues were presented with anywhere near the subtlety seen in the directing or acting, this movie really could have been something.  Instead, the film ends up being fairly entertaining yet predictable.  I don't know if this is the fault of the script writers or the director, the latter of whom probably had the power to better hide the clues or alter the dialogue and exposition during shooting to avoid letting the various cats out of the bag too soon.  Still, this isn't a horrid film, and I don't hesitate to recommend it as a rental or an inexpensive purchase.  Picture and sound on the DVD are generally excellent, and there are a few interesting extra features.  Overall, this isn't a bad little film to discover on DVD.
B00000IBE2|3.0|Any fan of this band knows that Dire Straits' best songs aren't the ones played on the radio these days.  Although tunes like Money for Nothing (which is edited for this album), Sultans of Swing, and Walk Of Life are great songs; they're not the best this band has to offer.  The depth of Dire Straits catalog is incredible considering the band only produced six studio albums and a couple of live ones.  It would be impossible to capture all their &quot;Greatest&quot; songs on one album but this one gives it a good shot.  I would ask anyone who buys and enjoys this album to invest in some albums like Love Over Gold, Making Movies, and their self titled debut.  The sound of the band changed a little since their debut in the late Seventies when songs like Lions, Wild West End, and Once Upon A Time In The West demonstrated Mark Knopfler's superb guitar work and unique voice but the quality of their work is unquestionable.  My fav tune of all time is Telegraph Road which gets absolutely no respect from current radio due to it's extended length but it's a great tune.  Songs like News, Single Handed Sailor, Espresso Love, Industrial Disease, and When It Comes To You should be included in any &quot;Best Of&quot; set but aren't here. If you only know songs like Money for Nothing and Sultans of Swing you should buy this album to get a taste of the band but don't stop there - there's so much more.
B0002XDODU|5.0|I bought Reise, Reise on Monday (Jan 10) and just fell in love with the heavyness and lyrices. Since that point i have also bought Mutter and Live aus Berlin!

B000002JS6|5.0|Wow.  This is easily one of the best albums I own.  Tracks on it are true metal and that's what makes this is a classic.  Though the first half of the album is good with the class \\"Hells Bells\\" the second half is where the album really shines.  With powerful, headbanging classics such as the title track, \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", and \\"Have a Drinik on Me\\".  Though some will call this album immature and juvenile it does not take away from the awesome solos, heartfelt lyrics, and intense intros. <br /> <br />Hells Bells  9/10 <br />Shoot to Thrill 8/10 <br />What You Do for Money Honey 7/10 <br />Given the Dog a Bone 7/10 <br />Let Me Put My Love into You 6/10 <br />Back in Black 10/10 <br />You Shook Me All Night Long 10/10 <br />Have a Drink on Me 9/10 <br />Shake a Leg 8/10 <br />Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution 7/10
B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones classic self-titled debut changed the music industry.  Joe Strummer (RIP) listed \\"Ramones\\" as the most essential punk rock album ever recorded.  The bottom line is this; \\"punk rock\\" as a genre did not EXIST until the Ramones were formed.  Sure, there were proto-punk group like the Stooges, the Dictators, and the New York Dolls, but the punk ethic was defined by this album, period.    The sound is classic, with the bass in one speaker and the guitar in the other speaker.  The vocals show a Joey who hadn't quite yet figured out what he was all about, but he still kicked major [...].  The words are classic.  From the Tommy-penned \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\", to the classic admition of male prostitution of the Dee Dee penned \\"53rd and 3rd\\", to the Johnny penned \\"I Don't Wanna Go Down To The Basement\\", this cd is where it all began, fellas.    The bonus tracks are not new revalations, but they work.  The cd must be in your collection if you wanna be a \\"punk rocker\\", because Blink 182, Green Day, and Yellowcard are NOT \\"punk\\" bands; they are POP bands!    Have fun, and try not to hurt yourselves!

B00008QSA5|5.0|What can I say.....for blues lovers this is a must....a staple part of one's collection. It is probably the very best stuff I've EVER heard. I've been a musician for 40 years, and this has'em all beat. Gotta get it....believe me you won't be sorry you did.<br /><br />I had this album (the old 33 vinyl) in 1968 when the album was first cut. LOST IT. And now refound it. It's got alot of extra tracks which is a bonus....not on the album itself.<br /><br />My fav: It Takes Alot to Laugh....It Takes a Train to Cry.....the bass player plays the lead line and the drumming is astoundingly \\"complimental.\\" Yes...Eddie Hoh RULES!!<br /><br />Get it....it's a WINNER!!
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Please don't try to compare this movie to the bood The Illiad, or to the tragedies, I do not believe this was ever the intention of the movie. <br /> <br />What Troy does, and does very successfuly, is try and bring to screen the reality of one of history's most storied wars and put it into perspective with regard to what ACTUALLY (most likely) happened, rather than do what has been done in the past and explain it away with myths and fables that have been written about it. <br /> <br />Troy shows you the struggle that Achilies, Hector, Paris and Helen go through, in a real sense.  The film focuses in on the human reality of the war and the devestating battles which took place.  I was completely thrilled to see that this film DID NOT try to explain Achilies as a God, or immortal, or explain that he was dipped in a pool of immortality... thank you!  We already know all the myths.  The film showed us how the war was really fought and why there was so much conflict between Achilies, the Spartans and the rest of the Greek forces. <br /> <br />I applaud the sensativity of trying to hide the nudity.  This movie could have easily done the nude scenes, but it wasn't necessary, and extremely well done without showing any. <br /> <br />If you want to try and escape for a few hours and watch something that was well acted, jaw dropping battle scenes, and witness the infamous fight between Hector and Achilies, that is worth the price of the DVD alone, enjoy this movie.  If you want to follow it up with the book and the plays, then do so and enjoy those as well, but don't compare them... they weren't ment to be compared.
0385507755|4.0|As someone who has a close relative in recovery, I have read many addiction memoirs.  Frey's book is the best in this genre I have encountered.  His writing style is unique, with conventions of indentation, capitalization, and grammar thrown out the window.  As a compulsive copy-editor, I initially found his writing off-putting and somewhat pretentious.  But the story he was telling was so gripping, and the pain he went through communicated so compellingly, that I stuck with it. I am glad that I did, for after a few chapters I didn't even notice his unconventional style; I simply heard his voice instead.<br /><br />Frey had the good fortune to receive the best of the best: inpatient treatment at the rehab center with the highest success rate in treating addiction in the world.  That this success rate is only 17% sobriety after one year is disturbing evidence of the intractable and self-destructive nature of addiction.  Perhaps the most intriguing part of Frey's story is that he is, apparently, one of the VERY few individuals who has been able to stay clean without working the Twelve Steps.  As an atheist, Frey could not bring himself to believe in the Higher Power that is the cornerstone of the Twelve Step approach. He achieved serenity instead by concentrating on principles of acceptance:  acceptance of who he was, his anger toward his family, the wrongs he had committed during his long years of alcohol and drug abuse, and his responsibility for those wrongdoings.  The book ends with Frey leaving the rehab center to carry out a jail sentence he had been avoiding.  This book could therefore serve as inspiration to other addicts who have similar difficulties accepting the fundamental assumptions of the 12 steps...but the flip side of the coin is that the book could possibly have the unintentional effect of discouraging some addicts from following the 12 Steps (\\"hey, if Frey stayed clean without them, so can I\\"), which would be unfortunate given that the 12 Step approach thus far IS the best documented treatment for addiction.<br /><br />Although the jacket material does not specify exactly when, this book was evidently published some years after Frey's experience at the Clinic.  Because the book is so richly detailed, with many conversations reported verbatim, Frey either kept a highly detailed journal during his time there (which he does not mention doing), or a certain amount of what is described is being reconstructed after the fact.  So it is not clear to me how much of what is portrayed \\"really\\" happened the way he describes, but in a very real sense, it doesn't matter.  Any addict or alcoholic will recognize the genuineness of the emotions and events portrayed here.<br /><br />Frey's book also highlights one of the truisms of addiction, which is that it strikes people from all walks of life.  Frey describes a delightful variety of characters, from federal judges and professors to unemployed high school dropouts.  Perhaps the saddest part of the book was the very end, where Frey updates readers on how all the patients he described are doing now.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anybody who has ever faced the challenge of recovery from a drug or alcohol addiction, and for anybody who has ever loved such a person.  It is not a book you can read without being affected.  Frey narrates his actions and feelings in a honest, unflinching style that makes it at times painful to read, but ultimately fulfilling.  I have nothing but the greatest admiration for his decision to choose recovery and the strength he had to display to achieve it, and the literary world has benefitted as a result.far IS the best documented treatment for addiction.

B0006399FS|1.0|<br />There's nothing here anywhere near as memorable as the aforementioned tracks from the last album. The closest Atomic Bomb gets is the single \\"Vertigo\\", and even that sounds like an artificial euphoria - as if the band were deliberately trying to rediscover the drive of their earlier career. All of a sudden, U2 sound tired and washed-out, aping their own former glories in half-cocked anthemic hogwash like \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"Original of the Species\\", songs full of facile rhetorical tropes such as: \\"I want the lot of what you got/ And I want nothing that you're not\\". <br />Even the lyrics, it seems, are stuck in some Ouroboros-like circularity, devouring themselves in an orgy of self-negation. \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", for instance, opens with Bono observing cryptically, \\"The more you see, the less you know\\", and concludes later with the even more cryptic, \\"The more you know, the less you feel\\". Which leaves us... where, exactly? <br /> <br />The general drift this time round is more personal than political, with several songs pleading for forgiveness or reconciliation: even when, in \\"Love and Peace or Else\\", Bono asks \\"all your daughters of Zion, all your Abraham sons\\" to \\"lay down your guns\\", he actually turns out to be fretting over some romantic split, rather than the political conflict that immediately springs to mind. None of which would matter a jot, of course, if the music sparked the lyrics to life with the band's characteristic spirit and lan. But the familiar Edge arpeggios sound weary, and it's a dull U2 album indeed on which the most notable musical strategy is the flamencoid chording of \\"Fast Cars\\". <br /> <br />No, it simply isn't happening this time. Instead, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb just offers a new benchmark of mediocrity.  <br />
B00009P1O5|5.0|HeavyHeavyHeavyHeavyHeavy.    Yikes.  This is Neil's heaviest record ever, and that says a bit, considering Rust Never Sleeps, and Live Rust, Ragged Glory, and Weld, and a *lot* of other stuff.  Critics hated it, my Omnibus Complete Guide says it's Young \\"with his emotional shutters locked tight.\\"  Even Neil himself says he wasn't paying attention and he ain't sure how good it is.   But they're all wrong; this is the indispensable spuzz.    \\"Shots,\\" \\"T-Bone\\" and \\"Opera Star\\" would be classics in a better universe, but every song is great; every song except \\"Get Back On It\\" features buzzsaw, slicing, dicing guitars.    And like the music, the lyrics are seriously under-rated.  If you're considering that emotional shutters statement, check out the lyrics to \\"Shots.\\"  And if you think that the lyrics to \\"surfer joe\\" or \\"t-bone\\" or \\"opera star\\" are bad, consider AC/DC, heavy metal masters of the ironic look at their own silliness.  I mean, this isn't gonna save the world, folks, and you might as well admit it.  \\"t-bone\\" is hilarious, and so are the lines   \\"You were born to rock/You'll never be an opera star\\"  And is it just me, or did Neil make up the word \\"garfong?\\"  This is Neil in his idiot savant mode, firmly in the tradition initiated by AC/DC's \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution.\\"  Anything this funny can't be bad.    Anyway, you need to tread carefully with Young's '80's output; I wouldn't say it was overall as bad as some might say, but you do need to leave your preconceptions at the door AND forgive a clunker here and there.  No such caveats need apply to this, the second album Young released in the 1980's.  You like rock and roll, you like heavy guitar, no questions asked, buy it.
0743490304|4.0|The was a great story from start to finish. The characters were great, especially Corky !!!<br />The plot was amazing, the writing as usual was superb and the over all feel of the book was great. I still prefer Angels &amp; Demons over any other Dan Brown book, but all of them are great.<br />Check this one out !!!
B0006213WG|2.0|I saw Sum 41 perform \\"Pieces\\" on David Letterman and was in awe of the bands performance. I ordered Chuck the next day, but was very disappointed that the rest of the CD was (in my book) hard core, thrash music. Nothing else on the CD even close to \\"Pieces.\\" Too bad they didn't write more songs like that one because they have tons of talent going to waste.
B00005JKCH|3.0|It is hard to turn a story based on a comic book into something thrilling, that's why I give the scriptwriter the benefit of the doubt. Despite the fact that the script was better than Spiderman 2 this script still stank. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, the action and graphics were intense and thrilling but the story stank. It's about science geek Peter Parker who can't get his love, Mary Jane, to go out with him but rather he just acts like a puss and let's other jerks get her. He lives next door to her yet he's afraid to talk to his own neighbor. Jeepers what a douch. <br /> <br />Peter's luck changes for the good when he gets raped by a radioactive spider turning into Spiderman. What happens to the spider is anyone's guess. Peter saves the day with cool moves and at the end has a chance is get some booty from Mary Jane but decides he wants to go home and masturbate to comic books underneath his bed. The real reason he doesn't get with MJ is because she's afraid she'll get hurt because of the dangerous life he leads. Yet he doesn't ditch Aunt May. <br /> <br />Watch this movie but don't expect a blockbuster
B0006HXXBA|5.0|The title of this review says it all!  If there's 1 album to get by this band, 'Enemy of God' is it ('Violent Revolution' is their 2nd best, which was the album before.)  Kreator is 1 of those bands that truly get better with age.  So without a doubt, check this album out; you WON'T be disappointed!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Alright, so you think hip-hop is horrible music, that too many rappers have turned into pop artists (see Chingy and Nelly), or that this guy is whack since he isn't sporting a jersey and do' rag.  It is time to put all that aside and lend your ears to Kanye West, who breaks all stereotypes about producers that can't rap.  With the exception of maybe \\"Breathe In, Breathe Out\\" that features Ludacris, every track on College Dropout amazes.  Sure the lead single \\"Slow Jamz\\" was meant to be a club-banger, and it was definitely a pop hit, too.  But don't let that fool you.  The rest of the album showcases Kanye's great beat-making skills, and we get to see for the first time his superb lyrical talent.  This kid can rock the mic better than most MCs to come out in the last five years, and he does it without making an album about blunts, guns, and the 5-letter word for a woman.   <br />The track recorded with his jaw wired shut, \\"Through the Wire\\", is masterful, using fully West's colorful verse and a great Chaka Khan sample of \\"Through the Fire\\".  \\"All Falls Down\\" is another great song on the album, and it also happens to be the 3rd single.  Yes, the original version with Lauryn Hill was incredible, but substituting Syleena Johnson sees no falloff in results.  Her beautiful voice flows smoothly with Kanye spitting about being self-conscious.   <br />Jay-Z makes a token appearance on \\"Never Let Me Down\\", but it is Kanye who shines on the song.  One of my favorite tracks is the creative \\"Get 'Em High\\" that features Common and Talib Kweli, two of the top lyricists in the game today.  The back-and-forth banter on the song makes it an entertaining listen for sure.  \\"Two Words\\", which, yes, features mostly 2-word lines, shows off Kanye's lyrics once again.  Mos Def and Freeway help out on this one, while Kanye exercises his skills on \\"The New Workout Plan\\".   <br />This album can be split into a couple of obvious divisions, with the first eight tracks looking into Kanye's past and his inner thoughts and feelings.  Especially good is \\"Spaceship\\", where he discusses the struggles he and others go through daily.  Second comes the poppish part of the album on tracks 9-13.  \\"Slow Jamz\\", \\"Get 'Em High\\", \\"The New Workout Plan\\", and the forgettable \\"Breathe In, Breathe Out\\" all fall in this part, and it is the weak point if there is one.  Even here though, Kanye is not far off his A-game.  The final tracks, 14-21, are again introspective and provide the listener a sense of who Kanye is and how he came up.  A minor letdown are the three skits, that are not necessarily bad, but they just don't really fit the flow of the album very well.  Here we find the great tracks \\"Two Words\\", \\"Through the Wire\\", and \\"School Spirit\\", as well as \\"Family Business\\", where we hear Kanye rhyming about the closeness of family.  College Dropout finishes with \\"Last Call\\" where he explores his career to date, and we see his hunger to succeed in full.   <br />When it comes down to it, College Dropout is a great piece of work.  For a debut album, it is especially amazing, ranking in my opinion with the likes of Illmatic, Ready to Die, and Doggfather.  This is one every good collection needs, no matter if you are a fan of hip-hop or not.  Easily, Kanye West is the best new artist of 2004, and College Dropout is one of its top albums.  Buy this now!
1577314808|4.0|I think this book is way different than the many books I had read. I have been intrigued by this Q \\"why I am living? what is the purpose of life?\\" and to my surprise Tolle also had the same question when he begain his journey to spritual world. I believe one has to read this book with a commitment to adapt the teachings in some form and follow them. I totally agree with Tolle that \\"life is full of suffering\\". Actually in ancient indian (east india) culture also it has been mentioned in the scriptures life is nothing but suffering, if you can enlighten your mind and soul from this materialistic world by reading this book then its priceless!!!    New Comment: I wrote the above review when I was mid way reading the book. I found it very difficult to practise this book, may be the language is not good enough or may be I cudnt get the focus this book deserve I am not sure but it was failure.
B00005JMXX|1.0|Oh, where to begin?  Apart from the horribly unscientific premises upon which the plot of this movie rests, this movie also has the typical condescending and lecturing tone so prevalent in the leftist garbage being produced by Hollywood.    If you can somehow ignore the junk science, the doomsday rhetoric, the emotionally-driven scare tactics, and the absolutely pathetic script/dialogue/sub-plots of this movie, you might at least enjoy one thing: the special effects.  Yep, they are pretty cool.  At least computer animators don't have political agendas.
B000002ULO|5.0|Now if you ask me, and many individuals interested in comebacks do now and again, this here album should definitely not be viewed as a McCartney comeback. Contrary to what my learned fellow reviewers are rambling on about, McCartney never went away!  If you don't go away, then how is it that you can come back?  <br /> <br />Here's the deal, see, McCartney was making good music all along. Even in all them years when he was releasing albums with paltry sales and no radio airplay, he was still making music that was head and antlers above all the rest of the pabulum they try to force feed us. McCartney, after all, is the standard for pop. So all the sudden in 1997 he come up with this here album and folks what weren't really paying him any heed start lip-flappin about a comeback. Well brethren (and cistern) you got it wrong. This is a stand out album like Band on the Run was a stand out album, sure enough, but betwixt Band on the Run in 1973 and this here album in 1997 Sir Paul wasn't just lollygagging around the house in his undershirt and slippers.  <br /> <br />So, before you commence to purchase this album (which you most definitely should) also consider purchasing some of the interim albums betwixt 1973 and 1997 because there is some good stuff in there as well. I have endeavored to review each and every one of them and if you look you can see my erudite and learned comments and insightful tidbits scattered about the place.  <br /> <br />I guess the testament to the quality of this here album is in the public vote, represented here in folk plunking down their pocket money and walking out of the record shop with this album under their arm... or in the case of many of us, clicking on the appropriate buttons right here at Amazon (dot come if you will) and having the thing whisked to the mailbox in no time. This album went all the way up to the #2 spot and remained there for a fortnight (as our pasty British cousins say) and this is significantly better than most of his albums for the past decade. He was on a roll again and some folk think it was because of his work on the Beatles Anthology and his association with Jeff \\"Electric Light Orchestra\\" Lynn. I ain't sure. I think Sir Paul (I refuse to call him \\"Macca\\" because I ain't British and that nickname sounds infantile to me)  had it in him all along and maybe he was cooking this album up even before the Anthology work and the exposure to Lynn.  <br /> <br />I'd go ahead on and get this one if I was you. This is the absolute favorite of one of the twins, but I can't tell you which one because I struggle to tell them two apart most of the time. Junior likes it pretty good, and Mama likes to call this one her \\"chicken cookin' album\\" because she has it on when she makes chicken-and-dumplings. Bernice (that's Betty Mae's cousin who's staying here while she and Lester get things worked out) likes this one an awful lot too and she sometimes puts it on and gets her fat bottom in to the hot tub we got outside beside our double wide trailer and soaks in the hot water and soaks in the music simultaneously (that means \\"at the same time\\")
B00008BXJG|5.0|AC/DC's albums with Bon Scott are almost always an enjoyable experince when I listen to them on stereo. Up until this period, their best was their debut, High Voltage (which is also recommended!) But all of their previous work is pushed aside on this masterpiece of an AC/DC album. They were firing on all cylinders and the riffs, lead vocals, and backing vocals do nothing but prove that AC/DC was a force that would challenge the rock world if it weren't for Scott's death after this album. They went on to make Back In Black and other good albums, but the band reached their pinnacle on this album. <br /> <br />1. Highway to Hell: The title track and the definitive AC/DC song, this is a timeless classic the still packs a giant punch. A definite 10 out of 10. <br />2. Girls Got Rhythm: Fast paced, furious, and loud enough to wake the dead, this track would have been the best song on most other AC/DC albums, but with the title track, it's a close second. 10 out of 10. <br />3. Walk All over You: The band slows down for a minute, then kicks it into high gear and makes this track a complex but enjoyable tune. 8 out of 10. <br />4. Touch Too Much: Such a great song... the lead and backing vocals are untouchable (pun not intended). The \\"touch too much/ much too much\\" line sticks in your head like super glue. 9.5 out of 10. <br />5. Beating Around the Bush: A frenetic rocker that is sure to please most of the AC/DC fans out there. 8.5 out of 10. <br />6. Shot Down in Flames: One of AC/DC's most underrated songs. The riffs are glorious and the refrain is outstanding. 9.5 out of 10. <br />7. Get It Hot: Basic AC/DC. Nothing wrong with that. It still rocks out like crazy and beats out most of today's stuff. 8.5 out of 10. <br />8. If You Want Blood (You've Got It): The backing vocals steal the show here with the infectious chorus. The riffs are standard AC/DC, meaning it's still wild. 9 out of 10. <br />9. Love Hungry Man: Much like Walk All Over You, AC/DC slows down again. It is clearly the weakest song on this collection, probably making it a standout track if it were released in today's rock scene. 7.5 out of 10 <br />10. Night Prowler: Eerie, creepy, and above all, classic. Scott's last song brings out the best on this hard rockin' blues track. Bon goes out in a brilliant display of screaming and heavy licks by Angus. One of the best blues songs I know. 10 out of 10. <br /> <br />Overall rating: 9.5 out of 10. If you listen to it fully, you'll realize why many consider this to be their best.
B000026WVL|5.0|Now if you ask me, and many individuals interested in comebacks do now and again, this here album should definitely not be viewed as a McCartney comeback. Contrary to what my learned fellow reviewers are rambling on about, McCartney never went away!  If you don't go away, then how is it that you can come back?  <br /> <br />Here's the deal, see, McCartney was making good music all along. Even in all them years when he was releasing albums with paltry sales and no radio airplay, he was still making music that was head and antlers above all the rest of the pabulum they try to force feed us. McCartney, after all, is the standard for pop. So all the sudden in 1997 he come up with this here album and folks what weren't really paying him any heed start lip-flappin about a comeback.

0385504217|4.0|I find it truly amazing that people have got upset about this book.  Dan Brown has taken some fact, some conjecture, possibly some consipracy and a good dollop of excellent research put it all together and produced an excellent book  that I and most of my friends couldn't put down.
B00005JNEI|1.0|The People's Choice Awards were this past week and, somehow, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 \\"won\\" an award for Favorite Film or something.<br /><br />One question: how could the 16th highest-grossing film of 2004 get voted as the best film of the year?<br /><br />(News stories abound about how this is the first year that voting for these awards was changed to Internet voting, a system obviously rife with corruption).<br /><br />Even the people I know who rabidly defended this thoroughly-discredited \\"documentary\\" have turned squeamish about Moore's obnoxious methods and arrogant attitude.<br /><br />You'd have to go back to Nazi Germany to find an equal when it comes to propaganda.
B00007KWHO|4.0|I'm apparently in the minority who find \\"poorly recorded\\" albums to be more interesting sometimes. Actually, I love the sound of this album - and it truly is progressive, especially for 1970. It is one of Yes's more unusual albums, and makes awesome use of dynamics and different recording techniques. I've been returning to this one several times over the past few days, which means there must be SOMETHING compelling about it. The use of volume pedal w/the guitar, the inventive orchestra arrangements, the quiet parts, it's f*@king fabulous (to me), but reading these other reviews, you would think it's nothing special. And I love the song \\"Time And A Word\\" - it's beautiful, Beatles-esque, and yes, atypical of their other material (so what). Let's hear it for confounding people's expectations! Isn't that what \\"progressive music\\" is about??
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is the type of zombie film horror fans have been aching for since \\"Evil Dead II\\" and the original \\"Dawn of the Dead.\\"  The writing is suprisingly intelligent and altogether tongue-in-cheek.  The gore is everywhere and so realistic as to invoke heartfelt cringing...often followed by a burst of laughter.  I want to relate sequences that are not only funny but sociologically profound (no kidding), but to give away these scenes would spoil the effect of the film.  As with George Romero's \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" there is more depth to this film than at first glance, with comparisons between zombies and mankind that are blurred to the point of being almost identical.  Once again I have to inhibit myself from giving away too much.  Yet another additive that sets this film apart from the rest of the genre is that all the characters are worth rooting for and caring about.  There are actually some touching scenes with authentic emotions indicating that although there are many ridiculous moments loaded with humor, these are real people caught in a life or death situation.  The way this film shifts from true horror and pain to slapstick (sometimes literally \\"slapstick\\") makes this a remarkable creation.  There are many subtle, sometimes vague references to many films such as \\"Resevoir Dogs,\\" \\"Snatch,\\" \\"28 Days Later,\\" the two aforementioned walking dead films, and even a mood-altering thud in the score that reminded me of John Carpenter's \\"The Thing.\\"  I have seen many zombie films before, but never one as thoughtfully created as this one.  This is a superb addition to the genre.  Highly recommended.
B00062J00S|5.0|This film is one of the classics of American cinema.  It's just a shame that it didn't get the praise it so rightly deserved years earlier.  I don't think I've been able to make it through the last scene without crying, ever.  No matter how hard I try, the message of the film is just as fresh as it was the first time I saw it.  It's true.  No man is a failure who has friends, and all the little things we've done in our lives add up and come back to us just when we need them the most.  Isn't that the message we all need to hear not only during the holidays, but all through the year? This movie will always be a classic as long as people need to hear what it has to say.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Let's face it, Hollywood movies usually get real people's lives all wrong.  Doctors make instant diagnoses, cops can hit a dime at a hundred yards, cops never sit at a desk filling out paperwork, and nerds are pretty people who happen to wear glasses. <br /> <br />\\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is a strange movie,  but the people in it are real nerds, all the folks you knew who had serious trouble relating to others - and didn't suddenly become party animals after smoking a joint. <br /> <br />If you want to see a pretty funny comedy with characters who seem like real people, albeit very eccentric ones, check this one out.

B000002VCO|4.0|Well, it started happening with 'Eye in the Sky' but with this album the Project complete the approach to pop, which will go further on 'Vulture Culture' and will turn again into a more rocky, aggressive sound on 'Stereotomy'.<br /><br />The opening is a great song, 'Prime Time' certainly similar to 'Eye in the Sky' but not so sentimental and more intense and emotional tho. 'Let Me go Home' is the classic \\"angry\\" Project song with Lenny Zakatek on vocals, this one better than some others in my opinion. 'One Good Reson' is a little funny song with a lot of Beatles flavour, and with Ian Bairnsons' guitar sounding a lot like George Harrison's. 'Since the Last Goodbye' is also a very lennonian composition, a wonderful ballad which has been sadly and unfairly underrated and ignored for the beauty of its complicated sequence of chords and of Chris Rainbow's vocals. 'Don't Answer Me' is a simple but beautiful ballad, but more obvious, with a beautiful movie/cartoon video.<br /><br />The second side is almost as interesting as the first one. Opens with a strange and nice song called 'Dancing on a High Wire' sung by Colin Blunstone, who used to sing softer songs and ballads before this one. The nex one is the most disposable track, 'You Don't Believe' although the song was used for the first 'the best of' before the album was released. 'Pipeline' is a small instrumental gem with nice orchestration, minimalistic guitar and a certain Spanish feel. And the last son, 'Ammonia Avenue', probably the strongest track in the album, is a Project classic, a more than beautiful ballad nice sung by Eric Woolfson with a terrifying instrumental part in the middle. The album is not a masterpiece, but a good step forward since 'Eye in the Sky'. The structure of the album reminds reasonably to Dire Straits 'Brothers in Arms' being only 2 years ahead, and with a very accurate and varied group of 5 songs in side A, some weaker songs in side B and a big climax at the end with an epic ballad. Recommended for everybody.everybody.
B0006213WG|4.0|First let me say I listen to heavy metal from the 80's  and classic rock. I never liked the whole \\"pop-punk\\" trend.  I thought this CD was going to be just like All Killer No Filler, wich bored me to tears. It's not. Sum 41 seems to have changed into a *gasp* rock band. Someone said they are fading out but actually I belive they are just starting to become real musicians. This album probably isn't selling that much cause they've been away for so long. They are making a move into rock 'n' roll instead of sticking with pop-punk. This one is harder and faster and a lot more artistic, epically in the lyrics. This is a wise move because rock has been around for ages and pop-punk is probably gonna die out soon.I think on the next CD these guys will have fully become a hard rock band, even though you can hear a little punk in here. It's more like Iggy and the Stooges and the Sex Pistols. Deryck Whibey (vocals) has noticable talent and I like the drumer's style. Bottom line: If you like Simple Plan, Avril Lavinge, or Ashlee Simpson and are hoping to get All Killer No Filler 2, skip this one. If you are into classic rock or metal and want some new music, check this one out.

0679746048|3.0|In the late 1960s, the author of this book spent about two years on the ward for teenage girls at McLean Hospital, a renowned psychiatric hospital. She was diagnosed with a mental illness, \\"borderline personality\\" disorder and depression. Her first psychologist sent her there after trying to kill herself with a bottle of aspirin and a bottle of vodka. When she got to the hospital and checked herself in she met some of the patients she would be living with in her ward. She roomed with a girl named Georgina who went crazy and was a pathological liar.  Other girls she got to know was Polly who lit herself on fire and the most influential girl she met was Lisa, she was clinically a psycho but loved challenges and escaping, she loved her freedom. Every time they would catch Lisa after leaving they would give her shock treatment. The girls were parentally damaged from the word \\"checks\\" and would do almost anything to have sexual relations. They were not allowed to have anything sharp so the girls would rarely allowed to shave unless a nurse watched them like a hawk to make sure they were using the blade correctly. This book had dark humor and a page to page insight on what is it like to be in a hospital.  <br />The book was about the author. She grew up in New York in the 1960s and had a bright life and had potential to go far until this incident happened. I think by far this book was one of the weirdest made you think kind of book I have ever read. I would defiantly recommend it.  <br />
068987474X|5.0|I bought this little book yesterday afternoon & read it last night cover to cover in less than 3 hours. I underlined something on nearly EVERY page! It gave me some amazing insight into my current non-relationship, as well as all the others I've ever been \\"stuck\\" in. I only wish it had been available about 25 years ago ... many a heartache I could have avoided! It should be required reading for older teen girls. The book is now tucked in my purse as a ready reference for those weak moments when I want to slip back into my old patterns. It is with much gratitude to the authors & creators of this concept that I submit my review. You may have saved my life!

B00003CXCT|4.0|I am happy to finally see this on DVD, even the changes I can tolerate, it's still a classic to me.....But why did lucas put Hayden Christensen's ghostly image there, in Return Of The Jedi, instead of Sebastian Shaw?  I mean if he is going to do that why not put Ewan McGregor's there instead of Alec Guiness?  If your going to do it, do it right.  I think its to soon to get excited about the next revision, ehh?

B0002858YS|5.0|I was at FYE with my friend one day when I saw Hot Fuss, interested, I bought a copy. I got home, popped it into my CD player and listened to the whole CD in one day about 7 times!! Now I listen to it every single day, about every second that I get a chance! I'm obsessed with The Killers now! They are AWESOME! I especially love the first 4 tracks. 5 and 6 are pretty cool too, though. Anyway, if you don't get this CD or listen to this music in any way... you're missing out!! BY A LOT! Their music is so great! A great new rock that I love! 5 stars... but it deserves more than that. BUY NOW!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Let me start off by saying that the album that introduced the world to:Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, Michael Anthony,and  David Lee Roth is one of the rare albums where every track is good. The 1st time I heard the CD, while I did love it I didn't like all the songs. But after a second listening that changed drastically. Eddie does some of his best guitar playing herer and  I have no doubt in my mind that this album ia a genuine classic.  The songs are as follows:  Runnin' With the Devil: A good song, good lyrics.  Eruption: This is just amazing to listen to. This just makes  the person listening think, How does he do that?  You Really Got Me: A great song. I love this song, it is just simply perfect.  Ain't Talkin Bout Love:Another great song on the album, i'm talking bout love when I refer to this song.  I'm the One: A very cool song.  Jamies Cryin' A great song, the lyrics flow together perfectly well.  Atomic Punk: Sound strangely simalar to A Clockwork Orange.Weird.  Feel Yuor Love Tonight: The music is great, a terrific song.  Little Dreamer: An all right song. Listenable.  Ice Cream Man: A weird song that wasn't written by Van Halen and seems like a weird selection.  On Fire: A great song, one of my favorites.  A+.

068987474X|2.0|The worst thing about this book is Greg's insistence that women not ask men for dates.  He makes it seem as though this is a universal male demand.  It is not.  There are plenty of men who prefer to be asked.  A survey taken a number of years ago showed that nearly fifty percent of men preferred to be asked, and that most of the rest didn't mind being asked.  Far from being in the majority, men like Greg who prefer to ask and resent being asked were in a small minority, about 1 in ten, if I remember correctly.  Maybe things have changed since this survey was taken, but probably not. <br /> <br />In addition, women who refuse to ask men out risk being thought of as hypocrites by men like me.  It is true that our society ignores men like me, and so maybe women who refuse to ask men out think they are doing nothing wrong because they get no obvious flak from it.  But they ARE doing something wrong.  I always thought that feminists were terrible hypocrites for the way they demanded the end of all gender roles, but then turned around and allowed these particular roles to continue.  Given the way the direction the country is going these days, feminists will find it difficult to ignore men like me forever. <br /> <br />The best part of this book is page 133, where Greg talks about life in the old days and how the family would have to approve of your boy friend before you could go out with him.  More broadly, this is about the decline in importance of the concept of character.  Before, people judged others on their character, and if they saw someone with bad character, they avoided them.  Older people had more experience in picking out people with bad character, which is why families had to approve of your prospective boy friend.  But since character went out the window, we now rely mostly on chemistry.  How many times have we heard about a woman who was utterly surprised by how rotten her boy friend turned out to be?  The only way she had to judge character was that \\"he treated me like a queen.\\"  But that isn't the end of it.  How does he treat other people?  If, for example, you want children, and your boy friend treats children as a nuisance (or worse), then even though he treats YOU like a queen, you've got big problems ahead.
0440213525|4.0|Never in 11-year old Mark Sway's life has he been in more trouble than he is now - he knows where the mob buried the body of a prominent senator. The FBI is harassing him to give out his secret while the mob is threatening to harm him and his family. He seeks the help of lawyer Reggie Love and they figure out how to make a deal with the authorities without the mob getting to them first. <br /> <br />The story is fascinating because it shows characters that we expect to be helpless but went against the odds to overcome their adversaries. We expect a kid to be defenseless but Mark displayed on many occasions that he has street-smarts to out-wit the grown-ups. The fact that he was able to hire a lawyer shows his atypical maturity. Reggie is every bit a tough and aggressive lawyer although she's already in her 50's, is only practicing law for 4 years and has been through a difficult divorce that put her in therapy. A kid and an old lady against the feds and the mob: it's an intriguing and compelling tale.
1591840562|5.0|What stands out in my mind is the sheer usefulness of this book. The entire book is devoid of mind-numbing theory, and in its place is useful, practical, implementable advice.

0446677450|3.0|I would not have finished reading this book if not for the very good advice it offers. It's about how to be financially independent; how to not work for money but how to make money work for you. It's an interesting premise especially for those who are tired of the \\"rat-race\\" and want to retire early. <br /> <br />The author does not talk about any get-rich-quick schemes. He talks about the need to improve our financial literacy because he believes that's the reason why most people are not rich. He also says that we do not learn financial literacy from traditional education because teachers simply don't teach anything practical about money. The author is very convincing and not at all technical. He explains the difference between assets and liabilities and how people should maximize assets and minimize liabilities. He shows the advantages of setting up a corporation and how a house is not a good investment.  <br /> <br />If this book is so informative, why did I mention that I almost did not finish reading it? It's because of the author's tendency to babble. The book had a very long wind-up and it went too long to get to the point. He also says things over and over again. It's not bad to reiterate a point but to repeat it a dozen times is simply too much. The author has very good ideas and I am thinking of getting his second book, but thinking about his writing style, I'm having second thoughts. <br />
0689835604|5.0|Ok, so maybe he didn't say so, but he doesn't need to, the expressions on his face as we read it speak volumes.  He smiles at the bright pictures and always raises his eyebrows as if surprised and impressed by the lift up flaps that reveal more bright pictures. Thie simplicity of the pictures, using common shapes and colors of the same value, are just right for infants. This is a great book for small babies. I've discovered that reading to my son, with him able to look at all of the pictures, is a wonderful way to soothe him when he is  tired, over-stimulated or just plain crabby.
1592400876|4.0|A person with above-average writing skills will still find this book on punctuation useful and appealing. The author Lynne Truss does not dish out a textbook style discussion but delights us with the history, usage and misuse of commas, apostrophes, colons, semicolons and the others. She does it in a comical manner as opposed to what you usually get in stuffy grammar books. <br /> <br />I can't believe how many instances punctuation is misused. She has a lot of examples in the book. One is the title of the movie \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" which should be \\"Two Weeks' Notice\\". One similar example I can think of is the movie \\"Eight Legged Freaks\\". When I saw this movie about giant spiders, I counted a lot more than eight freaks with legs. The author thus convinced me that punctuation is important in avoiding misunderstandings. <br /> <br />I also agree with the author about people who habitually interchange \\"its\\" and \\"it's\\" just like in, \\"good food at it's best\\", deserve to be \\"struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave\\". It's a bit harsh but it's annoying when you keep seeing those mistakes.
B00005JN4O|5.0|I have so much to say about this movie!  It deserves so much more credit than it has been given!  I loved it!  I loved the imagination factor, I love the actors/actresses, I loved everything.  This movie has to be one of the best movies I have seen in a while.  It came along when I have been disappointed by many movies I have seen recently and this was just great and made me excited that finally there was a movie worth my time!  Go and see this movie--I think you will be happy you did so.
B0002X314C|4.0|This is the kind of album that makes you appreciate life and the kind that injects good into every bad mood. <br /> <br />\\"Ordinary People\\" has to be the coolest soul song in recent memory.
0385336810|5.0|I just finished reading Shopaholic and Sister before reading Can You Keep A Secret.  I was a bit disappointed with \\"Sister\\" and so was hesitant about \\"Secret\\".  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the book.  Great, interesting characters.  I really had trouble putting the book down - which isn't something I say often about books in this genre.  I really wanted to know what Jack's secret was and how Emma was going to deal with everything going on.  This was as good and inventive as the original Shopaholic.
B000003TSP|5.0|If you were sitting on a fuzzy carpet, in a smoke filled room, with your 20-something ironic friends, chatting about topics that seem important to your \\"faded\\", at the moment, selves...This would be appropriate background music.<br /><br />Essential lounging music. :-)<br /><br />Patient verses, rifts, and samples are what this CD is all about.<br /><br />Every note seems to have been placed exactly where it needs to be on each track...And Beth's voice is fragile thing seemingly on the cusp of being shattered into a million pieces.<br /><br />If you like trip-hop, you (probably already own) will dig this.
B00028FDRA|5.0|***** - FIVE STARS    Lacuna Coil does something no other Goth Metal band has the balls to do, experiment. They don't like staying true to one sound, and on \\"Comalies\\", they've outdone themselves. This is one outstanding release. I can't find one negative thing to say about \\"Comalies\\"....    I would however have to say that \\"Unleashed Memories\\" has a harder edge than \\"Comalies\\", and is still my favortie Lacuna Coil release. Everything they've relased is excellent though, they're just one of those bands that can do no wrong....    What you get with the \\"Imported Version\\", is some really cool accustic versions off of \\"Comalies\\", and it's a wonderful change of pace when you get tired of the studio version. There are also a couple of demo/sudio version songs from \\"Comalies\\" which are incredible in their raw, uncut stages. Wonderful....    If you're new to Lacuna Coil, I'd highly recommend purchacing this, the \\"Imported Version\\" of \\"Comalies\\" over the regular version. It's alittle more costly, but you've got more songs too. Well worth the extra cash if you ask me....    If you enjoy \\"Comalies\\", pick up everything Lacuna Coil has released. They are truly an amazing band!!!!!!!    LACUNA LEGIONS FOREVER!!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|To all you Norah fans, I can just see your indignant faces growing red with anger as you await my critisism of one of your favourite singers.Well rest assured for I have now become one of you and have no intentions of doing anything of the sort. <br /> <br />Because the title refers not to Norah, but to me. <br /> <br />Once upon a time I heard 'Come away with me'.Now to be honest all I  heard was the off key drawling that sounded like someone was dying, hoarse with thirst while they sang to non-existent music that was far too low key for my taste. <br /> <br />When the second track was released I was no more appeased by the \\"Don't know why I didn't come\\" that to me, seemed to have been drawled with almost no emotion, as if she were singing to a wall. <br /> <br />But then it kept on playing on the -get this- jazz station that I frequent and while I cursed it loudly infront of my approving anti-norah peers, It actually grew on me.It was then that I rummaged through some old gifts of mine that I had thrown away in the attic, and found the whole album.It was here where I listened to it , enjoying the slow rythemic tures that we all know and love. <br /> <br />I kept this to myself, until one day I was caught red handed lip synching to a jones song to the horror of my peers who couldn't believe what they were hearing. <br /> <br />Now my love of Jonses talented music is known to all, and I've actually managed to convert a few pals along the way. The cd is now the trophy of my prized collection and I urge you to give this a few tries before you give up. <br /> <br />I really believe that Norah's music requires 'developing a taste' for it.But once you do, believe me, you'll wonder 'why you didn't come'.
6300271439|4.0|this is one of my favorite movies it is so funny the soundtrack is like a blast from the past well if you consider the 80's to be a part of the past some of us still live in that world but any who.. i loved this movie madonna was silly like a up to date with out a clue marilyn monroe kinda way. the funniest part was when madonna was acting like she was loudins' wife when he was in the hospital and the nurse ask her what was her husband first name  she said loudin and then she ask what was his last name madonna said clear
B00004RSA8|5.0|Twelve Monkeys is an excellent film by Terry Gilliam.  It takes place in a future world which mirrors our current world; however, a flu virus has destroyed a majority of the population of the world.  Bruce Willis portrays a prisoner who volunteers for an experiment involving time travel--  his mission: to discover where the flu virus was first released.  Each time he enters the past using an insane assylum as a porthole, a horrifying chain of events occurs.  This is a visually stunning and edgy film.  The performances by all of the actors -- Bruce Willis, Madelaine Stowe, and Brad Pit-- offers a grim yet real glimpse into the reality of a future pandemic.  I would definately suggest this film to anyone who enjoys good art direction, surrealistic sci fi, and great acting.  Ligeia
B000001IQH|5.0|THis is my favorite rancid cd. On the first song &quot;maxwell Murder&quot; there is the sickest bass solo that I have ever Heard. It is great for punk/ska and hardcore fans. When I first baught this cd I listened to it ten times in a row&#60;br /&#62; And kept it in my cd player for a whole month, Im dead serious. Rancid is good for fans of the clash, reel big fish, mighty mighty bostones, G.B.H.,AFI,THe Casualties, Greenday,and dead kennedys
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I first heard Look What You've Done on a popular radio station. It was late at night, and I was convinced that I was listening to a previously unreleased Beatles song, much to my happiness. I don't really follow all the ACDC references, even with the rocking out songs. I was only slightly a fan, Big Balls being great just for a laugh. So maybe I haven't experienced ACDC enough to see how badly Jet copies them. But I love The Beatles, always have, and this album is cool from my perspective. I don't see it as coping, which many others have tried to defend/offend. I accepted that music isn't really original long, long ago. I think I was 14, maybe younger. For that, I thank the people bitching that this is unoriginal...you've made me feel so wise for my age way back when. Wish you could have had the same epiphany as a teenager, so you wouldn't be puking up the age old cry of 'sell out' yet again. Okay, I will step off of my high horse for just a second longer and say this album is good, I feel it is great. Great MUSIC. Perhaps that is what so many other people are forgetting. It is music, it is nice to hear, it sets a mood, it reminds me of times ago and times to come. If you dig the bands that Jet is compared to, then by all rights you will like this as well. If you don't, then that is opinion, and that is cool too. Just stop coming off so 'in touch' with other bands, and accept that the reason these guys may sound like they are ripping off another band is the same reason you, if you had a band, would too: they've been influenced by the best.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This Album is completely amazing and unpredictable. It has the greenday sound and at the same time it sounds different&#60;br /&#62; from their other albums. Most bands that have been around as long as green day start going down hill. But greenday just keeps going up. Trust me, if you buy this you won't be sorry...
0312995423|1.0|This novel is a stinker! The characters are quite similar to those in his other novels... and they must easily be the dumbest people with high IQs. The poor ending caps off a disappointingly weak novel. <br /> <br />A definite miss for anyone technically adept enough to use a toaster and can count to 4.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This was the first album From Blink that I listened to and It was awesome. It stayed in my cd player for about two months strait and then I became a die-hard fan. It has great fast songs that will get your adrenaline pumping. I think that both fans of pop and punk have reasons to like this amazing cd. For Punks theirs the loud and fast guitar parts and drum parts that you can rock out to. And for pop fans there is softness also It has turned many pop fans into punk fans...trust me
0375703861|5.0|There are few writers who have Smith's intelligence and original voice that she displays in this standout first novel.  She captures cultural London perfectly.  The characters are all vivid and flamboyant and the plot is amazing.  I doubt that many other young authors could do better.
B00008WG3U|5.0|I think one of the main reasons that I love this cd is that It tells exactly how I feel about the government. It has great songs that leave you moshing to them andsinging them. NOFX Still has there brilliant origional sound that they did twenty years ago and only a few bands have done that.&#60;br /&#62; my favorite sons are &quot;13 stitches&quot; and &quot;The Irrationality for the Rationality&quot;.THanks to NOFX true punk is how it is.
B00005JMAH|3.0|It's been too long since I've read the book to be sure but I thought that Azkaban was a pretty good movie. Apparently some things were changed/ altered but mostly the story seemed to be substantially like what I remember reading. I could've done without the talking shrunken head (in the interview bit on disc 2 J.K.Rowling said she actually liked it even if it wasn't her idea)and would've liked Harry's patronus to have been more like the book (I believe it WAS shown as a Stag at one point).  <br />The Hogwarts exterior seems greatly changed to me, as did Hagrid's cottage and the kids are really starting to change in appearance. Most of the computer animation seemed pretty good, Buckbeak the hippogriff was a little off at times. As always the general level of detail, considering that so much of what you see is a set, is incredible. <br />I can't imagine that The Goblet of Fire can be shrunken down successfully but if it is done as well as this one I'll want to see it too.
6300184080|1.0|This movie... oh my gosh. Rocky is my step-brother (was). It makes my dad seems like a total jerk! And it makes Rusty a saint. When in reality she was keeping my dad(Roy) from seeing him. My dad also had another child by Rusty who contracted aids. I saw an actual picture of Rocky and I felt soo bad for him. But this movie is aweful how it portrays my dad and rusty. So keep that this in mind. All rusty really wanted was to make money and publicity. My dad(roy) actually wanted a relationship with him, and he tried to be there but wasnt given the opportunites.
B00005JMJG|5.0|What a fantastic film.  I was so surprised at the emotion the Jim Carrey draws from you during this film.  The story revolves are Carrey's character going through a mind erasure of his ex-girlfriend.  During the process, he regrets his decision and attempts to stop the process.  Unfortunately, he is asleep for the whole thing and cannot wake himself up.  What ensues is a very touching attempt by Carrey to save his memories by stowing them away in places where they don't belong (like his childhood).  The screenplay is by Charlie Kauffman, and he delivers his usual quirky high quality tale.  The story is beautifully told and the actors portray their characters with such realism that you really get taken for an emotional ride.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys films that are considered good for their writing and acting, not for big budget and effects.
B0002MRPE0|3.0|I have decided you are either a Crocker fan or you're not.  I can listen to him forever.  I liked this album better than some of the others I have.  The songs were just right for his voice.
B000002KLG|5.0|This collaboration of Quincy and George makes for a sheer masterpiece of a CD, perhaps one of the best of its decade. From the Rod Temperton-penned delights (LOVE X LOVE, GIVE ME THE NIGHT, TURN OUT THE LAMPLIGHT) to the remaining tunes (WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, MIDNIGHT LOVE AFFAIR), every track is smoothly played out with the wonderful voice and guitar of George, not to mention that particular golden touch that Quincy possesses. If you're looking for music that will totally relax you, not to mention make you want to dance, and perhaps get romantic, look no further than here.
0375713751|3.0|Warning: this book can induce symptoms of fatigue, crankiness, panic and sadness!  While being a quick and witty read,  I Don't Know How She Does It expresses so eloquently the main character's pain at juggling her career as a cut throat fund manager and her role as a mother, the reader feels those emotions as their own.      Kate Reddy, a married mother of two, living in wealthy North London, is a director at a top financial firm.  Trying desperately to hold on to her seniority at work, she finds herself caught between two half lives of domesticity and big business.  While initially it can be difficult to sympathize with Kate, who complains constantly and appears somewhat of a martyr in her determination not to relinquish her control over everything,  her self imposed frenzy becomes more believable as the reader realizes that it is part of Kate's  flawed but lovable character.   There is a good dose of humor thrown in when the going gets a little too tough for this to be a lighthearted read. - funnier moments reveal Kate scrabbling to fake home made mince pies for the School Christmas bake sale, revealing her lacy Agent Provocateur bra to the boardroom and discovering that her husband has mistakenly dressed the baby in a doll's outfit.    Nevertheless this is a cautionary tale for those of us who plan to \\" do it all\\", as the moral of the story is; it is best to do something well, than do everything badly.  I Don't Know How She Does It is a refreshing change from the tired literary genre of self obsessed twenty some things  trying to find a man and make it big.  Kate Reddy gives those of us who haven't yet  reproduced a glimpse into the future of career and family and gives working mothers a shoulder to cry on.
0446608955|4.0|<br />Title: A Walk to Remember <br />Author: Nicholas Sparks <br />Pages: 240 <br />Date Started: 11/4/2004 <br />Date Finished: 12/14/2004 <br /> <br />Annotation:  Every April, when the wind blows from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High.  It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister.  A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out.  Landon would never have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood . . . <br />Author Biography:  Nicholas Charles Sparks was born in Omaha, Nebraska into a family of loving parents and two siblings.  His father, Patrick, mother Jill, sister Danielle, and brother Michael lived together in Fair Oaks, California.  Nicholas grew up to be a very determined and achieving track runner.  He was also successful in his studies.  He majored in Business Finance and graduated with high honors.  He met his wife Catherine on spring break in 1988.  Nicholas began writing and selling books in 1994.  Since then Nicholas Sparks has had eleven very successful novels and will continue to do so in the future. <br />Evaluation:  \\"A Walk to Remember\\" is about teenagers Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter.  Landon grew up being rebellious with his group of friends.  Because of the mistakes the Landon had made, his mother thought it would be a good idea for him to try tobecome student council president. After he broke up with his girlfriend, Landon had to find a new date to take to the homecoming dance.  All of the girls that he would normally consider going with were already being taken, so Landon was forced to ask the only girl left, Jamie Sullivan.  They went to the dance, and surprisingly had a great time.  Landon was confused by his feelings for Jamie and pushed them aside.  One day after school, Jamie called Landon and told him that she needed a favor.  She needed him to be Tom Thorton in her father's Christmas play.  Landon realized that he owed her so he accepted the part.  The play turned out to be a huge success.  From all of the time that he put into the play with Jamie, Landon realized that his feelings for Jamie had grown to be something real.  He had fallen for her.  They started hanging out all the time after school, doing things that Jamie liked such as visiting orphanages and dancing at fancy restaurants.  They had fallen in love.  As they grew closer, Landon began to notice changes in Jamie.  She was always tired and was always getting sick.  It was then the Landon found out that Jamie had leukemia and she was dying.  Landon was crushed.  He knew what he wanted to do so he asked Jamie to marry him.  They got married that summer and shortly before Jamie passed away.  Landon never loved anyone like he loved Jamie.  She had changed his life forever and he would never forget that. <br />   A Walk to Remember is one of my favorite books.  I love how Nicholas Sparks always seems to catch my attention with his romance novels.  This book showed me the true being of love and fate.  Reading this book gave me the chills to see how much true love Landon had for Jamie.  It made me happy to see that Landon could look past Jamie's image at high school and see the real person in Jamie.  The simple risk that Landon took of asking Jamie out on a date made for a complete positive change in his life.  I often wondered throughout thebook what would have happened with Landon's life had he not asked Jamie to the homecoming dance.  I wonder if he would have kept making mistakes with his life or if he would have found peace in himself and in his family.  I definitely thought that A Walk to Remember was well written.  It was the type of book that when you start reading, it is difficult to put down.  <br /> <br />
B0002UXBD6|4.0|My brother was a big fan back in the days of their album 'Dookie' and I remember hearing them every time I was in the car with him. But this new release by Green Day has shown that that generation has grown from the ripped jeans and 'skate or die' motto to the blue-collar working man who hates his boss and wants to be a kid again. <br />In this album, it tells a story like theme of a teenager who is tired of the same old crap that is every day life and follows a dreamer named St. Jimmy who is also known as the Jesus Of Suburbia. <br />I loved the album in it's self and the image that it plays in my mind. So I hope you also will enjoy this album as much as I did.
B00005JKMQ|4.0|The best part of this movie was the camera angles in the fight scenes, but otherwise the plot is slow and tedious at best. <br /> <br />Does anyone know what the song is that is in th trailer for Ali on the DVD?

B000286RZM|5.0|John Frusciante uses beautiful layering and playing techniques in this superb album.  The first five of six \\"monthly\\" albums each have their own distinctive feel, and a minimalistic, yet intricate music style is evident.  \\"Shadows Collide with People\\" precedes the six latest albums, and it gives a more scrutinized studio sound.  I recommend going to [...] and downloading the acoustic versions and demos for free.  Two thumbs up to Frusciante and Josh Klinghoffer for their style.
B0000048CP|5.0|This is arguably Bathory's finest album. The production, while not perfect, is better than most other Bathory albums. Excellent black/speed metal songs like \\"The Golden Walls of Heaven\\" are sandwiched in between the Viking-mythology epics \\"A Fine Day To Die\\" and the title track. The songwriting here is much more complex than it is on earlier albums such as \\"The Return\\", where many of the songs sounded similar to each other. The drumming on this album (played by Quorthon?) is far better than on earlier Bathory releases; this combined with the improved sound make \\"Blood Fire Death\\" an awesome album.
0345451325|5.0|This is a must have for all Halo fans. <br /> <br />This novel looks into the creation of the Spartan program, and Spartans such as the Master Chief. It looks at major events that shaped the Spartans' lives to be who they are, prior to the events of Halo 1. It looks at the desperation of humanity as they are on the verge of complete extinction by an unstoppable foe, but it also looks at humanity as the struggling underdog fighting the good fight, never surrendering.  <br /> <br />This is the first novel in the Halo universe one needs to read. It sets the stage for Halo 1 and the second Halo novel, Halo: The Flood.
0553582461|5.0|The Tawny Man is by far Robin Hobb's best series and Fool's Fate is by far her best work. Highly recommended.
B000002G8L|2.0|I have yet to write any reviews for Amazon although I am an avid shopper here. However, after seeing the earlier two reviews, I felt compelled to part with precedent. Although this album is not bad, it CERTAINLY is not \\"Clapton's best live album.\\" I am a HUGE Clapton fan, and I own every recording he has ever released with every band he has been with, live and otherwise. Clapton's orginal songs sound weak here, with often weak vocals and shaky improvisation on the guitar. The blues covers he plays sound manufactured and \\"pop,\\" a clear indication of the unfortunate turn his music would take througout the eighties. However, this album is not without its high points, those mostly being the Disc 1 closer \\"After Midnight,\\" which is an interesting blend of Clapton's infamous cover of the song, with his energetic vocals, and JJ Cale's original with the soft beat and gentle guitar. The other high point of the album is the unique and novel medley of Ramblin' on My Mind and Have You Every Loved a Woman. Taken on their own, neither of these songs are outstanding, with Clapton's (at times) annoying eighties pop rhytum section pounding away in the background, but the unique mixture of the songs, from Ramblin' into Have You Ever than back into Ramblin', makes it at least a worthwhile listen. However, if you are looking for a great live Clapton album, I reccomend \\"Derek and the Dominoes Live at the Fillmore,\\" as that is his best, or \\"Goodbye Cream\\" which is also up there, although an earlier recording.
B0001O3YD0|5.0|It seemed like a cross between JAWS and Hitchcock's Birds attacking a whole town. I loved it, the monsters were actually frightening! They looked like flying hammerhead sharks, plus they had that \\"Vampire\\" flesh which burns in direct sunlight thing going for them that was a nice touch...lol...<br /><br />All in all I loved the movie and I loved watching everyone panic and get mauled to death. If you're a fan of gore and sci-fi you'll love this movie! I actually saw it in the theaters when it first came out, I hadn't even seen previews for it and didn't expect much, let me just say this is NOT a B movie, the effects were awesome especially the first scene when the ship gets hit by micro-meteorites and starts burning up while entering the atmosphere of this alien desert planet.
B0006J28KU|4.0|I just wanted to express my frustration about the growing trend of issuing a Special Edition DVD, and then a Special Special Edition DVD, and then maybe an Extended Special Edition DVD, all of the same movie!  It annoys me that after I have already paid my money for this product, the studio then decides to add more to it and then offer it for the same price, sometimes even for less, to people who did not show interest in it the first time!<br /><br />I work in a music and movie retail store, but things like this could easily make me want to consider some kind of downloadable and/or upgradable version of media.  Unfortunately, that type of media would obviously threaten the livelyhood of my business and would also likely cut studio profit margins.  If this is the way that the studios want to treat its fans though, it seems this is the way that they are headed.<br /><br />I would personally appreciate it if they either put everything they had into the original release, even if it meant a higher price, or to allow the people who support their product to upgrade to the new version when it becomes available at a discounted price.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant, because this is a great movie, just don't be surprised to see some Special Special Extended Director's Cut Version shortly with more footage shortly.
B00006879E|5.0|I pride myself in having good taste in music, thats why I was extremely skeptical about Maroon 5 when I heard about them.  I did see them as spin offs of Stevie Wonder etc.  I listened to the songs a couple times each and fell in love with \\"Harder to Breathe\\", \\"This Love\\", \\"She will be loved\\" and \\"The Sun\\". <br /> <br />But then I saw the music videos... I felt like I had to air out the living room after the whole experiance.  The lead singer seems to have this odd fascination with \\"doing it\\" on camera.  The whole \\"This Love\\" video was ruined by him and this girl banging it out.  <br /> <br />This almost turned me off.  Because if there is one thing I can't stand in music- it's sexual innuendo. The funny thing is, the same thing doesn't happen in the songs.  The only \\"reference\\" in the album is a line in \\"The Sun\\" <br />\\"The sex she slipped into my coffee\\" <br />Other then that there are some subtle \\"have to listen closely\\" lines.  Such as in -This Love- \\"My pressure on your hips\\".  <br />Um yeah.   <br /> <br />But if you overlook the scanky videos (which you don't have to watch- and Harder to Breathe is good) and those two lines...what do you have?  And absolutly awesome album.  What a breath of fresh hair the Maroon 5 gang brings to the music world.   <br /> <br />You either love them or hate them, so I can understand people not liking them at all.  Be prepared for some Grammy nominations.    <br />So it comes to... the videos or the music.  Stay away from the videos (if your uncomfortable with that) and if you like the songs buy the album.  Or if you want to be really safe, download every song except \\"This Love\\" and \\"The Sun\\" (but your really missing out if you get rid of the two).  <br />Hope this helped.
B0002YLC24|5.0|My comments really apply to both films, \\"Before Sunrise\\" and \\"Before Sunset\\" as I saw them one after the other, a day apart. Each could stand alone, but together, they just fit.<br /><br />I thought a lot about whether to give the films four or five stars. There are a lot of films which have more aspects to them.  But, are those films better? Maybe, but I just enjoyed these in different ways.<br /><br />So, that's why I give \\"Before Sunrise\\" and \\"Before Sunset\\" five stars each. They just grab you. What some might criticize the films for, just make them better, in my opinion. For instance, some criticize the films as slow moving, but as I see it, I like to spend more time with people I like and want to root for.<br /><br />Plus, I see a parallel between a couple building such a bond in a short time, but are questioning whether it will last, and my reaction to the films right after seeing them. My appreciation of the films just seems to grow.<br /><br />Thanks, Ethan and Julie. It's hard to imagine the roles without you.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I looooooooooooooooooooooove this album. When I first bought it i listen to it non-stop for a month and i still love it.

B00005JM02|5.0|Nemo and his paranoid dad Marlon live under the sea in a sheltered existance (after the death of Nemo's mother and sibling eggs) until Nemo's first day of school where he is abducted by a diver and destined to live the rest of his life in a fish tank... or belly up in a bag as a present to hideously ugly, violent human girl Darla. Meanwhile, Marlon and his newfound companion, amnesia suffering fish Dory travel the sea, encountering sea turtles and jellyfish, amongst others, in their search for Nemo.  <br />This film is so much fun and good for all ages. The two disc edition is packed with fantastic extras, and is one peice of amazing family entertainment. Do not believe what you hear about it being over-rated... watch it first and make your own opinon. It's hilarious, sensationally constructed and captivating to the last second. If you take my advice, you'd watch it.
B000002GXS|5.0|This album has see me through many sad lonely nights. But the real time this music works its magic is when you have a woman to share it with. I'm telling you guys, put this on in the background and they swoon. Any girl who doesn't simply isn't worth the trouble. <br />   And if you just love Tom Waits, well that's enough of an excuse in my mind. It's jazzy, it's bluesy, it's Waits! And that alone can't be beat.
B000056JYC|3.0|This would probably only matter to people who originally purchased Frampton Comes Alive when it first came out. <br /> <br />When I was a senior a Cal and on a tight budget, Frampton Comes Alive came out as a double album (vinyl of course) priced as a single album.  I bought it without knowing much about Peter Frampton and I loved it.  So did everyone else.  As Mike Myers said in Wayne's World, it was as if everyone was issued a copy at birth.  I remember sitting in my Berkeley apartment hearing the strains of it from some distant stereo. <br /> <br />I've never much cared for other Frampton recordings.  His studio versions of the same songs weren't nearly as good, at least far as I could tell. <br /> <br />After years without a copy of the album, I finally broke down and bought it.  I decided to splurge on the deluxe edition.  For me, that was a mistake.  I was used to the original, and changing it did not make it better.  There is a reason the new cuts didn't make it to the original album.  They aren't bad, but they're not as good.  For me, they detract from the album, which I would otherwise rate as five stars. <br />
B0001AP12G|1.0|This album shoots way above the ground nowhere near the under!! This is as mainstream as it gets. To call a Roc-A-Fella album underground is an oxymoron in itself. Don't get me the wrong the beats are ok but nothing phenomonal as most reviewers try to kid themselves. I would personally take an instrumental of this album over one with lyrics. Its a shame he has done work with rawkus label greats like talib and mos def who are real lyrical writers and legit hip hop artists. (kanye has tainted my image of them) Kanye's lyrics aren't brilliant they are simply corny a good example is the lame track The New Work Out Plan. People are suprised at this so called \\"new\\" kind of magic hip hop that doesnt talk about guns and hos, but wake up its been around for more than 20 years. This is by far the most overhyped album the year, i was expecting something great and was really let down. If you want real underground hip hop, here is a hint check out MF Doom and his many aliases.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|I seriously loved this film and wanted to give it five stars, but alas, it was released without the advertised English subtitles. Dreamworks has admitted they goofed, and hopefully a recall will come soon. If you buy it, beware! The English subtitles are closed-captioned, and if you watch it on a widescreen tv in anamorphic format, the subtitles will be HUGE, obscuring what is one of the most beautifaul animated films ever made. To add insult to injury, it has no English dub, which can be a problem if you simply want to admire the animation. I can't believe Dreamworks released this work of art in such terrible condition. For Shame!
B000068PQ0|5.0|In a time when the media refers to all musicians as artists, regardless of how little creativity most \\"artists\\" display, it's easy for the everyday person to forget how beautiful musical art can be.  If you only discover your music from the radio, \\"Yoshimi\\" is the cure. It's nothing less than a musical journey, changing every time you listen, revealing new corners of sound you've never heard before. You may reject it at first, but keep listening and soon you'll realize that the album is many things at once- unique yet accessible, profound yet simple, bold yet restrained, amusing yet sad... just like life.
B00065U08Q|4.0|I am ashamed to admit this, but when I heard the CD was going to be all \\"electronic\\" style music, I didn't expect to like it much. Strange considerring I LOVE 99% of Frusciantes music. Well, I deserve hell for that foolish asumption! I liked this release a lot and can listen to \\"Afterglow\\" a hundred times in a row and not get sick of it. \\"Afterglow\\" and \\"My Life\\" are highlights on this release. A couple tracks reminded me of the weird instrumental synthesizer tracks on \\"Shadows Collide...\\"  Johns voice blew me away on this CD too. He gets better and better with each Cd and that's saying a lot considering he released 6 CD's in the past year! If John falls down a flight of stairs while carrying his guitar, I hope someone is there to record it ...cause it'll most likely sound brilliant!
0812550757|5.0|This book is the second part of the Ender saga. For the first time since the destruction of the aliens called the buggers in Ender's Game (part one), intelligent alien life has been found in the universe, on a planet called Lusitania. The creatures are called pequeninos and have been nicknamed `piggies' because of their resemblance to pigs. Scientists called xenologers have been assigned to study the piggies, but under strictly controlled conditions, to protect piggy culture from human influence and corruption. But the piggies kill one of the xenologers assigned to study them, and so Ender Wiggin travels to Lusitania (a deeply religious community) to find out why this has happened.  I found this book to be a much deeper read than Ender's Game, with many underlying themes: the nature of the difficult but worthy path towards unity between peoples, the importance of family, the choice between obeying authority and obeying conscience, the loss of friends, the nature of truth, the tragedy of alien misunderstanding man, to name a few. The characters in this book are all superbly realised and stick in the memory, especially the children of the character called Novinha, and the development of the character of Ender mirrors the developing maturity of Card himself as a writer. Running as a theme throughout this book is the fact that Ender is looking for a place where the buggers can be reborn. This is Ender's penance for his destruction of the buggers at the end of Ender's Game. Profound and powerful writing from Orson Scott Card. I loved Ender's Game, and before reading this was sceptical that it would be as good. It is a tribute to Orson Scott Card that it is even better.
0670033375|5.0|Diamond is very impressive. He has so much knowledge to fit into one book. The product is a colorful and three dimensional account instead of a grayish flat analysis that usually trends on one point and makes it the anchor of all problems.<br /><br />True that Diamond emphasizes on geography, yet the book has so much to it than being a lame Atlas. It's a book of life, putting most of the things that it discusses in context. Just wish that politicians and policy makers start taking such books into consideration and abandon the prejudice of their advisors who always wish to call themselves experts on issues they barely know about.<br /><br />Diamond is well-informed. His book is a pleasure to read, even though to some, its style might look a bit dry. If you are not into these kinds of books, this one is certainly worth a try.
B0002XN322|5.0|This collection features episodes from both seasons of the series and it is representative of the acting talent that flourished on Serling's show.<br /><br />\\"The Dead Man\\" is, justifiably, the scariest installment in the show's history.  It stars Carl Betz (\\"The Donna Reed Show,\\" \\"Judd for the Defense\\") as a doctor whose \\"discovery\\" (Michael Blodgett) has the unusual ability to mimic serious diseases while in a hypnotic state.  The chiller also stars Louise Sorel (\\"Days of Our Lives\\") and legendary drama coach/director Jeff Corey.  Robert Prince's score is appropriately terrifying, reminiscent of Billy Goldenberg's music for the \\"Night Gallery\\" pilot.<br /><br />Larry Hagman, at the time late of \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\" has a ball as a husband that uses alchemy to do away with his shrewish yet wealthy wife, played by model/actress Suzy Parker.  Character acting great Jeanette Nolan relishes her part as the housekeeper that may be the answer to Hagman's dreams.<br /><br />\\"A Fear of Spiders\\" boasts a tour de force pairing of Patrick O'Neal and Broadway's Kim Stanley as a columnist and his admirer, respectively, that have a little problem with an eight-legged \\"freak\\".  The banter between O'Neal and Stanley is priceless, giving credit to Serling's teleplay.<br /><br />The quality of the performances show elevates this one to classic status.
B00005U122|2.0|This is a very sad DVD, because Roger Waters was once a musical genious and his downfall does not make any less of his previous accomplishments. The only reason i gave this DVD a 2 instead of a 1 is because its worth seeing to learn a very valuable lesson, but the actual performance is sickeningly aweful. Roger Waters has really lost his mind, he considers himself to be some kind of untouchable GOD in this DVD, he is more of a Las Vegas Seigfried & Roy theatrical performance, than a musician, just like every other gutless pop hit in todays music industry. If you cant pick this up from the intro and the performance itself (i love his hair flick ever time he hits an important note, lol) then check out the behind the scenes feature, which is more of an \\"undercover with a corrupted musician\\" and you will see what i mean. Its actually rather sad and disgusting, but a very valuable lesson for any quality musician.
0684800713|3.0|My first taste of Hemingway and I've got to say I'm very disappointed.  His style is crisp and economical and I like the dialog.  Outside of that, there is no huge conflict here to keep you turning pages, save for Jakes love of Brett.  I just got to the stage where I just didn't care what happened to Jake, Cohn or any of the others or where they were travelling to.   <br /> <br />I still have Men Withhout Women to read but I will more than likely shift it to the bottom of the pile.  I think Graham Greene is a much better writer.  Greene writes with style and keeps you turning pages, i.e. The Quiet American.
0440180295|1.0|This without a doubt ranks up there with the WORST books I have ever read.  Pointless, poorly written, and incredibly dull.<br /><br />If you want some great writing, try Ayn Rand.
B000002U8G|5.0|This, in sum, was the theory a friend conveyed to me regarding Meddle, Pink Floyd's forgotten masterpiece.  Each of the first 5 tunes is a different style, the hard charging metal of \\"One of These Days,\\" the snappy almost ragtime \\"San Tropez\\", the dreamy, ethereal \\"Pillow of Winds\\", the straight ahead \\"Seamus\\" all written and performed to PROVE that the Floyd could master any musical style.  Once confirmed, they said, now here's what WE are all about .. ECHOES.  23+ of musical genius, teasing greatly the masterwork of DSOTM this is their signature tune for heavy Floyd Heads.  It's unfortunate that this album is sometimes forgotten in the sick odd number year run of 70s greatness (73 DSOTM 75 Wish You Were Here, 77 Animals, 79 The Wall) but it's stil my favorite. <br /> <br />Enjoy
6305127646|5.0|This is such a great movie for Val Kilmer fans out there!! He surely knows how to act mutiple characters in this film!! It has a romantic theme as well as action-packed scenes! It's  a very good film to buy for your Val Kilmer collection!! :)
B000002KLP|5.0|only music this good could could back up a cover photo this gross. <br />
B00006JKOL|5.0|Everyone normally likes to point to Aqualung and Thick As A Brick as the best albums from Tull, while this one doesn't seem to get the credit it most definitely deserves. The songs on this album follow the orchestration of Warchild, but with a bit more classical influence, and complexity. The epic track Baker Street Muse is an absolute must hear, with the many different sections flowing into each other perfectly. All of the other tracks, especially the title track and Cold Wind To Valhalla are absolute quality. It takes a few listens to get into this one, but it's well worth the patience.
B000001EAQ|5.0|This should have been the last U2 album, when they were at the top of the hill. They should have released an extraordinary double CD set with \\"The Best Of\\" ( from 1980 - 1998 ), after their most succesful Tour ever ( yet they got more tickets than Zoo TV one !! ). <br /> <br />Everything is a pleasure listen here: Innovative, provocative, different, experimental, varied, sonic, mind-blowing, etc. <br /> <br />Their further lame sold out U2 2000 is pathetic.  <br />I really can't stand this wide labeled and sold out iPod band now !!!!.  <br /> <br />With Pop you won't find trademarked guitars, safe playing, lame lyrics, silly videos, etc. You'll find a whole new band. This album is pretty their \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". <br /> <br />Just songs like Mofo, Discotheque, Staring At The Sun, Please, Gone, etc, are better alone than the whole crappy U2 2000 era. <br /> <br />DON'T LISTEN TO THEIR RIPPING OFF EMBRACE, LISTEN TO THIS, THE LAST U2 MASTERPIECE
B000268QB2|3.0|It really grows on you after a while.  A very good freshman effort!
B0006399FS|3.0|This CD isn't as bad as some people would say.  \\"Vertigo\\" is pretty good, but the rest of the album is patchy at best.  U2 used to be the most powerful band in the world, but let's face the truth: they're losing their edge.  I'd download only the songs you want instead of buying the whole record.  And listen to the samples before you buy.
B00013RC9I|1.0|This is a terrible album and i wish this disgrace has never been made. What a waste of usefull record tape this was. Like i said Air runs and trips like a little child on a home movie that is hidden in you basement, and there is a reason for that...
B0000025VU|3.0|first of all, a swift clarification as regards the previous review. bob dylan, thanks be to god, NEVER sang 'where have all the flowers gone?  it was written by pete seeger & championed by every well-intentioned but naive, rotten doctor commie rat thereafter.  <br />what of infidels then?  highs & lows. some of the lows, very low, depth plumming moments probably. dylan himslef is in great voice, the poetry is rich & vibrant and the musicians are first class, & unlike most albums recorded in the early to mid 80's, infidels seems to have aged quite well.  <br />'jokerman' is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, & <br />'I&I' a brooding, spooky, introspective journey.  <br />the sentiments expressed in 'sweetheart like you' may be a little cheesy, even sexist, but some of the song's lines literally leap out of the speakers at you - 'just how much abuse will you be able to take? ain't no way to tell by that first kiss... bone chilling stuff...  <br />I recommend that you buy this record, then edit out 'man of peace', 'neighborhood bully' & 'union sundown' & replace them with 'foot of pride', 'lord protect my child', 'blind willie mctell' & 'death is not the end'. then you will have a truly mighty album in your hands... <br />'ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister'...
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is hillarious, and to those who say there's no point, you're right.  The fact that there is no point is what makes it so great, and the way John Heder plays Napoleon is great.  This movie looked like it would be the classic geek movie (etc. Revenge of the Nerds) but it turned out to be a whole new kind of comedy.  This is Dumb and Dumber, but stupider and funnier!!  I can't understand why anyone could say this movie is trash, unless you have no sense of humor.  Just listening to anything Napoleon says is funny...his pickup line is \\"Are you drinking 1% because you think you're fat, because you're not...you could be drinking whole milk if you wanted.  By the way, you should come get your stuff out of my locker, I can't fit my nunchucks in there anymore.\\"  That's not even the funniest scene. When Kip runs over the tupperware and just drives off, I coudn't stop laughing.  The music went along perfectly and some of the songs are actually good.  I had to buy the soundtrack too...42 tracks (including a lot of dialogue) for 13 dollars was a steal for Napoleon Dynamite fans.  This is my favorite DVD out of my collection, and I have some great movies..I'll end my favorite quote- \\"(Napoleon)I made like an infinity of those at scout camp last year\\" \\"(Deb)I'm trying to raise money to go to college.\\"  \\"(Kip) Your mom goes to college!\\"
B0006399FS|1.0|Hard to accept it, but U2 are so irrelevant now. They're a rotten band dying awfuly bad by their own marketing propaganda. <br /> <br />Many desperate fans have said \\"back to Old U2 !!!\\", \\"back to their roots !!!\\", \\"classic U2 !!!\\", and things like that. <br />But the truth is as follows: <br /> <br />U2 was a rebel band fighting against the system. <br />They had a white flag, three chords and the truth. <br />The system had money, fast cars, power, greed and lies. <br /> U2 2000 have  money, fast cars, power, greed and lies. <br />We have a whitle flag and the truth. <br /> <br />IN OTHER WORDS: U2 have become the same system they hated so much, and WE ARE the rebel U2. <br /> <br />BACK TO WHICH ROOTS MY FRIENDS ? BACK TO WHAT ?
0385510454|4.0|As someone who hasn't enjoyed Grisham's writing since the late '90s, I really didn't have high expectations for this book.  I don't think any of us read his novels looking for any kind of enlightment, but instead we only want an intelligent, fun ride.  To that end, The Broker is a success. <br /> <br />Unlike some of his more recent books, this one sticks to his old formula - a sympathetic character, intrigue, and a \\"chase\\" leading into a good ending.  The only thing that drags the book down is that Backman's time in Italy reads at times like a pastoral novel.  I'm all for character development, but we learn more at times about the country than about Backman. <br /> <br />I still look back on early efforts like A Time to Kill and The Firm as being Grisham's best.  This doesn't reach that level, but it's certainly a welcome improvement from recent material. <br />
B00006FMAW|4.0|Poor Bill Whitney!  He's a high school kid who lives in a marble mansion in Beverly Hills.  His family is filthy rich and super connected. When they're not buzzing around LA in the Maserati they're having the chauffeur warm up the Bentley.<br /><br />Whitney is all-American, captain of the football team, soon to be President of the Student Body. With a Washington DC internship in the works and a Harvard acceptance letter in the hopper, what could be better for a teenager in love?<br /><br />Everything.  Bill Whitney is going through an awkward stage: he's got to contribute to Society, after all, but he doesn't fit in.  He doesn't feel he belongs.<br /><br />Worse, Whitney is convinced something is deeply, frighteningly wrong: how to explain the night terrors he has of walking through his own house, a house dark but hardly empty, the halls and rooms filled with whispers and shuffling?  How to explain his sleepwalking, only to wake huddled at the base of the stairs clutching a butcher knife?  How to fathom his surprise and revulsion when something---only for a fleeting instant---shifts beneath the ridge of his sister's shoulder blade, too sluggish for doubt, too quick for certainty?<br /><br />How to dismiss his conviction that there are secrets being passed behind closed doors, deals being struck, sacraments carried out?<br /><br />The rabid Brian Yuzna made his film debut with \\"Society\\", which takes teen angst anxiety, loads it up with cordite, and lights the fuse with a charming little message that will appeal identity-wrestling teens the world over: if you feel you're always on the outside looking in, then you could always turn yourself inside out. Literally.<br /><br />Things take a turn for the worse when Whitney's schoolmate Blanchard produces a tape suggesting Whitney's sister Jenny is demonstrating considerably more than filial piety towards the folks.  Blanchard's subsequent \\"death\\", increasingly bizarre behavior on the part of his friends and family, and the violent death---and subsequent rosy reappearance---of a school rival suggest that something is seriously wrong with the Upper Crust of Beverly Hills, and it's not just because the rich are getting richer.<br /><br />It could, however, have something to do with the rich getting hungrier.  And the more Whitney (played like a champ by eighties character actor Billy Warlock) finds out, the more it occurs to him he might end up making a far greater---and more lasting---contribution than he ever dreamed possible.<br /><br />F. Scott Fitzgerald once remarked that \\"the rich are different from us: they have more money\\".  In less talented hands, \\"Society\\" might have languished as nothing more than a tedious feature-long riff on an old theme.  Not so with Yuzna, who invests it with every atom of the bloodthirsty, ferocious, and downright scary creativity that flows through his other directorial work: \\"Return of the Living Dead 3\\", \\"The Dentist\\" films, and the \\"Herbert West: Re-Animator\\" trilogy.<br /><br />The glory of \\"Society\\" is that for all its perversity, the movie functions very much in the realm of quirky eighties psychological thriller, and for the bulk of its running time, there's hardly a drop of blood or a gobbet of gore.  Certainly Bill Whitney has a strained and awkward relationship with his glossy, preening, patrician parents, but at his age who doesn't?<br /><br />Sure, Blanchard's tape makes it sound like something incestuous might be brewing at Chez Whitney, but it's easy to take a conversation out of context---heck, this is the eighties, the entire situation comedy lineup of the day---Three's Company, Cheers, Diff'rent Strokes---was founded on that routine!<br /><br />In the meantime, \\"Society\\" is a stylish, severely debauched, possibly mentally insane little romp that entertains in spades.  Chiefly due to Yuzna's skill with the camera, sense of pacing, spooky use of lighting and color, and lavish set-pieces (the mansion, the car wreck), \\"Society\\" entertains on its own terms as a stylishly creepy horror film.<br /><br />Cinematographer Rick Fichter wields one mean camera!  On its own terms, this is a lush and frankly gorgeous film, and the remastered DVD treatment makes it look like it was shot yesterday.  Fichter captures the high society ghoulishness with high style, using colored lighting in a fashion reminiscent of Dario Argento.  The acting is competent, the casting inspired: all the principals (Warlock, Patrice Jennings as Sis, the parents) work like troopers, while Ben Slack as the silver-tongued society shrink and David Wiley as the cigar-chomping Judge Carter (who has a talent for getting to the `bottom' of any problem, quite literally) steal every scene they're in.<br /><br />And then, of course, Society has something of a special effects nuke up its Armani sleeve, trotted out in the final, convulsive Big Reveal: effects served up the old-fashioned way (no CGI---everything done with latex and gallons of fake blood and goop and slime), which show how Screamin' Mad George got his nickname, and which---frankly---are nothing short of jaw-dropping, sincerely repulsive, and genuinely disturbing.  Think what you'd get if you moved the hankey-pankey in the husky pens of \\"The Thing\\" into a Beverly Hills boudoir, then ratchet up the goop and messiness factor by a power of 100.<br /><br />Jaded creature that I am, I was completely floored by the finale, where it would appear that social mobility in Beverly Hills is less about shinnying up the greasy pole than having the greasy pole do some shinnying of its own---and revealing some latex-inspired sexual positions that would have baffled (or inspired) the authors of the Kama Sutra.<br /><br />Class warfare?

B0006399FS|5.0|I have been listening to this band for as long as I can remember. One thing I can say is that from what's considered their best to their worst, I've never been disappointed in a U2 album as of yet. And this one is no exception. From Vertigo to Yahweh this is as good of an album as any other they have released. Great lyrics, great sound and voice of Bono that just will not quit. <br /> <br />I have nothing but my strong recommendations to offer to anyone. If you like U2 or ever have you will love this album. <br /> <br />Just one request to Bono: Cheer up mate.
015603008X|5.0|This extraordinary book used to be required in better schools for the importance of its sensitivities. Sadly, today it is unlikely to be found on reading lists or in classrooms. Bringing back these \\"classics\\" would be an effort to maintain the gentler design of teaching students how their behavior can make a world of difference in a world which requires them to survive. If schools are not offering it, parents should examine it for the values taught for their own budding geniuses, and even for those who aren't.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I'm always up for anything that provokes thought...this was perfect...although I believe it would have been better with the deleted scenes it's now up there in my list of favorite movies along with The Royal Tenembaums, American Beauty, and Girl Interrupted...it's truely Amazing...
B00003CXBK|4.0|It had a good story about with some strong themes.  Predominating themes were love, honor, man vs. nature and nature vs. machines.  The art was beautiful.  There were some elements of comedy, and of course the gore (oh, there goes that man's arm!).   <br /> <br />The movie is essentially about a man who kills a demon but gets infected by it.  In his search to find where the demon originated, he becomes caught between two different worlds-nature's struggle against man, and the society where the people are good but are hurting the environment.   <br /> <br />Actually, for the movie to be called Princess Mononoke is a little strange, she's the secondary major character.  It's more about the young man.  Overall it was a good movie.  I rented it first, which is what I would recommend with all Animes because everyone has different tastes.
B00005JNEI|2.0|I didn't see this movie until it came out on DVD, and from what I had heard from friends, my expectations were high.  <br />     I had heard it included photos of George W. Bush shaking hands with the Taliban, when in fact some members of the Taliban (or maybe they were American Muslims?) were just in Texas.  <br />     I wasn't at all shocked to find that a successful Texas oil man (also George W's friend) had some Saudi acquaintances. I really expected this film to be an indictment, but the movie was just transparent spin, cut and pasted.  <br />     Michael Moore should have tried to tie everything up more neatly. I also found the extended segment on the dead soldier's mother to be exploitative and beside the point. If decisions to go to war were determined by how much mothers loved their children, no one would ever go to war. <br />      And just why did he include a Saudi beheading? How does that contribute to Moore's argument that the government is scaring us with terror alerts? <br />     This movie is high on stimulus and low on cohesion. Still, it's worth renting to find out what everyone's talking about. Just  keep in mind, this film is designed to make you feel rather than make you think.

First of all, the music is so bland and obviously drawn from the band's influences that the only identity that can be found lies in the singer's annoying, piercing voice singing about how much his life in particular is worse than anyone else's. Secondly, the average rating of the album is 3.5 and half the reviewers have something very bad to say about it. And believe me because I know when to hate and when not to, that Simple Plan isn't coincidentally hated, or hated due to popularity. If you listen to this album and have any sense of what actual music sounds like, you will cry like the babies that Simple Plan's members are. This isn't normal bad we're looking at... It's TERRIBLE bad, worse than anything I've ever seen before, so rediculously bad that I can't figure out wether to laugh at it or get mad over the fact that a band like this could ever find the success that they have.    If you like this album, listen to Green Day repeatedly for a month without a single dose of Simple Plan. Then go back and listen Simple Plan again and you'll realize not how bad music can get, but how much better it can be than Simple Plan. And eventually you'll be able to appreciate how bad they are.
B00023B1LC|4.0|When I first saw this after it came out on DVD, I was not too receptive. Even though I thought Damon was well cast (indeed, seemed more able in this role than in some others he's played), my impression was that the screenplay was written primarily so that the director could simply string together the various action and special-effect scenes. In fact, from early-on into the movie that's exactly what is featured: car-chase and action scenes, distracting enough to make me lose sight of the plot as well. I came away disappointed, thinking this was crafted for immediacy at the expense of intrigue or drama. About 9 months later, however, it was a selection on one of the Cable TV networks, and this time I watched a little more intently, trying to discern if there was something I had initially missed. Wow! Second time around was apparently the charm for me: I got a chance to follow the events a little more carefully, and recognized that this was a much better film than I had first realized. Meanwhile, I also appreciated the value of the European locations which, this time, I could see provided more authentic substance to the scenes. Had I not been so quick to judge this as simply an Action-Jackson, I may have originally been more aware of its subtler aspects. Then again, perhaps it actually suffers from poor editing and requires more than one viewing. Whatever the case, after watching it again, I became a fan. While I still wouldn't place this in a 'classic' or 'great' category, I nonethless rank it as one of my recent favorites and now recommend it to others.
B00006BGXK|4.0|Heroin, sadomasochism, paranoia, seductive ladies and a big banana on the cover. The Velvet Underground was unique in 1967 (even if it never made big sales), and remains unique to this day, no matter how many bands are influenced by them. (Not bad for an arty band!)<br /><br />Lou Reed tears through a variety of songs, like the slashing, exotic S/M \\"Venus in Furs,\\" desperate hard-rocking \\"Run, Run, Run,\\" the surreal junkie ballad \\"Heroin,\\" and the eerie, soft \\"Sunday Morning.\\" However, German ex-model Nico leads in the seductive, singsong \\"Femme Fatale,\\" steady and slow \\"All Tomorrow's Parties,\\" and the lovely ballad \\"I'll Be Your Mirror.\\"<br /><br />The music isn't complex, but it is strangely compelling (such as the wiggling guitar at the beginning of \\"Black Angel's Death Song,\\" or the tambourines in Nico's songs). Nowhere else could musical compositions like \\"Sunday Morning\\" (the tune originally reminded me of a music box) seem so haunting as they do here.<br /><br />The vocals are excellent, although listeners will probably like one or the other. Lou Reed's high thin voice is a sharp contrast to Nico's accented, husky croon. (Nico left the band after this album) The writing is outstanding, especially since the frank references to kinky sex and drugs are nowhere near as shocking now as they were when the album was first put out.<br /><br />The sparse, slithering music and excellent singing add solidarity to the reputation of the Velvet Underground as a classic. Dark and brooding, \\"Velvet Underground and Nico\\" is an exceptional album.
B000268QB2|5.0|We've all done it.  You buy an album on a whim whether through recommendation or otherwise, and it sits on your shelf unopened for many months.  Sadly, such was the case between Keane & I. I listened to it for the first time just a mere week ago and was irritated at myself for not doing so much sooner.  This CD is absolutely nothing short of amazing.  As my review title suggests, the music here is nothing new to fans of Radiohead, Travis and Coldplay, but the fact that it's coming out now in the midst of hard rock's huge comeback gives fellow mellow music fans like myself something to be excited about again.  It took Radiohead years to capture the magic of OK Computer, let's hope Keane is back in the studio again very soon.
B0006213WG|4.0|After listening to All Killer No Filler so many times and getting bored of that, I decided to give that away, then a friend made me listen to this, I expected this to be not very different, but it was actually a real change for Sum 41 and they realize that they can do punk/rock, and not pop/rock. Though there still is pop, it's nothing like All Killer, this is far better and much more rock then anything they've previously done.  <br /> <br />Intro-4/5 It's a cool little riff that leads into the second song.  <br />No Reason-5/5 An awesome beginning to a great cd. This song is punk/rock, without the yelling he does in most of his other tracks.  <br />We're All to Blame-5/5 An awesome punk/rock verse, with a poppy chorus. All together, a great mix.  <br />Angels with Dirty Faces-3.5/5 Not too fussy on this song, very punk/rock, but just ok  <br />Some Say-5/5 A nice song to listen to, nothing special, just pretty.  <br />Bitter End-4.5/5 A completely rock track with nothing but awesome riffs and cool verses/chorus.  <br />Open Your Eyes-4.5/5 A cool song, nothing more.  <br />Slipping Away-2.5/5 And I'm yawning away.  <br />I'm Not the One-5/5 This song is cool, and it does resemble a Linkin Park song, but is definitely not a ripoff and is actually one of the best songs on the album.  <br />Welcome to Hell-4.5/5 This song is pretty cool.  <br />Pieces-5/5 Another slower song but it's just as good.  <br />There's No Solution-5/5 The best song on here, super cool riff and the verse and chorus come together great.  <br />88-4/5 The beginning riff rocks, the rest is a sleepathon and just plain garbage.  <br /> <br />Obviously Sum 41 still has weaknesses in some of their songs, but it's better then half the album being terrible. So I say they have improved majorly and I am looking forward to another album from them in the next few years. Definitely a cool album, get it today!!
B00005B36H|5.0|up until a friend had introduced me to this album, i had never sat down and seriously listened to metal, or anything \\"heavier\\" than Bach or Coletrane, discarding the entire genre as mediocre and being without musical depth. and for the most part, that is still my opinion, tool and specifically lateralus being one of the only exceptions. to lay it right on the line, this album is absolutely mind blowing. it actually inspires musical thought: the subtle complexity of the time signatures, rhythms, lyrics and overall concept of the album supersedes anything i have ever heard outside of classical music, and even then it is a close call. this album has expanded my mind as to the impressive beauty that \\"mainstream\\" music can possess. entirely incredible, almost unbelievable.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I had heard a lot about Rammstein before I bought this album,(Du Hast) and I never particularly payed any attention to them. However, once my cousin got Reise, Reise and I heard the two singles Amerika and Mein Teil I immediately knew I had to buy one of their albums. Reise, Reise was ok, but I knew soon that their album Mutter was chock full of hits and great songs, so I bought it, and I am so glad I did. Here's a run down of the songs: <br /> <br />1. Mein Hertz Brennt- 5/5-the first song that I heard off of Mutter and loved it. <br />2. Links 2,3,4- 5/5- the second song I heard off Mutter... and I couldnt get that \\"Links!\\" chant out of my head. <br />3. Sonne- 5/5- I love this song! I listened to it right when I popped into the cd player and enjoyed every bit of it. <br />4. Ich Will-4/5- A good song, and an awesome chanter, but just not one of my favorites on the album. <br />5. Feuer Frei!-4/5- Also a pretty good song, but that Bang! Bang! thing just sounds kinda cheesy everytime I listen to it, but I love the synth in this song. <br />6. Mutter- 5/5- A great song, I love the chorus, and the guitar. <br />7. Spieluhr-4/5- I dont know what it is about this song, the guitar is cool, chorus is pretty cool, but that little girl kinda bugs me man. <br />8. Zwitter-5/5- I love this song, because of Zwitter, it sounds so funny in this song! especially with that like little person electronic voice. <br />9. Rein Raus- 5/5- pretty good, lyrics are incredibly funny. <br />10. Adios- 6/5- one of my favorites on the album, awesome guitar, awesome everything. <br />11. Nebel- 6/5- I really like this song, and I dont know why. The orchestration is really cool, and sometimes reminds me almost of the keyboards and atmosphere you get in dimmu borgir or borknagar. One of my favorites on this album.
1591840562|5.0|After many recommendations by my professors and other faculty, I was very happy that this book more than lived up to my expectations.  Guy has put his experience and insight into a very honest and readable text.  Each page contains something valuable and practical; no fluff, just a straightforward tool that every person wanting to build an organization should use.  I, for one, will keep this by my side as my field guide while I build my business in the coming months.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Holiday/Boulevard Of Broken Dreams (8:13) starts as quite an anthem, kind of an old-school punk beat which transform its experience into a Holiday. Roughly mid song it switches tone and takes a full turn into a different somewhat whiney, pissed off song (one I recognize from the radio or something). With the song changing abruptly, I still can't figure out why it's on the same track, but that's what makes this album such a great spin. Track 3 (9:08mins), fantastically called `Jesus Of Suburbia', also morphs into different tones and feelings throughout the unusually long song. Billie Joe is really trying to either fix his ADD or show it off? I've got three levels: Great, Good, and Ok and this album is Great.  <br />
B0000DD79B|5.0|I've spent the evening listening to a new double-CD of Simon and Garfunkel and following along with the lyrics. Hubby bought it for me when we were in the center today.<br /><br />Simon & Garfunkel have quite a sentimental hold over me. I remember being 11 and waking up early in the morning, going out to my Dad's camaro, and listening his S&G 8-track until I had to go to school.<br /><br />While other reviews may complain about how this CD set is compiled, for us who have strong memories of S&G but no longer have 8-track players or any S&G albums, this set provides a good starter with many favorites.<br /><br />Now the years are rolling by me,<br /><br />they are rockin' even me<br /><br />I am older than I once was,<br /><br />and younger than I'll be, that's not unusual<br /><br />No it isn't strange, after changes upon changes,<br /><br />we are more or less the same<br /><br />After changes we are more or less the same<br /><br />***<br /><br />Can you imagine us<br /><br />Years from today,<br /><br />Sharing a park bench quietly?<br /><br />How terribly strange<br /><br />To be seventy.<br /><br />Old friends. . .<br /><br />***<br /><br />Time, time, time, see what's become of me<br /><br />While I looked around<br /><br />For my possibilities<br /><br />***<br /><br />Slow down, you move too fast.<br /><br />You got to make the morning last.<br /><br />Just kicking down the cobble stones.<br /><br />Looking for fun and feelin' groovy.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I have my books<br /><br />And my poetry to protect me;<br /><br />I am shielded in my armor,<br /><br />Hiding in my room, safe within my womb. . .
B00030590I|1.0|Ok, I liked the idea.... when it was first introduced back with Crouching Tiger. Doesn't anyone see that these movies are the same. The same actress the same effects. The list goes on. I'm not going to spend money to see the same stuff over and over. It's the same with House of Flying Daggers. The same stuff shoved down our throughts.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|As with the first movie, when I first saw this movie, I was unimpressed.  After watching it again, just like the first movie, I became a diehard Matrix fan.  Same great action and special effects.      (Spoilers Ahead)    I have one gripe.  The love scene between Neo and Trinity and the scene in the temple with everyone dancing around half naked were a disappointment.  Both those scenes were totally unnecessary and uncalled for.  We know Neo loves Trinity and we know Trinity loves Neo.  We din't need to see them make love.  That was a cheap thrill and I don't understand why the directors went there.  They certainly couldn't have been worried about getting an audience.  That having been said, The Matrix Reloaded is still a great ride.  Some say that this film is the worst of the set but I disagree.       Many of these scenes have never been seen or even thought of before. There are so many new things to see here. My review would go on for days if I tried to explain them here. Don't feel left out while others discuss the theologies and philosophies of The Matrix. Instead, watch it for what you can get out of it. You may note something that everyone else missed. There are many levels and we don't get all of them at the same time.    While many find flaws and faults with all of The Matrix films (what movie isn't flawed?) still others will walk away unimpressed as I did. Mind you I haven't seen any of the Matrix films in the theater. I do urge you to see them more than once. Once the inital shock is over, the many levels contained therein will start to seep into your brain. Pretty soon instead of saying Huh? what? you say Ahah!! I get it. So that's what that means.    The Matrix Trilogy has ushered in a new era of sci-fi just as Star Wars did back in the day. It seems like a million years ago. We will never be the same!! We may never be satisfied with the same old thing again. The sci-fi world is forever changed now.    I must add my kudos to the main cast. They all didsome amazing stunt work and really pushed themselves physically and mentally to learn all of the martial arts moves and other dazzling feats. You can see how hard they trained when you watch the special features on each dvd. Yes there are a lot of CGI scenes but the actors are underneath most of it providing the movement for the camera to capture. Great wire and stunt work.  The sets are fantastic.    Parental advisory: There is violence in this movie. There is no nudity or sex but there is foul language and unfortunately the Lord's name is taken in vain. I would advise a viewing age of at least 16 because the plots are so demanding that a younger mind may not grasp the details.    THIS TRILOGY ROCKS!
B000060P79|4.0|I like their newer album better but for any simple plan fan this is a great album to have. They are more mainstream then most albums but it is a great find never or less
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this film. I bought the DVD on New Year's Eve, and we've watched it four times in eleven days. My five-year-old laughs as much as my husband and I. The characters are so hysterically geeky; Kip, the older brother, is a hoot. Such a dorky 32 year old, \\"Don't be jealous because I've been chatting with babes all day, Napoleon.\\" I was about doubled over during the \\"glamour shots\\" by Deb. And the climax, the \\"skit\\" at the elections is classic. It's just one of our favorites. Being an Idahoan, and having grown up in a tiny town like Preston, the principal, classmates, and neigborhood eccentrics are just too realistic!
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Every thing about this movie was hilarius. The songs especially. Sex scene was so hilarius. But to the idiots out there who think that because of this movie Trey and Matt love the war. IT IS A MOVIE. CANT YOU TELL THEY ARE MAKING SERIOUS FUN OF ALL YOU RIGHT WING A-HOLES.
B000002J03|5.0|I listen to all kinds of music, except for rap and country, and this is by far my favorite album. I first heard Led Zeppelin II at age 15, when I found it in my parent's record collection. I had listened to dozens and dozens of their records, liking some of what I heard, but usually putting the record back in its sleeve and moving on to another one.<br /><br />When I put Zepp 2 on the the turntable, it stayed there! For a long time, there was no need to listen to anything else. Fifteen years have passed, and no other album compares to this one. Even the various Led Zepp live renditions of these same songs don't hold a candle to the original studio recordings. I suspect this will be my favorite album until the day I die. I cannot see anything ever replacing it.<br /><br />Mark McGinty is the author of \\"Elvis and the Blue Moon Conspiracy\\"
B0006399FS|5.0|the best record of there lifes. they are more mature musicians and they master the tecnics, great lyrics about the inner world in a time everyone is to obssess with outer world but do nothing to handle there inner world. all musics could be singles, it's like a best of, but as they were 11 diferent bands, each music has is style. great voice of bono and great guitar by edge.
B00009V7T2|4.0|A feast for the ears and mind, this guitar dreamscape fuses guitar-rock history and creates a masterpiece of cacophonous sounds and glorious noise unlike anything you might have heard - or everything you have ever heard all rolled into one sporadic and lethargic, glorious, pretentious dissonant transcendental trip. A rock-opera in the theatre-less sense, it's intellection based on the suicide of a friend, the deceased At The Drive In's Omar and Cedric newly define what art-rock could be and prog-rock should be for this new, inert millennium. In the cesspool that is the TRL-defined rock generation yearning for cred, Mars Volta reverberates under the MTV generation. Better for me. Better for us. My grade: A
B0006399FS|1.0|Well, the members of U2 have finally sold out by playing it safe and stopped being creative with their music in this new album. All the songs are tepid, weak and lack passion from their previous albums such as Joshua Tree and Actung Baby. I even liked their \\"Pop\\" album because I enjoyed the new direction they were taking with their music with touches of electronica and with a certain type of groove. This has all ended now and maybe it time for the band to retire at the South of France. I'm sorry I have played it twice and already I am bored!
B000002HEP|5.0|John. Josh. Scott. Brant. These four desert messiahs unwittingly unleashed a masterpiece on that June day back in 94'...this album is all about the riff, and where it can take you-where it SHOULD take you. We are guided on this journey by the one of a kind vocals of Mr.Garcia, a man with a voice that could give a Cambells soup commercial soul. The fuzz created by Mr.Homme (6 strings) and Mr.Reeder (4 strings) spawned legions of disciples...I am one, and forever will be. Listen to this album, and if you understand, you will be too.
B000002LCI|5.0|This is one of depeche mode's best albums. \\"Never let me down again\\" and \\"Strangelove\\" are classic, and the aggro mix is fantastic.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Just wanted to comment on the POV point. I think there's a simple answer to this \\"flaw\\". Rose's narration is the jumping off point for the story to be told. Just because she is telling her story there is no need for the movie to be narrowed down to what she directly sees and experiences. She is saying, \\"Let me tell you what I went through\\" and then the movie opens up to explore the titanic. Whatever she chips in narration-wise is directly related to what she has seen. I fail to see any problem or contradiction. Great movie!
B000002L9M|5.0|This album is one of D.M.'s \\"darker\\" albums and deviates greatly from earlier albums such as Speak and Spell and Construction Time Again, which have a more mainstream \\"pop\\" feel.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This 1983 film has recently been re-released on DVD.  It has a simple plot - the rise and fall of a gangster.  It's set in Miami and begins in 1980 when Castro allowed 125,000 refuges to leave Cuba.  Among that group were 25,000 criminals.  Al Pacino is cast as Tony Montana, an ambitious young thug who would stop at nothing to gain power.  This is a formula story, but the fine direction by Brian DePalma and excellent screenplay by Oliver Stone makes this film stand out above the ordinary.<br /><br />It's all about drug money and the cocaine trade.  There's a lot of violence.  People get murdered in horrible ways although we don't see gushing wounds as we might see in a more recently-released film.  There are opulent riches and lavish mansions.  There are two beautiful women.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays the girlfriend of a mob boss who Tony eventually eliminates.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantino is cast as Tony's sister, who he tries to keep innocent.  The film is exciting and fast paced.  And while we never really \\"like\\" Tony Montana, there is a streak of greed and evil in him that everyone can understand.  Al Pacino plays his role so well that while we are busy hating him we still have some empathy for him.<br /><br />This is a classic film and I definitely recommend it.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|i have to give this 5 because it's the best metal CD since the last Exodus CD (Tempo of the Damned). This CD is not as good as Violent Revolution though - i belive that one to be the best Kreator has ever put out.  They seem to have just remade VR, but it was that good.  If your a fan of old-school Metal this is as good as it gets.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|This recent film is a thriller.  But there is something slightly different about this one.  There's a good attempt at character development.<br /><br />Jamie Fox is cast as an ordinary cabdriver.  But very quickly we see he is highly intelligent as he develops a relationship with Jada Pinkett Smith, a hard-working prosecutor who just happens to get in his cab.  It's obvious that she's a person who he'd like to see again and is delighted when she leaves him her card.<br /><br />All seems very sweet and normal and then things suddenly change.  That's when Tom Cruise, cast as a sophisticated hit man, gets into the cab.  In a very short time the cabbie is exposed to murder and violence.  Tom Cruise keeps him a virtual prisoner.  He forces the cabdriver to drive him around when he commits murders.  But every time that Jamie Fox tries to flee, there is another twist to the story.<br /><br />O.K. - the plot was silly.  I even dozed off a couple of times and it didn't matter that I missed a few details.  But I did keep watching to the inevitable conclusion.<br /><br />This is not a great film but it is entertaining.  And I was impressed by the quality of Jamie Fox's performance.
B0000073I5|5.0|Ok, If you are a Mechanics fan then I respect your love of the band but they don't do it for me. This album is very good and I give it 5 stars for a solo outing. If it were a genesis album then it would get 3 or 4. If you like AND THEN THERE WERE THREE and DUKE you should like this. Very acoustic though. I like this and the first mechanics album. Didn't like Mikes follow up to this, ACTING VERY STRANGE.  I also like Banks album A CURIOUS FEELING. Each members solo effort was very good. That applies to Gabriel, Collins, Phillips, Hackett, Banks and Rutherford.<br /><br />Enjoy
B00000IQC8|4.0|You wake up and become part of the daily grind again.  You take your place at the convenience store where anything can happen and tends to.  A microcosm of life as it is. <br /> <br />That is what Clerks is.  When Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) has to come in to watch the store on his day off, he knows his life is on a bad track.  However, in the span of a work day Dante and the other eclectic patrons, friends, ex's, groupies, and fellow clerks experience almost all of the ups and downs that life has to offer. <br /> <br />Kevin Smith successfully placed the everyday convenient store in the social conscious with this film as a place of all kinds of emotions.  He accomplishes this with ruggedness, which is equally opposed by wit.  You feel for the characters, and you'll laugh at the humor, but mainly it is a simple story of life boiled down to a clerk's job. <br /> <br />A highly enjoyable film, Clerks is filled with creativity (shot all in black and white) and just entertainment that most people will love.  Definitely worth a view.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|the best of 2004, one of the best ever.
B000005GW2|5.0|As the title says, this is Chet Baker Sings, so if you're looking for his instrumental work, this isn't it.  It's a tired cliche I know, but you either love or hate Baker's singing voice.  I happen to love it, but if you've never heard him sing, this guy was no Louis Armstrong!  Baker's fragile, soft voice often sounded just on the edge of losing the tune entirely.  This might sound horrible if you've never heard him, but I think it lends a uniqely emotional edge to this collection of standards.  You have to hear it to make up your mind.  The closest comparison I can think of is a more subdued Morrissey of all people. Singing jazz.<br /><br />Pacific Jazz puts together two recordings, from 1954 & 1956 to form this compilation, together with a surprisingly good sound for such old recordings.  Baker takes you on a tour through the Great American Songbook decades before Rod Stewart thought of it, with his unique vocals and trumpet punctuation.  The small combos led on both sessions by Russ Freeman pretty much stay in the background and let Baker do his thing.<br /><br />One factor I take into giving stars is \\"playability,\\" which is simply how often I play something.  This CD gets pulled out a lot so I'm giving it 5 stars.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|I'm a HUGE Luc Besson fan, so I couldn't wait for this DVD to come out.  And I think the new Extras on this DVD are very cool -although not quite what you might expect for a Leon DVD.  There's a full length conversation with Natalie Portman in which she talks about making the movie, in detail, how her parents were against it at first, what conditions they made for her to make the movie, etc.  Then there's a companion documentary with Jean Reno -- in which you get to hear about his growing up in Casablanca, how he got into acting, his relationship with Besson.  The piece really has the feel of an in-depth, intimate conversation with this enigmatic star -- and is beautifully shot.  This piece also includes some rare photos of the star - including childhood shots of him as a little boy in Casablanca.  Any fan of Reno or Portman will love this DVD.  The real big feature is called the Ten Year Retrospective - where you get to meet many cast and crew members (Ellen Greene, the DP, the Fat Man, Michael Badalucco, the Costume Designer, editor Sylvie Landra) - shot all over the world - the Producer stands in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Michael Badalluco stands in front of the Statue of Liberty, the editor sits in a beautiful cadillac outside a hollywood studio - and they each share their very best stories about making the movie (including what REALLY happened at a not-very-successful test screening during which the audience laughed).  Lot's of really good inside scoops here. (Including a rare appearance by French actress Maiwenn, who claims that she was 12 when she met Besson and 15 when she fell in love with him - \\"so in a way, this is my story\\" she says.  The show ends with an incredible shot of the cast celebrating Natalie Portmans very final shot and the cast dumping huge amounts of confetti on her in the middle of the shot.  It's also revealed just how they did the movie's amazing \\"rocket shot\\" in the climactic final scene.  All in all, very rewarding - 3 reallyinteresting and engaging pieces.  (Oh - and there's an interesting trivia track too).
B0000X2EOW|4.0|I used to watch this movie on The Disney Channel alot!I loved it so much but for some odd reason my mom never wanted me to watch it.I will never know.I recently bought it and it wasn't as good as it used to be but I still like it.I think Jennifer Connelly is an amazing actress.I think anyone should buy this movie.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Growing up as a kid on Ft Sam Houston, TX, during the sixties and seventies, I was so enthralled with soldiers and war and guns.  I remember the nightly news with Walter Cronkite, always with casualty figures and reports from the front.<br />What I didn't realize at the time, what I was shielded from, were the number of casualties stuffed in the Brook Army hospital that we drove by every day.  All I saw was a beautiful, big brick building; it was innocuous.  The Fog of War brought back those insanely wonderful memories.<br />Watching the Fog of War is like inviting RSMcN to your living room to hear his side of the story.  Like him, or revile him, this documentary is candidly enigmatic.  At times, you take what he has to say at face value.  At others, he reminds you, using one of his lessons, that what is said and what is heard may not necessarily be true.  He makes no apologies.  He simply states, \\"Any military commander will tell you that they have made mistakes.  It's the Fog of War.\\"<br />Do not miss the Special Features section; his memory of his comments to a protester at the World Bank is priceless.<br />What you should know...<br />[as a veteran of both the first and second American Gulf Wars, as well as the Balkan wars of the 90s, i have to admit i'm biased; war sucks, and i'm a sucker for people who admit that war sucks.  knowing this, you should also know that i admire rummy, as he is RSMcN if RSMcN were SECDEF today.  If you revile rummy, watch this documentary if only to study your enemy.]
B00005JNJ7|5.0|This movie showcased the best of Parker and Stones song writing and satire skills. They continue to redicule liberals and their commitment to anti american ideals with the wonderful Alec Baldwin and F.A.G.(Film Actors Guild). Of course the puppet action scenes(and love scene)are performed in that unique style we are all familar with anyone who needs a laugh must see this movie. Its a must have for your DVD collection also.
B00005JMEW|2.0|First off, I do realize that this is simply entertainment, but my gut reaction to the rampant violence and gore was repulsion.  The glorification and \\"coolness\\" of vengeance and killing is disturbing, to say the least.  There is already too much vengeange-fueled terrorism and violence going on in the real world; as a result, I was unable to celebrate with Thurman's character as she systematically dispatched her foes. <br /> <br />I enjoy watching martial art movies, such as \\"Hero\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" because the carefully crafted fight sequences help to propel and illustrate the well written story.  That was not the case with \\"Kill Bill\\", where the fighting was the major focus, and the story was secondary.  What was the relationship between the sword maker Hattori and his disgruntled apprentice?  How did the bride (Thurman) achieve her level of fighting expertise?  These are but a few of the things that could have helped with the plot and character development. <br /> <br />I agree with the other reviewers who expressed surprise at the number of rave reviews by professional critics.  Tarantino may be paying homage to his favorite directors, but I still can't understand how he has become so well respected and revered. <br /> <br />One last thing:  for those of you who know who Uma Thurman's father is, I wonder what he think's of his daughter's choice of acting roles, especially in the \\"Kill Bill\\" series. <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|2.0|After \\"ATYCLB\\" and now this new disc I'm convinced there are two different types of U2 fans.  There are those who came to U2 from a punk/alternative/experimental camp... the people who still want to hear new bands today like Franz, Interpol, Secret Machines, etc.  Then there are those U2 fans who got into them by hearing their songs on Top 40 and Classic Rock radio.  People who are generally satisfied with anything spoon fed to them. <br />I can see no other way how it's possible any U2 fan who got into them for their intensity, fire and creativity can honestly care about this music.  I don't know what is more depressing, so many fans fawning over milked-over mediocrity or actually hearing the guys in the band talk so strongly of this work (truly, it is WORK listening as well).   I never dreamed I'd see REM and U2 turn into today's Rolling Stones. <br />
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Will Ferrell's performance in \\"Elf\\" carries the entire movie.  Zooey Deschanel is wonderfully cute and likeable as Buddy's love interest Jovie, but Ferrell's portrayal of the \\"fish out of water\\" elf in NYC tops all others; he is charming, endearing, and utterly hilarious.  He succeeds with a wide-eyed and tactless innocence that appeals to both young viewers and cynical adults.  The carefully chosen soundtrack helps to enhance the film's upbeat mood. <br /> <br />A five star rating for a Christmas movie is for classics only.  \\"Elf\\" deserves four and perhaps a near-classic rating.  Highly recommended.
B0000E2FLC|2.0|There seems to be some heated debate as to whether this DVD is actually \\"live\\" or not. Apparently if you question this show's authenticity, the AC/DC sunshine pumpers will go ballistic about it. Well, to them I say this: go listen to the original VHS version, then listen to the DVD version again, THEN get back to me...if you still say there's no doctoring to be found, then please call me & let me know what color the sky is in your world. Few complaints about the video quality (it DOES occasionally have an overabundance of camera angles, but it's not as bad as the Stiff Upper Lip DVD IMO), but the audio overdubs irk me too much to rate this 4 or 5 stars...I mean, I understand overdubs are inevitable on a typical concert release, but no one called off the dogs on this one. Y'know, I just finished watching this DVD along with the Stiff Upper Lip DVD, and I realized that if the camerawork of the Donnington vid was used for the SUL vid, we'd probably have a live AC/DC release for the ages...but I digress slightly. Anyway, I suppose it wouldn't kill you if you bought this DVD, because it's not like it's terrible or anything (it IS AC/DC, after all), but diehards be warned: what you're seeing is not necessarily what you're getting. 2.5 stars.
B000001ELP|4.0|Even though I did not like (Music From) The Elder when it came out in 1981, time and age have allowed me to appreciate this chapter in Kisstory.  A solid effort.  Different and destined to become a classic over time.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I found this version of the Illiad, on which the credits say it was \\"based\\", to be appropriately sober and spare; light on the soap-opera tender moments and energetic, panoramic and to the point on the battle scenes.  It is also unique in that Pitt accomplishes a believeable rendering of the god/man Achilles, giving a Hamlet quality to Achilles that I found interesting. Pitt convincingly portrays the character's awakening to his destiny in parallel to his awakening to his humanity.   <br /> <br />The acting and directing are done with economy, aided by an outstanding performance by Peter O'Toole.  The story proceeds on its own steam, does not get sidetracked by trying to be historically accurate, and the action seldom lags.  Bana gives an excellent and understated performance as Hector.  You can feel his stomach churn when his sound judgment is ignored due to pernicious influence of the court soothsayers over his father Priam [O'Toole].   <br /> <br />One obvious knock-off was the close resemblance of the Troy's soundtrack to the Gladiator soundtrack. Close your eyes and you expect to see Russell Crowe when you open them. <br /> <br />The casting of Helen was weak. The woman whose face launched a thousand ships should have had a more commanding and sensual screen presence.  <br /> <br />All in all, I found it entertaining, with a resonant theme.  Not quite 5 stars, but better than 4.
B000002KIT|5.0|This album is a classic, love the twin lead guitars!!!!
B000268QB2|4.0|Sadly todays music industry is one of PR hype, smoke and mirrors, Style and no content, beautiful people with no soul,wannabe's who seek fame rather than the perfect song, and people who make music just to be cool. <br /> <br />Gladly keane is none of the above, just a really talented new group who have made an album that will stand the test of time, and this coming from a person who wouldn't normally give this type of music a second glance. <br /> <br />These guys are superb, and their debut album \\"Hopes and fears\\" will stand the test of time, and cement them in th hearts of any real music fan who listens without prejudice. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B000002J09|5.0|Before I start, the last review says Limp Bizkit is a better guitarist. First whoever that was isn't very smart considering they are a band and not one person. And second, Zeppelin and Limp Bizkit can't even be put in the rap-metal wannabe category. They wouldn't even be there without Led Zeppelin. Anyway, back on track, This is considered to be their best recording ever released. I think there are too many good recordings to put one out on top, but if someone wanted to hear the best of Led Zeppelin who's never heard them before, I would most likely play this. With the classics you can't go one day without hearing on the radio like \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Rock and Roll\\", and \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", to the underrated songs on the recording such as \\"When the Levee Breaks\\", \\"Goin To California\\", and \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", there isn't one song that isn't a classic. Everyone loves Stairway To Heaven, but I can't stand the song personally, neither can Robert Plant, as he wouldn't sing it anymore in the later days. But it's fun to play the song backwards and hear the satanic messages. This is a must own on cd, and vinyl!!!!
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|\\"Troy\\" is pure entertainment. Enjoy this DVD in widescreen hi-definition format. Put yourself back in the days of the Greek Empire. Greek Gods, Kings, Queens and Princes ruled.  The motto was \\"Conquer or be conquered.\\" Fierce battles rein supreme. Natural born fighters killed face to face.<br /><br />  Paris (Orlando Bloom) convinces Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger) to leave her husband King of Sparta Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) and go back to Troy secretly. The overzealous Greek King Agamemnon uses his brothers vice as a reason for an all out war against the Trojans. All kings are summoned to join the King of Greece to conquer Troy.  Priam (Peter O'Toole) and Prince Hector (Eric Bana) must decide to protect their city or give back Helen.<br /><br />This movie follows King Achilles (Brad Pitt) who wants to go down in history as the greatest fighter in the world. Achilles contemplates fighting for the Greek King Agamemnon. Achilles detests King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) for his leadership. After convincing from his friend, King Odysseus (Sean Bean) Achilles agrees to fight the Trojans.  With that much tension in the air, I was waiting for Achilles to take down King Agamemnon at any time.<br /><br /> The movie flows well for the two-hour length. As a note, I would like to see how Achilles became such a great fighter. And how Paris and Helen got together in the first place.<br /><br />  Movies will try to entertain the audience for two hours.  Hollywood \\"Epic\\" is always associated with Hollywood. Key word is Hollywood. Hollywood will always give itself first billing to MAKE money. Money is a must. As for the \\"Based on\\" disclaimer, lawyers require that so know one gets sued.

B000002JSP|4.0|I only have this recording on vinyl so I don't know if the quality is the same on the cd. This recording takes a slower, synth based, sort of depressing feel. From synth based but still rocking songs like \\"All Of My Love\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" can't dissapoint any zeppelin fan. It was the closing to the Zeppelin reign, Jimmy Page didn't want to record much anymore because of his health, and then JPJ took over the helm. I play bass guitar, and JPJ is a god who every bass player recognizes, and even though there was more synth than bass to be found, it's safe to presume JPJ did better than Jimmy could do at that period in time. A must have for all Zeppelin fans.
0312995423|2.0|Dan Browns is noted for his well-researched, intelligent and believable books. This appears to be none of those things. I'm not a nuclear physicist, but I can remember enough from school to know that Angels and Demons is basically plausible. Similar comments apply to his other books, but upon getting this one, in an area of which I have a degree and career, I nearly couldn't read it. <br /> <br />Even allowing for the technical inaccuracies (there are simply too many to list but lets put it this way, computers don't have shields), the predictable plot, stereotyped characters (evil deputy director, poor little rich girl rebel, gorgeous intelligent female lead..) are badly developed and there is sense of identity with any of them. The story itself is too full of magic occurrences (just happening to spot the one person out of several thousand who he needs to find, managing to somehow dodge out of the way of the bullet at the last second) it all feels very contrived - if you've seen \\"Under Siege 2\\", you'll know what it's like. <br /> <br />I can't stress enough how disappointed with this novel I was - if you were expecting anything like the calibre of his other novels, you would be to. Think straight to video and you won't be far off the level of this book.
B000002J03|5.0|This was my first LZ recording I ever got my hands on, and it is my favorite. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Living Loving Maid\\", \\"Ramble on\\", \\"Moby Dick\\", and the odd hard rocking \\"Bring It On Home\\" combine hard rock with Plant's blusey style singing and shouting in a perfect form. This can arguably be the best recording besides LZ IV/ZoSo. Moby dick, a 5 min song with more than half of it being a drum solo, that not one drummer plays part of in their solos, shows how much power this drumming god has. There is no better drummer ever to live. The band is like the reconing of the gods. Every one of them is a god and no one is better at the instrument that each of them plays, especially Plant's singing. A must buy!
B000022TSW|4.0|Wathching \\"Southpark, BL&U\\" now, its almost hard to believe this movie was made before September 11.  Consider just a few of the events in this movie with their parallels in the real world post 911. <br /> <br />An offensive movie about Terrence and Phillip sends parents and moral conservatives into a censorship frenzy...Janet Jackson's exposed breast during the 2004 SB halftime show sends parents and moral conservatives into a censorship frenzy. <br /> <br />The Canadians bomb \\"the Baldwins\\", which leads to both an international war and a crackdown on civil liberties...Islamic fundamentalists bomb the WTC, which leads to both an international war and a crackdown on civil liberties. <br /> <br />Blame Canada...blame the French. <br /> <br />Canadians are put in internment camps...Arabs and Muslims are put in Guantonimo Bay and Abu Gharaib prison. <br /> <br />This was a brilliant film, if for no other reason, because Trey Parker and Matt Stone knew us as a people better than we knew ourselves, and this movie exposes the ugly monster that was lurking just below the surface, waiting for an excuse to come out.
B00030590I|5.0|Hero. Its a masterpiece. Awesome. Bigger than Gladiator (one of my all time favorite). Spectacular than crouching tiger hidden dragon. A great story. The cinematography is Mindboggling ! Must see. I also liked the extra DVD features. Interview with zhang zimou, jet li, zhang ziyi, donn yen, tony leung and maggie cheung makes it a wonderful collector's item. <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I bought the DVD without seeing the movie, because of the reviews I had heard about the film being one of the funniest ever made.  After watching it once, I was a little scared.  Yes, it made me laugh, but by no means did my stomach hurt from hours of doubled over laughter.  The next day I watched it again, and found myself chuckling, while rewinding parts to watch them over again.  After the third time viewing the film, I was convinced.  This is the funniest movie to hit DVD in a very long time.  Don't analyse it too much, empty your brain, sit back and enjoy.  It will definatly creep up on you, before you know it, your hooked.
B0002B15WE|5.0|It is Merry Christmas in Los Angeles.  New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) is visiting his wife where she works in the Nakatomi Building in an attempt to resolve their marital issues.  John is apparently the only one paying attention when a group of men take over the whole building and hold a large group of people hostage, including John's wife Holly Gennero McClane (Bonnie Bedelia).  Being an intelligent take action kind of guy, John immediately sets out to try and see if he can do something.  He also quickly realizes that he is outgunned and outnumbered.<br /><br />John does something you rarely see in action films; he calls for help.  However, the police he calls with a radio stolen from the bad guys suspect he could be a terrorist or kidnapper, as they have described the men in the building.  John is really struggling to get any support as the authorities tell him they have everything under control and that he should stay in a safe place while they handle the situation.<br /><br />Several things happen to make us realize the authorities are far from having the situation under control.  The police send in an armored vehicle which the suspected terrorists blow up with an anti-tank missile.  The FBI arrives to take charge and follow their standard playbook in dealing with the terrorists, which also turns out to be another mistake.  A helicopter is sent in with a SWAT team and it too is neatly dispatched.  The \\"authorities\\" come across as bumbling and ineffective.<br /><br />John realizes that the authorities have little such and of course he has already decided to take action himself.  However, John is no iron man Chuck Norris.  John gets cut-up, blown-up, banged-up and is continually on the run from the terrorists.  John does get lucky more than once, but there is some plausibility in his luck.  John also gets unlucky more than once.  John struggles to make headway with the terrorists as he is typically outgunned, but he keeps his head and manages to stay alive, which in this movie turns out to be really difficult.<br /><br />Bruce Willis does an outstanding job as vulnerable hero John McClane.  John is far from being a superman, making numerous mistakes that get him hurt and cause significant damage to the building.  He is very human, as is revealed throughout the course of the building.  He often does not know what to do next, and he does get scared.  His type of hero is much more real than the stoic iron man often depicted in movies of this type.  He has real life problems, including a wife from whom he is separated and children.<br /><br />The supporting cast is remarkable.  Alan Rickman plays Hans Gruber, the leader of the bad guys.  Hans is borderline psychotic and has everything meticulously planned out, except for the intervention of John McClane.  When Hans threatens Holly, who ultimately takes a leadership role amongst the hostages - no shrinking wallflower she, John gets really angry, which of course is one of John's motivations for dealing firmly with the terrorists.  Reginald VelJohnson plays Los Angeles cop Sgt. Al Powell, another down-to-earth family man who believes what John says and supports him even when his boss and the FBI do not.  While there are a few moments when the interaction between John and Al gets a bit maudlin, the pairing is effective.<br /><br />William Atherton plays Richard Thornburg, a caricature of a tabloid journalist of the type we all like to hate, and we quickly come to dislike Richard Thornburg.  Richard is being set up for a rather predictable and enjoyable scene near the end of the movie.<br /><br />Action movies have certain characteristics that often make them predictable.  We know that the bad guys are really bad.  We know that the authorities are ineffective for one of a host of reasons.  We know that there will be one man who overcomes the odds to defeat the bad guys.  This one man seems bullet-proof and all-knowing as he avoids getting killed.  This man is generally unemotional except to the innocent.  Bruce Willis helped to redefine the hero of action movies as someone who meets none of these requirements.<br /><br />While Bruce Willis was creating a vulnerable hero we are entertained by a well-plotted movie that has a number of surprises, including why the terrorists are in the building and how they plan to escape.  I was entranced as much by the mysteries in this movie as by the action.  This movie is a winner for the combination of action, intelligent plot, and character development.  Try \\"Die Hard\\" as an alternative to mindless action movies where the main character never does wrong, never gets hurt, and has way too much ammunition.generally unemotional except to the innocent.

0385336942|5.0|Through the twists and turns of the Alaskan tundra-I honestly didn't know where this book was leading me until the last moment.  It was a brilliant story about love, war, and the bargains we make with ourselves and others to survive life's tragedies and travails.  I found it an especially poignant and engaging work but what distinguishes it as literature and not just another Oprah's book club selection (no offense) is that the it truly resonates and stays with you.  The character development is subtle and well crafted.   While I didn't appreciate the varied tempo of the plot while reading it, in retrospect, it adds an additional depth and timbre to the book I had missed at first read.  I picked up the book on a lark at an airport but am now planning on hosting a book club in an effort to glean new insights and further explore the many layers of this debut novel.  But I would have to say that the most moving aspect of this book is the enduring message of pragmatic optimism it espouses which is so hard to find in modern literature.  In the interweaving of so many tragic stories and lives broken by war and circumstance, the author magically communicates a message of hope and peace which is a precious treasure in times such as these.  I am dying to discuss this book at length with friends and would highly recommend it to anyone.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|The original theatrical cut of Daredevil comes across as exactly what people have come to dislike about comic book movies. Much of the plot and character development is sacrificed to further box office revenues, leaving much of the intrigue that drew comic fans to the characters to begin with as nothing more than subtle inference. Thankfully, the DVD format has the cure for this illness.<br /><br />In the Director's Cut of Daredevil, we not only get the action and special effects work that everyone's come to expect from movies based on comic book properties, we also get genuine characters and a more engaging storyline. The new subplot not only explains more about the final downfall of the Kingpin, it also gives greater focus on the characters that were pushed to the background in the theatrical cut of the film. The new storyline gives viewers a better view of the characters of Ben Urich and Foggy Nelson as a questionable murder trial points them to the true Kingpin of crime.<br /><br />If you're only interested in the action sequences and a nearly naked Jennifer Garner love scene, this might not be for you. However, if you are a fan of the comics (or just a fan of good storytelling) and felt a bit cheated by the theatrical cut, you should check this version out. If this cut of the film had been the original release, I firmly believe that it would have received as much praise as the original X-Men movie.
B00005A0N5|5.0|The reviews I saw, prior to actually hearing this, led me to expect a variant of \\"Lacuna Coil\\" or \\"The Gathering\\", but my first impression, on actually hearing this, was more of \\"Dream Theatre\\".  It has a similar high energy, almost relentless, drive to it along with same level of musical sophistication.  <br /> <br />To me, \\"Nightwish\\" is actually more accessible, easier to get into; they are very disciplined in terms of arrangments and in creating memorable melodic themes.  Another difference is the level of integration between orchestral/operatic elements and metal; I don't think I've ever heard anyone mesh these together as well as \\"Nightwish\\" has on this release.  It's not just the vocals; the keyboards, the string arrangments, the drums - everything just blends together seamlessly - like it was all meant to be together. <br /> <br />As many have noted, Tarja's  vocals are just heavenly; when the harmonies kick in its a sublime experience.  I literally sat there, jaw dropping, thinking  \\"I just can't believe what I'm hearing\\"  I've never cared much for operatic style vocals, but it really woks here.  Maybe is the rythymic deive of the music, maybe its the restraint Tarja applies...whatever the reason I can.t get enough. <br /> <br />Every song is great, I can't pick favorites, \\"Oceanborn\\" is solid startt to finish.  Best of all, it keeps its integrity whether the song is laid back on slow or lights out blazing.  No dumbing down or lowest common denominator here. <br /> <br />Having said all of that, I don't think \\"Oceanborn\\" is perfect.   I thought the male \\"doom voice\\" vocals wer kind of cheesy, the lyrics can get pretty awkward, and there were a couple of other minor things which could have been improved.  Your results may vary; in any case these don't detract too much from the overall impact of \\"Oceanborn\\".  I should also mention that, soundwise, I found this CD to be excessively bright.  There's considerable sibilance in the vocal recording and there seemsto be a lot of nasty high frequency content.  It dosen't affect the clarity of the production but I found my ears ringing very quickly with this one.  What?, turn it down?, no way....although it has seemingly improved over time (or I've gotten deafer in that area). <br /> <br />At any rate, I'm bummed that I'm only discovering this six years after it's release.  On the other hand, I've just ordered four more \\"Nightwish? CDs, so maybe that's not such a bad thing after all.
0316172324|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell turns in a rare achievement: a clear, coherent book about a concept in science that isn't all too well defined, which draws from stories and examples that at first seem unrelated. In other words, a new synthesis, instead of another book on \\"the story of _____(fill in the blank with your favorite scientific theory)\\". \\"The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\\": it sounds like anathema to practitioners of careful, methodical science. Yet Gladwell presents a strong argument for the potency of thin-slicing and the rich, nimble workings of cognition that lie below our conscious level of experience.  <br /> <br />In this book we get to meet policemen in the heat of a chase, couples who seem happy but are actually, almost imperceptibly, frayed, a singer named Kenna, speed daters, and a rogue commander. The book itself is something of a \\"blink\\"--a light read, leaving me wishing he had included more detail about the concepts he was presenting. Lots of fun, however. It's certainly a fresh entry in the science section of the bookstore. I haven't finished reading his first book, 'The Tipping Point', but I think 'Blink' is much better.

B00004BZ16|3.0|Sandanista, the point where arguably the Clash fell off the wagon. For a band that had started partly because of loathing for stadium rock dinosaur bands that dominated in the mid to late seventies its ironic that they themselves became indulgent by this their fourth album. Any traces of 'punk' that had remained on London Calling are well and truly gone on Sandanista. The myriad of styles employed on this album is usually its most talked about feature, but are ultimately its downfall. The reggae and dub tracks never really work (for all their admiration of these styles the Clash were in truth terrible at them). Even if you edit out the 'bad' songs (often discussed between fans) the results would be an unfocused album which to be honest even at its best lacked a top ten or even twenty great Clash song.  <br /> <br /> <br />Sure Charlie Don't Surf, Police On My Back, Hitsville Hits UK, Up In Heaven (Not Only Here) and a few others a good songs, but there's no Janie Jones, Safe European Home, London Calling, Straight To Hell or even This IS England among them. There is also a definite 'new wave' feel about the album, not it a good sense either, but a poor production and watered down punk feel.  And with the miniority good songs scattered throughout the 36 tracks its makes for an annoying listen. The really sad part is, Strummer and Jones were better than this, before and after, we know that. Even after their prime when the band had split they were putting out some great music (more so for Strummer than Jones). Its shame that this album wasn't great give that they were well capable of making it so.
0767830555|3.0|First let me say that this  is a good movie. Good, not great. I am a big Deniro fan, so I thought I should check this movie out. Its kind of like SCARFACE in the way that everybody says you HAVE to see it. So I was expecting a lot more than I got. Its a pretty good movie all the way up until the ridiculous ending. The blood looks like ketchup! I can't help but compare it to SCARFACE which had more blood and gore, but was believable. The ending of this movie just wasn't good enough for me. The acting was good all around. I almost didn't recognize Jodi Foster as the young prostitute. My point is that even if a movie sucks the ending can still save it, but this movie was good until the ending which really annoys me. Anyway, if you are a Deniro fan, then I guess you should check it out.
B0006399FS|4.0|Well, as usual with any new U2 release, half the fans say the album stinks because it isn't as good as \\"The Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Achtung Baby\\", while the other half will continue to hail U2 as the greatest band in the world.  I am part of the latter half.  Fans complain about U2 not experimenting enough on the new album, while others are thanking the heavens for U2 reverting to a more \\"classic\\" U2 sound.  Everyone seems to want either more of the classic \\"Joshua Tree\\" sound or more of the \\"Achtung Baby\\" experimentation phase.  Geez.  Get over it. Quit living in 1987/1991.  These guys made great music then, and still do today.  It's been 15+ years since then, and people still take the time to write \\"ONE STAR!! IT IS NOT JOSHUA TREE!!!\\"    <br />    This album has grown on me more slowly than \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", but is still a great album.  Who knows, given enough time, I might even wind up liking this one better. \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" is one of my favorite U2 tracks ever. \\"A Man and A Woman\\" is an upbeat romantic song that I also found enjoyable.  For those of you that like the deep, slow U2 songs, there's \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\".  Basically, every song is good.  \\"Vertigo\\" although very rocking and receiving heavy radio play, is probably the weakest song from a lyrical perspective.  \\"All Because of You\\" is probably the best guitar driven song on the album, but it was actually my least favorite song at first. Generally, the lyrics on this album are good, usually great, and never \\"bad\\".  This album seems well thought out, and the lyrics, although occassionally fun and/or laid back, are never \\"crap\\" as some reviewers on amazon would have you believe. <br />     Yet again, when you've written a songs like \\"One\\", \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\" and \\"With Or Without You\\" people tend to call anything less than a complete masterpiece a piece of junk.  On a songwriting level, like their albums, new U2 songs are continously in the shadow of their past work.  For being in a rock band since the late 1970's, the boys are doing a darn good job of keeping their legacy of good music alive and well, with each album adding to their already great catalog.   <br />     If the album has a flaw, I think it likes in that the album isn't as immediately as accessable as \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" or some of their older albums.  This album takes time to grow on you.  If you can handle that, then you'll love the album.  <br />--After having the album for 2 months, I still prefer \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", but like I said, that might change given enough time.   <br />--This is great music.  Quite hoping for a re-hash of \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Achtung Baby\\" and get with the program. Quit living in 1987/1991.   <br />
B000002B7U|3.0|The Ultimate Sin, while mostly dismissed by the Ozzy camp with the exception of Shot In the Dark, which became the sole setlist staple in subsequent years...is an unfairly dismissed album. <br /> <br />To fairly judge the album, one must separate the actual songs from the production, which does indeed drag the album down.  Ron Nevison has no business on any Ozzy album (or KISS for that matter.)  It is  primarily the production that drags the album down, not the actual songs.  Fault lies with Ron Nevison and Capitol for pushing him as their choice of a producer upon Ozzy. <br />Put the production aside and judge the songs on their own merit, with some imagination of how they would have sounded with a proper producer.  One must also take into account the souring relations between Ozzy and guitarist Jake E Lee as a factor in affecting Ozzy's view of the album.  I believe the other factor that keeps this album/period as one that Ozzy would sooner forget is the image associated with it...big poofy blond hair with sparkly costumes best worn by Liberace.   <br /> <br />The album's opening and title track, The Ultimate Sin, is nothing to scoff at.  It features excellent lyrics put to a heavy groove...in fact, the song is an easy example of how the production got in the way of an otherwise worthy track, which can immediately instill a sense of frustration into the listener.  The song itself would not be out of place on Diary of a Madman or Blizzard of Ozz.   <br /> <br />Secret Loser follows suit with the same attributes....both tracks would be candidates as live set staples had they been handled correctly.   <br /> <br />Never Know Why is the first track to bring up another issue with  the album besides the production....poor lyrics.  Actually, with proper production and the dropping of the \\"We Rock\\" chorus...it would be improved upon.   <br /> <br />Thank God For the Bomb falls right in line with The Ultimate Sin  and Secret Loser.  The only real problem with the track isagain...the production.  It is the first track to bring up the theme of nuclear war on the album.  It's a fast paced rocker with thoughtful lyrics. <br /> <br />I consider Never to be quite generic and tend to skip it.  It does have it's moments...but not enough to hold me. <br /> <br />Lightening Strikes was the 3rd single released from the album.  It is a prime example of how a horrid chorus drags down an otherwise great song.  The hard hitting main guitar riff had plenty of potential to go down as one of the better known Ozzy classics.  Improved lyrical content would have taken this one much further.   <br /> <br />If there is one track that makes the overlooking of this album tragic, I'm going to give that honor to Killer of Giants.  As the title alone indicates....it features very well done lyrics and an excellent arrangement.  The mellow yet quitely edgy opening guitar appregios set the tone...bringing to mind images of the Earth in all it's beauty.  When Ozzy's voice first enters...it continues the mellow mood...but after singing the line \\"if the button is pushed there'll be nowhere to run\\" the mood/music effectively yet subtlely shifts to one of dread, bringing to mind images of scorched earth..building up to an aggressive chorus.  <br /> <br />Fool Like You is another generic rocker that I tend to skip.   <br /> <br />The final track Shot In The Dark is well known enough to not need any going into.  It does bear noting Ozzy was particuarly proud of the live performance of the song as found on the EP \\"Just Say Ozzy\\" as he felt it got right what Nevison trashed.  Indeed...the EP track does do just this and serves as a prime example of how the rest of The Ultimate Sin tracks should have been recorded.   <br /> <br />Considering the outrage pertaining to the re-recording of the bass and drum tracks on Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman...perhaps it would have been more prudent to go and correct the problems inherent on The Ultimate Sin..one of Ozzy's best selling albums, rather than attempt to bury it in obscurity by avoiding re-issuing it.  Out of the Ozzy back-catalog..it is the album that would most benefit from re-mixing and re-recording the instruments..fleshing out some truly excellent material that is too easily dismissed by those unable to see past the flat, inappropriate production.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, we only have the album as originally released.  I strongly recommend those that have not been exposed to it take into account the factors I name at the start of this review that impact the album.  The contempt for the album in many of the reviews here should be read with wariness, considering most provide little supporting commentary for their opinion, especially when considering the rest of the Ozzy catalog.  No Rest For the Wicked, while sonically correcting what was wrong with the Ultimate Sin, features a much higher degree of cringe-inducing lyrics than the Ultimate Sin.  The proper balance would not be struck until 1991's No More Tears.   <br /> <br />Avoid letting the slew of negativity skew your own opinion and you'll be able to see the material for what it is...adding some truly great Ozzy material to your collection that would otherwise have gone overlooked.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot are the kind of band that can pull off a great third album, and even a second besides that. Each album has something new, something better, something worth listening to. Vol. 3, the Subliminal Verses is definitely not an exception, and, in some ways, is better than their first album. Although not every song, it seems shouting has decreased between this album and their first, which to many, is a good thing, but to those who love anger in every song, may not be. <br />Pros: Almost everything, and their singles (which are great) are probably the worst on this cd. <br />Cons: Not enough guitar(i know its heavy, but i mean GOOD guitar), sometimes I question how long their guitarists have played, and (in my opinion) the band itself sounds similar to a lot of other artists. <br /> <br />Great album.
B00000IMTF|5.0|All these descriptions deserves this incredible collection of songs manufacturated by Mr Blackmore and company,  a dreamteam that just a few times in life its possible to put together , Mr Ronnie Dio in vocals, Mr Bain In bass, Mr Carey in keyboards and the great and saddly late Mr Cozy Powell in drums (owner by the way of a Guiness record for the biggest quantity of drums played in minutes) did you knew that? and of course the guitar legend Ritchie Blackmore , who also created the most known riff in rock history (intro for Purpple s , smoke on the water) a masterpiece within this masterpiece is of course \\"stargazer\\" and the blast of \\"a ligth in the dark\\" just a couple of examples of how gooooooooooooood!!!!!! is this recording achieved in germany in the late 70s when Rainbow emerged as a Blackmores side project to Deep Purpple and despite being conceived this way this amazing band for itself became one of the greatest bands in hard rock and heavy metal, technical skills of every band member (at least for this album) are also evident you can feel amazed for Powells drums and powerfull voice of Dio and awesome guitar riffs of Mr Blackmore also keyboards that despite being then quite primitive have that unique charm of that years.  <br />a masterpiece, no doubt about it, no question <br />HM
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Technically, this is a horror movie - scary because it reflects horrific things that happen to far too many people in real life. <br />The visual representation of drugs entering the system was pretty creative but the situational pressures the characters found themselves in were thick slices of reality. <br />Personally, I could have done without the graphic sex scenes - especially Jennifer Connelly's where she participates in a very explicit \\"private party show\\" that had at least four other women on the stage with about twenty suits jeering and screaming encouragement to \\"the entertainment\\".  These happen to work for this movie and had purpose for the story line but there was room for some tasteful editing (without losing the message). <br />While many parents might not feel comfortable viewing this film with their teenager - there are valuable lessons in it for young people who all too often think they are 'bulletproof' or that 'it won't happen to them'. <br />I give it only 4 out of 5 stars because some of the imagery is vague and unnecessary and it's not really a movie you want to watch more than once. <br />
B000002AGN|5.0|Time Out marks Mr Brubeck highest point, inspiration, enthusiasm, innovation, improvisation, love for jazz music at the best level, the rigth atmosphere surelly took place in studio at the moment of recording of this modern jazz masterpiece , tracks soun very cool, full of class, sublime, a very unique moment this quartet were living during the making in sessions, percussions had some sort of contained very well directed ferocity , as well bass section and piano parts , tracks \\"like everybodys jumping\\" and of course the classic cut \\"Take five\\" also \\"Blue rondo a la turk\\" are basic pieces to understand the music of the syncopated rithm , perhaps Time Out is the most influential jazz album of all times
068987474X|3.0|If you treat your relationship life like a game, then this is a great book for you. It is fun to read, but doesn't offer much substance.One thumb marginally up. One thumb down.<br />My suggestion is to pick up a book by a pair of Canadian Authors that a friend from Vancouver recommended. Seed's Sketchy Relationship Theories. Both funny and controversial at the same time. Go Canada.
1400032717|1.0|How can so many reviewers be so wrong in praising this orginal work created by Mark Haddon, a creative writing teacher living in Oxford, England with his family?  He cleverly compartmentalizes this tale of autistic grief and joy with prime numbers from 2 to 233, food, parents, teachers, neighbors, strangers, policemen, pets, classmates, colors, sights, sounds, smells, puzzles, quizes, tests, games, maps, and perspective drawings supposedly from the perspective of a young teenage boy who writes a murder mystery story about his dog, Wellington. This work is overloaded with disgusting invective.  I should not have endorsed those positive reviews by other reviewers by recommending it to other readers.
B000002L61|4.0|Well, I have to agree in part with Carl Lentner and the Kid: Carl, Dio rules, and Sabbath was better off for his manning the barricades with his stellar tenor. Tommy Iommi, you may well note also fired Ozzy; He didn't want the competition. Oh, well.    Nevertheless, Slayer rules too. Kerry King.....what can I say about him except that he wields quite a chain saw.    Dio really overshot on his premiere offering, \\"Holy Diver.\\" It was all downhill from there. A perfect album, it would have been rare for any other act, but Dio had come a long way since his do-wop days with Ronnie Dio and the Prophets. Helming Elf, Rainbow and -- at long last -- Black Sabbath, his teeth were honed razor sharp for Dio's entry into the Pantheon of Metal Gods.    I rate this album slightly lower than \\"Holy Diver,\\" though I must say he maintained quite the standard. While listeners may have been used to his long sustain (I remember once listening to a song in which he held a note for over a minute!) he starts clipping off notes in staccato fashion on this record, most notably in \\"One Night in the City.\\" He wails on the title track, but it seems the end of one era and the beginning of another.    \\"We Rock,\\" a Diofied arena-rousing anthem opens this set, and it bears some resemblance to Quiet Riot and Twisted Sister tunes from the same era. However, these bands were nothing to sneeze at.    Fans of concept rock will not be sorry with the closing track, \\"Egypt (The Chains Are On),\\" Dio's rock operatic paean to the flight of the Jews from the land of Pharoahs and Pyramids. It is a quite fitting composition for this fallen rock god, a golden calf to succor the thirst for idolatry of his minions.    There is an answer to Dio's riddle, \\"We'll know for the first time / If we're evil or divine / We're the last in line.\\" When you get to purgatory, you'll find out!
B00002MZ4V|5.0|I have always loved John Williams' music. From the meormable Star Wars ( and Darth Vader's  theme ) to the UN-forgettable Jaws. This composer knows his music, and the album showcases it perfectly. The first disc includes mostly his popular themes :  <br /> <br />Disc 1 :  <br /> <br />Star Wars  <br />E.T.  <br />Superman  <br />Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom <br />Sugerland Express  <br />Jaws <br />Olmpic Fanfare <br />Return of the Jedi ( Luke and Princess Leia theme )  <br />The Reivers <br />The Empire strikes Back ( Darth Vader's theme )  <br />Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade <br />Empire of the Sun <br />Raiders of the lost ark  <br />Close encounters of the third kind  <br /> <br />While Disc 2, while still good doesn't contain his most popular themes :  <br /> <br />Disc 2  <br /> <br />Jurassic Park <br />Schindler's List <br />Hook <br />Seven years in Tibet  <br />JFK  <br />Stepmom <br />1941 <br />Home Alone <br />Summon the Heros <br />Far and Away  <br />Born on the Fourth of July <br />Star Wars Episode 1 : The Phantom Meance  <br /> <br />All in all, the record is fanstastic!!!! This album is a must have for any fan of John Williams' music.  <br /> <br />
B0001Z52RU|4.0|I watched this film last night after a friend saw that it was on. We put off studying for finals and indulged in a movie we had both wanted to see. I was surprised at how well I thought Ashton Kutcher played this role. I wasn't sure how this comedian would transfer into other genres. The plot twists were enough to keep me interested and the sacrifice that he made at the end of the movie made me see him as a caring person. If you can handle the stranger parts of the movie, such as child pornography, animal cruelty and an insanely violent 13 year old, then you will enjoy this movie by this pair of first time directors.
0790730960|5.0|First of all, let me begin by saying that, Michael Keaton is the one and only person that should have ever fastened the cape and cowl to his body. The clowns after him simply ruined the character and lowered true fans' expectations of the sequels. Seriously... Val Kilmer???? Batman never used the word \\"chicks\\" not ever. \\"Chicks love the car\\" Excuse me while I bring my lunch back up...Uggh.. And George Clooney??  Amazing what kind of props you get for being voted sexiest guy of the year in a couple of goofball magazines... Anyhow, \\"Returns\\" is a great master piece. The cast is simply marvelous and the acting is superb. I truly love the way the movie depicts the \\"forbidden affection/crush\\" that Batman and CatWoman share. I get chills everytime I see the part where they are at the party and they resite each others comments about a kiss under the missle toe. I think this was genius and such a very touching way for them to find out their secret identities within each other. The musical score is also exceptional as it compliments every emotion as it happens when it happens. Danny DeVito plays a great role as The Penguin. He gives the character the ability to demand respect as a true cold blooded villain. The costume is absoultely gruesome, and so efefctive alongside his penguin-ish behavior to put the personlity of the Penguin over so well. I might also mention that this was the only other installment of the four, that truly took the time and effort to establish two villains at the same time.  In my opinion, part three with Kilmer, The Riddler and Two-Face were pretty much slammed down our throats and we had to go on what we knew from the Adam West era and DC Comics to accept their repulsive criminal person. I hardly enjoyed the fourth installment which actually introduced 3 new characters in the same picture. To use Arnold as Fries might have been more respectable if he came across on a more diabolically maniacal angle. Too many jokes and modern day slang here. He turnedout to be a goof instead of a villain. Poison Ivy was a rush and so was Batgirl. They even had the nerve to cram Bane in there... If I could meet the knuckleheads that allowed these characters to be botched up the way they were.... wow.  <br />Anyhow, Keaton all the way and the only way as Batman. Period.  <br /> <br />PS: You can see the true damage done by the latter two as now, the only thing left to do with the Batman franchise is to go back and do \\"The Beginning\\" prequel along with nearly every other trilogy that has exhausted creativity and disappointed fans.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I haven't bought a Madonna album in about 15 years but heard \\"Love Profusion\\" as part of a TV commercial for some product and liked the song very much so bought this album.    The songs are touching and reflective, not what I have associated with Madonna.  No songwriter keeps writing the same type of songs their entire life and it's unfair to judge Madonna on that basis.  If you like songs that come from the writer's heart, then buy this album.

Susie's unsovled murder impacts each family member differently, but all somehow survive the pain of this unimaginable tragedy. This story was beautifully written is bound to touch the heart of the reader, providing peace and comfort to anyone grieving over a deceased loved one.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I first heard t.A.t.U like most people through their single \\"All the Things She Said\\" but after hearing \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" I was hooked! The music/beat is something I can really dance to and the lyrics aren't half bad. There've been a lot of press that the lesbian duo are putting on an act to sell records, true or not the music and lyrics are very good. Another plus is the Russian versions of some of the songs are just as good, even if you don't understand the language. Marketing ploy or not the music is good, the lyrics aren't too bad, and it's just something you can DANCE to!
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Great film.  Absorbing all the way.  Michael Mann is compelling storyteller.  Fascinating making of documentary:  Mann appears to be a perfectionist in the Kubrick mold.  Take after take, driving his actors crazy, until he gets \\"the truth\\" out of them.  Eighty five percent shot on high def video tape to better capture the nuances of LA night lights.  So I ask, if production is high tech all the way, why in heck are all of Tom Cruise's scenes in back of cab obviously not lip synched.  Looks like they didn't even try.  Puzzling and to me extremely distracting.  It was like a foreign dubbed film, except Tom wasn't even moving his lips for some of the live dialogue.  Whats up with this!!!  Otherwise 5 stars.
0316776963|4.0|I got \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" after being bombarded by mainstream and gay press as this being the new wonder boy in story telling. I expected fiction but instead got Mr. Sedaris's life rehashed with little anecdotes and humor interjected in between. Most of the stories will make you chuckle here and there, some real writing talent, but they don't even begin to touch real stories that you'll remember and reflect upon. It's just like he's sitting in a coffee shop recalling stories from his life and throwing some humor in there. Kinda pulp I'd say. One important note though: If you've never heard David Sedaris talk you've got to find some NPR interviews or something. He has a high pitched, feminine voice, that at first had me thinking he was a 70 year old Billy Corgan. Once you've heard his voice it actually makes reading the stories much more entertaining; because you've got him narrating them in your head! Decent stories, great writing style, but not much thought in there.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|I am not rating the movie, but the product.  This movie was simply amazing.  It features some of the best combination of CG and Anime I have ever seen.  The story is very deep and is truly a worthy sequel to the original.   <br /> <br />The DVD is a horrible product.  No English track and tiny, hard to read subtitles.  I did not know this was subtitled until I got it home.  I paid full price for this product and I expect way more than what I received.  I am very disappointed with this release and I will definitely be very careful about making any future purchases released by this company.   <br /> <br />Here is an idea.  Get the original awesome voice actors from the original and have them do the sequel.  I do hope they make a 3rd movie in this series. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|First off I may be a little bias when it comes to U2. I've been a huge fan for nearing a decade now and while it might take a few listens for it to sink in I always end up loving every single thing they do.  <br /> <br />With that said here comes my concise review of HTDAAB: Brilliant! First off lets cut to the chase and say that \\"Miracle Drug\\" is probably their best song since \\"With or Without You\\". It's got the passion, the lyrics, and the ... intensity that just makes you want to listen to it over and over again. Another of the greats on this album is \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\". A truly moving, inspiring song, that strikes a cord with the heart and the hope in all of us. Other great songs on the album is \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"Yahweh\\" both of which sound very much like they came from the Achtung Baby era. In CBL the chorus is really superb although the other lyrics kinda drag and don't flow is well, it's when you hit that chorus that you forget everything. Yahweh is another inspiring song that reminds a lot of \\"Kite\\" or \\"Wild Honey\\" in its format. \\"Vertigo\\" which became the first single is a catchy rock tune that's good to listen to with the windows down while you're flooring it down the highway. Unfortunately I can't seem to get into Love and Peace or Else, All Because of You, Crumbs From Your Table, or One Step Closer. All 4 seem almost like ATYCLB b-sides. Going from Miracle Drug and Vertigo to those just seems like such a jump. On the other hand the album picks back up really well with the passionate \\"Original of the Species\\".  <br /> <br />If you're new to U2 then you'll really enjoy this album. It's a mix of Achtung Baby, Pop, and All That You Can't Leave Behind. If you've been a fan since their mullet days, however, you might be disappointed in some of the new stuff.  <br /> <br />Either way it's U2 so we know it's a brilliant, passionate piece of work. <br />
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|What can one say about Michael Jackson's music. It's timeless! A legendary genius's masterpieces. <br /> <br />He is an artform himself. The songs are amazing, concert is amazing, just buy it! <br /> <br />
B00006BTCA|1.0|I saw these guys open for The Cure, and I was not impressed.  All I can remember thinking was \\"These guys have ripped some of their progressions and MELODIES directly from Bauhaus..\\"  The dude also sang in a kind of monotone for practically the WHOLE set.. which made it even more Bauhaus.  I mean, seriously.  They named their band after a police force..  What other clues do you need to figure out that they suck?
B0000025RI|5.0|The editorial review for this classic album is very out of date. Thriller has now sold 60 million copies worldwide. Buy it, listen to it and you'll know why. This is the greatest album ever made hands down. Music critics don't want to admit it, after fawning over the Beatles for so many years. But this album blows them away. CLASSIC!!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I was a little weary at first about getting this cd because it's blatantly a Bush-basher whereas I'm a big supporter of his. They are the only band so far that I can understand where they're coming from with their ranting and raving because they do it so well. The cd is so kick-ass, I haven't stopped listening to it for the longest time and I just have a blast singing along to it! There is only one song that I don't love, \\"St. Jimmy,\\" but it's still good enough to have my moving around in my car. I totally recommend it to anyone. I was never a Green Day fan until this album came out; a definite must-have for any one interested in music. There's a little bit of everything.
B00007J5VN|4.0|I wish the powers-that-be at Universal would go back and reinstate the exit music on the DVD.  That would make this DVD perfect!
B0002ZMITY|5.0|I've never seen the show once, i've just seen clips and commercials and have never been intrested in Ali G but after see'n this movie, I'm looking to buy this and the first season Dvd set. I have friends that are like me and would find this movie funny. I guess he was hitting a younger generation with this one,because i got a couple of chuckles along with outrageous laughs. If your 18-23 I recommend this movie because it connects with us 80's Babies.
B0002X314C|5.0|with the creative wordplay and soulful sounds from kanye west's protege, john legend, his album stands out from the best. his ability to catch his audience through his lyrics and his vocals will bring new audiences to appreciate r&b. such tracks that stood out were, \\"lets get lifted\\", \\"Alright\\" and \\"ordinary people\\". the album overall would be best described as harmonic filled with soul with a touch of elegance. dont miss out on this album or else you'll be cheating yourself.
B00005JMAH|2.0|If I was Rowling, I would be very upset at the cavalier manner which the director of this film treated my book. Hogwarts is no longer a cheerful place, well upkept with magic--instead it is a moldering ruin. The students go about dressed in grimy \\"muggle\\" clothes, and play their roles in a cheesy and slipshod manner. Even great actors came out looking like first year drama students in this film--and the mediocre actors looked so terrible on the screen that I kept wishing for the movie to end. Case in point--Harry's loud and unbelievable crying midway through the movie (what was the director thinking?!). How 'bout Dumbledore--now a silly old man with little depth or intellegence (forget about any feeling of hidden power like in the previous films). Major plot points in the book were overlooked (like who wrote the map, and Harry actually having a Stag shaped Patronus and why). Anyway, the film harkens back to the late '60s and '70s where very \\"artistic\\" and \\"real\\" movies were made that were full of actors mismanaged (looking terrible onscreen) and meandering butcherings of good books.
6304711883|4.0|There's not much to this DVD other than the pleasure of owning the movie to see the superior peformances of Lili Taylor, Gary Sinise and --especially-- Mel Gibson.<br /><br />As a tortured father fighting his own demons as well as a brutal kidnapper, Mel delivers his arguably best performance.  Even Rene Russ, with all her Hollywood hair, cannot detract from the genuine strength, emotion and passion he puts into his role.  Clever twists and turns defy believability at times, but you will be caught up in the drama and excitement of this captivating suspense thriller.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I hadn't heard much about this film, but still, I live in Cairo and am quite disconnected from the speed at which the Western world turns.  <br /> <br />Many years back there were rumors, I believe, of Cruise playing the lead in the film version of Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho. As it turned out, this film version has to be among the worst transitions ever made from book to screen. Though horribly disturbing, Ellis's portrayal of the serial killer, embedded within his time at the close of the 1980s and early 1990s, and particularly that time in New York City, for me, stands out as one of the most astonishing works of fiction written. I remember the monologues in the book about Whitney Houston and Phil Collins: how chilling they were set against the detailed, terrible descriptions of how the book's main character, Patrick Bateman, thought about and killed women. Collateral is, I think, in the same stream. Cruise is subtle and unrelenting. It is a great movie at the level of aesthetics (all of it taking place at night, bringing a feast of tones and images to the eyes), but also in terms of dialogue. Bateman is updated and taken to the West coast of America, and makes a living from killing. Mixed in is a powerful and curious combination of fatalism, Taoism even, and animal-like fierceness: one that draws the viewer very close to the lead character Vincent (played by Cruise), as well as Max (played brilliantly by Jamie Foxx) who ultimately resists and fights against Vincent's entire world. More than an action movie it opens all kinds of questions: questions concerning the will, concerning accidents, nerve under pressure, and the whole hidden underbelly of many of the cities in which we live. <br /> <br />Only wish the screenwriters had had the guts - like Ellis had the guts - to let the killer live in the end; for the force of the likes of Vincent, or Bateman, are constantly recurring. How many of us can really, truly say that good triumphs in this complex, unfathomable world?
185984054X|5.0|Hitchens is an absolutely confirmed atheist and lives by the credo that Orwell established for estimation of the pious: all saints must be presumed guilty until proven innocent.  Even if Hitchens were to presume that Mother Teresa were not the hypocritical fanatic that he exposes her to be in this short polemic before he began the book, his exposure of her core rotteness when dealing with the poorest of the world's poor, coupled with her permanent leniency towards most tyrannical and corrupt of the world's rich and powerful is enough to make anyone who ever had even a passing kind thought about her question their own intellectual prowess.  Hitchens deserves praise for writting what is absolutely a class A piece iconoclastic work that exposes a favorite emblem of piety as nothing more than a well polished turd, and this work shows that he has some real guts to boot.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Illmatic is a hip-hop/music classis, YOU SIMPLY CANNOT ARGUE THIS.  It's practically genre defining for rap music.  So, a re-release is more than welcome.  I don't care weather or not any bonus material was added or not, it deserves a second look and the status of being a re-release.  I am very thankful though that the bonus material is kept on a second disc, in so many other cases bonus material (good or bad) clutters the end of the original album and takes away from it as it was supposed to stand. <br /> <br />The bonus material contains several remixes and two new tracks.  The remixes are defiantly disappointing because we all know that several remixes from Illmatic were released around the time of the album, there's really no need to make new ones with a completely new sound.  In addition they're edited?!!?  What the hell were they thinking?  It's already a Parental Advisory album?  The two new tracks are solid though, \\"On The Real\\" is claimed to have rhymes written 10 years ago & \\"Star Wars\\" is produced by Marley Marl.  Since Nas has returned to his original Nasty roots these tracks are great additions and fit in well with the tone of Illmatic.  I'm honestly just satisfied with adding these two solid tracks to my Nas catalogue.  Everyone is probably angry cause we all know that they could not tried at all and done better, and this is understandable.  When there's material already available on hand, there's no excuse not putting it on here.  But give some credit to Nas for bringing the new tracks.  But still... it's freakin' Illmatic, could anything possibly make a complete album better?? <br /> <br />To be honest, if you love Illmatic you've probably already picked up the 10th Ann. Edition out of respect if nothing else.  If you already have the album, but for some reason aren't too fond of it (you're crazy, but still) you probably won't get this.  If you have never herd Illmatic or don't own it already, now's as good a time as ever.  Quit sleeping on this classic and get educated on what rap is all about... you owe it to yourself.
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|I bought this album looking for something a little different for the CD rack.  Unfortunately I dont like most of the tracks on this album although the singles are OK.  Maybe I need to listen to it a few more times to like it... but its just not something Im prepared to do - it hurts.
B00005JMUA|2.0|I have loved all of Tarantino's films with the excpetion of Kill Bill: Volume 2 which was atrocious. It was so boring in parts that I had to fast-forwarded through them so I could make it through to the end.    For starters, the pace of 'Volume 2' is extremely slow. 'Volume 2' didn't feel like a movie as much as a bunch of scenes strung together to make a second film. Some of the scenes of 'everyday things and moments' that were charming and innovative in past Tarantino films fall flat here. You can tell the editors of 'Kill Bill: Volume 2' were trying to stretch out the movie so they could have two films (it was origonally intended to be one movie) and kept in a lot of scenes/moments that would have normally been edited out.      To makes matters worse, the acting is atrocious. I overlooked the poor acting in 'Volume 1' largely because the plot and dialogue were so good. However, without those elements in the sequel, the poor acting comes to the surface. Most of the performances feel forced and some (Thurman & Carradine in particular) are plain bad. I now realize why Carradine hasn't had much of a career after KungFu and was Tarrantino's third choice to play Bill.    Finally, many of the devices that Tarantino has borrowed from other films in the past to great effect don't work here. They feel cliched and forced. In particular, the music borrowed from the Sergio Leone trilogy was out of place and the normally inventive camera shots (shoes instead of faces for example) were tiresome and felt they were being done just to be 'different' and 'cool.'    I was shocked that 'Volume 2' got primarily stellar reviews. But as a  Tarantino fan, I felt this movie showed that the makers were trying to get a few extra bucks at the expense of quality by stretching one film into two. In the past, I've enjoyed rewatching Tarantino films but I'm reselling my copy of 'Kill Bill: Volume 2' on Amazon.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|For me this was hands down the best alt/rock album that I came across in 2004.  I love every track.  Good mix of heavy rock and slow songs.  Similar to pre KidA/Amnesiac Radiohead.
B00007JMCX|4.0|David Bowie at the height of his popularity and some may argue beyond the peak of his creativity, musically had begun to turn his attention to other projects. <br /> In order to understand the metaphor represented here , one must understand Bowie's state of well being. Burned out after Ziggy , Introspective and retrospective become inter-twined. The resultant psychosis is manifest here in The Man Who Fell To Earth. <br /> Imagine a rock star having both opportunity and the means to explore his own projects and so highly thought of that no-one dare say no to you , but all you really craved through your exploration was to be understood.  <br /> People's misgivings and misunderstandings about this movie are a reflection of the criticism that Bowie in his drug fuelled career had endured to this point. Its surely no suprise then that this movie confuses, suprises , amazes and revulses us. I think the director and Bowie convey this perfectly.The compulsive obsessive behaviour , the need to repeat a formula of success and the reliance upon a substance that will keep him sane and give him perspective. All conveyed admirably here. <br />  Bowie is not the worlds best actor , this is maybe not the best picture ever made , but what we see are a glimpse into the mind of a Musical Genius exploring a side of him that could not be conveyed within the medium of audio alone. <br /> This movie is of its time and those that are aware know what DB writes of \\"Time\\" , unfortunately I cannot convey those lyrics here , but would suggest you consult Mr Bowies excellent CD back catalogue if you need a reference to them. <br /> The only other criticism that I can make is that it could have been done with a little less self indugence. The pace may not be to everyones taste either , but is certainly no different to that of Lucas' THX-1138 in that regard. <br />
B0002TT0NW|3.0|What can one really expect from a book to movie interpretation?  Well, the first two Harry Potter movies did a great job recreating Harry Potter, the third movie did not.  One of my main dislikes about the movie was that the plot and added character developement that happens in book three was, not lost, but weak.  The director seemed more interested in the glamour of film than the meat and potatoes of it.  Another thing that really got me was that the entire plot between harry and sirus was out of order.  Harry finds out half way through the year that Sirus is good, he even gets the Firebolt by then too.  Other reviews have pointed out many other disappointments invovling backstory, which I might add is very very important to the rest of the series.  One problem why this occured is because of the neglected sequencing of the film.  The relationship Harry builds with Sirus during the spring allows him to learn about that \\"back story\\" that is missing in the film.  So Alfonso pretty much dug his own grave when he excepted this script.  If they don't beef up movie 4, I don't know how they are going to complete the series.  I'm just hoping they realize that they are going to have to start making 3 hour movies or longer, especially for movie #5.
B000669GAI|5.0|This album is a classic. <br /> <br />I have all of the PJ albums and this is my favourite. It has all the very best songs from all the albums and even has songs from  the 'singles' movie soundtrack. Disc one has the energetic, hard grunge songs & disc 2 has the slow, beautiful, depressing songs. Both discs are as good as each other.I strongly reccomend this to all true Pearl Jam fans and even people who have never heard them before, If you like Soundgarden, chillis, Stone temple pilots you'll love this.
B00005JMXX|1.0|I think it is indeed the worst movie of the year, maybe of the decade. *** SPOILERS *** The main hero WALKS in north pole like conditions from Philly to Manhattan, dragging his no-use-in-the-movie companion and a sledge, chased by the cold like some monster or something and reaches Manhattan in just a day or so. The story line is better described as \\"there's no story line\\". The doc is saving his son, his son is saving his girlfriend, girlfriend is saving some strangers, a homeless man is saving a dog, mom is saving a kid, fireman is saving the mom and the only poor person who cannot be saved in the movie is the president of US who happens to have every thing technology has ever produced on his disposal. What was he doing in the office till the last moment ? He was shown to be busy on the phone ... with whom ? Weather Channel guys ? How did everyone else left and didn't think of moving the president out of the danger zone ? I mean, pick ANY part of the movie and its simply ILLOGICAL and ridicilious. Those monster waves that took over huge tankers can't move statue of liberty from its place ? COLD chasing people like some ghost ? The only way to report weather from the space is people peeking out of windows of a space station ? COME ON ... there's a limit on how idiotic it can be and this movie surpases that limit.

B0002KQNL8|3.0|This film is an okay buy if you already have the original and want more of the same...err, similar.  This sequel attempts the same gags as the first, though I felt myself at times wanting to throw on the first.  Storywise, it basically plays out like the first, almost as if to say \\"Or it could have happened this way...\\". <br /> <br />My beef isn't so much with with the movie itself, it really isn't much more than you can expect from a sequel, I had a problem with the soundtrack.  It may seem odd, but prior to viewing this movie, I never really payed much attention to the soundtrack of a film.  Let me say, I have discovered for myself that it makes a HUGE difference.  I hadn't seen this part of the film series prior to viewing this dvd, so when I read some of the other reviews complaining about the different music, I didn't think it would bother me.  Sure enough, when played with the French dubbing, the original score exists.  On the original (English) dubbing, it seems to have been replaced with a more upbeat...almost 80's disco-ish soundtrack.  Whereas the original score had a more serious, authentically 80's horror sound, this new score seems almost to parody 80's horror music. <br /> <br />I understand this film series started out to be a parody of zombie flicks, but the new soundtrack is almost unbearable.  It seems to be ripped off from an old-school Arnold flick like Commando or Raw Deal.  While it may be acceptable in an 80's action flick, it seems to take away from the magic of a cheesy 80's horror movie.  I also found it kind of lame that they cast a few of the same actors from part one in similar roles, although they do play their parts very well.  If they were going to do that, maybe they should have thrown in Linnea Quigley as well!  Then again, the movie itself is not bad.  As the title of this review states, its a decent compliment to the original.  If you can get both movies for under 25 bucks, it would be a good buy.  You may like the new music.  Either way, you might want to rent this one first.   <br /> <br />Fans of this movie prior to it's dvd release may have a bone to pick with Warner Bros. for changing the score.  If you view this movie for the first time on dvd, I would suggest that you don't listen to it on the French dubbing unless you want to torture yourself thinking about how good this dvd would have been with it's original score.  Do us a favor Warner Bros., hand off the rights to this movie to Anchor Bay or MGM.  That way, we can view this movie in all it's originality.   <br /> <br />Simply put:  If film scores don't really have much of an influence on the mood of the film you are watching, then buy this one cheap.  If you are a keen observer as I have discovered myself to become, then you may want to rent this one first.
B00005JNEI|3.0|I'm not going to claim to be the smartest person when it comes to politics, I'm not. I don't know (and neither do you, fellow reviewers) everything that is going on behind the scenes in America, so I can't really say that what is presented in Michael Moore's highly praised \\"Farhenheit 9/11\\" is %100 relevant. Afterall, as someone who considers himself to be 100 percent democrat, even I can see that this documentary is lop-sided. From the beginning, it is almost evident that Moore has a personal axe to grind with Dubbya, as displayed early on when the kind gentlemen that is our president, greets Moore with the sentiments \\"Get a real job.\\" But then again, who doesn't have a problem with Bush these days? I have to say, on a personal level, what has happened to America over the past four years, and some of the values Bush stands for, downright piss me off. And the funny part about this movie is, none of the information was surprising to me. It shows Bush as the true moron he is at times, such as when he is doing an interview in a small-town where he says that the people \\"don't know the meaning of hard-work\\" or in the extra-features, after an interview with the 9/11 Commission, telling the reporters that he talked about \\"stuff\\" and \\"things\\" and \\"topics.\\" Not the best P.R. guy, eh? His past is dug into quite a bit here, and not surprisingly, the connections with the Bin Laden family. Make no mistake, there is ample Bush-bashing here. If you're a supporter of the dude, it's gonna infuriate you. But I hardly think Moore is providing us with false information, afterall, his nasal-voiced narration is mainly done over stock footage and interviews, can't really make this stuff up folks (editing my ass). It doesn't have all the answers, or any at all, but let's not make outrageous statements like \\"Anti-American\\" or simply cutting Moore down by mentioning his weight, something which the average American seems to struggle with. Just watch the movie. Absorb what is presented to you, do more research, and then develop an opinion of your own. I don't take this work as gospel; I knew who I was voting for before this movie came out. Just like I don't need Ben Affleck and Bruce Springsteen to help me make up my mind, I didn't need this movie to do it either. This film and other propaganda, pro or anti-Bush, should be taken with a grain of salt. The people making these films have their own political agendas, and are usually only telling half the side, which is the case with \\"Fahrenheit 9/11.\\" I didn't want Bush as my president, but I don't exactly see him as the embodiment of all evil, just the embodiment of all stupidity (sorry, couldn't help it). But the bottom line is: The film is well-made, and in typical Moore fashion, entertains and informs. Just try to view with an open mind.do more research, and then develop an opinion of your own.

B00005JN2Z|5.0|I thought this movie was really good.  I didnt like the girl, but both jamie fox and tom cruise were really good in this movie.  I thought cruise was better but thats because he was a cool murdering psycopath who killed anyone in his way.  I loved the part when he goes to the club and kills all the security guards, and then shoots fat charlie, or whatever his name was, the fat asian guy.  Then he shoots the cop.  THat was kinda sad and kinda cool, but i didnt care because tom cruise is cool and i didnt really like the cop andyways.  Overall it was a really good movie.  But im not proud of it or anything.
B0006399FS|4.0|I enjoy this latest offering from U2, and appreciate the way they have incorporated their sound of the past two decades for a more cohesive sound - I guess you can say their sound has matured or is maturing still.  While I found this CD radically different from past CDs, I have taken it on its own merits and have found songs like \\"Love and Peace\\" and \\"A Man and A Woman\\" to be two of my favorites on this CD.  I hope people will give this CD a true and unprejudical listen.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This album is, hands down, my favorite Smashing Pumpkins.  I owned it for about 5 years 5 years ago, and my desire to buy it back is what brought me to this page.  The 1st half of the album is quintessential Smashing Pumpkins hard rock, and the 2nd half touches on the more beautiful/lyrical components of their range.  Truly, the whole thing is a masterpiece.  Buy it, hold onto it, and never let it out of your site! (or else you'll end up like me, cruising Amazon for another copy ;p)
0312335164|5.0|I've read The Da Vinci Code as well as Angels and Demons so I had to try this one as well, and I was just as drawn in and amazed with this one as I was with the other two.  I couldn't stop reading, I had to get to the next page to see what was happening to Susan Fletcher (the attractive, and brilliant main character).  I don't know how, if you liked Dan Brown's other works that you couldn't love this one, it is one of my all-time favorites.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Hollywood nerd movies tend toward a formula: High-IQ nerds suffer humiliation, approach despair, then organize to exact revenge on their jock-prep-cheerleader tormentors. If it worked for Revenge of the Nerds, why mess with success?    Napoleon Dynamite offers an intriguing diversion from that formula. By abandoning convention (and plot), the filmmakers take you on an ultimately richer excursion into the world of ordinary nerds, a place where people dress just as badly, but prefer tetherball to programming. The filmmakers ratchet up the tragicomic tension, unfolding scene after scene of deadpan absurdity. It delivers the goods for your underdog-cheering habit, but gets there in quirky and unpredictable ways.    Napoleon, Pedro, Kip, and the other characters aren't self-aware MENSA nerds from central casting. Rather, they are sad and sometimes abidingly strange, interacting awkwardly with one another while enduring headlocks, devastating put-downs, and sundry indignities.    Through their humiliations, they exude the unsettlingly calm certainty that this is the Way of Things and always will be. You can see it best in their thousand-yard stares. Any actors could play this strictly for laughs, but here they almost suggest a state of -- go figure -- enlightenment through cluelessness.    This is one of those rare movies that is enjoyable on a second or third viewing because you keep finding new details and angles. Recommended very highly.
B0002SROT0|4.0|This is the final album from Elliot Smith. It was meant to be a double album. Songs like \\"Suicide Machine\\" have been removed from the final tracklisting. Of course he died in the midst of it and never completed that original vision. Smith had not released an album for a few years. He had not toured in a while either. This album is no surprise. There are moments that are evocative of The Beatles, Neil Young and even The Eagles. There are personal songs dealing with his life: themes of relationships, drug addiction, and depression. But most of this album seems forward-looking. It seems like the beginning of a new period in his life. I could see many more albums to come. It's not like the album Closer by Joy Division, which seems to have an ominous pallor cast over it. Songs like \\"Pretty\\" and \\"Shooting Star\\" are as moving as anything Smith has done. Some of the guitar playing and harmonies are inventive. This is definitely a strong album to check out. It is one of the best of the year. It might be a cool album that people revisit year after year. I suggest you read the new biography Elliott Smith and The Big Nothing by Ben Nugent.
B0000BXGCN|5.0|The first song I heard of Lara Fabian's was 'Adagio' almost five years ago--on the self-titled English debut of  2000. Since that first song, I haven't been able to find enough of Lara.<BR>This album showcases 16 tracks, taken mostly from the 2001 French release 'Nue,' and features Lara with a simple, elegant combination of strings and piano; creating a perfect mood to stir emotion when adding her phenomenal voice.<BR>Highlights for me on 'En Toute Intimit'are the cover of Charles Aznavour's 'Comme ils disent,' the loss in Fabian's 'Je T'Aime,' the hit duet with French vocalist Maurane 'Tu Es Mon Autre', and the impressively executed Italian aria 'Addio Del Passato' taken from  Verdi's opera 'La Traviata.'<BR>Also included on the live album is an English track 'Calling You,'--never-before-recorded, nor released til now.<BR>In the beginning--Fabian was determined to become a recording artist after her success at the 1988 Eurovision song contest, and soon moved to French speaking Quebec. Born and raised in Belgium by a Flemish father and Italian mother--Lara learned and spoke several languages, studied dance, and was classically trained as a vocalist--though she considers herself more of a songwriter than as a vocalist. Lara Fabian is often considered a contemporary to Celine Dion. Unlike Celine however, Lara writes a majority of the music she records, which comes through in her interpretations. Thus Lara connects to her audiences' deepest cores with her voice, her uninhibited delivery, and most of all the intense performance that delivers her experiences, joys, sorrows, and more directly from Lara Fabian's mouth. She loses herself, and you will too if you listen with your soul.<BR>If you enjoy Lara Fabian, especially her 2001 album, 'Nue,' I would most definately recommend 'En Toute Intimit.' <BR>Lara Fabian sings with the voice of my soul, undoubtedly you will think the same after buying 'En Toute Intimit.'<BR>Otherwise I will tell you, if you appreciate incredibly beautiful music you will add this cd to your collection as soon as you can.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Why the Arcade Fire seems so exciting and so refreshing is that their music seems to do less with today's cheap fashion and image obsessions and more with narrative and artistry. You could know nothing about the band and this music still could move you. Just the musical ambition on the songs alone is impressive. Whereas most bands of today paint themselves off into some retro new wave corner, the Arcade Fire seem capable of any type of song or music. The beginning songs vaguely belong to some territory mapped out by Talking Heads and Flaming Lips. The first song \\"Neighborhood #1 (tunnels)\\" starts out simply enough. By the time we get to the lines \\"Then we tried to name our babies\\" we recognize that this is something truly strange, different, and special. \\"Laika\\" is a similar song that reinforces the overall tone. You have by now entered the world of Arcade Fire. Their music is devoid of any rock clich&eacute;s. \\"Power Out\\" and \\"Crown of Love\\" are two centerpiece songs where they expand their sound in terms of songwriting, sounds, and balladry. Up till this point your feel like this record is like reading a novel. You become comfortable with all the characters and the elements. \\"Wake Up\\" begins with one chord and a chorus singing \\"oh\\" and is it possible for a song to get any better? \\"Haiti\\" is half in French and recalls the days of Duvalier. It is a jingly ballad. This is one of the songs that features Regine Chassagne. This leads to the best song \\"Rebellion (lies)\\" which is like a song against death. It is a lifelong struggle. Most of the drama of the album ends here. But of course there is one last great song \\"In The Backseat.\\" This song sort of exists outside the album from a comfortable place. It's looks back at all the drama that has happened. This is one of the strongest debuts albums ever. It is still stunning after twenty and thirty listens. This is an album meant to be heard in its entirety.

6305313687|4.0|Sometimes, a single image is enough to make or break a film's advertising, and the theatrical poster for American History X is an example of the latter. I think it was the image of Edward Furlong that also occupies the lower half of the cover artwork that broke the advertising campaign for me, although I didn't know what to make of Edward Norton until I recently viewed Fight Club. Not that the rest of the cast in this film particularly excited me, but seeing Norton in a role where he was the aggressor rather than the passive, whiny half of a disassociative tag team was worth the effort.  <br /> Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is a highly-placed member of the neo-Nazi contingent on Venice Beach, a tightly organized group with a similar political view to the Pat Robertsons and Fred Niles of this world. At the film's beginning, he is in the middle of having sex with his girlfriend, Stacey (Fairuza Balk), when a pair of Afro-Americans decide to break into his car. They are spotted by Derek's younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), who raises the alarm in spite of what a bad time to get Derek's attention it is.  <br /> <br />Derek responds in a similar manner to how many of us would when confronted with criminals breaking into our property - by beating them off with violence. However, in this case, the violent force he uses has lethal results for the young Afro-Americans, and Derek is sent to prison for three years as a result. Ignoring for a moment the fact that the thieves were armed, and that I find it hard to believe that a man would serve prison time for defending himself and his property (without Danny's testimony, they would barely have a case), the film jumps to a point where Danny is called before his school's principal, Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) to explain himself about an essay he wrote. The essay in question, entitled \\"My Mein Kampf\\", obviously ruffles a few feathers with the school's administration, but Sweeney tries to reach out to Danny, and does so by asking Danny to write another essay about his elder brother and the influence said brother has had over his life.  <br /> <br />On the same day, Derek is released from prison, and comes home to the celebrations of his crimes by his lover, his brother, and the men he calls his friends. What they discover on his return, however, is that prison has brought him several revelations that have dramatically changed him and his perspective on life and the life he once led. The plot summation to be found on the back cover is, in fact, surprisingly accurate, even if the story is a little simplistic in terms of detail, with the support cast not being particularly fleshed out. Herein lies one of this film's essential problems: comparisons to the Australian-produced Romper Stomper are inevitable in spite of the fact that the two films are stylistically very different beasts, and in terms of entertainment, the comparisons are not necessarily in favour of this film. It's not that American History X is any less well-made, it's just that it does take its time to explain the story at the expense of the entertainment value. Still, a film with such a story as this one certainly cannot keep up the action without taking some time to explain why the men in the film are kicking, punching, and otherwise assaulting one another.  <br /> <br /> To reveal anything more about this film's plot would spoil the film for you, so I will leave the description at that because the surprises in this film should remain so. In any case, if you need a film with intelligence to while away two hours with, then American History X is definitely worthy of your consideration <br />
B000005DQR|5.0|Out of the hundreds of discs I own, and the thousands I've heard, this is without a doubt one of the greatest, if not the greatest, period.  Sick beats, great samples, just surreal.  You should RUN, do not walk, RUN out and buy this.  It is, simply put, gorgeous modern aural art.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Armageddon and Deep Impact bear a striking resemblance to each other. They are both disaster movies. They are both big budget US \\"summer\\" movies. They both made lots of money at the box office. They both revolve around the premise of a cosmological object striking the Earth, annihilating all life. They both have pretty much predictable plots - filmmaking by numbers as it were.  <br /> <br />There are differences between them, however. In Armageddon, the enemy is an asteroid. In Deep Impact, the enemy is a comet. In Armageddon, the US president is white and up-beat. In Deep Impact, the US president is black and sombre (Morgan Freeman). In Armageddon, the emphasis is more on the amazing special effects and the gung-ho attitude of the Earth's saviours. In Deep Impact, they concentrate a little more on the human response to impending annihilation.  <br /> <br />Of the two movies, I preferred Deep Impact myself. However, Armageddon is no slouch of a movie, either, and is more of an arcade thrill ride than Deep Impact. Just don't expect anything other than a spectacular thrill ride, and you will not be disappointed.  <br /> <br />Bruce Willis is Harry Stamper. Harry is an oil driller. When NASA discovers that the asteroid is on its way to destroy the Earth, they call upon Harry and his team of roughneck oil drillers to save the Earth. There are the obligatory complications along the way, all telegraphed well in advance by the script, such as that which occurs on the Russian space station, and those that occur on the asteroid, but in the end...  <br /> <br />Well,you have to watch and see it for yourself. :) <br />
0385513755|4.0|A hectic year has passed since he vanquished the Illuminati threat in \\"Angels and Demons\\" and mild-mannered Harvard professor Robert Langdon would like a vacation.  Instead, he finds himself in Paris after giving a lecture on religious symbology and trying to get some rest when, suddenly, another fateful telephone call interrupts his sleep.  This time it is the French Judicial Police and they are looking for clues into the mysterious slaying of prominent Louvre Museum curator Jacques Sauniere.<br />Eerily reminiscent of the earlier novel's first symbol-laden murder, this case points not to the Illuminati, but to the equally secretive Priory of Sion.  Allegedly headed by such luminaries as Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) and Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), the Priory has been associated with the Holy Grail of early Christian lore.  Again we see shades of Indiana Jones, or as Brown puts it, \\"Harrison Ford in Harris tweed\\".  Again in James Bond-like fashion, Langdon gets help from a highly-intelligent and attractive woman, the Judicial Police cryptologist Sophie Neveu.<br /><br />Even though the plot of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is similar to that of \\"Angels and Demons\\", this novel throws in a few extra twists.  One is that Langdon himself is a prime suspect and he must elude the Judicial Police as well as his increasingly nebulous adversary.  Also, the symbols and puzzles that he and Neveu must solve are tougher and worthy of Leonardo da Vinci at his best.<br />Leonardo not only designed ingenious contraptions, but he may have hid surprises in his art.  In his \\"Mona Lisa\\" and also in \\"The Last Supper\\", he perhaps mocked convention by painting with alleged double meanings.  With the latest restoration of \\"The Last Supper\\", the figure at Jesus' right side (viewer's left) was returned to its original \\"androgyny\\", opening the door to reinterpretation.  Can it be either a man or a woman, like the subject of the \\"Mona Lisa\\"?  Or, is it really a woman after all, perhaps Mary Magdalene?<br /><br />Such speculation plays into the age-old Merovingian myth and its dynastic claim.  Beginning with the ancient Gnostics and continuing into the present, the notion of a bloodline springing from Jesus and Mary Magdalene has generated more heat than light.  By their fruits shall you know them, Gnostics included.  Apostle and evangelist Saint John had to contend with proto-Gnostics in the early Church.  It was this same inner-circle disciple who claimed that Jesus is divine, long before the Council of Nicaea did so in AD 325.  And the Bible indirectly affirms that it was John himself who sat at Jesus' (right) side during the Last Supper (John 13:23, John 19:26-27).  Whether or not Leonardo believed it is not the core issue.  (Leonardo probably did, because his notes on \\"The Last Supper\\" are said to indicate St. John.)  Yet as fiction, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" does offer the reader something more than a rehashing of Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln's \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\".  Also, the Special Illustrated Edition brings to life the settings of Brown's story, especially the Louvre Museum in Paris.  In \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", Brown delivers an intriguing story line that promises to continue with his forthcoming book, \\"The Solomon Key\\".  Hopefully in this next work, he will square away both his Judeo-Christian history and his theology.  If he does, we may see a spiritual classic.  If not, use caution!  Rev. Dennis J. Mercieri, alumnus of Holy Apostles Seminary, Cromwell, CT, USA<br />P.S.  I just saw the DVC movie and enjoyed it for what it is, a story.  While it zips through some of the elaborate riddles, it does mirror the book's plot and it ends with the same kind of impact.  The movie also reinforces the book's status as fiction and following the credits is a disclaimer that any similarity to real persons, places, or events is purely coincidental and unintentional.  For me, a shift occurred in that the movie highlighted the story's detective aspects.  I now see Dan Brown's DVC as more like an episode of Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot than of James Bond.ode of Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot than of James Bond.
B000031WD9|3.0|I'm not entirely sure why I decided that I had to see this film for myself, and the usual explanation of insanity doesn't quite work in this case. To be honest with you, when this film was finished, I wound up hating it a lot less than I honestly thought I would, although the content of this film still doesn't quite sit in my stomach too well. I had been told that American Pie was the best comedy of 1999 by various people, but the advertising campaign had led me to believe that it was just another film created by the sorts of minds that believe all human beings between the ages of 15 and 21 have identical motivations and personalities. While the film didn't quite go far enough to counteract this impression, it is entertaining enough to make the average viewer forget about the shallow characterization and enjoy the story as it unfolds. The story, such as it is, revolves around a foursome of male adolescents who are about to graduate from high school and step out into the big bad world of college and so on and so forth. Essentially, after being led to believe that the class nerd has just succeeded in talking a female into going to bed with him, these four teens make a pact to do the same before prom night, come hell or high water. The main characters are introduced to the viewer at a breakneck pace, and it takes some getting used to before the film settles comfortably in one's mind. In the end, most of the characters are relegated to props, with only Jim, his friends, and the young women they pursue gaining any real significance in the picture. Still, this is a better arrangement than some films I could mention, such as The Crow: City Of Angels.  <br />However, this is probably the biggest problem with the film, as the vast majority of the characters are never quite fleshed out enough for the viewer to feel any particular sympathy for them as they go through their inevitable humiliations and struggles. I also found it difficult to relate to these characters, as therewas no real detail to their portraitures, which makes the changes and developments in each character that are meant to advance the story seem more like a change in hair colour than any genuine change in character. However, Jim (Jason Biggs), the character that much of the story is told from the perspective of, does manage to carry the story because of the way we see him change as a human being from the beginning of the film to its end. His father (Eugene Levy) also manages to inject a dose of welcome humour into the proceedings. Other characters, such as Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), Oz (Chris Klein) and Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) help to flesh out the story of the film enough to sustain interest. As entertaining as the film was, however, American Pie seems little more than an updated clone of such direct-to-video B-grade releases from the 1980s as Porky's or Hot Chili. Sometimes things from the past are better off remaining there, if you know what I mean.  <br /> <br />In any case, if you're after a quick, brainless laugh, then American Pie is a film designed with you in mind. It is crude, it is ugly, and it is shallow, but the comedic factor of the film makes it a reasonable way to spend ninety minutes. It is worthy of a rental, at least.  <br />
B00005JMEW|5.0|Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) get into a small discussion about a pilot episode Mia was involved in called \\"The Fox Force Five\\" in Tarantino's masterpiece \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" which has a blonde woman, a Japanese woman, a black woman, a French woman, and Mia's character whose specialty was knives and supposedly known as \\"the deadliest woman in the world with a knife.\\" Unfortunately, it was just the pilot that aired and Mia only got 15 minutes of fame. Nearly ten years later, the Fox Force Five would become resurrected and reincarnated to become the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad in Tarantino's fourth film \\"Kill Bill.\\" The members: Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), aka Copperhead; O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), aka Cottonmouth; Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), aka California Mountain Snake; Budd (Michael Madsen), aka Sidewinder; and lastly, The Bride (Uma Thurman), aka Black Mamba. Bill (David Carradine) is their boss.    The Bride (name revealed in Vol. 2) is left for dead when members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and Bill interrupt her wedding by blasting anyone who's anyone, and putting a bullet into the Bride's head. Unfortunately, she miraculously survives, but is left in a coma. She awakens four years later, only to discover that her unborn child is gone, and that her body was used as a \\"love machine\\" by any perverted men who paid a doctor (called \\"Buck\\" here) to have sex with her comatose body. She escapes the hospital once she awakens and sets out to kill those who attempted to kill her: The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.    This is Tarantino's wackiest, bloodiest, and yet, extremely creative movie he has ever presented to us. The fight sequences and sound effects feel as if we're watching an old martial arts movie from the '60s or '70s. The fast camera zooming to show a close-up of a character's face, avant-garde filming style, and the film's score reminescent of good ol' Bruce Lee films certainly provide us with one thing: art. Of course, Tarantino is known for ripping off other movies, but he works around it by miraculously making it seem innovative and his own. I'm not sure how he does it, but... he does. One of the highlights is the story of O-Ren Ishii. Tarantino could've gotten some actors to do the sequences, but instead, he tells the story through animation... Anime, to be exact.    And of course, the bloody fight scenes. They were at one time hailed as the bloodiest sequences in a movie ever, up until \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" was released. People frown on them by exclaming it as a form of celebrating violence. Compare this to \\"Natural Born Killers.\\" It seemed that movie celebrated violence with Mickey and Mallory getting a kick out of killing whoever they want. \\"Kill Bill\\" is more over-the-top and cartoony. In other words, it's very unrealistic, which at the same time provides twisted humor. But Tarantino manages to keep the Crazy 88 sequence intact and slip by with a R rating by showing most of itin black and white. Since DVDs are constantly having more special features, why couldn't we have been treated with the sequence presented in color? As I've read elsewhere, the Japanese version of \\"Kill Bill\\" has the sequence in color.    I think one minor character steals the movie and fans seem to think so as well: Go Go Yubari. A teenage girl, dressed in a school girl uniform, and O-Ren Ishii's bodyguard. Is it because of her uniform, or is it because she's the only character that almost got the best of the Bride? It's one or the other, both, or neither, but I'm gonna settle with the latter. Go Go's fighting technique is damn impressive. She does all these crazy tricks with a ball and chain (perhaps that could be another reason she's a fan favorite). She's deadlier than even the Bride or any other character here. Whatever the reason, Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama) just about steals the movie.    And another highlight of the movie is the impressive soundtrack. Hearing \\"The Lonely Shepard\\"by Zamfir is worth buying the soundtrack alone. Just an absolutely beautiful and powerful track. Purchase whenever you get the chance. Oh yeah, can't forget other amazing tracks like \\"The Green Hornet\\" theme, the movie's theme \\"Battle Without Honor or Humanity,\\" and \\"Twisted Nerve\\" (that whistling song). There's many other great tracks as well.    Sorry about getting off-topic for a sec there. Tarantino has yet provided us with another masterpiece. I talk of both volumes as just one movie, but as separate, both are equally good. Tarantino still gives us the witty and intelligent dialogue he's best known for (especially in Vol. 2) with an amazing epic storytelling of revenge and loss. Vol. 1 has all the bloody action, and Vol. 2 makes up for the lost storytelling Vol. 1 rushed through. Both are essentials for the Tarantino fanatic. Sadly, the DVDs are lacking. We all know a DVD edition will be released later in the future. I hate it when that happens, but in the meantime, we'll see if one does come along.    Anywho, the \\"Kill Bill\\" saga are works of art.
0060512806|5.0|The erudition and information in this book are humbling.  Wait, wait! It also has humor, tragedy, war, romance, a bit of sex, intrigue, a treasure hunt, famous historical characters, and a whole bunch of other things---truly the complete range of human experience, across two generations of families.  One of my more unusual tests for a book is its ability to keep me interested if I have to leave it for awhile.  Well, I read Cryptonomicon over a period of more than 3 months, and even if I stopped reading for a week at the end of a paragraph (much less a section or chapter), I found I could return to it easily without losing the many threads of the story---minimal paging back to refresh my memory.  In a book of this magnitude and complexity, that is a rare, perhaps unique compliment.  I admit readily that it isn't fair to do this to a book, but sometimes stuff happens.  The author even enlightened me about a personal character trait!  That isn't something one expects in a work of fiction.  On the minimal downside, Stephenson is so knowledgeable about technical matters that he devotes some space to theories, graphs, computer programs, and the like.  The good news about this is that all of it is relevant to the story.  The bad news is that I couldn't begin to repeat much of it after reading it.  My best advice would be to read those sections several times, as I did, trying for a basic understanding of the concepts.  Going to either extreme (skipping them entirely or getting bogged down in them or, horrors, quitting the book in frustration) is not advised!! Cryptonomicon ends with a brief excerpt from Quicksilver, the first book in a new trilogy.  Stephenson has me intrigued already, and I eagerly await reading all of his other works.
B00000JLWW|4.0|This is a movie that millions around the world have enjoyed time and time again.  This movie is a worthy addition to the very long list of movies that have been done regarding the story of the fated ship \\"Titanic\\" is brought to the silver screen.<br /><br />The love story between the two ill fated lovers is both touching at sweet. I think that Mr. Cameron has done a very good job taking a real situation and adding a touch of Hollywood. This movie won several Academy Awards and was worthy of each one. I highly recommend \\"Titanic\\" if you want a good story that audiences can relate to.
0743424425|4.0|finished The Shining. very dark book. not depressing, but dark. the constant allusions to the snow, cold, and wind make the feeling of the book sinister and dim. character development made it boring in the beginning, but then again so are all of the beginnings of king's books. i call this book suspense more so than horror. it was pretty good. could've been a 400 page book if the words weren't so damn big.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|I loved this movie!  Good plot, cool actors, awesome car-chase scenes.  Lots of suspense and twists and turns in the movie keep you wondering what will happen next.  Not much cussing in the movie either, so that's a definite plus.
0425173895|5.0|This is the most controversial mystery novel of the 20th century.  It nearly got Agatha Christie kicked out of the Detection Club (an organization of writers who agreed to play fair).  It put her on the map.  It's her best work - ever.   <br /> <br />The book is a first person account of a Hercule Poriot mystery, done by Doctor James Sheppard, a country doctor serving his community.  He was there from almost the beginning, and his narrative provides a wonderful account of the murder of his friend, Rodger Ackroyd. <br /> <br />Rodger Ackroyd's female friend took her own life.  She wrote a letter to him before she did so, naming the man who ruined her life - a blackmailer who knew she killed her first husband.  Rodger read the letter to Dr. Sheppard, but wouldn't continue when he realized a blackmailer would be exposed because of it.  Dr. Sheppard begged him to continue and get the name - to no avail. <br /> <br />Ackroyd didn't comply.  James Sheppard left and went home, only to get a myserious phone call telling him Rodger had been murdered.  Murdered he was - and the letter was missing! <br /> <br />Enter Sheppard's neighbor, Hercule Poriot.  Dr. Sheppard plays Dr. Watson, following the sleuth around and recording what he finds.  From a missing son to a married maid; from the theft of household money.   <br /> <br />In the end, Poroit invites all the cast to a room where he talks about the case, and says he has a solution - which he will reveal to the police in 24 hours.  The only way for an innocent man to be saved was for the real killer to confess one way or another... and even though Dr. Sheppard has all the facts of the case, he can't see how Poriot could put them all together into a surprising solution of the case. <br /> <br />In short, if you want a book that will shock you, read this one.   Well crafted, with devious plot devices, Christie showed her genius for detective fiction with this book.  It was a work of genius because she had the imagination to dosomething amazingly original.  It may have nearly got her kicked out of the Detection  Club, but history has sided with her - she was right all along.  This is her most classic work of all time.
B000002LK1|5.0|I bought this album NEW back in 1990 when it came out.  This album still is awesome and holds up well dispite its age.  This is the only Depeche Mode album i own for a good reason ... all the songs are wonderful.  Plain and simple.  I know it's difficult to say \\"everyone\\", but i will say it here.... everyone will find something to like about this album.
0385510454|5.0|I read \\"The Broker\\" fast and it is full of suspense. And this time, Grisham is delivering an international suspense thriller, which he's quite good in writing. It's all about a Washington power broker (not a stock broker as the title may lead you believe) who's released from prison under a special deal. The CIA gives him (the power broker) a new identity, etc. relocates him to Italy. Nice scenery and details about Italian life. Now, the power broker is a target to his previous \\"clients\\" from the Russians to the shady middle eastern characters to whom he had sold U.S. secrets during his \\"good\\" old days. The Broker reminds me a little bit on the in 2000 published novel by Alec Donzi \\"The Consultant\\" which is along similar lines and also an exceptional international thriller. Both books are excellent reads -- and with \\"The Broker\\" the real Grisham is back in a powerful way.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I think that this is hands down Lamb of God's best album.  Here, they've found their creative niche.  Anyone who says the riffs are repetitive and similar, the same could be argued for Slayer.  I however will not argue that point because Slayer is incredible, but I digress.  Every track on here is slamming in its own way.  Laid to Rest starts the album off perfectly by showing us just how much better the sound on this album is going to be compared to NAG or AtPB.  And LOG make no bones about telling everyone that this album is anti-Bush, love it or hate it.  Every song on here smokes, but my personal favorite is Faded Line.  The title track is an instrumental that features Chris Poland on the third solo.  In case some of the people here are new to metal, Poland was the guitar player on the first two Megadeth albums.  The track itself is lacking, but Poland's solo is one of his best and you can tell right away it is him playing.  I would say every song on this album except the title track is an incredible metal song.  This is the album that will push LOG even further into the fore-front of heavy metal.  Buy it if you're a metal fan, period.
B00005JNEI|1.0|If a documentary can be judged by any journalistic standards of accuracy and integrity, this one fails miserably.  But as circuses go, it was barely entertaining; speaking metaphorically, you could \\"see the strings.\\"  Unfortunately Amazon.com doesn't have an option for less than one star.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I've always enjoyed Celine Dion and this album is no exception, but while reading some of the customer recommendations posted on this page I discovered an artist by the name of Mehdi (pronounced meddie). After an online search I found his site (SoothingMusic.Com) and listened to the samples...  <br />I was instantly blown away by the quality of this music and so I gave it a try and now that I have listened to his CDs several times I really must say that although I'm still a Celine Dion fan I also find Mehdi to be a great find. I have them both in my multi-disc CD player and love the way they compliment each other. I highly recommend that you give this artist a try or atleast just go listen to the samples, I have a feeling you'll be glad you did.  <br /> <br />
B00005JMXX|5.0|Look people, what it comes down to is this: you don't go to an \\"end of the world\\" movie for the plot. You go for the special effects. And I can honestly say these are some of the best special effects I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br />I work a lot with computer graphics, and can distinguish them (AND miniatures) by sight. This movie blends them seamlessly. The only other movie I've seen that does that is Lord of the Rings. If you want to see a movie that makes you believe that what's happening is real, watch this. If all you care about is plot, there are better choices. <br /> <br />I give this movie 5 stars based on exactly what I expected of it. Mindboggling visuals. <br /> <br />Hope you've got a big-screen and surround sound. You're gonna need it. <br /> <br /> <br />
068987474X|5.0|Its something that you know deep down is true, but you don't vocalize.  You want to believe that you're the exception, but the truth is, guys are all the same:  he's just not that into you.  And this book has a witty, non-hurtful way of bringing that point home.   Something that every independent female this day and age should read and laugh about.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|This is without a doubt my favorite comic book movie. Yeah, Spiderman is good and all, but there's just something about X-Men that I find more interesting-- maybe because everyone can find something to relate to in an X-Men character. And I like that there's more than one hero and that the bad guy is a mutant, yet unlike the mutant heroes.  <br /> <br />This is the second installment, the third is on the way (can't wait!) and we re-join the mutants at \\"Mutant High,\\" which is also the secret base of the elite X-Men. The film begins with an action scene, one of the best I've ever seen, in which a mutant teleporter attempts to kill the President as a protest against the anti-mutant sentiment that has swept the nation. Jean and Storm are sent by Xavier, the leader of the X-Men, to track down the teleporter, who was actually forced to attack the President by a man named Stryker, a non-mutant who has developed a mind-controlling serum and also has a great dislike for mutants and hoped his attack would force the government to get rid of the mutants.  <br /> <br />Great film, lots of cool action scenes, and some of the holes of the first film are finally filled in, getting more information about Wolverine. You don't have to like comics to like this movie, just have a like for action or a like for a good story. This movie has both. This movie isn't quite as comic bookey as Spiderman 2 was actually. Check this one out some time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
0671027344|5.0|I read this book for a book review, and I could not put it down. This book has all the ingredients of a best seller from interesting characters, to descriptive plot, to great theme.

I definatley reccomend reading it.
B00020VWMS|5.0|UK dancepop duo Moloko are in fine form in \\"Things to Make And Do,\\" their third blend of acid jazz and trippy electronica. The talented Roisin Murphy and Mark Brydon create a charmingly erratic dance album that sounds like nothing else, yet never fails to draw you in.<br /><br />It opens with a peculiar piano solo, before kicking into the sexy sax-keyboard of \\"Pure Pleasure Seeker,\\" and the ominously trippy \\"Absent Minded Friends.\\" A darker note enters with songs like \\"Being Is Bewildering,\\" which is technically a more \\"normal\\" song, a slow and rather melancholy song based on acoustic guitar and organ. Same with the lower-key pop song \\"The Time is Now.\\"<br /><br />There are also some more experimental songs, such as the nonsensical funk of \\"Indigo\\" or the creepy psycho-vocals of \\"If You Have A Cross To Bear You May As Well Use It As A Crutch.\\" \\"Remain the Same\\" is perhaps the most experimental, with the vocal sampling and sound of the organ being overwhelmed and sunk by the electronic bleeps.<br /><br />In this release, Moloko downplays the outright weirdness in favor of a more subtle sound. Call it experimental ultraquirk acid-jazz-funk-house-trip-hop. That more or less describes it. It's not just a fun album, but a richly engaging one with some deceptively simple-sounding songwriting.<br /><br />Roisin (no, it doesn't rhyme with \\"raisin\\") Murphy has an excellent voice for this type of music -- it sounds clear and flexible, while being strong enough to rise over powerful music that could have overwhelmed her. And she brings depth to certain songs like \\"Mother,\\" where she lashes out at her mother in a restrained manner: \\"I know somehow somewhere I'll be bumping into you/you see I'm blameless/I had a mother who was shameless/no wonder my life collapsed!\\" Elsewhere the songwriting is just deliciously bizarre.<br /><br />Mark Brydon takes charge of the musical backdrop for Roisin's voice. And a fine job he does too, blending organic instrumentation like piano, acoustic guitar and rippling strings with some vocal sampling and deliciously wacked-out beats, sounding like anything from a DJ on acid to the funkier twin of Portishead.<br /><br />Erratic it may be, but \\"Things to Make And Do\\" is also fun, wild and extremely eclectic, switching styles the way most musicians do instruments. It may not be their best album, but it is a wonderfully engaging, trippy one.like piano, acoustic guitar and rippling strings with some vocal sampling and deliciously wacked-out beats, sounding like anything from a DJ on acid to the funkier twin of Portishead.  <br />  <br />Erratic it may be, but \\"Things to Make And Do\\" is also fun, wild and extremely eclectic, switching styles the way most musicians do instruments.

The whole thing about the roulette ball could he really figure it out?  I don't know all i know is Tom Cruise is crying at the end that he will go see him in 3 weeks.  How long will that last, probably until real life kicks in and he forgets about him like his father did.   <br /> <br />Did it desearve 4 oscars and best picture.  NO would it get acclaim today I highly doubt it.  This movie is lame

B00007BK2N|5.0|a great deal of fun - overwrought, hackneyed, loud, indulgent, hazy, much like a Friday night in Fallowfield. Coogan is cooly cheesy, the lads who play JD and the Mondays are great - esp Ryder and Hook - and the space in between is filled with the shady, upstart conmen one might imagine in a grimy postindustrial utopia. Purists, sadists, and basically anybody with no sense of humor or fun will complain endlessly. (this is an impression - Tony Wilson's no less - not a documentary). most everyone else will be pleased.

038551123X|4.0|This book reminded me of a good summer movie, you eat your popcorn have a good time and leave. This is my first foray into the serial killer genre. Part of the plot reminded me of the movie \\"Silence of the lambs\\". The main character is intriguing, a serial killer who only kills people who deserve it. This allows you to offer up some sympathy for him. He also has suprise! suprise! a sister who is a cop. The Book is a quick fast paced read. Not great literature but I enjoyed it.

B000065U1N|5.0|Josh Hartnett (SSgt. Matt Eversmann), Ewan McGregor (Spec. John Grimes), Tom Sizemore (Lt. Col. Danny McKnight), William Fichtner (Sfc. Jeff Sanderson), Sam Shepard (Maj. Gen. William F. Garrison), and Eric Bana (Sfc. Norm Gibson) star in this amazing movie about an actual event that occured in Somalia in the fall of 1993.    This film re-creates the siege of Mogadishu in October, 1993.  An elite force of American Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are sent to capture the associates of Somali warlord Muhammad Farrah Aidid, whose regieme has lead to the starvation of countless numbers of Somalis.  The mission is only suppoed to take forty five minutes, but it soon turns into a sixteen hour nightmare battle for survival.  Two Blackhawk helicopters are shot down by rebel RPGs and the American ground forces are forced to fight their way to both crash sites to rescue the helicopter crewmembers.  Nineteen Americans would ultimately lose their lives, while over a thousand Somalis would perish in the fighting.    This is one of the best war films I've seen.  The acting is top notch, and the battle scenes are extremely realistic.  The harsh realities of warfare and fighting are also reproduced with some very graphic and telling battle scenes.    I give this fine film my highest recommendation.  Watch and see how the true fighting spirit, bravery, and camradarie of the American service personnel overcomes a situation that had went terribly wrong.
B000002UJQ|5.0|It is better than any single album by The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, Bob Dylan, The Velvet Underground, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, or anyone else. It is the best album ever made. 5 stars is a joke.
B00009W0WM|5.0|I really wanted to hate this movie.  I hadn't seen it and didn't want to buy into the mythical hype around it.  But I finally broke down, and to see it is to love it.  It is beautifully written, skillfully shot and tenderly acted.  If you're willing to lose yourself in the world of the film, there's no way you can't be swept to tears along with the luminous Ingrid Bergman in the final scene.  A great example of what American film was and should be.
B00003CXA2|4.0|Forrest Gump is without a doubt an effective film.  Only the hardest heart will fail to be moved by its emotional crescendos, of which there are many.  Several scenes have become American film classics, emblazed in our consciousness.  Also in praise, Tom Hanks does a fine job as Forrest, who embodies many of the qualities most prized in the United States; honesty, loyalty, and courage. There is, however, a seamy underside to the movie and it is this message: it is better to be a half wit, oblivious to the vagaries of reality; than to understand what is going on and be corrupted by the resulting despair.  To drive home this message, we are presented the parallel lives of Forrest, the innocent, and that of his lifelong love, Jenny.   <br /> <br />While Forrest valiantly serves in a war he does not understand, Jenny proceeds down the path of the anti-government reactionary of the 1960s.  We are invited to believe that Jenny takes this path in part because she was abused as a child, and we see her devolve slowly into anti-Vietnam protest, partying with the Black Panthers, drug abuse, suicidal tendencies, and perhaps worst of all, sexual promiscuity with unsuitable men.  AIDS is her punishment for wandering off the moral reservation, for Jenny is the anti-Forrest, a morally conscientious yet wholly immoral liberal.  In case the message is lost on you, the paths of Jenny and Forrest cross throughout the movie, and the audience can only conclude at every meeting that Jenny should forego the social conscientiousness, and retire to the plantation house with Forrest to enjoy a simple life.  Yet Jenny refuses to be saved, and the religious parallels are obvious.   <br /> <br />America follows the path of Jenny- her turbulence matches that of the political period.  But we are invited to wonder whether or not if we as a country would be better off as Forrest- perhaps chastity and innocence engender honesty, loyalty, courage, and the ability to be remarkable.  The only expense, however, is our intelligence, or at the least, a renouncement of ideological responsibility, an idea that is wholly discomforting.  <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|People who claim that this movie isn't funny just didn't get the point, I think.  Sure, the jokes might not always be obvious or slapstick-y.  But the humor is definitely there.  It's so off-the-wall and different than many \\"comedies\\" coming out at this time that I suppose those who weren't impressed with it are either more inclined to enjoy mainstream comedy or just don't enjoy the satirization of one nerd's existence.  This is very much a \\"less is more\\" kind of movie, if you're willing to really understand what's happening in it.  Don't feel bad if you don't get it, though.  A lot of people don't.  But if you have a penchant for more obscure, \\"life-is-just-funny-in-and-of-itself\\" observational humor, this is the one for you! <br />
0375713751|5.0|If you are a working mother with a high power job this book will really resonate with you.  Ms. Pearson brings Kate to life with her wonderful literary style.  The book is both moving and laugh out loud funny!  I was astounded by the similarities we share with women in the UK and that husbands are the same everywhere ;-).  Best book I've read in a long time.  I'm sharing it with all my working mother friends!
B000000OSE|4.0|Every great band in music history has been plagued by one problem: fans compare every work of theirs to their magnum opus. In GnR's case it is \\"Appetite for Destruction.\\"I should concede that I like \\"Use your Illusion I\\" a lot, but even though I am a die hard GnR fan, I wouldn't rate it at par with \\"Appetite.\\"But the nonetheless, it's a great effort by Guns.  <br /> <br />Instead of releasing I and II, if they compiled the best songs of both albums, it would definitely be as good as \\"Appetite.\\" The \\"Illusion\\" releases have one thing that makes them different from their debut album. It is a lot more experimental, the keyboard and piano voices are more pronounced and you hear many instrumental voices that traditionally is not used by rock bands. \\"Use your Illusion I\\" is certainly better of the two.  <br /> <br />The best songs on this album are: <br /> <br />Right Next Door to Hell- One of the best on the album...almost as good as the opener \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" <br /> <br />Don't cry-  which is a much mellowed Axl who at the end of the song goes \\"ah, eeh, ahhhhh\\"...great rendition  <br /> <br />Perfect Crime- hard and in-your-face...solid <br /> <br />November Rain- Well, this song needs no introduction, one of the best rock ballads of all time <br /> <br />The other songs range are all average, but in my opinion not a single song would qualify to be called an out and out filler.  <br /> <br />A must for any GnR fan. You will enjoy the variety of sounds and the change in pace in the songs. The only shortcoming is the drumming. I think Steven Adler did a much better job on \\"Appetite\\" than Matt Sorum. If you are new to GnR start with \\"Appetite\\" and then buy this. You will like both! <br /> <br />Sherin <br />
B00067ZONA|3.0|It always seems to me that a lot of greatest hits collections do come and go from time to time. Yet, there are some that are just absolutely exceled quite well, and others that just overdue the feel of the collection just a little bit. That happens with so many greats from all over the world. That has happened again with good quality artists like Boyz II Men, the legendary Whitney Houston, and one of the legendary rock groups since the 70's, Genesis. For Genesis, their career has been in two different folds. One of them reflects the feel during the Peter Gabriel era, and the even more widely successful Phil Collins era. Yet, they have defined the British music scene for nearly 30 years, but a collection of good songs isn't all in the way that should dance.<br /><br />The Genesis Platinum Collection, is a collection of 39 tracks that really seperate from both era of the longtime British rock group. The songs are very good quality tracks from the different eras and such big hits like I Can't Dance, Land Of Confusion, Trick Of The Tail, the groups only #1 hit song Invisible Touch, and That's All. The collection does seem to fair very well with the amount of songs, but really loses a lot of steam with so many of those quality tracks being remixed into newer version, which fairs similar to Whitney Houston's 2000 Greatest Hits. The remixed versions, seem to overshadow and not reflect on what made the original songs fair well, especially on songs like Follow You, Follow Me, Abacab, The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, Foxtrot, and many other songs. The collection, also overlooks a few good quality traks like Congo, from the final Genesis record Calling All Stations, Never A Time, and other good songs.<br /><br />All in all for longtime Genesis fans, this collection fairs well, but others will fell this isn't wirth the money. Instead, I honestly suggest that some just wait for a better hits collection, while many others might want to consider the 1999 Turn It On Again: The Hits collection. The Genesis Platinum collection just misses the mark by a little bit.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Quantity of music: C-<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Remastering: B<br /><br />Overall: C-its collection.

B000002J09|5.0|I was just reading some of the old reviews for this album, anyone who gave it 1 or 2 stars usually said the same exact thing, \\"this is the most overplayed album of all time.\\" Children who aren't old enough to get a real account on Amazon are bashing this because it's not up to date. Well, South Park said it best \\"What would happen if the Beatles updated the White Album every year?\\" Bottom line - Yes it's EXTREMELY overrated and it's classic rock, but who cares. The first time ANYONE hears Black Dog, it's physically impossible for them to not respond one way or the other. I rest my case, it's a must have.
0671027344|5.0|I picked up this book after reading so many good reviews of it & I'm sure glad that I did. I loved the whole idea of the book, reading letters. It was a nice break from your standard book. I really felt for Charlie and at some points in the book I even teared up a bit over things. That may sound silly but I'm a bit of a depressed person who's spent too much time alone. Heh.<br /><br />I've seen a handful of reviews saying that this was a terrible book, I couldn't disagree more. While some of the things Charlie brings up seem weird or out of place you have to understand that you're dealing with a character who's not completely stable.<br /><br />This is a geat book.
B00005T33W|3.0|But I guess it's okay to occasionally watch anyway. Some of it gets boring, though. There isn't that much significance in the opening song. It's just a regular movie with no special effects because that's not the kind it is and I suppose I like it a little bit at least. I've never read the comic book because I had never heard of it before. This isn't really much of a review. It's just me talking about my brief issues with this mediocre film....... did I mention the \\"special effects\\" thing already?? If this  is supposed to be comedy, then the filmmakers should have had something better to do. This movie is okay. It's not great, but it's something to watch if you're bored.
B000002UVX|3.0|Typically people recommend this album for \\"Machine Gun\\".  From a guitarist's point of view, I think \\"Message of Love\\" has two of the most consistent and best live guitar solos ever played by Jimi Hendrix. His guitar tone morphs into different sounds without any studio gimmics and his playing is clearly inspired without his usual tuning problems.  Buddy Miles is merely a competent drummer, but he ain't no Mitch Mitchell.  Billy Cox however, is a different story.  His bass playing fits Hendrix's music like a glove.
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana--now THIS is a TERRIBLE band.  Absolutely AWFUL.  In the late 90s, you couldn't get away from Nirvana.  Everybody liked them but me.  I hate this band.  No wonder all the nerdy rock critics worship Nirvana.  This is music only a pseudo-intellectual loser would like.  They all talk about how \\"influential\\" Nirvana was and how Kurt was \\"brilliant\\" and a \\"tortured genius\\".  They praise Kurt for \\"killing off hair metal\\" and \\"saving rock and roll\\". <br /> <br />Well, I've got one question for all you Nirvana nerds--IF NIRVANA WAS SO GREAT, THEN WHY DIDN'T ANYBODY LIKE NIRVANA WHEN KURT WAS STILL ALIVE? <br /> <br />I'm only 20, so my memeory of Nirvana's 80s heyday is a bit blurry.  But if Nirvana really was so big in the 80s, then why didn't I ever hear of them until 1996?  I clearly remember the first time I ever heard of Nirvana.  It was late 96, almost 3 years after Kurt ate a shotgun barrel.  Everybody was talking about how they were supposedly \\"legendary\\".  I had never heard of Nirvana until then, even though I knew all the other 80s bands. <br /> <br />It is a well known fact that the only reason Nirvana are famous is because Kurt is dead.  Compare their record sales before he died with the record sales after he died.  It is a shocking difference.  Nevermind has gone 10 times platinum since he died.  You can tell how awful a band is when their record sales skyrocket after the lead singer kills himself. <br /> <br />There's no way Nirvana would have been famous if Kurt didn't commit suicide.  If Nirvana really is the great band rock critics say they are, then where were their millions of fans before Kurt Cobain commited suicide?
B00008S2VG|5.0|I don't care what anyone says about this album, I think it's pretty amazing. <br /> <br />People in this society tend to put other people in boxes and when they attempt to step out, they are automatically steped on and tried to be put back in that \\"box.\\" <br /> <br />You need to listen to this CD with an open mind and realize that Madonna is NOT just an entertainer who needs to deliver fun music like she did back in the 80's and early 90's when she was fun and carefree--She is now a mother, a wife, a kabbalist, and on top of other things, she is very philosophical and if people think that those things are not going to reflect in her work as an artist, they're wrong. <br /> <br />If you're narrowminded, or just looking for fun Madonna tunes like she had in the 80's, I suggest not buying this album but buying the Immaculate Collection instead. <br /> <br />However, if you're looking to be provoked through question and thought, this album is highly reccomended. :)
